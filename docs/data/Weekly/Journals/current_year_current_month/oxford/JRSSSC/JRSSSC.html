A multivariate spatial statistical model is developed to jointly analyse high-resolution remote sensing data and coarse-resolution climate model outputs. With a basis function representation, the resulting model can achieve efficient computation and describe potentially nonstationary spatial dependence. We implement our method to produce downscaled sea surface temperature projections over the Great Barrier Reef region from CMIP6 Earth system models. Compared with the state of the art, our method reduces the mean squared predictive error substantially and produces a predictive distribution enabling holistic uncertainty quantification analyses.},

While the LC model is effective in capturing mortality trends, it may not always be able to account for large, unexpected jumps in mortality rates caused by pandemics or wars. Existing models allow either for transient jumps with an effect of one period only or persistent jumps. However, there is no literature on estimating mortality time series with jumps having an effect over a small number of periods, as is typically observed in pandemics. The Bayesian approach allows to quantify the uncertainty around the parameter estimates. Empirical data from the COVID-19 pandemic show the superiority of the proposed approach, compared with models with a transitory shock effect.},

  abstract     = {Many studies suggest that searching for parking is associated with significant direct and indirect costs. Therefore, it is appealing to reduce the time that car drivers spend on finding an available parking spot, especially in urban areas where the space for all road users is limited. The prediction of on-street parking spot occupancy can provide drivers with guidance on where clear parking spaces are likely to be found. This field of research has gained more and more attention in the last decade through the increasing availability of real-time parking spot occupancy data. In this paper, we pursue a statistical approach for the prediction of parking spot occupancy, where we make use of time-to-event models and semi-Markov process theory. The latter involves the employment of Laplace transformations as well as their inversion, which is an ambitious numerical task. We apply our methodology to data from the City of Melbourne in Australia. Our main result is that the semi-Markov model outperforms a Markov model in terms of both true negative rate and true positive rate while this is essentially achieved by respecting the current duration that a parking space already spends in its initial state.},

  abstract     = {Combining data from various sources empowers researchers to explore innovative questions, for example those raised by conducting healthcare monitoring studies. However, the lack of a unique identifier often poses challenges. Record linkage procedures determine whether pairs of observations collected on different occasions belong to the same individual using partially identifying variables (e.g. birth year, postal code). Existing methodologies typically involve a compromise between computational efficiency and accuracy. Traditional approaches simplify this task by condensing information, yet they neglect dependencies among linkage decisions and disregard the one-to-one relationship required to establish coherent links. Modern approaches offer a comprehensive representation of the data generation process, at the expense of computational overhead and reduced flexibility. We propose a flexible method, that adapts to varying data complexities, addressing registration errors and accommodating changes of the identifying information over time. Our approach balances accuracy and scalability, estimating the linkage using a Stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm on a latent variable model. We illustrate the ability of our methodology to connect observations using large real data applications and demonstrate the robustness of our model to the linking variables quality in a simulation study. The proposed algorithm FlexRL is implemented and available in an open source R package.},

  abstract     = {The task of simplifying the complex spatio-temporal variables associated with climate modelling is of utmost importance and comes with significant challenges. In this research, our primary objective is to develop a clustering framework to handle compound extreme events within gridded climate data across Europe. Specifically, we intend to identify subregions that display asymptotic independence between precipitation and wind speed extremes, meaning that occurrences of extreme rain and wind speed in one subregion do not affect those in the other. To achieve this, we utilize daily precipitation sums and daily maximum wind speed data derived from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset spanning from 1979 to 2022. Our approach hinges on a tuning parameter and the application of a divergence measure to spotlight disparities in extremal dependence structures without relying on specific parametric assumptions. We propose a data-driven approach to determine the tuning parameter. This enables us to generate clusters that are spatially concentrated, which can provide more insightful information about the regional distribution of compound precipitation and wind speed extremes. The proposed method is able to extract valuable information about extreme compound events while also significantly reducing the size of the dataset within reasonable computational timeframes.},

This model is applied to two main meteorological data sources in the Philippines. The data fusion approach assumes that different data sources are imperfect representations of a common underlying process. Observations from weather stations follow a classical error model, while numerical weather forecasts involve both a constant multiplicative bias and an additive bias, which is spatially structured and time-varying. To perform inference, we use a Bayesian model averaging technique combined with integrated nested Laplace approximation. The model’s performance is evaluated through a simulation study, where it consistently results in better predictions and more accurate parameter estimates than models using only weather stations data or regression calibration, particularly in cases of sparse observational data. In the meteorological data application, the proposed data fusion model also outperforms these benchmark approaches, as demonstrated by leave-group-out cross-validation.},

  abstract     = {The D-vine copula-based quantile regression (DVQR) is a powerful tool for weather forecasting, as it is able to select informative predictor variables from a large set and takes account of nonlinear relationships among them. However, DVQR shows in its current form a lack in adaptively modelling strongly varying effects among variables, such as temporal and/or spatial effects. Consequently, we propose an extension of the current DVQR, where we specify the parameters of the bivariate copulas in the D-vine copula through Kendall’s τ to which additional covariates are linked. The parameterization of the correlation parameter allows generalized additive models (GAMs) to incorporate, e.g. linear, nonlinear, and spatial effects as well as interactions. The new method is called GAM-DVQR, and its performance is illustrated in a case study on postprocessing 2 m surface temperature ensemble weather forecasts. We investigate constant as well as time-dependent Kendall’s τ correlation models. The results indicate that the GAM-DVQR models are able to identify time-dependent correlations and significantly outperform state-of-the-art postprocessing methods. Furthermore, the introduced temporal parameterization allows a more economical and faster model estimation in comparison to DVQR using a sliding training window. To complement this article, we provide an R -package for our method called gamvinereg .},

  abstract     = {Statistical models are an essential tool to model, forecast, and understand the hydrological processes in watersheds. In particular, the understanding of time lags associated with the delay between rainfall occurrence and subsequent changes in streamflow is of high practical importance. Since water can take a variety of flow paths to generate streamflow, a series of distinct runoff pulses may combine to create the observed streamflow time series. Current state-of-the-art models are not able to sufficiently confront the problem complexity with interpretable parametrization, thus preventing novel insights about the dynamics of distinct flow paths from being formed. The proposed Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model targets this problem by combining the concept of multiple windows sliding along the time axis with multiple linear regression. The window kernels, which indicate the weights applied to different time lags, are implemented via Gaussian-shaped kernels. As a result, straightforward process inference can be achieved since each window can represent one flow path. Experiments on simulated and real-world scenarios underline that the proposed model achieves accurate parameter estimates and competitive predictive performance, while fostering explainable and interpretable hydrological modelling.},

In urban environments, these new data have the potential to allow for high-resolution and high-frequency forecasts, and thereby to provide an assessment of population exposure at neighbourhood level. The complex spatio-temporal structure of these data, however, requires new flexible methods that are also able to provide timely forecasts. In this work, we propose a novel method that first provides forecasts with a reservoir computing approach, an echo-state network, adjusts the forecast with a transformer network with attention mechanism and then merges the echo-state and transformer forecast into a combined network. The stochastic nature of the method allows for a fast and more accurate forecast then individual predictors as well as standard statistical methods. Simulation and application to San Francisco air pollution show how the proposed method is able to produce high-resolution urban maps of air quality. Additionally, we show how these forecasts can be used to provide neighbour-level exposure assessment using population data, a task that would not be achievable with sparse government-sponsored air quality networks.},
