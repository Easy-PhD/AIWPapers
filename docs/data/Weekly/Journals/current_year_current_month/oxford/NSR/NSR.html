  abstract     = {Channelized thin seismic low-velocity zones (LVZs) are observed beneath subducting slabs, extending from the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary to the mantle transition zone (MTZ). While LVZs above slabs are well-explained by slab dehydration and flux melting, the origin and fate of these enigmatic subslab LVZs—persisting far deeper than expected—remain elusive. Here we use geodynamic modeling to show that subduction-induced wet upwellings from a water-bearing MTZ that generates dehydration melting feed the base of the lithosphere forming seismically detected LVZs. A similar process may occur when a pre-existing partially molten layer atop the 410-km discontinuity is displaced upward in response to subduction. These thin partially molten layers are successively entrained alongside the subducting slab and recycled back to MTZ depths. This mechanism supports a globally widespread scenario where subduction-induced upwelling of a water-rich MTZ can account for the observed mantle heterogeneities. Since minute quantities of melts may dramatically reduce viscosity, this process is likely to have non-negligible implications for the Earth's dynamics and recycling of the lithosphere into the deep mantle.},

  abstract     = {In 2024, southern China faced its worst flooding during the pre-flood season (April–June), the first major rainfall season in East Asia, with considerable socioeconomic consequences. This extreme flooding is fueled by the unprecedented warming in the Indian Ocean, with a decaying moderate El Niño in the Pacific contributing weakly. Alarmingly, similar pre-flood season flooding events have become increasingly frequent in southern China over recent decades, posing unexpected risks to local communities. We demonstrate that the recent rapid Indian Ocean warming enhances local convection efficiency, leading to more frequent intense pre-flood season rainfall. As sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean continues to rise in a warming world, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its role in shaping regional extreme weather patterns for future climate adaptation and disaster management.},

  abstract     = {Anxiety disorders frequently accompany aggression, with their co-occurrence predicting greater functional impairment and poor prognosis. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive, primarily due to a lack of appropriate animal models. Here, we designed a chronic conspecific outsider stress (CCS) model in which male mice underwent perceived social threats and exhibited increased anxiety-like behaviors accompanied by aggression. CCS led to Fos activation and hyperexcitability of GABAergic neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA). Inhibition of mPOA GABAergic (mPOA Gad2 ) neurons rescued CCS-induced anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors, whereas activating these cells induced susceptibility to CCS. Moreover, CCS upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of the sexual-dimorphic gene, cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR)-encoding Cckar gene in the mPOA. Importantly, the knock-down and overexpression of CCKAR in the mPOA Gad2 neurons had alleviating and promoting effects on anxiety-like and aggressive behaviors, aligning with decreased and increased excitability by the anxiolytic CCKAR antagonist MK-329 and the anxiogenic CCKAR agonist A71623 in mPOA Gad2 neurons, respectively. Overall, our study characterizes a novel mouse model of anxiety disorders accompanied by aggression and the neuronal subpopulation and molecular mediator of the aberrant behaviors provide potential targets of intervention for anxiety disorders with aggression.},
