  abstract     = {Given the global displacement crisis, the integration of refugees has emerged as a critical policy issue for many host countries. A key challenge involves supporting refugees in learning the language of their host country. While several European nations have instituted publicly funded language training for asylum seekers and refugees soon after their arrival, evidence on the efficacy of these early language programmes in promoting economic integration remains limited. This study examines the impact of a pioneering, large-scale ad hoc programme introduced by German policymakers, which provided basic language training to over 230,000 refugees arriving in 2015–2016. Utilizing register data on the population of asylum seekers and exploiting a cut-off date in programme eligibility, we assess the programme’s effectiveness using a regression discontinuity design. Our findings reveal no discernible effect on refugee employment over the subsequent 2 years. To explore whether language programmes are generally ineffective during refugee crises, we contrast these results with the impacts of a more comprehensive, preexisting, yet smaller-scale programme. Using a variety of difference-in-differences estimators, we find that this programme considerably increased refugee employment. These contrasting findings offer important insights for policymakers on designing effective language training programmes for refugees.},

  abstract     = {School enrollment forecasts are vital for effective planning. This study introduces a probabilistic multiregional population projection model, which accounts for different components, including preschool entries, migration, grade progression, and graduations. Using different distributions with a cohort component projection and Monte Carlo simulation, this paper forecasts student enrollments for each school and academic year level in the Australian Capital Territory based on the annual record-level administrative data. In the in-sample validation tests, the model’s overall performance is robust, and the probabilistic design offers reliable prediction intervals reflecting the variation in observed values. The paper ends with a discussion on the importance of prediction intervals for informing school planning.},
