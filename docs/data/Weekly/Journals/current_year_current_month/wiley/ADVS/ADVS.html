  abstract     = {Behçet's uveitis (BU), characterized by recurrent bilateral panuveitis, is a severe manifestation of Behcet's disease (BD). However, disease-specific metabolic alterations in BU remain largely unknown. Here, untargeted metabolomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are performed in patients with BU and healthy controls (HC). scRNA-seq data of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice are also incorporated. The data showed an altered metabolic profile, characterized by upregulated glycolysis in BU. MYC is predicted to be a hub molecule regulating glycolysis and T cell response. Notably, it is discovered that the expression level of MYC is higher in BU compare to HC and may reflect the treatment response of BU disease. Correspondingly, the scRNA-seq data of EAU mice also reveal higher glycolysis levels and MYC expression. Further studies reveal that inhibition of MYC repressed glycolysis and exerted therapeutic effects similar to those of glycolysis inhibitors, including amelioration of EAU and repression of the abnormal response of effector T cells (T helper [Th]-1 and Th17 cells). Mechanically, inhibiting MYC disrupts the glycolysis-PI3K signaling circuit to curb the effector T cell response in uveitis. Collectively, the study indicated that MYC promoted glycolysis to fuel abnormal T-cell responses, thus therapeutically targeting MYC would provide an attractive approach for treating BU.},

  abstract     = {Capturing different pluripotent state stem cells from epiblast in vitro helps understand embryonic development and provides invaluable cell sources for basic research and regenerative medicine. Sheep are not only one of the most important livestock species in agriculture but also serve as an ideal preclinical model for studying human disease. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of sheep preimplantation embryos from embryonic day (E) 1 to E14 is performed to investigate the pluripotency changes of epiblast and elucidate the pluripotent regulation signaling. By combination of growth factors or inhibitors of JAK/STAT3, FGF, WNT, and TGF-β pathways in the culture medium, sheep formative and primed pluripotent stem cells (sfPSCs and spPSCs) are established respectively. The newly derived PSCs could maintain over 100 passages and differentiate into three germ layers. In addition, sfPSCs and spPSCs exhibit different molecular features, and sfPSCs have the ability of contribution to ICM and can be used as donor cells for producing cloned embryos efficiently. A cross-species comparison of early embryo development in mouse, pig and sheep illustrates the conservation of the epiblast naïve to primed state transition process and the divergence of the developmental events time points, the specific gene expression patterns and pluripotent regulation signaling. These studies are expected to improve our understanding of mammal early embryo development and present a reference for defining pluripotency.},

Copper- and iron-based nanozymes enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and regulate metal ion homeostasis, driving ferroptosis and cuproptosis. However, simultaneous delivery of copper and iron ions and the role of mitochondria-targeted copper in inducing cuproptosis remain underexplored. Here, a dual-functional nano-heterojunction platform, MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA, is reproted, integrating iron- and copper-based components for synergistic ferroptosis and cuproptosis induction. Mitochondria-targeted Cu 1.8 S nanodots demonstrated high biocompatibility and efficiently induced cuproptosis by disrupting mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins. Combined with MIL-88B, the iron-based metal-organic framework, the MIL-Cu 1.8 S heterojunction exhibited enhanced ROS catalytic activity, confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, with improved H 2 O 2 adsorption and lower energy barriers for peroxidase (POD)-like reactions. The dual-targeting MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA nanoplatform effectively delivered copper ions to mitochondria and iron ions to tumor cells, modulating key ferroptosis- and cuproptosis-related markers, such as GPX4, GSH, FDX-1, and HSP70. The platform synergistically combined photothermal effects with multi-pathway cell death mechanisms, achieving significant anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. This study underscores the therapeutic potential of synchronously delivering copper and iron ions and highlights mitochondria-targeted strategies in advancing multi-modal cancer therapies.},

The incorporation of various photothermal materials into polymers has been developed for endowing composites with the capability of light harvesting and photothermal conversion, and management. However, their opaque appearance, vulnerability, and challenging processability limit their practical applications. Herein, it is successfully synthesized a series of versatile transparent films (PUMW) that combine photothermal self-healing function and mechanical strength through integrating polyurethane (PU) self-healing polymers with plasmonic enhanced MXene and W 18 O 49 hybrids (MXene@W 18 O 49 ). The resulting comprehensive film (PUMW4) maintained a visible-light transmittance of over 79% in 0.2 mm thickness, and could rapidly reach 102 °C within 5 min under light irradiation of 0.45 W cm −2 . Furthermore, it demonstrated a favorable ability for photothermal self-healing, with surface scratches disappearing in 2 min. Besides, the tensile strength of PUMW4 significantly increased from 22.7 to 30.7 MPa, in comparison with PUMW0 (pure PU). The proof of concept for an indoor thermal insulation test demonstrates that the organic glass house model covered with the film exhibited a temperature reduction of 10 °C compared to the naked model, highlighting the potential of as-prepared PUMW films in energy-saving applications for large-scale out-door buildings.},

Fecal microbiota transplantation and fecal conditioned medium are used to assess the specific involvement of gut bacterial metabolites in the effects of GPNs. Comprehensive multi-omics analyses showed that GPN significantly enriched the abundance of Alistipes senegalensis , an indole-producing commensal bacterium. Increased expression of tight junction-associated proteins, as well as activation of gut stem cells, are found to be mediated by the AhR pathway, indicating the causal mechanism by which GPN reduced increases in gut permeability. The results are verified in Caco-2/THP-1 cells, Caenorhabditis elegans , and enteroids. To the knowledge, this is the first identification of an integral functional axis through which GPN and functional metabolites of A. senegalensis influence the gut barrier and reduce systemic inflammation, providing clues for the potential development of innovative plant polysaccharide treatment strategies to promote healthy aging.},

  abstract     = {Impairment of neuronal plasticity is involved in a spectrum of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, it is reported that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DEC2 serves as a pivotal regulator of both neuronal plasticity and epileptogenesis through its repression of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A). Knockdown of DEC2 in hippocampal neurons elevates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, exacerbating seizure susceptibility and severity. Conversely, overexpression of DEC2 in hippocampus reduces intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, ultimately decreasing seizure susceptibility. Mechanistically, DEC2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of Scn2a by directly binding class B E-boxes (CACGTG) in its promoter. Additionally, DEC2 forms complexes with myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1) and occupies the CAGCTG E-boxes within the Scn2a promoter; however, this interaction does not affect Scn2a transcription in vivo. These findings also reveal that cannabidiol (CBD) can modulate the DEC2-SCN2A axis. Notably, CBD predominantly enhances DEC2's direct transcriptional repression of SCN2A. In summary, this study identifies DEC2 as a critical regulator of neuronal plasticity in epilepsy progression, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for epilepsy treatment.},

Leveraging these characteristics, iPSCs hold great promise for developing wide-spectrum vaccines against cancers. In practice, iPSCs are typically combined with immune adjuvants to enhance antitumor immune responses; however, traditional adjuvants lack controllability and can induce systemic toxicity, which has limited their broad application. Here, a r ed/far-red light-controlled i PSC-based va ccine (RIVA) based on the chimeric photosensory protein FnBphP and its interaction partner LDB3 is developed; RIVA preserves the intrinsic tumor antigens of iPSCs and enables optogenetic control of an immune adjuvant's (IFN-β) expression under red light illumination. Experiments in multiple mouse tumor models demonstrate that RIVA inhibits tumor growth and improves animal survival in prophylactic and therapeutic settings, including against pulmonary metastatic 4T1 breast cancer. RIVA efficiently stimulates dendritic cell maturation, eliciting innate immune activation effects through NK cells and elicit adaptive immune anti-tumor responses through CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Moreover, RIVA protects animals against tumor re-challenge by inducing strong immunological memory, with minimal systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates RIVA as an effective optogenetic approach for developing safe multi-antigen vaccines for the prevention and treatment of cancer.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive subtype, currently lacks potent targeted therapies. ARID1B, a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, is linked to high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. However, its function and regulation remain unclear. Here, it is found that uncontrolled accumulation of ARID1B and its dysregulated nuclear import promoted oncogenesis and drug resistance. ARID1B negatively regulates ARID1A, impairing SWI/SNF-mediated tumor suppression and enhancing tumor survival. Using protein complex purification and mass spectrometry, the KPNA2–KPNB1–RANBP2 protein cascade is identified as critical for facilitating ARID1B nuclear import. Replacing R1518, H1519, and D1522 residues on ARID1B with T1518, G1519, and G1522 attenuates the ARID1B–KPNA2/KPNB1 interaction, preventing recruitment of ARID1B to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Pharmacologically inhibiting KPNB1 suppressed ARID1B translocation, limiting its nuclear levels. In TNBC mouse models, ARID1B knockout (KO) significantly reduces tumor growth and enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy. Collectively, these findings uncover an undocumented mechanism for ARID1B nuclear translocation and reveal that blockade of ARID1B nuclear translocation can be a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC.},

In this study, 5 batches of animal experiments are conducted to reveal the pathological process of chronic psychological stress on the heart, and found that cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is an early manifestation of cardiac damage. Furthermore, it is discovered that corticosterone and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play an important role in mediating this phenomenon. Additionally, a new direct target gene of GR, Lama5 , is identified and confirmed in vivo and in vitro that the corticosterone-GR-LAMA5 axis is a significant pathway mediating chronic psychological stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, the potential of LAMA5 is validated as a biomarker for myocardial hypertrophy and impaired cardiac function in patients with depression. In summary, a novel hypertrophy-related gene, Lama5 has been identified, that may play an important role in chronic psychological stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.},

Using high-throughput screening, the approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is identified that exhibit high selectivity in killing HMA-resistant AML cells compared to parental cells. Mechanistically, HMA-resistant cells are overloaded with DNA hypomethylation-associated endogenous viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which, however, fails to trigger an anticancer interferon (IFN) immune response due to downregulation of dsRNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). ATRA compensates for RIG-I expression, thereby re-triggering IFN response and potently inhibiting HMA-resistant AML cell lines, xenograft mice, and patient-derived primary cells. A library of potential RIG-I-inducing compounds is rationally constructed and screened, in which the approved M3 AML treatment drug tamibarotene (TAM) exhibits strikingly 28036-fold selectivity and 779 p m IC 50 in killing HMA-resistant AML cells. ATRA and TAM do not selectively inhibit p53-mutant cancer cells. Together, this study uncovers a common resistance mechanism in HMA-treated AML patients and, in addition, provides highly potent and selective agents that can overcome resistance through re-triggering IFN anticancer immune response.},

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) contribute to cancer ferroptosis, but underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, it is discovered that USP10 as a member of DUBs, is tightly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Functionally, USP10 inhibits ferroptosis via transcriptionally upregulating the expression of SLC7A11 in HNSCC. Targeting USP10 via gene depletion and antagonist sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis inducers both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, USP10 directly interacts with the largest RNA Polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A), removes the K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains of POLR2A through its deubiquitinase activity and prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Then, POLR2A transcriptionally activates SLC7A11 , eventually leading to the suppression of ferroptosis. Overall, the study indicates that a novel USP10-POLR2A-SLC7A11 axis regulates ferroptosis, positioning USP10 as a potential therapeutic target in patients with HNSCC.},

TDP-43 regulates RNA processing, including cryptic exon splicing. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 directly controls growth-associated protein (GAP43) expression by binding to its pre-mRNA. Loss or hyperphosphorylation of TDP-43 disrupts this binding, leading to the inclusion of cryptic exon 4a1 , which introduces premature stop codons and reduces GAP43 protein levels. RNA sequencing analysis of ALS and AD brains revealed GAP43 downregulation, while 4a1 is upregulated in AD cases with phosphorylated TDP-43. TDP-43 knockdown impaired axonal regeneration in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, whereas GAP43 restoration rescued this defect. These findings suggest that the loss of GAP43 contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS and AD. The inclusion of GAP43 cryptic exon 4a1 may serve as a hallmark of TDP-43 proteinopathies, highlighting a mechanistic link between TDP-43 dysfunction and neuronal vulnerability.},

NETs play a key role in the pathological process of sepsis. However, the specific regulatory mechanism has not been fully clarified. This study finds that the levels of NETs in peripheral blood are significantly elevated in clinical sepsis patients and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models, and the expression of Acod1 is closely related to the generation of NETs. Acod1 knockout led to a further increase in NETs levels in CLP mice, aggravated the inflammatory response, worsened organ damage, and reduced the survival rate. Further studies indicate that E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 interacts with PAD4 (one of the core proteins for NETs generation). Acod1/itaconate (ITA) enhanced the enzymatic activity of UBR5 through alkylation modification, promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PAD4, thereby inhibiting NETosis. In conclusion, this study combines transcriptomics, metabolomics, genetic engineering, and co-immunoprecipitation techniques to reveal the molecular mechanism of Acod1/ITA in regulating NETs, providing new potential targets and theoretical basis for the treatment of sepsis.},

Nevertheless, their practical deployment is significantly constrained by several challenges, including the intrinsic low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), sluggish redox kinetics, and instability of the Li anode. To overcome these limitations, the integration of catalytic materials has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate sulfur redox reactions, promote LiPS conversion, and enhance cycling stability. Recently, high-entropy catalysts (HEC), comprising five or more metallic elements in near-equimolar ratios, have garnered increasing attention owing to their entropy-stabilized structures, abundant active sites, and tunable electronic properties. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the design principles, synthesis methods, and electrochemical applications of various HEC families, including high-entropy alloys, oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, MXenes, and Prussian blue analogues, in Li–S battery systems. The synergistic effects arising from multicomponent interactions, structural advantages, and underlying catalytic mechanisms are systematically discussed. Finally, key challenges such as scalable synthesis, in-depth mechanistic elucidation, and rational compositional design are addressed, along with future directions aimed at advancing high-performance HEC-based Li–S battery systems.},

These ordered configurations facilitate efficient pathways for charge and mass transport. Particularly, in comparison with first-order structure, hierarchical structure designs exhibit more obvious advantages in reaction interface, charge, and mass transport.

Their intrinsic advantages—such as superior interfacial contact with electrodes, tunable ionic conductivity, and compatibility with scalable manufacturing methods—as well as the key technical challenges they face, including limited thermal stability, narrow electrochemical windows, and interfacial degradation, are examined. This study highlights emerging solutions from recent research, including polymer molecular design, polymer–ceramic composites, and in situ polymerization strategies. In contrast to oxide and sulfide systems, which face significant barriers in cost, manufacturability, and integration, polymer-based electrolytes offer a realistic and economically viable path to large-scale deployment.

  abstract     = {Redox, a native modality in biology involving the flow of electrons, energy, and information, is used for energy-harvesting, biosynthesis, immune-defense, and signaling. Because electrons (in contrast to protons) are not soluble in the medium, electron-flow through the redox modality occurs through redox reactions that are sometimes organized into pathways and networks (e.g., redox interactomes). Redox is also accessible to electrochemistry, which enables electrodes to receive and transmit electrons to exchange energy and information with biology. In this Perspective, efforts to develop electrochemistry as a tool for redox-based bio-information processing: to interconvert redox-based molecular attributes into interpretable electronic signals, are described. Using a series of Case Studies, how the information-content of the measurements can be enriched using: diffusible mediators; tuned electrical input sequences; and cross-modal measurements (e.g., electrical plus spectral), is shown. Also, theory-guided feature engineering approaches to compress the information in the electronic signals into quantitative metrics (i.e., features) that can serve as correlating variables for pattern recognition by data-driven analysis are described. Finally, how redox provides a modality for electrogenetic actuation is illustrated. It is suggested that electrochemistry's capabilities to provide real-time, low-cost, and high-content data in an electronic format allow the feedback-control needed for autonomous learning and deployable sensing/actuation.},

  abstract     = {Organophosphinic acids, R 2 P(O)(OH), and their derivatives are versatile compounds with applications in catalysis, material chemistry, biomolecular bridging, metal extraction, and flame retardancy. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on white phosphorus (P 4 ) as a precursor, which is converted into nucleophilic or electrophilic P-synthons through acid-/base-induced disproportionation (e.g., PH 3 , [H 2 PO 2 ] – ) or chlorination (PCl 3 ). However, P 4 poses significant drawbacks due to its highly pyrophoric nature, environmental hazards, and the energy-intensive production process from phosphate ores. Previously, we introduced a method to bypass P 4 in the synthesis of P V compounds through the redox-neutral activation of phosphates using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf 2 O) and pyridine, yielding the electrophilic PO 2 + phosphorylation reagent [(pyridine) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1a [OTf]). While this reagent exhibits high selectivity for alcohols, amides, and (pseudo)halides, it failed to react efficiently with organometallic compounds to form organophosphinates. Here, we present mechanistic studies that rationalize this limitation and report an optimized strategy, which successfully facilitates reactions with Grignard reagents. By replacing the pyridine leaving group in 1a [OTf] with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), the reagent [(DMAP) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1b [OTf]) is obtained, which enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of diaryl- and dialkynylphosphinates, thereby expanding the scope of redox-neutral phosphate activation.},

Activation of the cGAS-STING pathway holds significant potential to enhance antitumor immunity. However, their efficacy remains constrained by various drug delivery and pharmacological obstacles, including poor stability, limited cellular uptake, inefficient intracellular delivery, suboptimal tumor targeting, and immunotoxicity. There is a growing focus on the design and application of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems (nano-DDSs) to improve the delivery of cGAS-STING agonists for safe, effective, and specific targeting. This review outlines the latest advancements in cGAS-STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics. First, the research background of the cGAS-STING pathway and nanotechnology is briefly outlined to emphasize the promise of STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics in cancer immunotherapy. Second, the progress in the development of cGAS-STING agonists and recent advancements in cGAS-STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics are overviewed. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms and applications of STING agonist-based combination therapies are discussed, including synergistic strategies with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor, cancer vaccine, adoptive cell therapy (ACT)), phototherapy, sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and targeted therapy. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of STING agonist-based nanotherapeutics in clinical cancer therapy are proposed.},

In this study, a range of Trp metabolites are evaluated for their potential to modulate tumor immunogenicity using a co-culture assay with tumor cells and T cells. Indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) is identified as an indole derivative that significantly enhances tumor immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo. This enhancement is attributed to the upregulation of antigen presentation and immunogenic molecules on tumor cells by I3A, thereby promoting their immunogenicity. Mechanistically, I3A induces the activation and degradation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to increased expression of MHC-I molecules on tumor cell surfaces. Meantime, I3A induces rapid degradation of c-MYC in tumor cells and further enhances T cell activation. In mouse melanoma and lymphoma models, I3A demonstrates immune-dependent antitumor effects and enhances the efficacy of adoptive OT-I T cell therapy. Moreover, overexpression of the Trp metabolic enzyme interleukin-4-induced gene-1 (IL4I1) in tumor cells increases the intracellular level of I3A and enhances tumor immunogenicity. In summary, I3A is identified as a tumor immunogenicity inducer, which holds the potential to enhance antitumor immunotherapy efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The confinement of breast cancer cells at the interface of the mammary gland lumen and its surrounding extracellular matrix is thought to be a key physical driver of cellular plasticity. The relationship between confinement-induced solid stress and drug resistance is not well understood due to a scarcity of models that faithfully isolate the contribution of confinement on cancer cell behavior. Herein, drop-on-demand printing is used to uniquely replicate the spatial compartmentalization of the native cancer-host interface: MCF-7 breast cancer cells are dispensed within bioinert cup-shaped alginate-based hydrogels in high-throughput to yield “confined” spheroids. Hydrogel confinement affects the emergence of CD44+-CD133+ cells at the spheroid interface that drives a two-fold increase in doxorubicin/tamoxifen resistance compared to control “unconfined” spheroids. Whilst the peripheral drug-resistant phenotype is observed clinically, the model is unique in facilitating the emergence of this population in an in vitro setting. Pharmacological modulation of mechanotransduction proteins (YAP, myosin), abrogated the emergence of this peripheral phenotype, implicating mechanotransduction pathways as an effective way to target solid stress-induced drug resistance. Together, this supports an “interfacial stress—stemness—drug resistance” relationship that sheds new light on the existing paradigm of spatial emergence of drug resistance in breast cancer.},

Second, functional applications of Xenes in electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicine are also reviewed.

Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution profiling of the TME, particularly tumor-infiltrating immune cells, across diverse cancer types. However, our understanding of how immune cells shape ICI responses and how they are dynamically altered during treatment remains incomplete. In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing TME features associated with ICI responsiveness, highlighting key immune cell subsets involved in ICI therapy and emphasizing their phenotypic plasticity and functional adaptability following ICIs. Additionally, we outline the spatial architecture of the TME in terms of its effects on immune cell behavior and interactions, and discuss the critical role of stromal components and the microbiota in modulating the immune landscape and influencing ICI responsiveness. By integrating these insights, we aim to deepen our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ICI responses, elucidate determinants of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance, and inform the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.},

The introduction of oxidizing O 2 gas to the microscope led to structural changes on the NP surface and decrease the intrinsic negative charge of the NP. Conversely, under reducing H 2 gas, the surface structure and charge state of the NP remained almost unchanged compared to those in vacuum. Systematic analysis revealed that the injection and removal of O 2 gas caused reversible changes in the charge state of the NP within the range of a few electrons. The effect of O 2 gas on charging of the NP is confirmed by first-principles calculations. These findings demonstrate the potential of electron holography in gas environments for advancing the understanding the reaction mechanisms on heterogeneous catalysts.},

Here, through serological testing of mice with fatty liver, it is found that the rhythms of prolactin secretion are disturbed and that the circulating prolactin level is reduced. Based on these findings, prolactin's biological effects on fatty liver are investigated, and biomimetic photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with periodically prolactin releasing are proposed to inhibit lipid accumulation in liver. The microneedles are comprised of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) shells and prolactin-loaded cores of photothermal black phosphorus, phase-change gelatin, and carrageenan. Under periodically stimulation of near infrared (NIR), the prolactin in the microneedles can be released in a rhythmic manner for inhibiting the lipid accumulation in liver cells. Based on these features, it is demonstrated in mice with fatty liver that the bioinspired-responsive microneedles can facilitate prolactin mitigating hepatic steatosis through its interaction with the hepatic prolactin receptor (PRLR) and by modulating the expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). Thus, these photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with prolactin pulse release hold significant promise for the treatment of fatty liver disease.},

The surface of the gripper is composed of vertically aligned composite nanowires with an average diameter of 79 nm. When a liquid is injected into the nanoporous membrane, capillary adhesion occurs, allowing the object to be picked up. As the liquid evaporates, the object can be released by extremely sparse contact. The off-state adhesion of a millimeter-scale gripper is even lower than the gravitational force of thin polymer films (0.18 mN cm −2 ), enabling the solid-contactless release of lightweight materials. We characterize and model the mechanism across length scales and provide pick-and-place demonstrations including LED chips, micro-architected materials, and thin-film electronics.},

This study pioneers a novel approach to fabricating Mg-Ta incompatible LMCs via crystal orientation regulation, achieving in situ formed serrated mechanically interlocked interfaces with exceptional bonding strength (80.5 MPa) through hot-rolling. It also exhibits exceptional tensile properties with an ultimate tensile strength of 340–395 MPa, a yield strength of 301–363 MPa, and an elongation of 5–10.2%. Systematic multiscale investigations combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a hierarchical interfacial architecture comprising dual heterointerfaces zone (hexagonal close-packed /face center cubic Mg/Cu and face centered cubic /body-centered cubic Cu/Ta), with strain-modulated micro-serrations (width: 1.6–5.5 µm; depth: 6–15 µm) morphology, along with atomic interdiffusion zones (1.1–3.1 µm). A quantifiable inverse correlation is identified between serration dimensions and interfacial strength, with reduced width and depth directly enhancing bond integrity. Furthermore, the heterointerface evolution mechanism is decoupled into three thermomechanical stages: 1) crystallographic orientation optimization via dissimilar atomic contact, 2) strain-driven micro-sawtooth generation through dislocation slip competition, and 3) geometric interlocking completion via interface self-assembly. This work establishes a universal paradigm for designing multifunctional structural materials through strain-engineered heterointerface manipulation, rather than just applying several specific deformations processes.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical behavior and microstructural evolution of a BCC-phase NbTaTiV refractory multi-principal element alloy (RMPEA) is studied over a wide range of strain rates (10 −3 to 10 3 s −1 ) and temperatures (room temperature to 850 °C). The mechanical property of present RMPEA shows less strain-rate dependence and strong resistance to softening at high temperatures. Under high strain-rate loading, the formation of thin type-I twins is observed, which could lead to an increase in strain-hardening rates. However, this hardening mechanism competes with adiabatic heating effects, resulting in the deterrence of strain-hardening behaviors. In contrast, substantial strain-hardening occurs at cryogenic temperatures due to the formation of twins, which act as stronger barriers to dislocation motion and interact with each other. To further understand the different strain-hardening behaviors, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict relatively low stacking fault energies and high twinning stress for the NbTaTiV RMPEA.},

  abstract     = {Co-precipitation is an attractive means for synthesizing mixed metal oxides, a material class with a wide range of application prospects. Often soluble metal salts are precipitated as metal hydroxides or -carbonates, which subsequently are converted to the corresponding oxide(s) upon thermal treatment. The thermal treatment step is used to induce compositional homogeneity on the atomic level. In order to shed some more light on this effect, detailed analyses of a mixed Li-Ni-Mn-oxide with the target composition LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO), which is a promising cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries are performed. The first synthesis step is the precipitation of a Ni-Mn-carbonate, which is subsequently thermally lithiated and transformed into an oxide. A combination of X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) in combination with elemental analysis, as well as electrochemical characterization, revealed that chemical inhomogeneities present already in the precursor particles have a direct influence on the electrochemical performance of the final product. The broader implications of these results in relation to co-precipitation-based syntheses of functional materials are discussed, with special focus on the importance of the particle size distribution of the secondary particles.},

However, the absence of alkali metal cations in the SSE-based CO 2 RR process at the cathode poses a challenge, constraining the performance and stability of CO 2 RR and exacerbating the hydrogen evolution side reaction. Herein, a novel strategy for the tunable production of both electrolyte-free HCOOH and sodium formate (HCOONa) solution through the regulation of anolyte composition in an SSE-based cell is reported. Employing this strategy, the continuous generation of a ≈0.27 m electrolyte-free HCOONa solution and ≈0.22 m electrolyte-free HCOOH solution with extended stabilities of 300 and 200 h, respectively is achieved. More importantly, the introduction of sodium ions resulted in a reduction of cell voltage by ≈1000 mV and further enhances the stability of the cell. In situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that GB-Bi requires a lower applied potential for formate production, owing to its stronger binding energy to the key intermediate OCHO* compared to Bi. Finally, a techno-economic analysis indicates that this strategy for HCOONa solution production possesses excellent economic viability.},

  abstract     = {The magneto-mechano-electric (MME) coupling principle plays an important role in synchronously harvesting magnetic energy and monitoring safe operation in the distribution grid and the Power Internet of Things (PIoT). In this study, an MME resonator is presented, containing two crossed U-fingers made of piezoelectric phase-elastic beams with different lengths and magnet masses, operating in symmetric, decoupling dual bending modes. One U-finger resonating at 50 Hz serves as energy harvester (EH), while the other resonating at 185 Hz acts as current or magnetic sensor, enabling the resonator to simultaneously and wirelessly capture 50 Hz stray magnetic field ( H AC ,50 Hz ) energy and ground fault message of power lines by injecting an additional non-grid-frequency (185 Hz) current. The EH U-finger generates an output power of 1.53 mW RMS under a weak H AC ,50 Hz of only 0.5 Oe, achieving a normalized power density surpassing current standards. While the sensing U-finger shows a high sensitivity to H AC ,185 Hz with a detectability of 710 pT, even the EH U-finger is operating. The application test demonstrates the system's wireless monitoring and synchronous self-powered functions, providing stable energy for self-sensing data processing and transmission.

  abstract     = {Charge transfer properties between 3D and 2D perovskite layers play a key role in determining the performance of 3D/2D heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the exact photophysical behaviors at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure remain ambiguous, which makes it challenging to form the desired 3D/2D heterostructure. Herein, via combining the state-of-the-art ultrafast spectroscopies of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, transient absorption microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, charge transfer and recombination dynamics are unveiled at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, for comparison, where the 2D layers are fabricated through the two distinct approaches of organic ligand surface reaction (2D L ) and 2D crystal seed direct deposition (2D S ), respectively. 3D/2D S heterostructure exhibits superior hole transfer from 3D to 2D S , featuring a large spatial diffusion constant and high charge mobility compared to 3D/2D L , attributed to the higher phase purity and the lower defects in 2D S . Moreover, 3D/2D S heterostructure yields suppressed nonradiative recombination, reduced Langevin recombination, and increased quasi-Fermi level splitting, significantly aiding fast photoinduced charge transfer at such heterostructure. These advantages are further confirmed by a remarkably improved PSC efficiency using 3D/2D S , especially in terms of enhanced open-circuit voltage and diminished energy loss. This work sheds light on the dynamics at 3D/2D heterostructures, providing a promising guideline for designing 3D/2D high-performance PSCs.},

Herein, by incorporating both the µ -oxo bridged Fe III -porphyrins and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) mimics into an allosteric coordination capsule, the regulation of O 2 activation and the upregulation of intracellular methionine depletion have been achieved, resulting in effective pH-activated tumor immunotherapy. Upon light irradiation, the transition from the tensed bridged Fe III -porphyrins to the relaxed unbridged Fe IV = O/Fe II porphyrin pair induces unique conformational switching. The relaxed state of the capsule facilitates the binding of substrates for the oxygen atom transfer reaction. The in situ formed Fe II -porphyrin pair, following the substrate oxygenation, activates O 2 with the intervention of NADH mimics to restore the tensed state of the capsule, thereby releasing the product for the next cycle. Regulated by the acid/base content in the system, this allostery-triggered metabolic behavior enhances the efficacy of intracellular methionine depletion therapy through the accumulation of local methionine sulfoxide, thereby improving safety. The allosteric switching strategy offers an improved approach for precise tumor treatment via dual light-and-guest stimuli-responsive regulation.},

However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J-M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J-FeCo and J-CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant-potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N-M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J-FeCo and J-CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority-/minority-spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N-FeCo and N-CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.},

Addressing the critical need for simplified system integration, a single-metal bifunctional catalyst is developed by modulating electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) to construct semi-crystalline Ru domains with metastable crystalline-amorphous interfaces. The optimized catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 21.5 mV (hydrogen evolution) and 254 mV (hydrazine oxidation) at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , alongside spontaneous hydrazine decomposition at open-circuit potential. This synergy enables near-zero energy input for electrolysis, evidenced by a steep polarization slope (1.235 A cm⁻ 2 V⁻¹), which surpasses conventional hybrid systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amorphous Ru sites near the interface induce charge redistribution, which partially optimizes the free energy changes associated with adsorption * H and the dehydrogenation process from * N₂H₄ to * N₂H₃. This is accompanied by a transformation of the rate-determining step into the * N₂H → * N₂ pathway, thereby advancing the kinetics of the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrazine oxidation reaction (HER/HzOR) reactions.

The findings elucidate key regulatory pathways underlying both inflorescence development and sex differentiation. Through the characterization of dynamic transcriptional changes across four consecutive developmental phases, distinct cell types within the shoot apex and stage-specific marker genes are identified. Notably, pseudotime trajectory analysis reveals that spinach sex differentiation occurs at the four-leaf stage. Furthermore, the critical involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this process is demonstrated. By integrating functional genetic validation, the epigenetic regulator MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 1 (MSI1) together with histone deacetylase HDT2 is discovered to promote female differentiation. Collectively, this work provides comprehensive insights into the regulatory networks controlling inflorescence development and sexual differentiation in spinach and establishes a valuable resource for advancing sex differentiation research in dioecious plants.},

  abstract     = {Zr 2 Fe alloy is a promising candidate as a tritium-getter material for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), but its practical application is hindered by undesirable inverse disproportionation behavior and poor anti-disproportionation properties. In this study, theoretical computational screening is utilized to predict the effects of partially substituting Fe with Co, Cu, and Ni on regulating the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x (M = Co, Cu, Ni; x = 0.1–0.5) hydrogen storage systems. Experimentally, these modifications successfully correct the distorted inverse disproportionation reaction and achieve full reversibility in the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems. Notably, Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 and Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 alloys retain excellent hydrogen storage properties, while their kinetic energy barriers of hydriding disproportionation reaction increase significantly from 87.88 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe) to 184.35 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 ) and 192.32 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 ), respectively. The corresponding deceleration of hydriding disproportionation kinetics behaviors is clearly visualized by TEM observations. Combined density functional theory analyses reveal that the mechanism underlying enhanced anti-disproportionation properties in the optimized Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems involves the homogenization and stabilization of Zr─H bonds within the hydrogen storage interstices, along with the effective suppression of disproportionation-favorable chemical environments.},

  abstract     = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains a significant clinical challenge due to delayed diagnosis and multidrug resistance, necessitating innovative strategies to enhance early detection and therapeutic efficacy. This review evaluates the role of lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), including liposomes, micelles, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers, as advanced drug delivery systems in providing innovative solutions for RCC diagnosis and treatment. These LNPs exhibit unique advantages of great biocompatibility, biodegradability, extended circulation, and tumor-targeting capabilities, which enable precise drug delivery, controlled release, and circumvention of drug resistance mechanisms. After integrating recent advancements, it is highlighted that formulations such as Liposome@Sunitinib can enhance tumor accumulation, two-drug-loaded liposomes can activate immune responses, and RNA therapy in combination with immunomodulators can reverse drug resistance. Current findings underscore the transformative potential of lipid-based nanotechnology in addressing RCC-specific challenges, particularly in overcoming biological barriers and refining personalized treatment approaches. In the future, multifunctional nano platforms, precision therapies based on patient genes, advanced materials engineering, combination therapies, and sustainable manufacturing can be developed to promote the application of LNPs in the treatment of RCC and realize personalized nanomedicine.},

  abstract     = {Heterostructure single crystals have emerged as a significant functional material system due to their unique properties and potential for novel optoelectronic device applications. Particularly, their distinctive structural characteristics offer promising prospects for suppressing ion migration, which is highly advantageous for X-ray detection. Herein, by gradually modifying the cyclohexylmethylamine cation into the 4-aminomethyltetrahydropyran cation, a layered heterostructure single crystal (PbCl 2 ) 2 (4-Aminomethyltetrahydropyran) 2 PbCl 4 is successfully obtained. It comprises two distinct inorganic frameworks, namely a perovskite layer built from PbCl₆ octahedra and an intergrowth layer consisting of PbCl₂ units, wherein the organic components are firmly anchored to the intergrowth layer via Pb─O bonds, thereby enhancing the crystal stability and effectively suppressing ion migration, as evidenced by high ion migration activation energy (1.64 eV) and extremely low dark current drift (2.86 × 10 −18 A cm −1 V −1 s −1 ). X-ray devices based on the ultra-stable heterostructure single crystal demonstrate an extraordinary sensitivity of 8453.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 (at 40 V), ultra-low detection limit of 5.2 nGy s −1 and superior air stability (≈1 year). Such values make it one of the most outstanding candidates for high-performance X-ray detection. This work promotes the development of heterostructure single crystals optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Halide perovskites (HaP), with their exceptional optoelectronic properties and high-power conversion efficiencies in photovoltaic devices, hold promise for photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications in green fuel and chemical production. However, their stability in aqueous environments remains a challenge. This study investigates the stability and degradation mechanisms of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper phase phenylethyl ammonium lead iodide (PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 ) thin films in aqueous electrolytes under dark and illuminated conditions. While PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 thin films appear to be thermodynamically stable in an aqueous electrolyte with phenylethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI), illumination causes significant photodegradation generating a deprotonated and dehalogenated 2D intercalation product: phenylethylamine-lead iodide, 2PEA (0) -PbI 2 . The degradation of the 2D semiconductor leads to substantial reduction in the photovoltage, adversely impacting the material performance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. To intercept photo-excited charge carriers in the 2D semiconductor, the I 3 − /I − redox is added, which reduced photodegradation. The findings underscore that while catalytic reactions at halide perovskite electrodes in aqueous electrolytes are feasible, reversible and irreversible photodegradation remains a critical limitation that must be addressed in the design of PEC devices employing metal halide semiconductor layers for direct electrochemical energy conversion.},

However, the enhanced light-matter interactions and reduced group velocity tend to arouse high sensitivity to the environment, challenging fabrication and operation in practical applications. In this work, the first experimental demonstration of topological QI-like effect is reported in a 1D on-chip system, where two different topological mechanisms are induced to provide robustness for slow light. Topological charges rooted in the parameter space can offer immunity to parameter deviations, such as coupling strengths, and topological edge states rooted in the momentum space can manifest robustness against structural disturbances, like width disorders and bending deformations. By incorporating bright and dark edge states into a composite waveguide, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window is observed and switching between slow light and fast light is demonstrated by measuring the transmission and group delays. The findings provide an extensible platform for exploring novel QI and topological physics, and pave the avenue for developing robust on-chip devices.},

  abstract     = {Post-transplanted dysfunction remains the key unsolved challenge to construct bioengineered complex organs. Herein, by analyzing the bioengineered trachea, it is found that multiple tissue senescences occur, and poor endogenous cellular contact and exogenous immune microenvironment dysregulation are identified as two crucial factors during senescence. Therefore, a Hebe engineered trachea (Hebe-ET) with a ring–ring structure and dual anti-senescence designs is proposed for maintaining regenerative homeostasis after transplantation. First, in the cartilage rings, a fiber-film structural scaffold is designed to promote close-packed cellular contact, significantly reducing senescent P21+ chondrocytes. Furthermore, between the cartilage rings are distributed fibrous connective tissue rings, in which the loaded quercetin induces an immune cascade to restrain senescence in multiple cells, including chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts via mitochondrion-targeted oxidative stress scavenging, promoting the development of the full tracheal components in vivo. Based on these designs, 12 weeks after orthotopic transplantation, the Hebe-ET achieves sustainable youth and develops a natural-like structure with mature cartilage phenotype, reconstructed vascular network, and epithelium coverage. The mechanical property exceeds that of the natural trachea, and 87.5% of animals survived. This study first reveals the necessity of anti-senescence design in the fabrication of complex organ substitutes and proposes an effective engineering strategy for segmental trachea reconstruction.},

Improving nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) condition first requires a supportive surrounding environment. However, how to provide an excellent microenvironment before regulating the function of the NPCs is not yet a complete strategy. In this study, a sequential drug delivery system is comprised of chitosan hydrogel (G-CS) loaded with Angiotensin (1-7) and mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSN) coating with α-mangostin to achieve synergistic effects of anti-inflammatory and regulation of metabolic disorders of the ECM in NPCs. The system first explosively releases outer G-CSloaded Angiotensin (1-7) by exploiting the different solubility characteristics of the two drugs, which improves the inflammatory environment by inhibiting the integrated stress response and regulating the macrophage phenotype. During the second stage, the inner layer of the MSN controlled-release loaded α-mangostin to regulate ECM metabolism and synthesis, slowing cell aging and apoptosis. Furthermore, α-mangostin promotes mitophagy in NPCs by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and activating the Pink1/Parkin pathway, promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria. The proposed drug delivery system represents an innovative and promising strategy for treating IDD.},

  abstract     = {Superlattice structures, created by the periodic arrangement of two or more distinct materials, have attracted significant interest. This paper proposes a strategy for designing superlattice structures in soft materials with improved dielectric and mechanical properties. Two types of acid-functionalized block copolymers and a series of zwitterions with varying cationic and anionic structures are synthesized. When the zwitterion anion possesses a localized charge and the cation exhibits weak interactions with the acid groups in the polymers, the zwitterions preferentially localize at the interfacial layers between the ionic and ionophobic domains. As the zwitterion concentration increases and ion–dipole interactions strengthen within the confined subdomains, the interfacial curvature of the superlattice transitions from lamellae to cylindrical morphology and further evolves to Frank-Kasper phases. Notably, these morphological transitions occur despite the symmetrical volume fractions of the ionic phases. These superlattice structures and Frank-Kasper phases exhibit thermal stability up to 150 °C, a high static dielectric constant of 25, and excellent mechanical properties including a modulus of 360 MPa, hardness of 16 MPa, stiffness of 772 N m −1 , and energy dissipation index of 0.675 at 22 °C, making them highly promising candidates for advanced applications in soft electronics and memory devices.},

However, the dual requirement for high mechanical robustness and good injectability poses a fundamental challenge, as improvements in one often compromise the other. Colloidal gels offer tunable mechanical properties and feasible injectability through the bottom-up assembly of building blocks. Here an interfacial reinforcement strategy is developed by enhancing specific surface area and roughness to fabricate nanosheet-mica (NM) magnetic colloidal gels (NMMG). The negatively charged NM, exfoliated from natural ground mica (GM), possessed increased binding sites, while in situ grown Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles enhanced building block roughness, reducing intergranular displacement and thereby maintaining mechanical strength while ensuring injectability. Compared with GM-based magnetic colloidal gels, NMMG can be injected through 2.6 F catheter with ≈20 N force (40% of manual limit), while storage modulus improved from ≈800 to ≈1800 Pa (2.25-fold higher than embolization minimum limit). Transcatheter embolization with NMMG significantly inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, NMMG-mediated minimally invasive therapies, including TAE combined with magnetothermal therapy, achieved synergistic therapeutic effects in hepatic tumor-bearing rabbits. The rough-interface strengthening strategy facilitates the development of high-performance colloidal gels with mechanical integrity and tailored functions.},

In this study, the helical Landau levels rooted in acoustic quantum spin Hall systems are theoretically proposed and experimentally validated. By linearly increasing the local bandgap through the lifting of the double Dirac cone in acoustic crystals with both square and hexagonal lattices—achieved via topology optimization method—a position-dependent effective mass is introduced in the Dirac Hamiltonian, thereby synthesizing in-plane pseudomagnetic fields. This results in the emergence of spin-locked helical Landau levels, which has been experimentally validated. The large-area conveyance of acoustic energy facilitated by these helical Landau levels is demonstrated and the robustness of Landau-level-mediated propagation against defects is confirmed.

Under mild, energy-efficient conditions (−200 mA), this approach converts cinnamaldehyde to benzaldehyde with complete conversion (100%) and >99% selectivity, outperforming traditional harsh oxidants. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the tailored coordination environment of the catalyst enhances * OOH formation, enabling targeted oxidative activity. The method operates at ambient conditions, eliminates toxic reagents and high energy-consuming process, and aligns with sustainable chemistry principles.

  abstract     = {Enriching trace biomarkers (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids) is critical for biomedical applications; yet conventional methods often lack versatility, limiting their effectiveness to specific biomarker types. To address this, the phase separation-assisted pre-enrichment (PSAP) technology is presented that exploits differential polymer-polymer partitioning to achieve 47-fold antigen and 44-fold RNA enrichment simultaneously. Through systematic optimization of interfacial chemistry, including pH modulation, polymer hydrophilicity, mass fraction, and molecular weights, the protocol is refined to enable direct integration with commercial diagnostics. PSAP-boosted rapid antigen ests (RATs) detected SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza viruses at tenfold and fivefold lower limits, respectively. In clinical validation, 53 clinical specimens (containing PCR undetectable samples as controls) are analyzed. The PSAP method significantly enhanced detection accuracy for both viral antigens and RNA, particularly improving positivity rates in low viral load specimens (27 < Ct < 31) compared to conventional approaches while maintaining specificity in high-Ct and negative controls. With its universality and tunability, PSAP demonstrates universal applicability across respiratory pathogens and lays the foundation for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignancy of myeloid progenitor cells that demonstrates highly variable responses to current regimens, highlighting the need for precision medicine. However, reliable biomarkers for precision medicine treatment remain elusive due to cellular heterogeneity. Conventional Models based on bulk RNA sequencing and ex vivo assays often fail to capture the intricate molecular pathways and gene networks that underlie treatment response and resistance. Here, NetAML, a novel network-based precision medicine platform that systematically develops 87 drug sensitivity prediction models for 87 clinical drugs using ex vivo drug responses from 520 AML patients with RNA-Seq is presented. The approach leverages network-based analysis and machine learning to identify biologically interpretable gene signatures that capture the complex molecular interactions driving differential drug responses. Notably, the signature genes derived from the models reveal distinct cellular mechanisms. For instance, the co-expression of C19ORF59 and FLT3 is associated with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In summary, NetAML offers a powerful strategy for personalized AML treatment by constructing drug-specific models, identifying clinically actionable biomarkers, and supporting the development of optimized, patient-specific therapeutic regimens.},

Due to an insufficient understanding of the underlying pathomechanisms, treatment options remain limited. Although tendinopathy is recognized as a multifactorial disorder, known risk factors and predisposing conditions have largely been studied in isolation. In this review, it is aimed to examine the various pathomechanisms identified to date and synthesize them into a unified concept. Particular emphasis is placed on key drivers believed to be critical in the onset and progression of the disease—namely mechanical stress, inflammation, and vascular changes. By exploring molecular signaling pathways and conditions involved in tendinopathy, how these mechanisms interact and reinforce one another is illustrated, forming a complex and dynamic signaling network, referred to as the tendinopathic loop. In the future, this network is expected to become even more intricate with the inclusion of emerging concepts such as intratendinous pressure and the potential influence of metabolic factors.},

Here, a prototype of space-time acoustic metasurface (STAM) is proposed and implemented, consisting of a reflective piezoelectric array controlled by a field-programmable gate array. Leveraging the spatiotemporally programmable phases of the STAM, this is experimentally achieved Doppler-like chirp modulation and space-time modulation with deterministic frequency and momentum shifts of waterborne acoustic waves. Furthermore, based on this flexible and efficient modulation strategy, a stochastic space-time modulation method is introduced, showcasing its applications in single-channel direction-of-arrival estimation.

Organic electrode materials are currently the best-performing candidates, and among them, poly(1,4-anthraquinone) ( P14AQ ) shows excellent electrochemical properties. This holds in particular for magnesium-ion batteries, where the polymer displays reversible insertion of Mg 2+ ions with high cycling stability. The conventional synthesis of P14AQ , however, employs stoichiometric amounts of bis(cycloocta-1,5-diene)nickel(0) (Ni(COD) 2 ), which is an air- and light-sensitive and expensive chemical, and therefore lacks sustainability. Herein a synthetic route to P14AQ is presented that uses only catalytic amounts of dibromobis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(II) (NiBr 2 (PPh 3 ) 2 ). This route – in addition to being more cost-efficient and less toxic – results in higher yields and polymer molecular weights. A life-cycle assessment (LCA) comparing the new and conventional polymerization methods shows that regarding the environmental impact categories climate change, human toxicity, and cumulative energy demand, the new method brings significant improvement.},

When placed in water, proteinoids swell into microspheres which produce neuron-like spikes of electrical potential. This study combines proteinoid microspheres with Emiliania huxleyi algae to create advanced bioelectronic signal processing systems with neuromorphic characteristics. The morphologies of L-Glu:L-Phe proteinoid microspheres and their interactions with algae are studied using scanning electron microscopy, revealing complex structures with budding forms and traits of self-assembly. Electrical measurements demonstrate that both pure algae and algae-proteinoid mixtures generate spontaneous oscillations with unique amplitude and frequency patterns across different recording channels. The algae-proteinoid mixture exhibits a broad range of oscillatory dynamics with amplitudes varying from 25.49 to 191.42 mV and periods ranging from 251.92 to 5471.01 s. These oscillatory behaviors are utilized to perform Boolean logic operations, through post-processing of biological signals rather than autonomous computing, with pure algae systems showing superior performance for direct gates (AND, OR) while the mixture excels at inverse gates (NAND, NOR). Temperature and pH emerge as critical factors controlling oscillatory dynamics. The findings indicate that algae-proteinoid electrochemical systems represent a step toward biohybrid computing and offer a sustainable and biocompatible alternative for unconventional computing, providing enhanced signal stability, environmental resilience, and more effective information processing compared to traditional electronic systems while acknowledging current limitations in autonomous learning capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), a leading cause of chronic low back pain, arises from nucleus pulposus (NP) cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress-induced mitophagy impairment and ferroptosis, though regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. F-box only protein 2 (FBXO2), a Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10)-regulated F-box protein, is downregulated in degenerated human NP tissues and correlates with disease severity. Overexpression of FBXO2 restores extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis by promoting matrix component synthesis and inhibiting catabolic enzymes, while its knockdown exacerbates ECM degradation. Under oxidative stress, FBXO2 activates PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Proteomics reveals that FBXO2 suppresses ferroptosis by attenuating lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, and iron overload. Mechanistically, FBXO2 binds lipocalin-2 (LCN2) via its FBA domain, promoting K27-linked polyubiquitination to drive proteasomal degradation of this ferroptosis inducer. FBXO2 co-expression reverses LCN2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis markers. In vivo, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of FBXO2 ameliorates IVDD in rats, whereas FBXO2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit exacerbated IVDD. LCN2 silencing in FBXO2-deficient mice partially restores disc integrity and matrix component expression. These findings identify FBXO2 as a dual regulator coordinating mitophagy activation and ferroptosis suppression, offering therapeutic potential for IVDD progression.},

  abstract     = {This reports a dual-functional approach in which Fe catalysts, initially employed for methane pyrolysis to generate COx-free hydrogen, are directly repurposed as anode materials following in situ carbon deposition. During methane splitting, catalytic decomposition of CH₄ at 900 °C forms onion-like graphitic carbon shells (≈280 layers) around Fe cores (≈50 nm), producing a structurally stable and electrically conductive Fe@C900 composite without post-treatment. This carbon-enriched catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrochemical behavior when transitioned into a battery context. Without any conductive additives, Fe@C900 delivers a reversible capacity of 380 mAh g⁻¹ with 98% retention over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Under a 5000 G magnetic field, spin alignment within the Fe cores triggers directional lithium-ion migration, enhancing rate performance by 150%. Multimodal characterization reveals accelerated lithium kinetics, stable SEI evolution, and deep lithiation behavior. DFT calculations further confirm strong lithium adsorption (−24.14 eV) and low insertion barriers (−22.85 eV), validating the spin-guided diffusion mechanism. This work introduces a new class of hydrogen-derived ferromagnetic anodes, where the byproduct of a clean hydrogen process is re-engineered into a high-rate, conductor-free lithium storage platform. By coupling hydrogen generation with energy storage through shared material intermediates, this strategy offers a scalable path to carbon-efficient, magnetically enhanced battery systems.},

Here, it is shown that the cell-cell communication, known as quorum sensing (QS), inhibits the expression and activity of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in S. aureus . The QS regulator, AgrA, directly binds to the promoters of two transcriptional regulators encoding the genes sarA and arcR to inhibit their expression. However, both SarA and ArcR act as positive regulators that promote the transcription of cas genes by directly binding to a novel promoter P cas . Furthermore, the P cas of 300 bp located in cas1 displays as a critical regulatory node to initiate the transcription of cas10 and csm3 .

  abstract     = {Bacterial biohybrid microrobots possess significant potential for targeted cargo delivery and minimally invasive therapy. However, many challenges, such as biocompatibility, stability, and effective cargo loading, remain. Bacterial membrane vesicles, also referred to as minicells, offer a promising alternative for creating sub-micron scale biohybrid swimmers (minicell biohybrids) due to their active metabolism, non-dividing nature, robust structure, and high cargo-carrying capacity. Here, a biohybrid system is reported that utilizes motile minicells, ≈400 nm in diameter, generated by aberrant cell division of engineered Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), for the first time. Achieving over 99% purification from their parental bacterial cells, minicells are functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to enable external magnetic control. Minicell biohybrids are capable of swimming at an average speed of up to 13.3 µm s −1 and being steered under a uniform magnetic field of 26 mT. Furthermore, they exhibit a significantly high drug loading capacity (2.8 µg mL −1 ) while maintaining their motility and show pH-sensitive release of anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) under acidic conditions. Additionally, drug-loaded minicell biohybrids notably reduce the viability of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells in vitro. This study introduces minicell biohybrids and establishes their potential as magnetically guided, drug-loaded biohybrid systems for targeted therapies in future medical applications.},

  abstract     = {The lifespan of the transient electronic system can be determined in advance (i.e., predefined) or controlled via on-demand and programmable approaches using a diverse range of principles. However, in most cases, dissolution or disappearance requires an aqueous solution and is only possible for the entire system, not for specific or targeted components. Here, a soft, stretchable, thermally expandable system is introduced for precise, localized, on-demand deactivation or destruction of electronic systems. The incorporation of thermal expansion particles into a polymer matrix produces soft, resilient composites that generate substantial thermo-mechanical forces at a predefined temperature, enabling the direct collapse of electronic devices. Integration with multichannel microfluidics and wireless systems creates a vanishing, self-destructive optoelectronic system and bio-safe drug delivery vehicle for frequency-based selective release, demonstrating the broad potential of this approach in the fields of defense/security and biomedical devices as well as other envisioned areas.},

  abstract     = {High-quality capture of diverse motion signals in flexible sensors requires soft sensing materials to perform signal conversion and transmission stably and without delay over extended periods. However, low hysteresis achieved through purely elastic mechanisms easily exhibits poor crack propagation resistance. By leveraging the significant gap between the strain rate during large-strain service conditions and the crack propagation rate in the fracture process, this study presents a facile strategy for constructing a highly competitive dynamic hydrogen bonding system to produce near-zero-hysteresis and highly crack-resistant D-gels. Through tuning the relaxation dynamics of strong hydrogen bonding interactions with polymer segments by insert deep eutectic solvent (DES) components, the highly dynamic hydrogen bonds are rendered mechanically “invisible” during service condition—an essential factor in achieving a low-hysteresis attribute (low hysteresis: <3%). Meanwhile, the relaxation time of those dynamic bonds is comparable to the inverse of crack propagation rate, effectively alleviating stress concentration at the crack tips, thereby enhancing the ultimate fracture strain (1500%) and crack propagation strain (550%) of the gels. This approach provides a general strategy for synthesizing gels that overcome the traditional trade-off between high crack propagation resistance and high elasticity.},

  abstract     = {Vertebrates have undergone two rounds of whole-genome duplication (WGD), termed 1R and 2R, with a third, teleost-specific duplication (TSGD or 3R) occurring in ray-finned fishes. In the order Cypriniformes, additional lineage-specific WGDs have further contributed to species diversification. While polyploidy is well characterized in species like common carp and goldfish, other polyploid taxa—particularly loaches—remain understudied. Here, high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies are presented for two loach species: Sinibotia superciliaris (Golden Chinese Loach) and Parabotia fasciatus (Yichang Sand Loach). By integrating these genomes into a comparative framework with 20 other cypriniform species, key phylogenetic relationships are reconstructed, and introduce a novel subgenome partitioning method (M3). Unlike previous approaches, M3 uses differential sequence divergence to accurately and rapidly assign subgenomes, completing partitioning within minutes and outperforming existing tools. Applying M3, a markedly reduced subgenome is uncovered in the Golden Chinese Loach, with lineage-specific molecular changes in several candidate genes, suggesting potential adaptive significance. This study offers a comprehensive view of polyploidy and subgenome evolution in loaches, highlighting the genomic complexity shaped by repeated WGDs in Cypriniformes and providing valuable resources for future research on vertebrate genome evolution and adaptation.},

  abstract     = {Flexible microelectrodes are ideal for chronic neural recordings; however, their low bending strength poses challenges during probe insertion. Here, a stiffness-tunable polyimide probe, termed Neurotentacle, is proposed for deep brain implantation. Its tunability is enabled by embedded microchannels with controllable liquid pressure. During insertion, the Neurotentacle becomes stiff under elevated internal pressure, allowing penetration of brain tissue without additional materials or tools. Once inserted, it regains flexibility by reducing the internal pressure. The novel ultra-thin microchannel fabrication technique enables the Neurotentacle to maintain dimensions similar to conventional flexible probes. This minimizes tissue damage during insertion while ensuring long-term biocompatibility and stability, confirmed by histological evaluations in both acute and chronic animal models. In long-term recordings, Neurotentacles outperform traditional shuttle-assisted implantation methods. The technique is straightforward, controllable, and does not require complex devices, making it ideal for minimally invasive implantation and long-term neural recordings.},

A mixed electrolyte composed of LiFSI (LiN(SO 2 F) 2 ) as the main salt, DEE (1,2-diethoxyethane) as the solvent, and LiNFS (LiC 4 F 9 SO 3 ) as an additive achieves a significantly improved CE of 98.32%. Key molecular descriptors are identified for each performance label, and the most accurate model is selected through rigorous benchmarking. The optimal region reveals a preference for medium-to-high salt concentrations; low C, O, and N content; and high F content in salts, along with high C and low O content in solvents.

However, current treatments for cartilage degeneration often lead to the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and fibrocartilage, making it challenging to achieve full-thickness cartilage. Here, dual-modular hydrogel microparticles (dmHMPs) are developed, which enable precise spatio-temporal modulation and dynamic equilibrium between immune responses and cartilage regeneration. dmHMPs can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment of the joint by promoting the polarization of synovial macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Consequently, as inflammation is mitigated, synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells recruited by dmHMPs can efficiently undergo chondrogenic differentiation to repair damaged cartilage in situ. In vivo experiments demonstrate that dmHMPs significantly suppress the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and collagen type X, thereby reducing the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and preserving the structural integrity and biological functions of articular cartilage. This therapeutic modulates the dynamic balance between inflammation and repair, providing a promising approach for full-thickness cartilage regeneration.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, the specific mechanisms by which gut bacteria and their metabolites exert therapeutic effects in melanoma remain poorly understood. In this study, it is unexpectedly demonstrated that prophylactic supplementation with Limosilactobacillus reuteri exhibits significant tumor-suppressive properties, primarily mediated by its secreted metabolite, reuterin. This metabolite induces trained immunity through macrophage metabolic reprogramming, thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses. Mechanistically, this process involves stabilizing HIF-1α via the AHR-ROS signaling pathway, enhancing glycerophospholipid metabolism, and elevating arachidonic acid levels, thereby amplifying the trained immunity response. Similar to reuterin, arachidonic acid also induces trained immunity and facilitates macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing. To enhance its therapeutic efficacy, reuterin is encapsulated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior effects in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), remodulating intratumor bacteria and directly facilitating tumor cell killing. Notably, COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy compared to cisplatin. Furthermore, COF-Reuterin reprogrammed TAMs from an M2 to an M1 phenotype, increasing CD8 + T cell infiltration and decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of probiotics and their metabolites in the metabolic reprogramming of TAMs, offering a promising cancer therapeutic approach.},

Ar, N 2 and CO 2 interact with an all-solid composite material composed of activated porous carbon and silica characterized by a high amount of charged interfaces under isothermal conditions and ambient temperature. The intimate contact of both components in the composite allows for the formation of multiple resistor-conductor interfaces enabling the reversible physisorption of these gases using electric fields in the lower V and mA range.

Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating general patterns associated with DSBs, the influence of 3D chromatin structure on DSB formation remains underexplored, particularly concerning its spatial configuration. Here, the ChromInSight framework is introduced. Using standardized datasets,Hi-DSB is developed and deployed in ChromInSight, a genome-wide DSB prediction model based on graph contrastive learning (GCL), and applied advanced interpretability techniques to identify DSB-associated genomic patterns. The findings reveal that the spatial cluster-scene between hub nodes and DSB sites is predominantly shaped by the 3D conformation of chromatin, rather than by linear genomic distance. This phenomenon is validated at both the Loop and topologically associating domain (TAD) levels and proposed a “spatial isolation – damage containment” hypothesis, which illustrates the genome strategy for managing damage. These findings support the role of 3D genome architecture in genomic instability. Consequently, the framework provides a powerful tool for investigating the intricate relationship between chromatin structure and genomic stability.},

  abstract     = {Garnet-type Li 6.5 La 3 Zr 1.5 Ta 0.5 O 12 (LLZO) has emerged as a highly promising solid electrolyte for next-generation Li metal batteries due to its high Li + conductivity and stability against metallic lithium. However, its practical application is hindered by poor interfacial contact between Li and LLZO, as well as the persistent issue of lithium dendrite formation during cycling. In this study, a novel and efficient strategy is proposed to address these challenges by employing a room-temperature ultrasonic treatment combined with a LiMg alloy anode. The fabricated symmetrical UW-LiMg/LLZO/UW-LiMg cell exhibits a low interfacial resistance and achieves an unprecedented critical current density of 4.45 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, these cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability, maintaining stable lithium plating/stripping for over 1000 h at a high current density of 1 mA cm − 2 with a low overpotential of ≈30 mV. The superior performance is attributed to the enhanced anode ductility achieved through Mg alloying and the formation of an ultra-stable interface layer. The all-solid-state UW-LiMg/LLZO/LiFePO 4 battery, incorporating an ultrasonically treated alloy anode and a fluorinated cathode interface, delivers a specific capacity of 153 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C and retains an impressive capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at room temperature.},

  abstract     = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a leading cause of discogenic lower back pain, yet the crosstalk between macrophage polarization and nucleus pulposus (NP) cell senescence in IDD progression remains poorly understood. Emerging therapies using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) show promise for IDD treatment. In this study, it is first demonstrated that senescent NP cells promote macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in coculture systems. Reciprocally, conditioned medium from M1 macrophages exposed to senescent NP cells accelerates senescence in healthy NP cells. Notably, it is identified that iMSCs-derived exosomes break this pathogenic cycle by reprogramming M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Mechanistically, these exosomes deliver miR-100-5p to suppress mTORC1 signaling and regulate glycolysis metabolic reprogramming in macrophages. These findings are corroborated in a rat IDD model, where iMSC-exosomes mitigate IDD progression in vivo. This work elucidates a novel iMSC-exosomes mediated mechanism regulating macrophage-NP cell interactions, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD intervention.},

  abstract     = {The cGAS-STING signaling pathway has emerged as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy. However, STING agonists have a dual-edged nature. Although they enhance antitumor T cell activity, STING agonists also elicit protumorigenic effects by promoting IL-35-producing B regulatory (Breg) cells, suppressing natural killer (NK) cell density, and fostering immune suppression. To address these challenges, this work develops a tumor microenvironment-responsive hollow mesoporous nanosystem that degrades under high glutathione conditions, thereby releasing the STING agonist MSA-2 and Mn ions. This nanosystem facilitates magnetic resonance imaging-guided chemodynamic therapy and radiosensitization, efficiently activating the cGAS-STING pathway by disrupting mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Notably, by integrating this nanosystem with an anti-IL-35 blockade, this work successfully mitigates the Breg cell-mediated suppression of NK cells, restores innate immune responses, and enhances antitumor efficacy. This study highlights the pivotal role of anti-IL-35 in reversing immunosuppression, enhancing innate immunity, and establishing a synergistic theranostic platform for molecular imaging-guided cancer radioimmunotherapy.},

Topics address gut physiology (gut digestion and absorption, epithelial nutrient sensing, gut motility), intestinal immunity (covering innate, adaptive, and antiviral responses), and extracellular to intracellular processes (i.e. mitochondrial function, stem cell fate, and intestinal circadian rhythm). Special focus is given to the gut microbiome, including both bacterial and fungal communities and how the KD modulates them in conditions such as epilepsy, obesity, traumatic brain injury, and multiple sclerosis. Innovative methods for tailoring the KD, including the use of alternative formulations, ketone esters, and microbiome-focused interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics are examined. Strategies to maximize the diet's benefits while reducing potential side effects are considered. Together, these insights herein offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the interactions between the KD and the gut, a prerequisite for optimizing the overall health benefits of metabolism-based treatments.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant alternative splicing plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis. Here, splicing factor 3A subunit 3 (SF3A3) is   significantly upregulated in endometrial cancer (EC) tissues and associated with poor prognosis. Functionally, SF3A3 drives tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, suppressing apoptosis, and enhancing cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SF3A3 regulates alternative splicing of fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (c-FOS), an oncogene linked to chemoresistance, resulting in a ≈2-fold increase in full-length c-FOS expression and activation of downstream anti-apoptotic pathways. Notably, phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a direct inhibitor of SF3A3 through database screening and biophysical validation via surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry is identified. PEITC reduces c-FOS expression and induces apoptosis in EC cells. Moreover, encapsulating PEITC in a hydrogel delivery system significantly enhances its therapeutic efficacy by enabling controlled release, reducing dosing frequency, and improving clinical applicability. The therapeutic potential of SF3A3 inhibition is further validated using patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs), where PEITC and the c-FOS inhibitor T-5224 exhibit synergistic effects in suppressing EC. Collectively, our findings establish SF3A3 as a novel oncogenic regulator in EC and highlight PEITC, particularly in its hydrogel formulation, as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving clinical outcomes in EC patients.},

It is further developed immuno-lung organoids comprising hPSC-derived alveolar and airway organoids co-cultured with macrophages to investigate the impact and underlying mechanisms of macrophage-mediated lung damage following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings demonstrate that proinflammatory macrophages induce lung cell senescence through the THBS1–(ITGA3+ITGB1) signaling axis, a mechanism further validated using spatial transcriptomics. This study not only establishes physiologically relevant immuno-lung organoid models for modeling macrophage-mediated tissue damage, but also identifies a previous unrecognized role of the THBS1-(ITGA3+ITGB1) pathway in driving lung cell senescence during infectious disease.},

Neutrophil aggregation and clearance within the brain parenchyma influence neuroinflammatory damage during ischemic stroke. Microglia-mediated phagocytosis plays a pivotal role in mitigating neuroinflammation and promoting brain parenchyma recovery. However, the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between neutrophils and microglia remain poorly understood. Here, this study demonstrates that neutrophils can trigger microglial functional change to inhibit microglial phagocytosis and promote pyroptosis, which is regulated by neutrophil-derived myeloid-related protein 14. Additionally, interleukin-1 β released by pyroptotic microglia further upregulates myeloid-related protein 14 expression and facilitates neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow, establishing a self-sustaining inflammatory loop. Therefore, neutrophils accumulate in the brain parenchyma and further exacerbate microglial neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain. These findings reveal a previously unknown interaction between neutrophils and microglia after acute ischemic stroke and suggest that targeting myeloid-related protein 14 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke therapy.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in understanding the STING signaling pathway, mechanisms governing cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-induced STING trafficking out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unclear. This study reveals that STING localization is regulated by the balance between coat protein II (COPII)- and coat protein I (COPI)-mediated trafficking, maintaining ER residency in the inactive state or promoting transport to the cis -Golgi via enhanced COPII-mediated export upon activation. Two novel TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-regulated phosphorylated COPII sorting signals on STING—a conserved pSGME motif and a primate-specific pFS motif—are biochemically and structurally identified. These cGAMP-induced signals drive activated STING toward the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis -Golgi complex. Using a cell-free COPII vesicle reconstitution system, TBK1 activation is shown to occur on COPII vesicles, while IRF3 phosphorylation is confined to the ERGIC or the cis -Golgi complex post-uncoating, due to the competitive binding of COPII Sec24 and IRF3 to phosphorylated STING. A class of compounds is also identified that attenuates IRF3 phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphorylated STING packaging into COPII vesicles. These findings elucidate STING trafficking mechanisms and offer therapeutic potential for diseases linked to dysregulated STING activation.},

It has been established that myelin debris and foam cells are negative on SCI recovery through direct and indirect neurotoxicity. Different from previous studies, the present research utilized efficient biological composite materials to adsorb myelin debris, exploring new avenues for solving foam cells and myelin debris following SCI. To achieve the strategy, the present author team has developed the biomaterial composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber and pretreated macrophage membranes. Results in vitro and in vivo showed that the composite biomaterial effectively adsorbed myelin debris, with a result of few remaining foam cells, mitigated inflammation, minimal scarring, and favorable motor function recovery. Moreover, lipidomics and proteomics, from a metabolic perspective, further demonstrated the regulatory role of the composite biomaterial in myelin debris. Taken together, the composite biomaterial can effectively promote SCI recovery, which provides a novel insight for the treatment of SCI.},

  abstract     = {Bone injury repair remains a significant clinical challenge due to the tissue's limited self-healing capacity and the complex physiological environment at the defect site. Factors such as insufficient vascularization, poor retention of therapeutic agents, and the lack of effective mechanical stimulation further hinder the success of current minimally invasive treatments, which often rely on the delivery of drugs or stem cells. Here, magnetic gelatin/hyaluronic acid composite hydrogels micromotors are developed, capable of promoting bone regeneration through localized micromovement stimulation, eliminating the need for therapeutic payloads. By harnessing the mechanical forces generated by the micromotors under an oscillating magnetic field, the approach directly enhances osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, providing a novel mechanism for bone repair. The efficacy of this strategy is further validated in vivo using animal models of bone defects, where moderate micromovement stimulation is shown to significantly increase the volume fraction of newly formed bone by approximately twofold, accompanied by well-aligned collagen and organized mineralization, thereby demonstrating substantial regenerative effects. This work presents a paradigm shift in bone repair with a payload-free, minimally invasive solution that overcomes conventional limitations and offers new insights into microrobotics in regenerative medicine.},

However, it remains predominantly a research tool due to the challenge to simultaneously achieve mass production, ultrasensitive and rapid detection, high-reproducibility, and ease of integration, which are extremely desired in point-of-care testing (POCT)-based commercial products. Here, a label-free, ultrasensitive, and rapid assay protocol is described for quantitative protein detections in serum samples, which integrates an ultrasmooth gold nanogroove arrays (UGNA) biosensor with an initial rate analysis (IRA) method. i) Compared with the existing plasmonic biosensors, miscellaneous-protein-mixed scheme substantially accelerates the binding kinetics of analytes by passivation of all channel inner surfaces. Combined with the IRA method, a wide linear range of AFP detection (1–10 4 ng mL −1 ) is obtained, and an enhancement factor of ≈160-fold in detection time (≈70 s) is achieved for an analyte with ultralow concentration. ii) UGNA can achieve an extremely high surface figure of merit (FOM surf ) under normal incidence, which is immensely useful for miniaturization and multiplexing. iii) UGNA are fabricated using a high-reproducibility template-stripping technique, which potentially enables low-cost mass production. These unique advantages suggest that the biosensor system and analysis method have tremendous potential in POCT biosensing devices.},

Due to limited knowledge of cortical sensorimotor coordination, artificial feedback is mostly counterintuitive, requiring training to be associated with grasping behaviors. The current study investigates sensorimotor communication by recording neural activities from the primary sensory cortex (S1) and the primary motor cortex (M1) while macaques grasp targets of various textures and loads. Intracortical micro-stimulation is also delivered to S1 to validate the intervention of sensorimotor communication in grasping. The findings identify an S1→M1 functional pathway through which tactile information is transferred. The pathway is shared by both natural and artificial neural propagations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that sensory and motor decoding of neural activities in M1, as well as the actual grip force, are modulated by stimulation designed via S1→M1 communication, without prior training. The work provides a biomimetic strategy to design intuitive haptic feedback for brain-machine interfaces utilizing the S1→M1 pathway.},

  abstract     = {Many plant-derived bioactive molecules with low solubility and permeability can cause hepatocyte injury. However, the mechanism by which they induce hepatic damage without passive diffusion into the hepatic circulatory system remains unclear. This study demonstrate that indirubin, the main component of indigo naturalis with poor aqueous solubility, predisposes mice with chronic colitis to hepatic injury. This closely mimics the hepatic damage commonly observed in ulcerative colitis patients treated with indigo naturalis. Upon administration, indirubin is detected in the plasma, Peyer's patches, and hepatic tissue, with its distribution linked to macrophage infiltration into the liver. Ablation of macrophages significantly reduces indirubin accumulation and attenuates elevated hepatic transaminases in mice with chronic colitis. Mechanistically, macrophages internalize and transport indirubin aggregates from Peyer's patches through the circulatory system to the livers. This internalization activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the formation of macrophage extracellular traps (METs), which contribute to oxidative stress-induced liver injury. The study identifies indirubin as a potentially toxic component of indigo naturalis that provokes METs-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, the findings reveal a novel transport pathway for poorly soluble molecules to reach the liver via uptake by macrophages within Peyer's patches.},

Overexpression of TaPPR13 enhanced the antioxidative defense system, whereas knockdown of TaPPR13 led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused abnormalities in chloroplast thylakoids under drought stress conditions. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpression of TaPPR13 significantly upregulated the expression of nuclear-encoded genes involved in ROS scavenging and the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. Furthermore, TaPPR13 interacted with TaAOR1 and TaSIG5 to facilitate detoxification and regulate chloroplast gene expression, thereby enhancing drought tolerance. Overexpression of TaPPR13 and TaAOR1 mediated stomatal closure to reduce water loss, improving photosynthetic capacity and conferring a yield advantage under drought stress. These findings show that TaPPR13 promotes retrograde signaling to alter nuclear gene expression, with the TaBZR2-TaPPR13-TaAOR1/TaSIG5 module representing a novel signaling pathway that likely plays a pivotal role in drought stress response.},

  abstract     = {The color patterns of mammalian fur are determined by melanocytes' ability to respond to and adapt to microenvironmental cues. However, these patterns can be lost following injury or under pathological conditions, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, reconstituted hair-bearing skin is generated using skin organoids derived from dissociated epidermal cells, dermal cells, and melanocyte progenitors. The reconstituted skin exhibited pigmented hair patterns. By investigating the molecular cues involved in re-establishing pigment patterns, it is demonstrated that this process is regulated through a two-step mechanism. First, during skin organoid culture, signaling from dermal fibroblasts to melanocytes via the COL6A3-CD44 pathway promotes the early maintenance of organotypic melanocytes. Subsequently, during hair follicle morphogenesis after skin organoid transplantation, signaling from the bulge to melanocytes via the SEMA3C-NRP1 pathway regulates microtubule stability. This regulation guides melanocytes to migrate to their bulge stem cell niche, thereby enhancing hair pigmentation by promoting the adaptive patterning of melanocytes within the hair follicle. The study reveals two novel signaling mechanisms that shape melanocyte adaptive patterning and highlight the hair follicle as a regulatory hub for melanocyte physiological behaviors. These findings may inspire new clinical strategies for preventing hair greying.},

RNA sequencing of HS-fed rat hippocampi showed downregulation of cAMP signaling and SHANK1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA/CREB reduced SHANK1 levels and impaired dendritic structure and synaptic function, while PKA activation restored CREB activity and SHANK1 expression, reversing HS-induced deficits. Notably, CREB activation is essential for SHANK1 regulation, as a CREB mutant (S133A) blocked the effects of PKA activation, and a constitutively active CREB (S133D) prevented SHANK1 downregulation. These findings highlight the PKA/CREB/SHANK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for HS-induced cognitive dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex inflammatory bowel disease characterized by multiple factors. Alleviating inflammation is the primary therapeutic approach. However, currently employed anti-inflammatory treatments have limited efficacy and cause side effects. Safer, more effective therapies are needed. Selenium nanosheets (SeNSs) are biocompatible, anti-inflammatory, and low-toxicity nanomaterials with high surface areas and abundant active sites, making them potential therapeutic agents for UC. This study indicates that SeNSs can interact with macrophages and adhere to their cell membranes, significantly increasing their internalization into cells. Proteomic analysis reveals that the main components of the SeNS protein corona are proteins involved in cell proliferation and migration, including those associated with the AKT/PI3K and NF-κB signaling pathways. SeNSs hydrophobically interact with GP130, inhibiting its expression. This interaction downregulates the proteins involved in the aforementioned pathways. In addition, a transcriptomic analysis confirms that SeNSs inhibit apoptosis, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, and the chemokine and TNF signaling pathways. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model mice, SeNSs significantly decrease IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, alleviate tissue damage, and lower the disease activity index. These findings suggest that SeNSs can be a safe and effective treatment strategy for UC, offering a novel approach for managing inflammatory diseases.},

Keratinocytes, the primary cells in epidermis, play a pivotal role in orchestrating the UV-induced immunosuppressive response by releasing platelet-activating factor (PAF) upon UV exposure. Adopting a paradigm shift that transforms a known health hazard as a potential therapeutic asset, a novel therapeutic strategy is set out to investigate for inflammatory conditions by leveraging immunosuppressive properties of UV-irradiated keratinocytes. To safely exploit this mechanism, extracellular vesicles are isolated from UV-irradiated keratinocytes, designate UV KEV, and assess their potential as immunomodulatory agents in the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis. Subcutaneous administration of UV KEV efficiently stimulates the secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) by keratinocytes and promotes the migration of mast cells to lymph nodes through the PAF/PAF receptor pathway. The as-prepared UV KEV effectively reshapes the immune landscape within the spleen by inhibiting dendritic cell maturation and increasing the population of regulatory T cells. Animal studies confirm that UV KEV can result in robust systemic immune tolerance and significantly alleviate the symptoms of both IBD and psoriasis.

Conditional knockout of Mettl3 in macrophages alleviated psoriasis-like symptoms in mice, whereas knockout of Alkbh5 exacerbated them.

The regulation of macrophage polarization by m 6 A is likely mediated by targeting Slc15a3 .

  abstract     = {Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), as an emerging approach for target protein degradation based on the intracellular ubiquitin-protease system, is characterized by catalytic and reusability over traditional inhibitors. However, PROTACs are fraught with pharmacokinetic dangers due to poor water solubility and membrane permeability, further posing a huge challenge to the clinical potential. Herein, a nanodelivery system is developed that is elaborately decorated with prodrugs to improve the physicochemical properties and therapeutic efficacy of PROTAC. The nanodelivery, lipid nanodisk (LND), is readily assembled from three commercially available phospholipids, and shows high stability and long circulation time in vivo. The lipid-derived prodrug realizes prolonged retention and precise release of PROTACs at tumor sites under the endogenous stimulus. Collectively, the LND loaded with MZ1 prodrug (LND-MZ1) presents enhanced biocompatibility, improves intracellular accumulation, and superior tumor penetration capacity, enabling more potent and targeted PROTAC therapy with enhanced specificity in vivo. LND-MZ1 shows a more significant anti-tumor effect in the xenograft tumor model, even at a one-tenth dose of the parent PROTACs under the same therapeutic schedule. Overall, the LND-based nanomedicine paves the way for remodeling the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of various drugs to expand the therapeutic scope.},

  abstract     = {Conventional thrombolytic agents demonstrated limited efficacy in treating thrombotic disorders characterized by narrow therapeutic windows and progressive vascular injury, lacking the required precision, timeliness, and treatment durability. Here an engineered probiotic powered micro-rod robot for targeted and penetrative treatment for thrombus is developed. This micro-rod robot ( Sr EcN PL ) using natural probiotics as bio-carriers, functionalized with thrombolytic carbon nanotubes and platelet membrane-coated nanoparticles loaded with targeted vasodilators. The robot exploits the rapid movement of probiotics, combined with the active targeting ability of the platelet membrane, to achieve rapid and precise drug delivery to thrombus tissue. Based on the natural rod-shaped structure of probiotics, Sr EcN PL can deeply penetrate thrombus tissue, achieving faster thrombolysis efficiency. The thrombolytic micro-robot combines thrombus-targeting capability with prolonged circulation time and controlled vasodilation, maintaining vascular patency and inhibiting secondary thrombus. Results indicate that this micro-robot can quickly and accurately target and penetrate thrombus tissue, extending the biological half-life of thrombolytic drugs by ≈332 times and enabling sustained thrombolysis. This novel dual-pronged combined thrombolytic therapy has significant scientific implications for treating thrombotic diseases with narrow therapeutic windows caused by vascular injury.},

  abstract     = {The regulatory mechanisms governing cell fate determination, particularly lineage diversification during mammalian embryonic development, remain poorly understood with in-depth regulatory paradigms yet to be fully elucidated. Here, leveraging the epigenetic landscape of mouse gastrula, p-Enh is identified, an enhancer located within the first intron of Cdx2 and epigenetically pre-marked in the primitive streak region, as a pivotal regulator for posterior tissue development in mouse embryos. Morphological and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed embryonic lethality phenotype with disrupted posterior tissue development trajectories in p-Enh-KO embryos. Molecularly, apart from regulating the neighboring coding-gene Cdx2 in cis , the findings suggest that p-Enh also modulates the global transcriptome and epigenomic landscape, which might through the transient production of eRNA in trans . Further investigation revealed p-Enh-derived eRNAs participate in the regulatory cascades of TGF-β signaling by directly interacting with SMAD4 protein. Combinatorial modulation of TGF-β signaling and p-Enh-eRNA abundance can largely rescue the posterior development deficiency in in vitro gastruloids through a Cdx2 -independent mechanism. Thus, a potential model is proposed in which the broadly distributed p-Enh transcripts within the nucleus can serve as essential cross-modular coordinators, priming the posterior development of mouse embryo.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-intrinsic programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) has been shown to activate the mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) pathway via its phosphorylation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, the immunoregulatory consequences of MET activation remain poorly understood. Herein, a significant positive correlation between phosphorylated MET (p-MET) and tumor-intrinsic PD-1 is verified, both of which are independently associated with adverse prognosis. Elevated p-MET levels correlated with diminished CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MET activation selectively drives the accumulation of intratumoral GITR⁺ Tregs—a distinct effector Treg subset with potent immunosuppressive function and high prognostic relevance. Compared to KLF2⁺ naïve Tregs, GITR⁺ Tregs exhibited an activated phenotype and enhanced expression of immunoregulatory markers. Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that elevated GITR⁺ Treg infiltration diminished the prognostic utility of serum CA19-9, underscoring the immunosuppressive dominance of this Treg subset. Mechanistically, MET–IL-23–STAT4 axis orchestrates GITR⁺ Treg-mediated immune evasion in PDAC. In vivo, MET inhibition and GITR agonism synergize to enhance antitumor immunity in an orthotopic PDAC model. Collectively, these findings highlight MET signaling and GITR⁺ Tregs as actionable targets to counteract immune evasion and improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.},

  abstract     = {NSP7 (Non-Structural Protein 7) of SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial component for viral replication and transcription. In this study, it is revealed that the host E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO5 suppresses viral replication by mediating NSP7 lysine-48-linked ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, it is also determined that NSP7 expression impairs the host antiviral response by inhibiting the ISGylation of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), a key sensor for viral RNA. Through an unbiased esiRNA screen, it is identified that NSP7 ubiquitination is coregulated by β-TrCP1 and the kinase TAF1. Additionally, this study uncovers a small molecule FBXO5 stabilizer that disrupts the β-TrCP1–FBXO5 interaction, thereby markedly enhancing NSP7 degradation and effectively mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Taken together, the findings reveal a novel mechanism for NSP7 regulation and suggest that small-molecule activators of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO5 represent a promising new class of host-directed antiviral therapies.},

  abstract     = {FOXP1 syndrome caused by FOXP1 haploinsufficiency is characterized by intellectual disability, speech, and language impairment, autistic features, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities such as anxiety and hyperactivity. Behavioral changes in patients are mirrored in Foxp1 ± mice. It is shown that decreased Foxp1 in the Foxp1 ± striatum results in a significant decrease in phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a). Predominantly expressed in medium spiny neurons (MSNs), Pde10a modulates basal ganglia circuitry. Furthermore, the Foxp1 ± striatum exhibits microglial activation, reduced synaptic pruning, and dysregulation of 111 inflammatory genes. These include the downregulated P2ry12 and Fcrls , markers of homeostatic microglia, and upregulated Cd74 , a marker of reactive microglia, suggesting that neuroinflammation contributes to the observed deficits. Interestingly, treatment of Foxp1 ± mice with the PDE10A antagonist MP-10 (PF-2545920) immediately after birth not only corrects behavioral abnormalities, including decreased ultrasonic vocalization, hyperactivity, and anxiety but also normalizes changes in microglia morphology and synaptic pruning. Transcriptomic analysis with a neuroinflammation-specific gene panel reveals nominal gene expression changes after MP-10 treatment, including Bdnf upregulation and enrichment of neurotrophin signaling. Since FOXP1 and its signaling pathway are highly conserved, administration of MP-10 or other Pde10a antagonists may also alleviate the neurological dysfunction seen in humans with FOXP1 syndrome.},

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have functions of repairing skin wounds, while antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) can prevent the infections of skin. Therefore, if FGFs can act like AMPs, they will have better application potential in promoting skin wound healing. Here, it is found that grass carp fibroblast growth factor 8a (gcFGF8a) has broad-spectrum and potent antibacterial activity through disrupting the cell membrane, indicating that FGF8 is an uncovered AMP. Further study revealed that gcFGF8a can accelerate skin wound healing through dual functions: inhibiting bacterial and activating of glycolysis. Mechanistically, gcFGF8a/FGFR4 signaling induces epithelial cell glycolytic programs for barrier remodeling through the mTORC1/HIF1α pathway. Interestingly, it is found that mouse FGF8b (mFGF8b), the homolog of gcFGF8a, also has antibacterial and skin wound repair activities, indicating that FGF8 is a functionally conserved molecule in vertebrates. To the knowledge, FGF8 is the only member of the FGF family with both antibacterial and wound repair functions at present, greatly enriching the understanding of this pivotal molecule. Furthermore, these findings highlighted the potential application of FGF8 as a skin wound repair drug.},

  abstract     = {Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is one of the most complex temporomandibular disorders. Cartilage matrix degradation results in the infiltration of nerves, blood vessels, and inflammatory cells, which disrupts chondrocyte function. Therapeutic strategies for TMJOA designed to maintain cartilage homeostasis remain largely unknown. Here, it is reported that orosomucoid 1 (ORM1) attenuated TMJOA progression by maintaining cartilage homeostasis. It is demonstrated that ORM1 is down-regulated in the synovial fluid of patients with TMJOA and condylar cartilage of unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) rats. Administration of ORM1 protein significantly inhibited cartilage matrix degradation and alleviated TMJOA progression in UAC rats. At the mechanistic level, ORM1 binds to vimentin (VIM), a type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, and inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, thereby significantly decreasing cartilage matrix degradation mediated through inhibiting the cartilage degradation markers matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and MMP3, and maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Notably, inhibition of VIM in vivo also markedly improved TMJOA progression, including cartilage degradation and subchondral bone destruction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the important functions of ORM1 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis via suppressing VIM/MAPK/MMP signaling and suggest that ORM1 is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in TMJOA.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a specific type of lipid peroxide-mediated cell death which is crucial in tumor suppression. While the mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) is implicated in lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism, its role in ferroptosis and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains uncharacterized. Here, MTCH2 is identified as a crucial regulator of ferroptosis in CRC progression. Clinically, high expression of MTCH2 in CRC tissues predicts poor prognosis. Functionally, loss of MTCH2 inhibits azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in MTCH2 cKO mice and leads to accumulation of ferrous ion and enhances ferroptosis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTCH2 deficiency promotes the proteasome-dependent ubiquitination of E2F4 and attenuates transcriptional inhibition of transferrin receptor (TFRC) by E2F4, ultimately facilitating TFRC-mediated ferroptosis in CRC cells. Moreover, MTCH2 depletion combined with sorafenib treatment synergistically triggers ferroptosis, suppresses liver metastasis, and effectively eradicates tumors in liver metastasis foci. Taken together, This study reveals the mechanism of MTCH2 deficiency-induced ferroptosis to inhibit the progression of CRC and supports a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the MTCH2/E2F4/TFRC signaling axis in CRC patients with liver metastasis.},

  abstract     = {The elongation period of cotton fiber development is crucial for ensuring cotton quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation remain unclear. This study reveals that SER02 _ A11 , which is preferentially expressed during the fiber elongation period, encodes serine protease inhibitors (serpins). A previously uncharacterized SNP 517th is localized in the gene's coding region between Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum , leading to the premature translation termination and low expression of GhSER02 in G. hirsutum . However, in G. barbadense , normal protein translation and high expression of GbSER02 are observed. Ectopic GbSER02 expression or site-directed GhSER02' mutagenesis (but not GhSER02 ) promotes trichome and root cell elongation in Arabidopsis , indicating that SNP 517th causes the dysfunction of GhSER02 . Overexpressing GbSER02 in G. hirsutum increases fiber length. GbSER02 interacts with the transcription factor GhVOZ1 (vascular one-zinc-finger protein) in the cytoplasm, alleviating the inhibitory effect of GhVOZ1 on GhGA3ox1 expression, thereby promoting gibberellin synthesis. Subsequently, the cell wall loosening-related genes GhXTH2 and GhEXPA1 are significantly upregulated whereas the flavonoid metabolism-related gene GhCHS1 is significantly downregulated, ultimately improving fiber length. Collectively, this study reveals the essential role of the GbSER02-GhVOZ1-GhGA3ox1 module in regulating fiber quality and provides novel insights into the mechanism of fiber development in cotton.},

  abstract     = {Cancer patients have a higher risk of all types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cardiologists are encountering a growing number of cancer patients with CVDs, and an increasing number of cancer patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The mechanistic link between cancer and CVDs remains elusive. Here, the meta-analysis shows the increased incidence ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing PCI with cancer compared with non-cancer. We experimentally demonstrated that cancer aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in two models of lung cancer in mice. Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cancer mice exacerbated cardiac I/R injury in vivo and in vitro, while inhibition of tumor EVs secretion by lipid-coated polyacrylic acid/calcium phosphate nanoparticles delivered a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor (GW4869) showed the opposite results. Lung-specific miR-485-3p sponges mediated by Adeno-associated virus 6 suppress cardiac damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in CC10-KRAS G12D mice post-I/R. Mechanistically, PPARGC1A/PGC-1α is post-transcriptionally repressed by miR-485-3p in cardiomyocytes, leading to the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I subunits and ATP synthesis. Taken together, our findings reveal for the first time that cancer can aggravate cardiac injury and mitochondrial dysfunction by releasing miR-485-3p-enriched extracellular vesicles derived from cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Creation of well-curated databases tailored to specific structural motifs can underpin and drive materials discovery, as the properties of materials are governed by composition and structure. The role of such motifs in directing the intricate interplay between structure and properties is exemplified by intermetallic compounds with structures that contain kagome layers that exhibit a variety of exotic physical states. Two prevailing approaches have previously been applied to identify such materials: evaluation of structural topology or geometry assessment, however, both present limitations if deployed individually. We augment topological screening with geometrical filtering to allow versatile control over the identification of kagome layers. Applying this approach with minimal further constraints labels over 9000 kagome-containing intermetallics which are assigned to four structural classes, revealing connections between symmetry, composition, direct space structure, and flatband electronic structures in reciprocal space. A machine learning model is used to predict new element combinations that favour the formation of kagome layers. Several highly-ranked phase fields correspond to known kagome-containing materials that were absent from the training dataset, demonstrating that the workflow can identify chemistries affording kagome layers. This motivates the extension of the approach beyond kagome to other property-conferring motifs, such as honeycomb, square planar or triangular plane nets.},

To maximize their efficacy, adjuvants and their combinations are investigated to prepare vaccines with whole tumor antigens. By comparing different nano/micro-vaccines, ≤ 400 nm and 2.5 µm, respectively, are identified as their optimal sizes. When used alone, the optimal cancer vaccine cures all or most tumor-bearing mice with melanoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma lung metastasis. The landscape of immune cells in the blood, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes of vaccine-treated mice is systematically investigated using single-cell sequencing. The diversity of CD8 + T cell receptors (TCR), CD4 + TCR, and B cell receptors (BCR) in cured mice is higher than that in uncured mice. By comparing 21 samples, several biomarkers, including KLRG1, S100A4, S1PR5, IL2Ra, and IKZF2, were identified to distinguish responders and non-responders to immunotherapy. Moreover, S100A4, S1PR5 and KLRG1, are biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy in mouse cancer models and patients with cancer. Hence, this study presents an optimized cancer vaccine that cures most tumor-bearing mouse models and the landscape of immune cells in non-responders and responders to immunotherapy.

  abstract     = {Mounting evidence has indicated that immune signals originating from the brain's border tissues will exert a profound influence on brain parenchyma neural cells. However,  the structural component alterations and immune cell infiltration characteristics of choroid plexus (ChP) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain incompletely understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis, the accumulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) in the ChP stroma post-TBI is identified. Intracerebroventricular adoptive transfer of ILC2 is further indicated to exhibit a tendency to colonize the ChP and significantly alleviate pathogenic immune infiltration during the acute phase of TBI, as well as maintain hippocampal integrity during the chronic phase. Sensory-motor function and memory impairments in TBI mice are also improved under ILC2 treatment. Mechanistically, ILC2 is induced by ChP fibroblasts derived IL33 and anchored to stroma fibroblasts via the VCAM-1/Integrin α4β7 pathway. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus reveals that ILC2-derived AREG promotes the initiation of neurogenesis by interacting with EGFR on early-stage neurogenic cells. Overall, these findings highlight that ChP-resident ILC2, through optimizing the immune microenvironment and promoting neurogenesis after TBI, may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

Thioesters are widely employed in the realms of physiology, pharmacology, and agriculture. It is imperative to continuously expand the range of sulfur-containing precursors to keep pace with the cutting-edge advancements in the field of organic sulfur chemistry. This research has uncovered that polysulfide anions (K 2 S x ), which serve as reducing catalysts, can also effectively act as sulfur reagents, providing the formation of C( sp 3 )–S bonds through a photoredox catalysis with an oxidative photocatalyst tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and dual hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) process. In a pioneering study, a combinatorial strategy of an oxidative photocatalyst TBADT is presented with a reductive photocatalyst K 2 S x , enabled a photo-induced three-component coupling reaction of simple aldehydes with alkanes containing C (sp 3 )─H and polysulfide anions. A numbers of thioester derivatives are successfully obtained in good yields, while a by-product H 2 S is captured and identified by gas chromatography analysis.

  abstract     = {Rotator cuff tears often require surgical reconstruction; however, outcomes remain suboptimal, primarily because of the challenges in fully restoring the tendon–bone interface (TBI). The normal fibrocartilaginous transition zone is often replaced by fibrous scar tissue, thereby increasing the risk of retears. A porous hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel is developed to encapsulate adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Gelatin microspheres served as porogens to create micropores within the hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel (HMs), and hollow gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel microspheres are used to encapsulate BMP-2 (GMBs). In vitro experiments confirm substantial proliferation and homing of ADSCs within the porous hydrogel system. When the ADSCs-loaded composite hydrogel (HMs/MBs/ADSCs) is applied to a rat rotator cuff injury model, it effectively reconstructs the fibrocartilage transition zone and promotes TBI healing. Transcriptome sequencing is performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BMP-2-induced fibrocartilage reconstruction. Furthermore, integrated in vitro sequencing reveals that HMs/MBs/ADSCs modulated the tissue microenvironment to enhance tissue regeneration, primarily through BMP-2′s regulation of the paracrine effects of ADSCs. This study explores the comprehensive pathway through which HMs/MBs/ADSCs enhance tissue regeneration, emphasizing the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and ADSCs, and offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying TBI healing.},

  abstract     = {Leaf senescence significantly impacts both the yield and quality of non-heading Chinese cabbage (NHCC). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of leaf senescence in NHCC remain poorly understood. Here, transcriptome changes are first profiled, and found that ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways are activated during leaf senescence. Further mining of ET, SA, and DNA methylation pathway genes identified that EIN3A and CMT2 are induced and repressed, respectively, during leaf senescence. A whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis revealed a global reduction of DNA methylation during leaf senescence, with the most dramatic decline occurring in the 1 kb regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) and downstream of transcription end sites (TES). Knocking down of EIN3A and CMT2 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) demonstrated that EIN3A is crucial for ET- and age-triggered leaf senescence, while CMT2 plays an inhibitory role. It further showed that EIN3A directly represses the expression of CMT2 to release its “braking” role on senescence-associated genes ( SAGs ) expression. Thus, the study uncovers a pivotal antagonistic interaction between ET signaling and DNA methylation, which may be involved in setting the pace for the progression of leaf senescence in NHCC.},

  abstract     = {Effective bone regeneration remains a significant challenge in surgical practice, particularly due to the limitations associated with autologous bone grafting, such as donor site morbidity and limited bone availability. This study investigated the potential of human bone-derived endothelial cells (b-ECs) in mediating bone regeneration, especially in conjunction with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm-MSCs). It is demonstrated that b-ECs retain unique osteoinductive properties post-isolation, crucial for promoting bone formation in vivo. Utilizing ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models in immunodeficient mice, these findings revealed that the synergistic interaction of b-ECs and bm-MSCs induced rapid and substantial bone formation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of b-ECs in bone repair strategies. The distinct expression of KIT ligand (KITLG) in b-ECs emerged as a key factor in these processes. KITLG expression by b-ECs facilitated the recruitment of c-Kit+/CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to the osteovascular niche, leading to robust osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs, a process regulated by Notch signaling. Moreover, inducing KITLG expression in non-bone-derived endothelial cells conferred similar osteoinductive capabilities. These findings not only enhance the understanding of the intricate interplay between vascular and bone tissues but also open avenues for developing innovative cell-based approaches for bone regeneration therapy.},

  abstract     = {Livestock farming and conventional meat production pose significant environmental, health, and animal welfare challenges. In seeking sustainable alternative solutions, cultivated meat technology typically utilizes differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) into muscle cells for in vitro meat production. However, understanding the molecular determinants governing MPC differentiation into muscle cells, and the potential enhancement of this process through modulation of signaling pathways, remains limited. Herein, we characterized the molecular landscape associated with bovine MPC differentiation in vitro by employing multiomics, and explored its augmentation by small molecules, together leading to identification of media that enhanced myogenic differentiation compared with conventional methods in both 2D cultures and tissue-engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, we compared conventional and enhanced differentiation media, demonstrating that the enhanced media gave rise to unique progenitor-like cell populations, while simultaneously promoting differentiation into myocytes and contractile myotubes expressing a wide array of myogenic markers that more closely resemble bovine muscle cells in vivo. The improved method for promoting myogenic differentiation in 2D and 3D formats, together with the corresponding molecular roadmap, may prove valuable for cultivated meat applications.},

  abstract     = {Exposed to mechanical confinement, mammalian cells can establish remarkable unspecific adhesion, which is independent of integrins. How cells facilitate such adhesion remains unclear. Here, it is investigated how mammalian cells exposed to compression initiate unspecific and integrin-mediated adhesion. It is observed that with increasing compression, cells increase adhesion to collagen I or fibronectin and strengthen adhesion faster. Under low and medium compression, cells minimally increase unspecific adhesion to substrates that lack specific binding sites for cell surface receptors, such as integrins. However, under high compression, mammalian cells switch to a strong unspecific adhesion state, which significantly contributes to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Thereby cells use the glycocalyx to directly facilitate strong unspecific adhesion and to enhance early integrin-mediated adhesion. The mechanistic insight of how cells unspecifically adhere to substrates under confinement opens avenues to better understand cell adhesion in development, homeostasis, disease, and in a wide range of biotechnological and medical applications in which cells are exposed to mechanical confinement.},

  abstract     = {Immunotherapy with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) has shown promising therapeutic effects in the treatment of lung cancer, the overall efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors is only 20%-30%. Thus, more effective combination therapies are needed. This study finds that cystine and cysteine levels in tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are significantly higher than adjacent non-tumor tissues. Cystine deficiency polarizes macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, secreting more TNF-α, CXCL9, and CXCL10. However, using a cystine-free diet marginally reduces the development of lung cancer in vivo. A cystine-free diet slightly reduces lung cancer progression in vivo. Further studies show that cystine deprivation or erastin-mediated transport inhibition increased PD-L1 expression in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combining a cystine-free diet or IKE injection with PD-L1 antibody treatment significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies indicat that cystine deficiency-induced GSH depletion activates NF-κB in macrophages by reducing its glutathionylation. This effect can be reversed by replenishing GSH or using an NF-κB inhibitor. At the same time, lung cancer patients with better responses to immunotherapy are found to have lower serum GSH levels. These findings suggest that targeting cystine metabolism combined with PD-L1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy.},

Furthermore, integrating nanocatalysts into nanodiodes has narrowed the gap between model systems and practical catalysts, demonstrating hot electron excitation in nanoparticle-based systems.

  abstract     = {Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury associated with recanalization therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) exacerbates the initial brain damage. However, it remains a clinical challenge due to limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of I/R injury. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated succinate oxidation in microglia extracellular traps (MiETs) formation and neuronal injury after cerebra I/R injury. The results show that microglia are the main cell type producing extracellular traps (ETs) at 24 h at cerebral parenchyma after cerebral I/R. Additionally, oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) could induce MiETs formation and increased level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Microglia switches toward glycolysis with enhanced SDH activity and upregulated expression of SDH subunit A (SDHA) during MiETosis. Dimethyl malonate (DMM), a competitive SDH inhibitor, could reduce MiETosis by inhibiting succinate oxidation and mtROS production during reperfusion. Furthermore, DMM is found to alleviate neuronal injury after OGD/R exposure and neurological behavior disorders after cerebral I/R, and the effect is similar to MiETosis inhibitor BB-Cl amidine. These findings reveal a novel functional state of microglia and the role of succinate oxidation in MiETosis after cerebral I/R and provide a novel potential target for the treatment of AIS.},

However, traditional low-frequency microwave absorption materials (MAMs) suffer from issues such as large thickness, heavy weight, difficult impedance matching, insufficient low-frequency microwave loss, and poor environmental stability, severely limiting use and development. In recent years, researchers construct composite systems combining various types of loss, coupled with component adjustments and structural design strategies, significantly improving the impedance matching and multiple loss synergy effects for low-frequency MAMs. Based on the above, this review briefly introduces the basic principle of microwave absorption and the influence factors of low-frequency microwave absorption performance, and systematically reviews the recent research progress of carbon-based composites, magnetics-based composites, polymer-based composites, ceramic-based composites, and multiphase hybrid composites. Additionally, the intrinsic relationship and mechanisms are discussed in detail between the micro-structure and macro-performance of different composites. Furthermore, the key scientific and technical bottleneck problems that need to be addressed in the design and preparation of low-frequency MAMs are identified. It is expected to provide theoretical guidance for the controlled preparation and performance regulation of low-frequency microwave absorption composites.},

The underlying mechanisms of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in glucose metabolism remodeling in breast cancer (BC) are still not well understood. Herein, the expression of a tumorigenic lncRNA, LINC01094 are demonstrated that, is significantly increased in BC tissues and is associated with poorer patient survival. METTL14-mediated m 6 A modification stabilized LINC01094 by recruiting the reader protein IGF2BP2, which contributed to the upregulation of LINC01094 expression in BC. Gain- and loss-of-function assays validated that LINC01094 triggered a switch in glucose metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, promoting BC progression both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01094 promoted the dimeric assembly and nuclear translocation of PKM2 by acting as a “molecular scaffold” for the PKM2/JMJD5 complex. This, in turn, facilitated energy metabolic reprogramming and cell proliferation induced by HIF1-α/β-catenin. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of LINC01094 is evaluated through the administration of the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 in mouse xenografts.

  abstract     = {Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal to sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. Yet, its sluggish kinetics in acidic media and reliance on expensive noble metal catalysts limit its efficiency in these applications. Spinel cobalt(II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 )-based catalysts are cost-effective alternatives with high theoretical catalytic activity. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their poor stability in acidic electrolytes. This review critically examines recent advances in enhancing the stability of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of acidic OER are first analyzed to illustrate how different catalyst design strategies can be used to improve their stability. Next, five key catalyst design strategies reported in recent studies are summarized: 1) constructing protective surface layers, 2) modulating reaction pathways, 3) controlling cobalt redox dynamics, 4) tuning cobalt-oxygen covalency, and 5) stabilizing lattice oxygen. Further, recent research progress in understanding the structure-activity-stability relationship of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts is summarized, with a focus on identifying their catalytically active sites, tracking surface reconstruction, and elucidating degradation mechanisms.

  abstract     = {Coordinating transcription and replication via transcription factors (TFs) is a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes. The role of TFs in regulating these processes in cancers remains unclear. Here, it is shown that oncogenetic ETS transcription factor ETV4 controls DNA replication through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ETV4 localizes to specific DNA replication origins and interacts with the origin recognition complex subunits ORC1 and ORC6 during the G1/S phase, facilitating origin formation. Using quantitative in situ analysis of protein interactions at DNA replication forks (SIRF) assays, it is shown that ETV4 transiently localizes to replication forks in the S phase. It interacts with replicative helicase MCM2 N-terminal, histone H3, and histone-chaperone FACT and is involved in histone processing during replication. Additionally, ETV4 transcriptionally regulates key replisome genes MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM10, and ORC1, influencing their expression and recruitment to chromatin. Due to its binding at the origin-promoter locus like the MCM4 gene, ETV4 overexpression increases R-loop formation, DNA damage, and cell death under external replication stress induced by topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor. These findings highlight the dual role of ETV4 in replication and transcription and suggest that targeting TOP1 could be a synthetic-lethal approach in ETV4-overexpressed lung cancer.},

The mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) acts as the executioner in the necroptosis pathway, transitioning from an inactive to active state through phosphorylation, oligomerization, membrane recruitment, and membrane insertion, ultimately forming membrane hotpots. These mechanisms involve protein–protein interactions between receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and MLKL, MLKL phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions between MLKL and MLKL, and MLKL-lipid interactions. In this review, the specificity of MLKL activation mechanisms is discussed across different species and describe the processes by which MLKL transitions from an auto-inhibited to a membrane-embedded state. The opportunities are further explored for targeting MLKL, including small molecule inhibitors and functionally interacting proteins.},

  abstract     = {Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging (HSFI) could simultaneously offer morphological visualization and microenvironmental information through fluorescence wavelength-shifting of microenvironmental-sensitive fluorescent probes, yet its advancement is directly hindered by the scarcity of probes with sufficient spectral sensitivity. Herein, this study focuses on the development of an innovative fluorescent probe that exhibits heightened spectral sensitivity to microenvironmental changes and its advanced HSFI application. First, the comprehensive investigation of various donor-π-acceptor molecules uncovers the critical role of π-spacer on the wavelength sensitivity to microenvironment polarity. Based on this insight, a new fluorescent probe Lipi-PS of whose wavelength sensitivity represents the highest level so far is rationally developed. Further combining with the features of lipid droplets (LDs) targeting and high photostability of Lipi-PS , as well as the newly established wavelength and polarity encoding method, HSFI is successfully realized in cells, tissues, and zebrafishes. Accordingly, the structural morphologies, fluorescence wavelengths, and polarities are intuitively visualized in the HSFI images. Notably, a special HSFI of single LD is achieved using Lipi-PS in a custom-built 3D-SpecDIM system, allowing 5D tracking ( xyzλt ) of individual LDs for the first time. This enables unprecedented correlation of polarity-dynamic behavior at the single-LD level.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to etiopathogenesis and progression of heart failure (HF). The underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Transcription factor FOXM1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development. The present study explores its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics in postmitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs). FOXM1 is significantly upregulated in ischemic heart tissues from humans, mice, and pigs. CM-specific Foxm1 -knockout mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy features associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Foxm1 -knockout mice reveal robust, specific downregulation of gene programs important for mitochondrial energetics and homeostasis. Analysis of proteome and ubiquitinome data reveal that FOXM1 deficiency in CMs promotes LKB1 ubiquitination and impairs the AMPK signaling and energy metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identifies that E3 ligase MKRN1 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 on Lys146, which in turn, inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway and impairs energy homeostasis in mice with HF. CM-specific Mkrn1 knockout ameliorates cardiac dysfunction by rejuvenating the impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics induced by FOXM1 deficiency. FOXM1 overexpression preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics and protects against myocardial I/R injury in both rodent and porcine models. In conclusion, FOXM1 is actively involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics during HF. FOXM1 may be a potential promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and HF.},

  abstract     = {Designing in situ whiskers to enhance the fracture toughness of ceramics presents challenges for structural applications. Herein, two corundum-type medium-entropy oxide ceramics (MEO-1 and MEO-2) are synthesized through solid-state reaction sintering under controlled oxygen partial pressures. MEO-1 is a single-phase corundum-type oxide (Al 0.41 Cr 0.26 Fe 0.31 Ti 0.02 ) 2 O 3 , while MEO-2 incorporates (Fe 4 Al 3 Cr) 0.25 TiO 5 whiskers to reinforce (Al 0.40 Cr 0.25 Fe 0.30 Ti 0.05 ) 2 O 3 . By regulating variable valence ions at different oxygen partial pressures, the whiskers achieved a maximum average length of 28.3 µm and a length-to-diameter ratio of 17.7 at 50.6 kPa, significantly enhancing the fracture toughness of the MEO-2, which possesses the optimal flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of 321 ± 8 MPa, 22.4 ± 1.5 GPa, and 3.87 ± 0.12 MPa m 1/2 , respectively. Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker law (BFDH) simulation elucidates that oxygen partial pressures can effectively regulate ionic diffusion behavior and whisker growth. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the whisker growth direction [0 4 0] aligns with the high shear modulus direction, contributing to the strengthening mechanism. This work provides new insights for designing high-performance medium/high-entropy ceramics, highlighting the critical role of oxygen partial pressure in regulating whisker growth and improving mechanical properties.},

The developments discussed herein signify substantial progress in material synthesis, characterization, and processing techniques, effectively addressing critical challenges associated with the integration of biodegradable devices into medical implants. Although biodegradable medical implants promise advanced patient care, widespread clinical translation is hindered by inconsistent degradation rates mismatched with healing timelines, insufficient load-bearing strength, and potential inflammatory or toxic by-products. Additionally, most studies exhibit application-material imbalances, inadequate in vivo validation, and poorly controlled degradation behavior. Future efforts must clarify degradation mechanisms and treat materials as therapeutic agents.

This Co 3 O 4 electrode affords a unique charge avalanche effect at the metal–semiconductor interface to concentrate electron release and thus enables high-current-density hydrogen evolving at 1000 mA cm −2 with only 207 mV overpotential, far outperforming commercial Raney nickel electrode that commonly delivers current densities below 500 mA cm −2 at 300–500 mV overpotentials. An industrial cell-stack electrolyzer utilizing Co 3 O 4 electrodes achieves a consistent current density of 1000 mA cm −2 at a 2.0 V cell voltage, surpassing the operational current density of commercial ALK systems by two to five times (200–500 mA cm −2 ). A significant enhancement in current output and a minimal deactivation rate of only 0.056 mV h −1 demonstrate the potential of the Co 3 O 4 electrode to replace commercial Raney nickel electrode, thereby substantially improving the hydrogen production efficiency of ALK electrolyzers.},

This study presents two types of STOMs with an area of 11.4 cm 2 , exhibiting homogeneous appearance while retaining up to 92% of their respective small-area cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). Precise laser structuring minimized the area loss originating from the sub-cell series interconnection, allowing narrow cell stripes down to 1.25 mm. This enables a metal-less top electrode composed solely of PEDOT:PSS without compromising fill factor. For a module, an additional challenge is to ensure a low resistance series interconnection between sub-cells.

For the first design, the latter incorporates Al-doped ZnO and Ag attaining a PCE of 6.1% with an average visible transmission (AVT) of 47.5%. A more elaborate design features an extended back electrode using TiO 2 and SiO 2 for improved optical performance (PCE = 7.9%), reaching an unprecedented AVT of 50.8% and a light utilization efficiency (LUE = AVT x PCE) of 4.0%.},

  abstract     = {Copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have emerged as a remarkable class of CO 2 reduction reaction catalysts that are distinguished by their unparalleled reactivity, but effectively modulating the transport pathway of charge carriers between Cu NCs by feasible chemical means is still challenging. Herein, a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy is proposed to modulate the fast electron transport pathway formed between clusters. A copper-sulfur–nitrogen cluster [Cu 4 (SN) 4 ] (denoted Cu 4 SN ) is first synthesized; subsequently, the SN ligands in Cu 4 SN are coupled covalently via a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy to yield CC –Cu 4 SN , which exhibits enhanced conductivity and photocarrier transport. As expected, CC –Cu 4 SN shows a high photocatalytic CO production rate of 29.98 µmol g −1 h −1 with ≈99.5% selectivity in CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as sacrificial agents, which is more than 10 times superior to that observed with Cu 4 SN . Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the covalent crosslinks between clusters accelerate the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, increase the light utilization ability, favor CO 2 adsorption and * COOH generation, thereby accounting for the increased CO 2 photoreduction activity. This work presents a novel thermally induced internal covalent crosslinking strategy for synthesizing novel cluster-based covalent polymers with enhanced stability and catalytic activity.},

G3BP1, YBX1 and p53 protein can bind to each other, and p53 can inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 via nuclear binding to the promoter region of SLC7A11 mRNA. The p53 and YBX1 proteins can synergistically enter the nucleus to aggravate cell damage, while G3BP1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and inhibits p53 binding to SLC7A11 by blocking the entry of the p53 and YBX1 proteins into the nucleus. ALKBH5 promotes G3BP1 expression through m 6 A methylation at m 6 A sites 142 and 173. Subsequently, G3BP1, YBX1, and p53 interact with each other, the amount of synergistic nuclear translocation of YBX1 and p53 is reduced, and the level of p53 nuclear translocation that inhibiting SLC7A11 transcription is decreased, thereby inhibits cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and reducing myocardial tissue damage during myocardial IRI in diabetes.},

  abstract     = {The noninvasive glucose sensors with comprehensive functional capabilities can enable wearable glucose monitoring in sweat with high sensitivity and minimal risk. However, the limited stability of natural enzymes, along with interference from electro-oxidizable species, continues to pose significant challenges for their long-term application. Herein, an integrated wearable system is presented for nonenzymatic glucose monitoring in sweat at the point of care. This system integrates a flexible microfluidic glucose sensor patch for sweat sampling and measurement, using Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) confined within phthalocyanine-based conductive metal–organic frameworks (Pc-MOFs) as electrode materials, and a flexible printed circuit board for signal/analysis and wireless communication. The microfluidic sensor patch based on Pc-MOFs confined Pt-NPs exhibits significantly improved nonenzymatic glucose sensing performances. This is attributed to the ultrasmall size of Pt-NPs and the confinement effect within the Pc-MOF channels, which regulates the glucose adsorption intensity and increases the electrocatalytic activity to glucose oxidation. During the continuous monitoring process, the glucose concentration is calibrated in sweat by accounting for fluctuations in pH and temperature, and evaluated the performance of the wearable device in monitoring sweat glucose levels in human subjects over a 12-h period, achieving data as accurate as that obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography.},

These composites can encapsulate a wide range of bioactive agents—small molecules, peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids—within hydrogel matrices, guided by molecular interactions such as electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. Such interactions influence both the physicochemical stability and drug release profiles of the system. This review highlights recent advances in NP–hydrogel composites, emphasizing how molecular-level interactions shape the nanostructure, drug encapsulation, and release behavior. The enhanced mechanical strength, stimuli responsiveness, pharmacokinetics, and biological performance of these materials are also discussed. Particular focus is placed on how improved mechanistic understanding can guide the design of next-generation hybrid systems with tunable, predictable release for biomedical applications.

  abstract     = {Regulating the orientation and dynamics of interfacial water is essential for optimizing electrocatalytic reactions, yet it remains challenging due to its intrinsic disorder. Here, it is demonstrated that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on an Ir single-atom Au catalyst actively restructures the hydrogen-bond (HB) network, accelerating ammonia oxidation reaction kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that plasmonic excitation shifts the HB network toward a more flexible configuration, favoring the formation of three-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (3HB·H 2 O) while suppressing cation-associated species (K + ·H 2 O). This transformation enhances the dehydrogenation process and stabilizes reaction intermediates, leading to a 28% increase in NH 3 oxidation kinetics. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy further confirms that LSPR-driven polarization at the Ir active site compresses the Ir─O bond from 1.73 to ≈1.58 Å by generating electron vacancies, thereby accelerating deprotonation with * OH during oxidative electrolysis. Extending this principle to an LED-driven plasmon-assisted symmetric wastewater electrolyzer, achieving a 40-fold current enhancement and 94% ammonia removal efficiency over 120 h at 1 V under landfill leachate-like conditions.},

Here, this study introduces an electrochemical degradation strategy for PGA waste that couples its conversion with seawater-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using rosette-like high-entropy NiCoFeMnAlO x nanosheets (r-NCFMAO). The PGA-derived glycolic acid oxidation reaction (GAOR) achieves 100 mA cm −2 at 1.36 V versus RHE, benefiting from abundant hydroxyl species (OH*) that lower the required potential by over 190 mV compared to the oxygen evolution reaction. This method produces ≈90% CO 3 2− , and subsequent Ca 2+ precipitation recovers 77% of CaCO 3 , a valuable material in construction and papermaking. Electrochemical analysis, quasi in situ electron paramagnetic resonance, and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal continuous OH − oxidation enhancing GAOR activity, while density functional theory confirms that OH* lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining C─C bond cleavage and C─H bond activation. The integrated GAOR ‖ HER system sustains performance for over 300 h at industrial current densities and is applicable to upcycling various plastics.

  abstract     = {Low-temperature annealing is traditionally employed to relieve residual stresses in metallic materials, typically resulting in softening. However, a novel finding in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) CoNiV medium entropy alloy (MEA) is reported, where low-temperature annealing induces significant hardening without sacrificing ductility. Specifically, after annealing at 530 °C, the yield strength increases from 503 to 653 MPa, while maintaining plasticity of ≈60%. The comprehensive analysis reveals that this unexpected strengthening is attributed to the development of multi-scale chemical short-range orderings (SROs) during the annealing process. These SROs, particularly a newly formed L12-type ordered structure (SRO-2), enhance material strength by promoting dislocation slip planarity and reducing dislocation entanglement. This study demonstrates that low-temperature annealing can effectively optimize atomic-scale structures in complex alloys distinct from that in conventional alloys, thereby improving their mechanical properties. These findings extend the conventional understanding of annealing effects and highlight the potential for leveraging SROs to design high-performance materials.},

The ionogel, synthesized from the molecular network construction of Gly-lignin, 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazole tetrafluoroborate (BVIMBF 4 ), and benzyl methacrylate (BZMA), forms a stable and elastic 3D conductive network through both chemical and physical crosslinking. This structure imparts remarkable mechanical properties, including considerable adhesion (30.4 kPa on flame-retardant gloves), tensile strength (5.8 MPa), and high ionic conductivity. Notably, through the formation of a protective carbonized/B₂O₃ layer and chemical barrier gases during combustion, the ionogel exhibits excellent flame retardancy, with a weight loss of 41.8% at 800 °C. Additionally, GLI achieves real-time thermal sensing via its negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior (TCR = −0.58% °C −1 ). Even after exposure to fire, GLI retains its temperature and motion-sensing capabilities. Moreover, GLI demonstrates favorable biocompatibility and environmental degradability, broadening its applicability in sustainable and wearable electronics.

  abstract     = {This work elucidates an important open question in the field of mechanically soft magnetorheological elastomers (MREs): how microstructural rearrangements during magnetic actuation modulate their viscoelastic behavior. Experimental assays are provided on mechanically confined and very soft MREs that, under magnetic actuation, show an order of magnitude increase in relaxation times compared to purely mechanical cases. It is demonstrated that such a modulation in the viscous response can be tuned by the amplitude and actuation rate of the magnetic stimuli, and is intrinsically linked to microstructural rearrangements of the magnetic particles. Motivated by these experimental observations, magnetic actuation protocols are conceived to enable mechanical responses in soft materials with force-memory. Specifically, due to the magnetically induced long-term viscous relaxation, one can induce magnetic-driven yielding by introducing material hardening during cycling loading. This mechanical memory of the MRE can be subsequently removed by releasing the magnetic stimuli for h, resetting the material performance and its microstructural state. These mechanisms are deeply understood by a combination of different experimental approaches and a new theoretical magneto-mechanical continuum model. The results reported herein respond to unraveled fundamental questions in soft MREs, and provide a game-changing concept for designing a new branch of soft sensor-actuator and reservoir computing systems.},

However, most of existing topologically protected couplers exhibit a constant transmission coefficient within the bandgap, and achieving continuously tunable transmission coefficients remains challenging. Here it is experimentally showed that a four-port coupler consisting of quantum valley Hall effect-based waveguides can exhibit continuously tunable transmission coefficients from one input port to each of the two output ports over the bandgap, while the rest port is consistently isolated by the topological protection. Further topologically protected digital signal transfer is demonstrated with frequency shift keying modulation in the coupler, revealing the data-transfer capability close to the theoretical limit established in the digital communication scheme.

Here, a novel class of 3D mechanical metamaterials with hyperbolic kirigami tessellations has been developed. By projecting hyperbolic kirigami templates onto three types of triply periodic minimal surfaces, candidate structures are developed with remarkable properties. An extreme negative Poisson's ratio of -1 and tunable mechanical multistability are uncovered through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments thanks to the flexible kirigami geometry. Notably, the structure achieves a maximum volume expansion of up to 488% during auxetic morphing. Furthermore, programmable morphing behaviors are demonstrated through voxelated assemblies of kirigami unit cells with varying geometrical parameters. The novel design strategy presented in this work based on hyperbolic kirigami tessellations opens up new avenues toward auxetic and multistable mechanical metamaterials with broad applications spanning shape-morphing architectures, deployable space structures, and soft machines.},

Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic nitrogen (N)/sulfur (S) participation and π-conjugation in their fused heterocycles govern metal coordination selectivity and redox stability.

On these principles basis, BioBridge employs a dynamic prototype meta-learning framework to associate insights from weakly related annotations, enabling robust predictions for previously unseen drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioBridge surpasses existing models, especially for unseen proteins. Notably, when only homologous protein binding data is available, BioBridge demonstrates robust efficacy for virtual screening of the epidermal growth factor receptor and adenosine receptor, underscoring its potential in drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {Flexible dual-modal sensors that can monitor two signals play important roles in biomedical applications, along with the recent progresses of epidermal or bioimplantable electronic devices with diagnostic or therapeutic functionalities. However, techniques for flexible dual-modal sensors mainly rely on integrating multiple sensing units on a platform, thus inducing extra costs and complexities associated with the fabrication and data processing. In this paper, a flexible dual-modal sensor is presented, which contains only one sensing unit, i.e., single-crystalline silicon-based diode, for the real-time, independent, and continuous monitoring of light and temperature. Operation modes for photodetection and temperature sensing of the flexible dual-modal sensor are switchable by controlling the biased condition. In addition, both experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the crosstalk between light and temperature can be conveniently decoupled by short-circuit current and forward current of silicon-based diodes. Finally, the flexible dual-modal sensor is implemented as a platform to realize the continuous monitoring of photoplethysmography (PPG) and skin temperature of fingertips. These presented results offer paths to the construction of multifunctional, flexible bioelectronic devices or integrated platforms for biomedical uses.},

To explain the difference in attitudes toward AI agents, existing research has primarily focused on environmental factors. However, evolutionary psychology research suggests that the mechanism of outgroup rejection has a genetic basis, highlighting the need to explore the potential genetic underpinnings of negative attitudes toward AI agents as an outgroup in human society. This study examines the genetic basis of negative attitudes toward AI agents and their relationship with related personality traits, using a twin study design to assess negative attitudes toward AI agents, victim sensitivity, and moral preferences. Univariate genetic analyses revealed significant heritability of these negative attitudes. Bivariate analyses further identify shared genetic influences between victim sensitivity and personal-level fear and wariness toward robots. Similarly, a shared genetic basis is observed between the moral preferences concerning authority and sociotechnical blindness anxiety toward AI agents. These findings extend the understanding of social cognition in AI agents by emphasizing the role of genetic factors in shaping attitudes toward them. Moreover, they provide new insights for enhancing public acceptance of AI agents and optimizing human-machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, quantum machine learning (QML) is investigated as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) is developed combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Ω·mm when validated on experimental data. Noise robustness and generalization are further assessed through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models can provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial instability in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) leads to uncontrolled dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, limiting their practical applications. In this work, a novel superhydrophobic HfO 2 -coated functionalized glass fiber separator is proposed. Characterized by its high dielectric constant, HfO 2 can autonomously generate an oriented electric field under external electric field stimulation, ensuring uniform distribution of the electric field and Zn 2+ flux at the interface. This strategy not only enhances Zn 2+ transport kinetics but also effectively suppresses the migration of SO 4 2− via electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the HfO 2 @GF separator promotes the deposition of Zn 2+ along the Zn (100) and Zn (002) crystal planes, facilitating the preferential exposure of the unique Zn (101) crystal plane. Additionally, its superhydrophobic property effectively inhibits interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the symmetrical cell exhibits an ultra-long cycling life of 4660 h at 5 mA cm −2 and 1 mAh cm −2 , and maintains stable operation up to 5050 h at 10 mA cm −2 . The Zn||I 2 full battery maintains 87.75% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles at 10C. Furthermore, the stacked Zn||I 2 pouch battery provides an Ah-level capacity (1.64 Ah).

  abstract     = {Gold is an effective catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation, yet its mechanism remains debated. Among the various proposed mechanisms, increasing attention has been given to a possible electrochemical pathway in recent studies. Here, experimental evidence is reported that CO oxidation at room temperature in electrolytes proceeds via coupled electrochemical CO oxidation and oxygen reduction half-reactions, i.e., the mixed-potential-driven mechanism. A model system is designed with deposited Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) on carbon paper acting as spatially separated electrodes in a single electrolysis cell. After shorting the two electrodes, the reaction current and mixed potential of the overall CO oxidation are measured without any externally applied bias. Independent current–potential curves for each half-reaction are also obtained under identical experimental conditions. The intersection points of these curves, representing the predicted mixed potential and net current, showed good agreement with the values measured in the short-circuited system. These results provide clear evidence that CO oxidation in aqueous media proceeds via a mixed-potential-driven mechanism, analogous to corrosion. This finding provides strong support for the hypothesis that low-temperature CO oxidation over-supported Au catalysts in the presence of water vapor proceeds via a similar electrochemical pathway in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.},

However, their inherent vulnerability related to mechanical damage and electrical breakdown seriously limits their safe and long-term service. Herein, a healable dielectric elastomer (PHT-ZnS:Cu) is acquired for premature breakdown warning by synthesising a healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) based on reversible imine bonding and hydrogen bonding and subsequent incorporation of electroluminescent ZnS:Cu particles. Moreover, LiTFSI ionic liquids are introduced into the healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) to prepare a transparent healable compliant electrode (PHT-IL) that does not obscure the light emission of PHT-ZnS:Cu dielectric elastomer. Then, an integral healable DEA (ISDEA) with an excellent interfacial interaction is constructed by coating two sides of PHT-ZnS:Cu with PHT-IL. The optimized ISDEA displays an actuated strain of 17.0% at 15 kV mm −1 with a healing efficiency of 91.9%. The integrated ISDEAs are used as soft anti-counterfeiting labels and soft intelligent keyboards for information transmission, encryption, and human-machine interaction, showing prospective applications in the realm of data leakage prevention and personal privacy protection.},

In the CdZnSe/ZnSeS/CdSeS/CdS (C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 , in which C is the CdZnSe core and S represents the shells) structure, there is an intriguing metamorphosis from quantum dot (QD) to QS (that is, C and C/S 1 belong to QDs, meanwhile C/S 1 /S 2 and C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 are in the QS regime).

It enables QS-based light–emitting diodes (QS-LEDs) with the state-of-the-art performance, such as high external quantum efficiency (EQE of 22.16%) and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the investigation of charge carrier dynamics reveals the difference between the QD- and QS-LEDs, showing that the charge carriers inside the QS-LEDs need more time to recombine with each other.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this maturation are not yet fully understood. In this study, YTHDC1 is identified as a key positive regulator of hepatocyte maturation and an essential factor in maintaining liver homeostasis. YTHDC1 expression increases in the liver after birth, and hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ythdc1 impairs hepatocyte maturation, leading to reduced liver weight, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. These defects contribute to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. YTHDC1 supports postnatal hepatocyte maturation and liver function by enhancing the expression of key transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2, at the posttranscriptional level through m 6 A recognition. Restoring FOXA1 or FOXA2 expression mitigates the phenotypic defects observed in Ythdc1 -HKO mice. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 binds to the m 6 A regions of Foxa1 and Foxa2 mRNAs, promoting their expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which YTHDC1 regulates hepatocyte maturation.},

Here, the label-free and non-invasive detection of multiple tau variants dynamics across developmental stages, age-related variants, and various APOE isogenic genotyes is presented to investigate the APOE –tau axis using human cerebral organoids (hCOs) combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SERS signals successfully identifies four developmental stages of hCOs: embryonic body, neuronal differentiation, maturation, and maintenance phases. Temporal dynamics of age-related tau protein secretion are observed, reflecting characteristics associated with AD, which are diminished by astrocyte expression. PCA-based dimensionality reduction of SERS signals further reveals distinct clustering for different APOE isogenic genotypes, with tau protein secretion increasing from APOE2/E2 to APOE4/E4 , providing direct insight into the APOE –tau axis in AD. This study introduces a novel method for the non-invasive clinical assessments of disease conditions, dynamics, and the relationship between APOE and tau in AD.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising strategy for obesity treatment. It is previously identified βFaar as a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulator of islet β-cell function in individuals with obesity, but its effect on WAT browning is not well understood. In this study, it is discovered that βFaar expression in adipose tissue markedly decreases with the progression of obesity in both mice and humans. βFaar in adipose tissue reduces lipid droplet (LD) size in WAT and promotes a browning phenotype in inguinal WAT (iWAT), leading to the amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. These effects can be attributed to crosstalk between βFaar and proteins within the master regulatory pathways of LD formation and WAT browning, including RAS oncogene family 18 (RAB18) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). Specifically, βFaar inhibits LD swelling by binding to RAB18 and promoting IRF4 nuclear translocation, increases uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription, and further induces iWAT browning by binding to karyopherin subunit alpha 6 (KPNA6). Together, these results demonstrate the critical roles of βFaar in regulating iWAT browning and preserving metabolic health; thus, βFaar may be a potential therapeutic target for management of obesity and related disorders.},

In this work, a novel composite electrocatalyst, copper-indium/black phosphorus ( CuIn/BP ) is developed, using a simple one-step co-reduction method for efficient CO 2 RR. It is found for the first time that there is a linear relationship between BP content in CuIn/BP and the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas. Consequently, the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas can be precisely tailored by simply adjusting the BP content in CuIn/BP . A total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H 2 reached ≈ 100% along with a current density of 135.2 mA cm −2 . Mechanistic studies suggest that the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species are in situ generated in CuIn/BP , where the CuIn phases mainly contribute to CO generation, while the Cu 3 P species promote H 2 formation. The variation in BP content modulates the proportion of the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species, leading to the variations in H 2 /CO molar ratios. Thus, this study provides an efficient and simple strategy to tailor the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas for various industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen, produced via renewable-energy-driven water electrolysis, is among the most promising new energy carriers. Ru is a potential catalyst for this purpose; however, its strong hydrogen binding strength results in poor reaction kinetics, limiting its application potential. Creating a new Ru structure by introducing a second element is crucial for optimizing its catalytic performance. However, only a few studies have explored this approach, leaving the understanding of how chemical composition influences Ru's structure and catalytic activity elusive. Here, a systematic study is reported on Si decoration of Ru, achieving a tunable local environment around Ru and optimized reaction kinetics. By constructing a Ru-SiO x interleaved Turing-patterned structure, the ratio of Si coordinated to Ru is tuned by well-designed selective etching. With increasing Si content, the H-binding strength on the Ru center is progressively weakened, resulting in a V-shaped trend in hydrogen production activity. The optimized sample exhibits a low overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline solution, along with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec −1 , surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C. This study establishes a valuable framework for optimizing the surface properties and catalytic activity of noble metals.},

Typically, the various rate constants are obtained by numerically fitting of the photoluminescence (PL) decay, but it is overlooked whether or not the solution of such a fit is unique. Using an analytical model, it is demonstrated that for typical TADF emitters only the sum of k S and k ISC , and the sum of k T and k rISC can be uniquely obtained from the transient PL decay and PL quantum yield (PLQY) experiments. Depending whether nonradiative losses stem from singlets or triplets, various combinations of k T and k rISC , k S and k ISC can be used to obtain the same transient PL decay, while keeping the PLQY constant. The only exception is the case of unity PLQY that allows for a direct determination of all relevant kinetic rates from just a single transient PL measurement. It is further shown that additional PL measurements in oxygen atmosphere with complete triplet quenching are redundant, since the results can be explicitly predicted from PL measurements in inert atmosphere. Using the TADF emitter CzDBA with a PLQY as high as 90% as a model system, it is demonstrated that by a combination of PL decay, PLQY, and OLED device modeling it is possible to quantify all the individual kinetic rates. For CzDBA neat film with PLQY as high as 90%, the majority of nonradiative losses stems from triplets, showing it is vital to conduct comprehensive studies on the molecular origin of nonradiative losses in the future.},

However, achieving uniform and stable coverage of the textured silicon substrate with hole-selective layer (HSL) remains a significant challenge. Herein, a HSL material, DPAICz ((indolo[2,3-a]carbazole-11,12-diylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(phosphonic acid)), is reported specifically designed for textured silicon substrate. Compared to the typical HSL material 2PACz, DPAICz features a π-expanded conjugated core and multiple anchoring groups, forming a split-standing configuration with anchoring groups positioned on opposite sides, resulting in superior anchoring stability on textured substrate under external stimuli. Moreover, DPAICz exhibited a larger molecular dipole moment and a more pronounced p-type characteristic, enhancing the interfacial hole extraction efficiency. Consequently, wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells employing DPAICz as the HSL achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.42%. Introducing the DPAICz into monolithic silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells greatly improved their performance, achieving a remarkable PCE of 32.55% in 1 cm 2 area. Importantly, the unencapsulated tandems based on DPAICz exhibited significantly enhanced long-term operational stability, retaining 96% of its initial PCE after 880 h of continuous 1-sun light soaking at 45 °C under open-circuit condition.},

Solid-state memristive devices, such as crossbar arrays and percolated nanoparticle (NP) networks, already demonstrate these properties. However, closer similarity to neural networks is expected from liquid-state systems, including polymer melts, which remain largely unexplored. Here, the resistive switching in silver/poly(ethylene glycol) (Ag/PEG) nanofluids, prepared by depositing gas-aggregated Ag NPs into PEGs of varying molecular mass, is investigated. These systems form long-range conductive NP bridges with reconfigurable resistance states in response to an electric field. The zeta-potential of Ag NPs and molecular mobility of PEG determine the prevalence of low resistance (ohmic) state, high resistance states (poor conductance) or intermediate transition states governed by space-charge-limited conduction or electron tunneling. The occurrence of these states is given by the interparticle gaps, which are determined by the conformation of PEG molecules adsorbed on the NPs. It is presented, for the first time, an equivalent circuit model for the Ag/PEG system. These findings pave the way to adopt polymer melts as matrices for neuromorphic engineering and bio-inspired electronics.},

Understanding the structure-property relationship is essential for the realization of their use in spintronic, valleytronic, and optoelectronic applications. Herein, after the high pressure-temperature synthesis of 3R-MoS 2 in a large volume cubic press, a concomitant experimental and theoretical high-pressure study of 3R-MoS 2 is reported, leading to the discovery of pressure-induced reversible isostructural phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Concurrent with the isostructural transitions, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed, owing to strong interlayer interaction and charge redistribution across the van der Waals gap under pressure. The pressure-induced enhancement of interlayer interactions together with the robust intrinsic layer stacking in 3R-MoS 2 prevent the layers from sliding under pressure and hinder a corresponding volume collapse. This study on continuous pressure-tuning of crystal and electronic structure in 3R-MoS 2 will play a vital role in developing the next-generation devices involving coupling of structural, optical, and electrical properties of 3R-polytypes of TMDs and other layered materials.},

However, achieving this heterogeneity within a single material remains a significant challenge. Here, a strategy to engineer spontaneously generated heterogeneous surface and bulk structures within a material is introduced. The resulting material is termed phase-separation and underwater reconfiguration-enhanced (PURE) elastomers. PURE elastomers integrate the high elasticity of the bulk with superior immunocompatibility at the surface. By de novo designing the immunomodulatory and alkyl acrylate monomer structures, this is regulated that the copolymer's spatial configurations, ultimately influencing its condensed structure. Tuning the alkyl side chain length facilitates the formation of a distinctive phase-separation pattern in elastomers that accommodates large deformations, resulting in excellent toughness and low hysteresis. Moreover, this phase structure supports a water-induced surface phase reconfiguration, aligning with in vivo applications. This reconfiguration enriches immunomodulatory groups at the material surface, significantly enhancing immunocompatibility. Consequently, these elastomers exhibit extremely low fibrotic capsule formation for up to one year in mice and two months in non-human primates. This findings introduce a class of durable, fibrosis-resistant materials and establish a new strategy for designing heterogeneous polymeric elastomers with broad biomedical applicability.},

Here we present FemXpress, a computational tool leveraging X-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to group cells based on the origin of the inactivated X chromosome in female single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. FemXpress performs robustly on both simulated and real datasets, without requiring parental genomic information, and can also identify genes that escape XCI. Applying FemXpress to single-cell RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues of a cynomolgus monkey, we reveal heterogeneity in XCI origin across organs and cell types. In each organ, we identify candidate XCI-escaping genes, and within each cell type, we observe gene expression differences associated with XCI origin, potentially contributing to phenotypic variability. Furthermore, FemXpress demonstrated strong performance in phasing XCI in scRNA-Seq datasets from embryos and colon tumors. In summary, FemXpress provides a powerful approach for XCI status analysis, offering new insights into XCI dynamics at single-cell resolution.},

However, the practical application of traditional ceramic aerogels is constrained by their inherent mechanical brittleness. Herein, a strategy is proposed to customize mechanically tunable aerogels by armoring ceramic nanounits with pyrolytic carbon (PyC). The PyC encapsulating layers with various thicknesses are transformed into ductile tights or rigid armors, facilitating the mechanical customization of BN@PyC aerogel from superelasticity to rigidity across scales. Interestingly, the PyC armor imparts unique versatility to the aerogel, including flame retardancy, elastic response conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, owing to the thermal stability of the PyC armor, the BN@PyC aerogel maintains its mechanical integrity even after high-temperature thermal treatment, and exhibits an unexpected resistance to butane torch ablation. Integrating mechanical stability, high-temperature resistance, and multifunctionality, BN@PyC aerogels offer new possibilities for scalable applications in extreme environments. This facile strategy of armoring brittle ceramic aerogels with PyC provides a novel reference for customizing the mechanical properties of multifunctional aerogels.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanisms underlying Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation-driven development and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) may facilitate the discovery of novel strategies for KRAS-mutant PDAC (KRAS mut -PDAC) treatment. Here, it is reported that downregulation of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15B) significantly correlated with poor outcomes in patients with KRAS mut -PDAC. Mechanistically, KRAS mut /ERK1-elicited phosphorylation of ABHD17C promotes depalmitoylation and membrane-to–cytoplasm translocation of ALOX15B, facilitating proteasome-dependent degradation of ALOX15B via interaction with the E3 ligase complex CUL4/DDB1/DCAF10. Notably, treatment with methyl protodioscin (MPD), a steroid saponin primarily purified from polygonatum sibiricum rhizome, restored the S-palmitoylation and membrane location of ALOX15B via disruption of the ABHD17C/ALOX15B interaction, consequently resulting in significant inhibition of growth rate of patient-derived KRAS mut -PDAC organoids in vitro and KRAS mut -PDAC-formed tumor in vivo via induction of ferroptosis. Therefore, these findings unveil a prominent role of ferroptosis evasion in KRAS mut -PDAC progression and highlight the potential of targeting KRAS/ERK1/ABHD17C/ALOX15B axis in KRAS mut -PDAC treatment.},

  abstract     = {Hydrovoltaic nanogenerators, which harness small quantities of water to generate power, are gaining considerable attention for applications in next-generation wearable electronics. Conventional hydrovoltaic nanogenerators are constrained by their limited power density and suboptimal long-term stability. Therefore, a transpiration-driven electrokinetic power generator (TEPG) based on silk yarn coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/divinyl sulfone (DVS) and designed as a wearable hydrovoltaic nanogenerator offering outstanding power generation efficiency and water stability is presented in this study. Given its hydrophilic surface, mechanical durability, and high aspect ratio, silk yarn is used to design a yarn-based TEPG system to achieve high spatial-efficiency and maximize volumetric power density. Furthermore, the covalent crosslinking agent, DVS, is introduced to sustain the long-term, high-power production efficiency of PEDOT:PSS. The devised yarn-type TEPG system generates a maximum power of 112 µW cm −3 with artificial sweat. A system comprising 25 yarn-type TEPGs arranged in a series–parallel configuration is implemented utilizing the high spatial-efficiency of the sewable yarn-type TEPG. The results demonstrate the potential of wearable hydrovoltaic nanogenerators as next-generation renewable energy systems for wearable applications.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating conductive nanomaterials into polymers yields a new class of piezoresistive strain-sensing materials. While possessing monotonic resistance-strain behavior is a fundamental requirement for any material used for strain sensing, polymer nanocomposites frequently exhibit nonmonotonic resistance responses under strain, which limits their application prospects. In this study, physical experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to determine a feasible solution to overcome this limitation. The corresponding results demonstrate that regulating the initial inter-nanofiller junction geometry imparts complete control over the monotonic piezoresistive behavior of polymer nanocomposites. Mechanistically, monotonically increasing resistance responses under tension can be achieved by promoting active diffusion that causes van der Waals force-driven barrier crossing of nanofillers (resulting in direct contact between nanofillers, e.g., at elevated curing temperatures) during curing; thus, during deformation, nanofillers primarily move away from one another. Conversely, suppressing diffusion during curing causes barrier crossing of nanofillers, which results in resistance reduction, under deformation owing to stress-driven local rearrangement of polymer molecules in heterogeneous shear transformation zones. The mechanistic insights provided by this study can guide the design of next-generation, advanced strain-sensing materials in the future.},

However, while Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 mediated H3K27me3 clearly contributes to the formation of repressive chromatin loops in Arabidopsis , the role of PRC1 mediated H2Aub remains unclear. Notably, in the Arabidopsis genome, H2Aub and H3K27me3 marks do not always co-localize, and some regions are marked exclusively by H2Aub, but the contribution of these only-H2Aub regions to chromatin looping remains largely unexplored. By using Capture-High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (C-Hi-C) to specifically enrich interactions associated with H2Aub regions, it is find that H2Aub loops are preferentially established between two H2Aub enriched regions. Although pure only-H2Aub-loops can be detected, H2Aub regions tend to interact with regions marked by both H2Aub and H3K27me3, contributing to the formation of PcG hubs. Furthermore, it is find that maintaining appropriate level of H2Aub and H3K27me3 is essential for the stability of H2Aub loops and that the formation of these loops reinforce gene repression.

Without confirming the identifiability of these parameters, model predictions may be unreliable, limiting their usefulness for understanding biological mechanisms or informing experimental and clinical decisions. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework is proposed for practical identifiability analysis in dynamic models. Starting from a rigorous mathematical definition, it is proved that practical identifiability is equivalent to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability is further established, introducing an efficient metric that simplifies and accelerates identifiability assessment compared to traditional profile likelihood methods. To address non-identifiable parameters, new regularization terms are incorporated, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. Additionally, an optimal experimental design algorithm is developed to ensure all parameters are practically identifiable from collected data. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and biological models demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.},

This study introduces AntiBMPNN, an advanced deep-learning framework that leverages an antibody-specific 3D dataset, a fine-tuned message-passing neural network (MPNN), a frequency-based scoring function, and AlphaFold 3 to achieve highly accurate antibody sequence design. AntiBMPNN surpasses ProteinMPNN with a perplexity of 1.5 and over 80% sequence recovery. Its scoring function, combined with AlphaFold 3, effectively prioritizes sequences based on structural recovery, positional stability, and biochemical or complex properties. Experimental validation highlights a 75% success rate in single-point antibody design. AntiBMPNN consistently outperforms AbMPNN, AntiFold, and ProteinMPNN in designing complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1-3, yielding stronger binding affinities. For CDR1 of huJ3 (anti-HIV nanobody), it achieves a half maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 9.2 nM (nanomolar), better than ProteinMPNN (135.2 nM) and AntiFold (59.3 nM), and comparable to AbMPNN (6.6 nM). For CDR2 of the D6 nanobody (targeting CD16), AntiBMPNN reaches 0.3 nM, outperforming AbMPNN (2.3 nM), AntiFold (0.7 nM), and ProteinMPNN (0.7 nM). In CDR3 of huJ3, it achieves 1.7 nM, surpassing AbMPNN (51.2 nM), with no detectable activity from AntiFold or ProteinMPNN. These findings confirm that AntiBMPNN-designed sequences for J3 and D6 outperform the originals, highlighting its potential to improve therapeutic antibody design.},

The creation and control of pore size and interconnectivity can be conveniently achieved with aqueous two-phase emulsions. The decomposition of these emulsions into two separate phases can be controlled by carefully choosing the polymer components and solution conditions. Spinodal decomposition, a mechanism of phase separation, can result in a highly interconnected pore morphology, though controlling this process is difficult in practice, limiting its application for in vitro models. Here, a straightforward method is introduced for dynamically halting the phase separation of a gelatin methacryloyl and poly(vinyl alcohol) (GelMA-PVA) polymer blend in the context of a biofabrication process based on dynamic interface printing (DIP). This is enabled by a novel approach based on the concerted application of acoustic mixing and photocuring to structure the pore size, orientation, and interconnectivity in hydrogels. This approach accordingly enables spatially addressable fabrication of 3D hydrogel architectures, with the potential to enhance the functionality of engineered tissues via tailored microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Food-grade lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) have been widely used as functional carriers of various nutrients and clinical drugs; however, the potential for FLNs to induce substantial biological effects is often overlooked. Here, it is found that FLNs are first delivered to the early endosomes and then preferentially fused with lipid droplets (LDs) after entering the cells through endocytosis. This process leads to a notable LDs accumulation, which in turn triggers autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. The cascade ultimately promotes tumor cell growth and invasion. However, autophagy inhibition while FLNs treatment counteracts these effects and further causes mitochondria damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and excessive LDs accumulation, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. This indicates a potential anti-tumor strategy. The animal tests further demonstrate that intratumoral injection of FLNs together with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis without harming normal cells in mice, confirming a promising and safe anti-tumor strategy of applying FLNs under autophagy inhibition conditions. The findings represent a substantial step forward in comprehending the biological effects of biomedical carriers.},

Consequently, the development of suitable intratumoral microbiota analysis methods is crucial. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) involves straightforward operations and provides precise results, the “direct smear method” limits the identification of bacterial subspecies. Furthermore, the issue of inadequate quantification with MALDI MS renders it unsuitable for direct analysis of intratumoral bacteria. To address these challenges, a novel ionic liquid in this study is employed, called norharmane conjugated to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Nor@DHB) for the direct detection of intratumoral bacteria using MALDI MS. Because gram-negative bacteria are dominant within cancer cells, lipid A is selected as the chemical fingerprint for bacterial identification. The results demonstrated that using Nor@DHB can enhance the lipid A signal by an order of magnitude and achieved a good linear relationship within a concentration range of 0.01–80 ng mL −1 . Here, this method is successfully applied to the direct analysis of lipid A in actual clinical samples. Subsequent machine learning and nomogram models further confirmed the correlation between characteristic lipid A ions and LC patient clinicopathological features, which are further validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

For example, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) utilize D- and F-motifs, which frequently act in concert to enable bipartite substrate binding. While these motifs are known to modulate phosphorylation efficiency, their quantitative impact on target site phosphorylation within long intrinsically disordered substrates remains largely unexplored. Using NMR spectroscopy, JNK1-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1, a 450-amino acid disordered substrate, is investigated, identifying eleven phosphosites with distinct phosphorylation efficiencies. By selectively disrupting JNK1 binding to the D- and F-motifs of JIP1, the determinants of phosphorylation efficiency are uncovered. Specifically, it is found that the D-motif selectively enhances phosphorylation in the C-terminal direction in a length-dependent manner, impressively increasing the phosphorylation efficiencies of sites located at sequence distances exceeding 120 amino acids, while the F-motif primarily promotes phosphorylation of a site located immediately N-terminal to the F-motif. Additionally, docking-site-independent phosphorylation is observed, whose efficiency is dictated by the intrinsic sequence preference of JNK1, as inferred from motif scores derived from positional scanning peptide arrays. The work highlights how docking site motifs and sequence context synergistically regulate phosphorylation efficiency, emphasizing the critical role of substrate architecture in determining MAPK-mediated signaling outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in the synthesis of biomimetic materials, the scalable fabrication of high-performance bulk materials under ambient conditions remains a formidable challenge— particularly when it comes to achieving rapid processing while preserving superior mechanical properties. Herein, inspired by nacre's “brick-and-mortar” structure, this work develops an energy-efficient approach that utilizes ice-templating technology as the structure framework and carbon mineralization for rapid CaCO 3 production, resulting in a strong yet tough carbon mineralized material (CMM) while also fixing CO 2 . This material replicates both the hierarchical microstructure and chemical composition of nacre. By precisely controlling the freezing dynamics with dual temperature gradients, this work creates an ordered lamellar skeleton composed of γ-dicalcium silicate (γ-C 2 S). The rapid, in situ carbon mineralization under mild conditions generates interspersed CaCO 3 grains within this structure, which are then infiltrated with gelatin to form a nacre-like CMM with exceptional mechanical properties. The resulting material exhibits a flexural strength of 45 MPa (eight times that of a cement-hydrogel composite) and a fracture toughness of 2.03 MJ m −3 (a 20-fold improvement over unmodified CMM), while maintaining a density of only 1.2 g cm −3 . The enhanced performance stems from multiscale toughening mechanisms, including crack deflection, secondary crack formation, and strong interfacial bonding, all of which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-performance synthetic materials through the synergistic integration of biomimetic principles with carbon mineralization, offering promising applications in the development of sustainable infrastructure and carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Effective management of postoperative pain and wound healing presents significant challenges in clinical settings, driving the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. The analgesic and wound healing effects of hydrogen (H 2 ) have gradually been recognized; however, the lack of efficient hydrogen delivery systems remains a major limitation. This study introduces a novel transdermal drug delivery system, which utilizes sustained-release photothermal microneedles (MNs) to ameliorate incisional pain and accelerate wound healing. Polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZIF-8@ammonia borane (AB) nanoparticles with photothermal conversion properties are designed, along with temperature-responsive QX-314-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for controlled release, which are delivered in vivo by dissolvable MNs. In vitro results showed that PDA@ZIF-8@AB nanoparticles can release H 2 continuously for up to 5 days in an acidic microenvironment, while the photothermal properties of PDA facilitated controlled release of QX-314 through 6 cycles of near-infrared (NIR) exposure. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MN system provided sustained analgesia for up to 5 days and promoted wound healing in the acidic microenvironment of postoperative incisions. Upon NIR exposure, the photothermal conversion of PDA activated membrane ion channels and induced thermally triggered deformation of PCL@QX-314 microspheres, allowing for on-demand release of QX-314 and targeted neuronal uptake, thus offering personalized analgesia. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo studies confirmed the biocompatibility of the system. This innovative approach not only highlights the dual role of H 2 in pain relief and wound healing but also provides a new personalized treatment strategy for postoperative pain management with promising clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT) has emerged as a promising approach due to its remarkable anticancer efficacy. However, hypoxic tumor microenvironment and insufficient energy deposition severely reduce the radiotherapy outcomes. Herein, lonidamine (LND)-loaded Fe(III) metal-Pt(II) porphyrin framework (FPTM-LP) is designed for radiosensitization through hypoxia alleviation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification. Specifically, the high-Z element Pt effectively absorbs X-ray photons to generate •OH for RT while transferring X-ray energy to porphyrin (TCPP), which stimulates the generation of 1 O 2 for RDT. Moreover, by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, the weak acidity and glutathione (GSH)-responsive release of LND achieves O 2 economization, which promotes the generation of ROS and stabilizes DNA damage. Intriguingly, Pt(II)TCPP exhibits the capability of O 2 concentration-dependent near infrared luminescence imaging-guided RT-RDT. Moreover, the decomposition of FPTM-LP under high concentration of GSH generates large amounts of Fe 2+ , leading to the augmented production of •OH via Fenton reactions. In brief, this work presents a radiosensitizer with a unique and efficient mechanism of self-monitoring hypoxia alleviation and increasing ROS levels for enhanced cancer RT-RDT. The radiosensitization potency of FPTM-LP is confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in vivo, proclaiming a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dots (CDs) have elicited attention in photodynamic antimicrobial applications, but their susceptibility to aggregation limits their effectiveness. Herein, CDs@ZIF-8 nanocomposites are synthesized. The results reveal that they have superior dual photodynamic enhanced antimicrobial properties, specifically 7.63 log 10 CFU mL −1 (lg) elimination for Escherichia coli (only 3.12 lg with CDs and 4.18 lg with ZIF-8) and 7.27 lg elimination for Staphylococcus aureus (only 4.17 lg with CDs and 2.94 lg with ZIF-8). Optoelectronic property analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial properties of CDs@ZIF-8 can be attributed to their narrow bandgap and higher binding affinity for O 2 , which facilitates the photo-generated e − –h + pairs separation and promotes the generation of 1 O 2 and •O 2 − . Furthermore, the CDs@ZIF-8/polycaprolactone/ethyl cellulose nanofibrous films are prepared by microfluidic-blow-spinning, which have prominent antimicrobial properties and extend the shelf life of strawberries from 6 to 12 d. Overall, this study provides a novel idea for designing synergistically enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial materials and photodynamic preservation of perishable fruits.},

Herein, a bipolar conjugated donor-acceptor (D-A) polymer (PTZ-Pz) is designed and synthesized with the co-storage of opposite ions by utilizing the electron-donating phenothiazine (PTZ) unit and the electron-withdrawing phenazine (Pz) unit as the building blocks. It demonstrates that the continuously alternate storage of anions and cations can facilitate the charge transfer processes and thereby accelerate the reaction dynamic of the PTZ-Pz cathode. Consequently, the D-A polymer PTZ-Pz shows a high specific capacity of 208 mAh g −1 . The electrode exhibits an ultra-long cyclability of more than 80 000 cycles, with an excellent rate performance of 116 mAh g −1 at 20 A g −1 . Benefiting from the fast kinetics, the PTZ-Pz cathode can operate well at a high mass loading of 44.2 mg cm −2 . The enhanced energy and power density via alternate storage anions and cations mode may facilitate the exploration of new electrode materials for aluminum batteries.},

  abstract     = {Red mark syndrome (RMS) is a disease affecting rainbow trout. Although the precise etiology of this disease is still under debate, a Midichloria-like organism (MLO) is suspected as the triggering agent. RMS provokes characteristic skin lesions. Previous investigations pointed to a local immune response characterized by a B cell influx. To elaborate on these findings, here, this study extensively characterizes systemic and local B cell responses in RMS-affected fish. The local influx of IgM+ B cells to the skin lesions is confirmed, and a differentiation of these B cells to plasma-like cells is demonstrated. IgM repertoires suggested a polyclonal activation of local B cells and some trafficking between skin and head kidney. Finally, the fact that transcripts of the gene coding for MLO 16S rRNA are found in sorted skin IgM + B cells and non-IgM + skin leukocytes reveals the capacity of this intracellular bacterium to be internalized by B cells, where it may possibly directly interfere with intracellular pathways. The data significantly advances the knowledge on RMS and provides another example of a fish pathology in which fish B cells seem pivotal, possibly because of the specific ways in which teleost B cells intrinsically sense and respond to pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is increasingly recognized as a negative prognostic factor for cancers, including osteosarcoma. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to chemoresistance in osteosarcoma remain unclear. This study found obesity is significantly associated with poor responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. In vitro, adipocyte-conditioned medium (Adi-CM) induced cisplatin resistance, while peritumoral adipocytes and diet-induced obesity (DIO) reduce the cisplatin efficacy in vivo. Mechanistically, Adi-CM enhanced DNA repair by the PARP1/ATM pathway activation. Proteomic analysis identified A1BG, a secreted protein upregulated in adipocytes from chemoresistant patients, as a key mediator of this effect. A1BG depletion in adipocytes restored cisplatin sensitivity, whereas recombinant A1BG enhanced resistance and promoted DNA repair. Further investigation revealed a direct interaction between A1BG and NAMPT, leading to the stabilization of NAMPT and an increased NAD + production. This enhanced PARP1 activity and subsequent DNA repair. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT and PARP1 using FK886 and Olaparib, respectively, reversed Adi-CM-induced cisplatin resistance and restored cisplatin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells, DIO mouse models, and patient-derived organoids. A novel link between obesity and cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma is established, highlighting the A1BG/NAMPT/PARP1 axis as a critical driver. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming obesity-associated chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.},

The role of migrasomes in endothelial-immune interactions remains unclear. This study explores migrasome evolution in the atherosclerotic (AS) microenvironment, highlighting their function as amplifiers in the inflammatory cascade. Through analysis of ApoE −/- mouse models and single-cell multi-omics data, migrasome activity is mapped using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) algorithms. Co-culture systems and anti-Cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) blocking experiments are employed to investigate immune-metabolic reprogramming triggered by migrasome cargo signaling. Advanced imaging and functional studies demonstrated that the interaction between amyloid protein precursor (APP) ligands on endothelial cells and CD74 receptors on macrophages triggers endothelial cells to produce more migrasomes. The clinical relevance of these findings is confirmed through CD74 blocking experiments, which effectively disrupted migrasome-mediated signaling and attenuated atherosclerotic progression. Importantly, migrasome content is positively correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis. These results fundamentally challenge existing paradigms of intercellular communication by establishing migrasomes as dual-functional entities – serving both as biomarkers of endothelial stress and molecular drivers of immune microenvironment deterioration. The discovery of the “migrasome-APP-CD74” signaling network opens new avenues for developing organelle-targeted therapies to interrupt the vicious cycle of vascular inflammation.},

However, the mechanisms regulating ID1 ubiquitination in ESCC are not well understood. This study identifies TRIM21 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ID1 for K11-linked ubiquitination at lysine 91. Unlike typical ubiquitination that marks proteins for degradation, TRIM21-mediated K11 ubiquitination does not affect ID1 stability. Instead, it disrupts the ID1-TCF12 interaction, releasing TCF12 to activate SLC31A1, a copper transporter. Elevated SLC31A1 expression increases intracellular copper, inducing cuproptosis and inhibiting ESCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Functional assays show that overexpressing TRIM21 suppresses ESCC progression, while TRIM21 knockdown promotes growth. Clinically, low TRIM21 expression correlates with advanced disease stage and poorer patient survival rate, underscoring its prognostic value. Additionally, Sorafenib treatment upregulates TRIM21, enhancing ID1 ubiquitination, increasing SLC31A1 expression, and inducing cuproptosis. These findings uncover the TRIM21-ID1-TCF12-SLC31A1 axis as a critical pathway in ESCC progression, suggesting that targeting this axis with Sorafenib can offer a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and improving patient outcomes.},

Furthermore, siRNA screening has underscored the critical role of TRAF3IP3 in modulating PDL1 expression and immune pathways, with implications on the ERK pathway and NFATC2 involvement. Through single-cell analysis of published and in-house datasets, TRAF3IP3 exhibited selective enrichment in NPC-like and MES-like tumor cells, and showed a dual functionality in mediating T-Cell Exhaustion.

  abstract     = {Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is one of the significant characteristics of poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), strongly associated with high mortality rates. Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial treatment modality for OSCC LNM, yet its limited response rate severely restricts its clinical application. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered immunogenic cell death (ICD), is often hindered by lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, which also contributes significantly to the lack of response to immunotherapy. Herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodrug loaded with orlistat (ORL) is developed, designated as ORL@Cu-MOF. This nanodrug is designed to respond and release under the high glutathione (GSH) stimulus of the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby inducing cuproptosis and suppressing fatty acid metabolism in OSCC cells. In vivo, ORL@Cu-MOF effectively triggers cuproptosis and inhibits fatty acid metabolism, exerting antitumor effects in mouse models and remodeling the TME. Furthermore, the combination of ORL@Cu-MOF with programmed death receptor-1 (αPD-1) significantly enhances immunotherapy outcomes, transforming “cold tumors” into “hot tumors”. This study is the first to report the synergistic use of cuproptosis induction and fatty acid metabolism suppression in the treatment of metastatic cancer, offering novel insights for the care and management of LNM of OSCC.},

  abstract     = {This study highlights the discovery of the (MgMnCo) 1-x Fe x O y system, identified through a high-throughput thermodynamic screening utilizing the CALPHAD methodology, as a highly efficient material system for two-step thermochemical water splitting under mitigated redox reaction conditions. The screening focuses on a wide range of ferrite systems (M 1-x Fe x O y , M═Mn, Al, Mg, Co, Ni, 0.05< x< 0.95) and particularly underscores the (MgMnCo) 1-x Fe x O y system for its high oxygen capacity during redox cycles. Remarkably, (MgMnCo) 0.65 Fe 0.35 O y achieves state-of-the-art turnover number and a higher theoretical solar-to-fuel efficiency of 43.6% compared to benchmark ceria at 17.4%. CALPHAD-based thermodynamic analysis and spectroscopic electronic structure analysis reveal that the excellent redox performance of this material is attributed to the simultaneous contributions of Fe and Mn cations. This dual active feature is discovered for the first time in any ferrite cycles to the best of available knowledge, offering significant opportunities to explore new multi-cation ferrite systems in the related research field. In addition, the screening methodology employed here can potentially be extended to other thermochemical processes.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the morphology of the active layer is crucial for achieving high photovoltaic conversion efficiency in all-polymer solar cells (APSCs). Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an essential post-treatment strategy for controlling active layer morphology. However, most current SVA are conducted ex situ, limiting their ability to accurately reveal the morphological evolution of active layers of APSCs. In this study, in situ synchrotron radiation GIWAXS and in situ UV–vis spectroscopy combined with GISAXS is used to monitor the morphological evolution of PM6/PY-IT blends during the SVA process in real-time. Results showed that the PY-IT absorption peak exhibited a red shift under a nonpolar carbon disulfide vapor, while a blue shift is observed during the SVA process with a polar chloroform vapor. The SVA process can be divided into three stages: solvent swelling, recrystallization, and molecular rearrangement. For thermally pre-annealed samples subjected to chloroform SVA, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased by 15.1%. The improved PCE stems from reduced crystal plane spacing (d-spacing), enhanced crystal coherence length, and optimal phase separation via SVA. Pre-annealing suppresses excessive swelling, emphasizing the reordering dynamical role in the morphology of APSCs. This study offers insights into balancing SVA conditions to maximize performance and minimize adverse effects.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between the intestinal commensal microflora and the mucosal immune system. Non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis , a common human colon symbiote, has been shown to alleviate colitis. However, the underlying mechanisms of this alleviation remain incompletely understood. Herein, it is demonstrated that promoting the secretion of B. fragilis outer membrane vesicles (Bf OMVs+ ) enhances its ability to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, while inhibiting B. fragilis OMV secretion (Bf OMVs− ) reduces this effect. Bf OMVs+ alleviates colitis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Further, B. fragilis OMVs (Bf-OMVs) are isolated and extracted, then administered them intraperitoneally to DSS-induced colitis mice, observing that Bf-OMVs can target intestinal tissues, the spleen, and bone marrow, and they are internalized by neutrophils to inhibit NET formation, thereby alleviating colitis. The expression profile of miRNAs in Bf-OMVs is assessed, revealing that Bf-OMVs are enriched with mmu-miR-like sRNA, miR-5119, which targets and inhibits PD-L1, leading to the suppression of GSDMD-mediated NET release and promoting the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), culminating in the alleviation of colitis. These findings provide new insights into the role of B. fragilis OMVs in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD.},

  abstract     = {The interaction between SCAF4 and RNA polymerase II (POLR2A) is crucial for proper mRNA termination, with its dysregulation leading to truncated mRNAs and nonfunctional proteins, impairing cellular growth. Despite its potential relevance, the role of this interaction in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unexplored due to the lack of effective molecular tools. To address this, we employed SRiApt, an aptamer generated through the recently established Blocker-SELEX pipeline. Its biological stability is improved by phosphorothioate modifications to form PT f -SRiApt. Using this aptamer, the critical role of the SCAF4-POLR2A interaction in driving TNBC tumor growth and immune regulation is uncovered. PT f -SRiApt effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells with elevated SCAF4 and POLR2A expression. Additionally, PT f -SRiApt promotes premature mRNA termination, boosting antigen presentation and promoting T-cell infiltration. Analysis of patient samples further confirmed the negative correlation between SCAF4-POLR2A interaction and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, highlighting the potential of PT f -SRiApt in improving immune efficacy. Together, the work provides a powerful tool not only for dissecting previously “undruggable” protein-protein interactions but also for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.},

  abstract     = {Given that sleep and pain are bidirectionally related, we investigated the neural circuits underlying pain-induced sleep disturbances using two acute pain models. Activation of nociceptors in acute inflammatory pain (AIP) significantly reduced sleep by 45–50% in the first 6 h, with reduced sleep spindle density for 1–3 h post-AIP. Additionally, an “optogenetic pain (Opto-Pain)” model is implemented to produce acute peripheral pain-induced awakenings that reduced sleep comparable to AIP. Both pain models are used to test the role of wake-promoting neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that express Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (PBel CGRP ) in relaying nociceptive stimulus from the dorsal horn as part of the spine-ponto-amygdaloid tract. Blocking PBel CGRP neurons with genetic ablation or optogenetic inhibition attenuated sleep loss. To dissect the PBel CGRP pathways, the terminals are then optogenetically silenced post-AIP and found the reversal of sleep disturbances in the following descending order of effectiveness: substantia innominata of the basal forebrain (SI-BF) > central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) > bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) > the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In SI-BF and CeA, a similar reversal of AIP-induced sleep loss occurred with pharmacological blocking of either CGRP or NMDA receptors. The results are relevant to emerging pain therapies aiming to attenuate sleep disturbances.},

While tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) mediate intercellular communication, their role in shaping TAMs phenotypes and function remains unclear. This study explores how TNTs facilitate the transfer of tumor-derived materials, particularly fatty acids, to TAMs, affecting macrophage polarization and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations in the TME. Enrichment analysis pinpointed key substances transferred via TNTs. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyzed the fatty acids involved. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated TNTs-mediated material transfer, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the associated signaling pathways. TNTs are the primary route for transferring tumor-derived fatty acids, notably arachidonic acid (AA), to macrophages. This transfer reprogrammed TAMs from anti-tumor CD5L + to pro-tumor TREM2 + phenotypes, increasing CCL18 secretion, reducing phagocytic activity, and impairing CD8 + T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, AA activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, driving TAMs polarization. These findings are confirmed in xenograft models, where TNTs-induced TAMs exhibited enhanced pro-tumor properties. TNTs-mediated transfer of tumor-derived AA reprograms TAMs via PI3K-AKT activation, promoting immune suppression and tumor progression, highlighting TNTs and PI3K-AKT as potential therapeutic targets in iCCA.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary vascular remodeling, which current therapeutic targets fail to alleviate disease severity, plays a key role in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Irisin is identified as a protective factor involved in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in PAH remains unknown. To investigate, plasma irisin levels and its local pulmonary artery expression are measured in patients with PAH and mouse models. Irisin expression is significantly decreased in patients with PAH and PAH mouse models. Furthermore, overexpression and exogenous injection of irisin effectively alleviate hemodynamic and right-heart function in PAH mouse models, meanwhile, it also reverses proliferation and cell cycle progression of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To illustrate the mechanism of irisin exerts on PAH, Enolase 1 is identified as a key irisin-interacting protein. Irisin suppresses proliferation of PDGF-induced PASMCs by promoting ubiquitination status of Enolase 1 via E3 ligase of down regulated protein 4 in neural precursor cell development. Co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking analyses verifies the interaction and binding sites between irisin and its interactive proteins. Overall, these findings suggest that, irisin is a novel protective factor downregulated in PAH. By ubiquitination, irisin promotes Enolase 1 degradation and suppresses cell proliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria in changing environments rely on motility and sensory mechanisms to locate optimal conditions. This process depends on specialized chemoreceptors to sense environmental stimuli. Exceptionally high numbers of chemoreceptor genes are present in magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), which combine magnetic alignment via intracellular magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) and oxygen sensing for a unique navigation strategy toward low-oxygen zones, called magneto-aerotaxis. However, chemoreceptors for aerotaxis in MTB have not been experimentally identified. This study examines chemoreceptors in the model MTB Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense . Gene deletion analysis shows that M. gryphiswaldens e relies on a complex and partly redundant set of chemoreceptors to sense oxygen. Within this diverse repertoire of chemoreceptors, a receptor formed by two interacting proteins is identified that plays a key role in aerotaxis. Interaction assays and microscopy confirm that both proteins interact within polar-lateral regions in the cell. Moreover, genetic, biochemical, and motility experiments demonstrate that the chemoreceptor complex promotes a cellular response away from oxygen via the redox cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), independent of magnetic fields. These findings provide first insights into how MTB control oxygen sensing at the molecular level, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying bacterial navigation and highly complex chemosensory systems.},

Early infiltration of macrophages predicts the adverse outcome of grafts, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Significant infiltration of M1 macrophages and upregulation of Rictor in macrophages are observed in ABMR allografts. Deficiency of Rictor in macrophages exacerbates histological injury and shortens the survival of ABMR allografts by promoting macrophage M1 polarization. Additionally, loss of Rictor in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation through activating NF-κB. Mechanistically, Rictor upregulates E3 ubiquitin ligase SOCS1 to enhance K48-linked ubiquitination of p65, thereby suppressing macrophage M1 polarization. Taken together, Rictor ameliorates acute ABMR following kidney transplantation by suppressing macrophage M1 polarization through the p65-NLRP3 axis and may serve as a therapeutic target for ABMR.},

  abstract     = {Angiogenesis is vital for tumor growth and metastasis, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) being key pro-angiogenic cells recruited by tumor-secreted chemokines. High levels of TAMs contribute to tumor progression and antiangiogenic therapy resistance. Therefore, intensive study of the regulatory mechanisms of TAMs recruitment during tumor development is important for the discovery of new antitumor and antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ENH levels positively correlated with microvessel density and TAMs infiltration. Further exploration revealed that ENH promoted LUAD angiogenesis and growth by stimulating TAMs recruitment and M2 polarization. Mechanistically, ENH in LUAD induced YAP nuclear aggregation to promote CCL5 transcription, thereby increasing monocyte chemotaxis and ultimately increasing TAMs infiltration and M2 polarization. Besides, we found that ENH interacted with YAP through LIM domains, which significantly triggered the formation of YAP-KPNA2 complexes. Consequently, YAP is imported into the nucleus by KPNA2 and then promoted CCL5 transcription. Notably, ENH knockdown also significantly increased the chemosensitivity. Together, ENH functions in LUAD cells to mediate macrophage infiltration and M2 polarization, which in turn promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth, and targeting ENH offers a promising target for antiangiogenic therapy through immune modulation.},

  abstract     = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive nature and limited response to immunotherapy. This study identifies lactate-induced histone lactylation as a novel epigenetic mechanism in SCLC, contributing to immune escape and poor therapeutic outcomes. By identifying the LDH-H3K18La-Nur77 axis, new insights into the metabolic regulation of immune responses in SCLC are offered. Multi-omics analysis, including metabolomics and TCR sequencing, is used to compare serum samples and immune cell profiles from SCLC patients. Data from Shanzhong cohort (n = 222), along with a validation cohort from the IMpower133 study (n = 264), demonstrates that LDH levels are associated with poorer outcomes following immunotherapy. ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays reveal that lactate-induced histone lactylation at H3K18La induces transcriptional activation of Nur77 in naïve CD8 + T cells, leading to tonic TCR signaling, which impairs antigen recognition and prevents effective anti-tumor activity. In preclinical SCLC models, lactate inhibition reduces Nur77 expression, restores T cell function, and enhances the efficacy of PD-1 blockade, leading to a decreased tumor burden and improved survival. This study uncovers a novel mechanism of immune escape in SCLC through lactate-driven histone lactylation and provides the first evidence that targeting lactate metabolism can enhance immunotherapy effectiveness.},

However, the factors that trigger the abnormal activation of fibroblasts in PF are still not well understood. Using proteomics and single-cell sequencing dataset screening, extra accumulation of Cathepsin K (CTSK) is detected in the periphery as well as in fibroblasts in the lungs of PF mouse models. Addition of recombinant CTSK (rCTSK) aggravates collagen accumulation and PF progression in bleomycin-induced PF mice. Mechanically, CTSK underwent endocytosis through interaction with sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), which is engaged in TGF-β1 induced SMAD3 activation for downstream glutaminase 1 (GLS1) upregulation and glutamine enrichment. In turn, extra glutamine increases collagen synthesis in fibroblasts. More significantly, serum CTSK levels positively correlated with glutamine levels and poor prognosis in patients with PF. Thus, the results identify CTSK as a novel regulator of fibroblast activation that remodels glutamine metabolism and promotes collagen synthesis during PF pathogenesis. The correlation between peripheral CTSK and glutamine levels implies its future feasibility in the prediction and prevention of PF progression.},

Here, we present DECENT ( de ep c opy number variation (CNV) r e co n s t ruction), a deep learning method to reconstruct embryonic CNVs and mitigate maternal contamination in SECM from single-cell methylation sequencing of cfDNA. DECENT integrates sequence features and methylation patterns by combining convolution modules, long-short memory, and attention mechanisms to infer the origin of cfDNA reads. The benchmarking study demonstrated DECENT's ability to estimate contamination proportions and restore embryonic chromosome aneuploidies in samples with varying contamination levels. In contaminated SECM clinical samples, including one with more than 80% maternal reads, DECENT achieved consistent CNV recovery with invasive tests. Overall, DECENT contributes to enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness of cfDNA-based noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing, establishing a robust groundwork for its extensive clinical utilization in the field of reproductive medicine.},

However, compact and robust water-immersed photonic devices remain challenging to realize. Among various approaches, dielectric metasurfaces are particularly promising for underwater optics due to their flat form factor and subwavelength phase control. Nevertheless, current platforms suffer from instability in liquids, incomplete phase modulation, or strong sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Here, ultrathin water-immersed metasurfaces composed of gallium phosphide (GaP) Huygens’ integrated resonance units (HIRUs) operating in the visible regime are demonstrated. By leveraging the high refractive index and low optical loss of GaP, and integrating both forward and inverse design strategies, metasurfaces with planar geometry (≈1/5 of the operating wavelength), enhanced fabrication tolerance, and stable in-liquid operation are realized. These metasurfaces generate various structured light beams in water, including abruptly autofocusing (AAF) beams, Bessel beams, optical vortices, and Gaussian focusing beams.

This study investigated the role of CD248 in regulating TSPC stemness and assessed the therapeutic potential of si-CD248-loaded liposomes in promoting tendon-bone healing under osteoporotic conditions. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified increased TSPC populations, particularly a unique subcluster, TSPC-0, with elevated CD248 expression in osteoporotic tendon samples.

In osteoporotic mice, liposome treatment significantly enhanced tissue regeneration, improving histological scores, collagen organization, and biomechanical properties. This study reveals that elevated CD248 expression negatively impacts TSPC stemness and impairs healing under osteoporotic conditions.

  abstract     = {Porcine extended potential stem cells (pEPSCs), which exhibit both self-renewal and pluripotency, are promising for application in both agricultural biotechnology and regenerative medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these two interconnected properties remain elusive. Here, two types of CRISPR-Cas9 screenings are conducted in pEPSCs. This fitness screening identified several genes essential for cell viability, including PRMT1 , MYBL2 , and NASP . Concurrently, FACS-based screenings revealed genes crucial for pluripotency, such as SOX2 , ZFP42 , and FOXH1 . Notably, it is demonstrated that FOXH1 is required for maintaining pluripotency in pEPSCs, which complements the understanding of its role in mesendoderm specification. pEPSCs lacking FOXH1 exhibited a flatter and more dispersed clonal morphology, accompanied by downregulation of pluripotency genes and upregulation of lineage-specific genes. Additionally, FOXH1 knockdown significantly impaired blastocyst formation during early pig embryogenesis. Functionally, the dual role of FOXH1 in pluripotency maintenance and cell differentiation is validated: FOXH1 preserves pluripotency by enhancing chromatin accessibility at pluripotency gene loci, while also influencing lineage specification through H3K4me3 modification at developmental related genes. Thus, these findings uncover a novel role of FOXH1 involved in the core regulatory network that orchestrates gene expression programs to maintain the pluripotency state of pEPSCs and provide valuable insights into categorizing gene function.},

  abstract     = {Most patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) may initially experience high-frequency hearing loss linked to greater vulnerability of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlear basal turn. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this susceptibility in the high-frequency region remains unclear. Here, NOX2 is first identified as a differentially expressed gene related to oxidative damage in the apical and basal turns through single-cell RNA sequencing. In mouse cochleae damaged by neomycin and noise, Nox2-positive OHCs increase progressively from the apex to base, indicating that NOX2 expression clearly differed significantly between the apical and basal OHCs. In NOX2 knockout mice, OHC damage caused by neomycin and noise exposure is significantly reduced. Furthermore, knocking out NOX2 increases the expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and Nrf2 nuclear translocation in OHCs. In addition, Nrf2 inhibitors counteract the protective effect of NOX2 knockout against neomycin. Finally, when Nox2 is used as the target, ginsenoside Rg1 is identified as a compound with protective effects against neomycin-induced hearing loss. In summary, these results indicate NOX2 is highly correlated with high-frequency OHCs vulnerability in the cochlea and is a potential intervention target for the clinical treatment of SNHL.},

However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially shows that plating starts at the interface between the electrode and the current collector where also a high degree of micropore filling and formation of pseudo-metallic sodium is found. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical reduction of nitrate for ammonia production not only offers a promising alternative to the traditional Haber–Bosch process, which requires high temperatures and pressures, but also provides an effective solution to the pollution caused by nitrogen-enriched nutrients in drinking water and soil. Nitrate reduction is a complex multielectron, multiproton reaction, leading to multiple reaction pathways and numerous by-products. Moreover, the product distribution and Faradaic efficiency are highly dependent on the applied potential, often resulting in competing reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, which increase energy consumption. Therefore, the development of low-cost, highly active, highly selective, and scalable electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction is critical to advancing this field. This review highlights recent advances in nitrate reduction electrocatalysis, focusing on catalyst design strategies, reaction environments, and performance evaluation. It also compiles and analyzes a wide range of research examples in the field, discusses current challenges, and offers perspectives on future research directions.

  abstract     = {Cobalt-free LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO) has recently emerged as a highly promising cathode material owing to its benefits of a high operating voltage platform (≈4.7 V vs Li), high theoretical energy density (≈650 Wh kg −1 ), eco-friendliness, and resource abundance. However, it has also demonstrated low cycle and poor rate performances. Researchers have hitherto identified multiple LNMO failure and degradation mechanisms, including the Jahn-Teller effect, Transition Metal (TM) dissolution, electrolyte decomposition, and Oxygen Vacancies (OVs). The Jahn-Teller effect causes structural material degradation, while TM dissolution could lead to the loss of reactive species and interfacial side reactions. On the other hand, OVs and electrolyte decomposition accelerate capacity decay. Notably, deeply understanding LNMO structural failure mechanisms and the targeting of corresponding modifications presents a vital avenue for modulating its surface-interface structure and improving its electrochemical performance. Although researchers have extensively investigated the failure mechanisms of LNMO to elucidate its modification strategies, a comprehensive and detailed summary of the latest research advancements has yet to be provided. In this work, the research background, encompassing the advantages and disadvantages of LNMO cathode materials, is first introduced. The crystal structure and discharge mechanisms, among other fundamental principles of LNMO, are subsequently analyzed. Finally, recent research findings on the aforementioned failure mechanisms in high-voltage spinel LNMO are synthesized. Subsequently, a critical assessment of recent advancements in modification strategies targeting the failure mechanisms of LNMO is performed, encompassing the tools employed (e.g., doping modification, surface coating, morphology and size management, and surface orientation management) as well as their synergistic effects. Finally, potential future research directions to guide the rational design of high-performance LNMO, particularly manganese-based spinel cathode material, are proposed.},

This review systematically summarizes recent progress in applying metamaterials to solar-driven processes for energy conversion and water treatment, including photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, water splitting for hydrogen generation, degradation of organic pollutants, and solar-driven water evaporation for purification. Key enhancement mechanisms include localized surface plasmon resonance, photonic bandgap engineering, and improved charge separation via metamaterial and semiconductor heterojunctions, which collectively improve light absorption, charge separation and transfer, and surface reactivity. Practical challenges related to scalable fabrication, long-term durability, and integration into real-world systems are also examined.

The fundamental properties and protective mechanisms of biomass-derived materials are systematically analyzed, focusing on four key functional groups: carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, and sulfonic acid. Through examining their roles in regulating critical interfacial processes, quantitative structure-function relationships are established that reveal optimal interface protection requires balanced binding energies rather than maximizing individual interactions.

Herein, a nano-electro-platform is shown that enables non-invasive screening of aggressive cell subpopulations from heterogeneous tumor samples. Single-cell sequencing further reveals immune evasion pathways associated with their aggressive behavior. Targeting the screened aggressive cells, the platform implements a unique nanopore-focused electric field, which genetically remodels the cells to generate extracellular vesicles (EVs) with significantly enhanced tumor-targeting and therapeutic capabilities.

These frequent complications of intraocular drug implants can be overcome using magnetically controllable degradable milliscale swimmers (MDMS) with a double-helix body morphology. A biodegradable hydrogel, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, is employed as the primary 3D printing material of MDMS, and it is magnetized by decorating it with biocompatible polydopamine-encapsulated iron-platinum nanoparticles. MDMS have comparable dimensions to commercial intraocular implants that achieve translational motions in both aqueous and vitreous bodies. They can be imaged in real-time using optical coherence tomography, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging. Thanks to their biodegradable hydrogel-based structure, they can be loaded with anti-inflammatory drug molecules and release the medications without disrupting retinal epithelial viability and barrier function, and decrease proinflammatory cytokine release significantly.

Mechanistically, Foxo6os directly interacts with myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3), which then recruits protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) to facilitate MYBPC3 phosphorylation, resulting in maintaining myocardial contractility and postponing HF progression. Therefore, these findings underscore the critical role of Foxo6os in preserving cardiomyocyte contractile function, suggesting a potential for Foxo6os as a novel therapeutic target of HF.},

  abstract     = {Flexible lithium metal batteries (LMBs) using polymer-based solid-state electrolytes (PSSEs) are highly desirable for wearable applications because of the potential advantages in energy density and safety. Recently, ether-based polyelectrolytes have received extensive attention because of their good stability, high ionic conductivity, and Li metal anode compatibility. However, it typically forms organic-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at the cathode, which is still a pain point that impedes the high-voltage performance. To address this challenge, herein a fluorinated plasticizer, bis(2-fluoroethyl) ether (BFE) is reported, which can be easily blended into ether-based PSSE and enables high-voltage-stable flexible LMBs. The BFE and PSSE molecules form an atypical hydrogen bond interaction, which weakens the interaction between PSSE and lithium ions. This leads to the formation of an anion-rich solvation structure that generates inorganic-rich and high-voltage-stable CEI. The oxidation stability of PSSE is improved from 4.4 V to over 4.7 V after introducing the BFE molecules. LMBs using BFE-blended PSSE can couple with high-voltage cathode and retain 80% capacity after 480 cycles at 1C. Full cells show high energy density (752.2 Wh L −1 ) outstanding capacity retention per cycle (99.88%), and high flexibility with almost identic charge/discharge characteristics after 4000 bending cycles.},

  abstract     = {Traditional biomaterial design often prioritizes empirical knowledge over disease mechanisms and pathological dynamics, resulting in imprecise solutions in complex clinical conditions. Age-related osteoporosis (A-OP) is a disease associated with aging, characterized by a dysfunctional pathological microenvironment that hinders the osseointegration of conventional titanium implants. To develop a targeted titanium implant for A-OP, rat single-cell transcriptomics is integrated with human serum-derived transcriptome data to investigate dynamic changes in skeletal stem cells (SSCs) during aging, which guided the implant design. These findings reveal that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within SSCs interact via a feedback loop: HSCs undergo premature senescence, leading to depletion of HSCs and secondary senescence of MSCs. Senescent MSCs exhibit adipogenic bias, perpetuating the pathological cycle of A-OP. Using core genes identified in the transcriptome analyses, resveratrol is selected and utilized it and a GelMA-chitosan hydrogel to decorate titanium implants for localized delivery. In the A-OP microenvironment, the hydrogel enables sustained responsive release of resveratrol, which reverses MSC senescence and redirects differentiation from adipogenic to osteogenic lineages, thereby breaking the pathological cycle. This multi-omics-driven implant design enhances precision and offers a novel methodology for biomaterial development.},

  abstract     = {Superelastic aerogels with ultralow thermal conductivity have essential advantages for advanced thermal management systems in energy-efficient buildings. However, inorganic aerogels suffer from brittleness and poor processability, whereas their organic counterparts experience high production costs and inadequate elastic recovery. This study used a dual-template (ice and bubble) strategy to fabricate ultralight, superelastic aerogels with hierarchical porosity inspired by stress-dissipating dome architectures. Microbubbles are engineered via a modified “Tessari method” to create macropores (≈100 µm) while ice-templating introduced aligned pores of a few µm in size during freeze-drying. The synergistic interplay of a rigid gelatine (Ge) skeleton, flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nodes, and potassium salt-enhanced crystalline domains yielded aerogels with exceptional elasticity, ultralow density and thermal conductivity. Flame retardancy is achieved through potassium salt-mediated catalytic carbonization, reducing the peak heat release rate by 54% and enabling self-extinguishing behavior. Microbubble introduction in precursors can provide macropores for aerogels, which dispersed internal stress during the deformation of aerogel, whereas dynamic hydrogen bonds enabled rapid water-assisted self-healing ability and closed-loop recyclability. Scalable production using commercial compressed air foaming systems and a low raw material cost further highlight its industrial viability. Combined with biodegradability and superior thermal insulation, this work advances sustainable, fire-safe aerogels for multifunctional applications.},

Here, a spatiotemporally and hierarchically-guided bone regeneration hydrogel with a Janus structure is engineered through a sequential photocuring protocol, which features full barrier protection by the outer dense phase and superior osteoconductivity within the inner loose phase. The Janus hydrogel exhibits stable spatiotemporal layering, adaptable degradation, asymmetrical combination of network structures, and mechanical strength. The dense phase, with space maintenance capacity, completely covers the defective area, continuously blocking fibroblast infiltration, and preventing bacterial adhesion. In addition, the loose phase is shape-adapted to the defective cavity, allowing osteoblast-associated cells to migrate and create a favorable osteogenic microenvironment. In situ implantation of this Janus hydrogel effectively promoted osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in both mouse calvarial and rat periodontal bone defect models. Furthermore, the osteogenic efficiency achieved by the Janus hydrogel implanted in mouse calvarial defects and rat periodontal defects is increased by 42% and 13.7%, respectively, as compared with previous studies. These findings thus demonstrated the synergy of protective barrier function, osteoconductive properties, and adaptive degradation within a single scaffold, which is conducive to bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary adaptation of skin repair drives sequential regenerative phases: epidermal proliferation rapidly restores barrier function, followed by dermal reconstruction through extracellular matrix remodeling to establish structural support, yet the molecular coordination of this spatiotemporal program remains unclear. While the endocrine system is crucial in modulating wound repair, the critical hormone receptors orchestrating tissue-layer-specific responses are unidentified. Here, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and in vivo/in vitro analyses in mouse models of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, as well as wound and skin organoid models, are employed to identify the thyroid hormone receptor Thra as a key regulator of phase-coupled regeneration through two distinct yet coordinated mechanisms. In the initial phase, epidermal Thra activates glutathione metabolism via Gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT), driving keratin filament assembly to accelerate reepithelialization. In the subsequent phase, dermal Thra mediates the Serum Amyloid A3 (SAA3)-Fibronectin 1 (FN1) interaction, establishing angiogenic niches essential for matrix maturation. Using the self-assembled epidermis-dermis dynamic skin organoid model, Thra's role in simulating the wound healing process is further confirmed. This study highlights the essential role of spatiotemporal adaptability in wound repair using Thra as a paradigm and provides insights for developing clinical strategies to enhance skin wound healing.},

However, considerable bystander editing significantly compromise its accuracy. Point mutagenesis, a powerful approach for gradient-tuning protein function, facilitates the generation of diverse plant phenotypes to meet the demands of complex environments and consumer preferences. Here, a series of plant base editors is engineered by fusing three optimized TadA8e variants, TadA9, TadA-LM, and TadA-dual, with a PAM-flexible SpRY nickase (SpRYn, with 5′-NNN PAM recognition). These editors enable A-to-G, C-to-T, and dual-base (simultaneous A-to-G and C-to-T) conversions within a highly condensed active window (1–3 nucleotides). Performance evaluations reveal that the TadDBE (TadA Dual-Base Editor) achieves the most robust outcomes, delivering dual-base editing efficiencies ranging from 2.3% to 61.4%, while maintaining minimal off-target activity. Utilizing TadDBE, targeted point mutagenesis is performed on OsBadh2 , a gene encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), a key aromatic compound. This approach yields rice lines exhibiting gradient-tuned aromatic profiles and optimized levels of 2-AP and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These evolved TadA-derived editors provide a precise, PAM-flexible platform for base editing and represent a versatile strategy for generating genome-edited plants with gradient-tuned agronomic traits.},

To date, the application of cyano group has predominantly been confined to end-group modification in SMAs, with limited investigation in central unit engineering. Herein, in this work, the role of cyano substitution is systematically investigated in the central unit of SMAs and design a novel cyano-functionalized wide-bandgap acceptor UF-BCN. The introduction of the cyano group significantly enhances the surface energy of the molecule and substantially deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level due to its strong electron-withdrawing capability, then leading to a blue-shifted absorption. When introduced as the third component in the D18:BTP-eC9, UF-BCN demonstrates complementary light absorption, strong intermolecular interactions, and excellent compatibility with BTP-eC9 to form a mixed acceptor phase, enabling it to function as an effective morphological modulator within the ternary system. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on D18:BTP-eC9:UF-BCN achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.34%. This study underscores the effectiveness of cyano substitution in central unit engineering and highlights its potential for optimizing active layer morphology and enhancing the performance of ternary OSCs.},

In this study, recent advances in understanding the formation and functions of plant peptide hormones, distinguishing between non-secretory and secretory peptides and their respective physiological roles are reviewed. These peptide hormones interact intricately with receptor kinases to regulate multiple signal transduction pathways. Plant peptide hormones are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation within both shoot apical and root apical meristems, as well as in the development of various organs. They also play a central role in plant reproduction, particularly in coordinating male-female gametophyte interactions for successful fertilization. Furthermore, plant peptide hormones contribute to abiotic stress responses and immune responses against biotic stresses. An overview of the multifaceted roles of plant peptide hormones in growth, development, and environmental adaptability, emphasizing their importance in plant biology are presented.

Thanks to the highly selective ECL probe L-012 to OOH*, the ECL signal evolution (e.g., onset ECL potential and maximal ECL intensity) is bridged with the generation and accumulation of OOH*, allowing for convenient and quick judgment to the rate-determining step of OER. Due to the spatial and temporal resolution of ECL microscopy, it is found that the phase I of Cu─TCNQ shows better catalytic activity. The COMSOL simulation also shows the heterogeneous current distribution during the OER reaction, in agreement with ECL imaging results. Finally, the ECL approach enables to compare the OER performance of three TM─TCNQ, well explaining the free energy profiles for different reaction intermediates. Therefore, the proposed ECL analysis and microscopy provide an alternative way to understand the detailed elemental steps in OER, thus further indicating the direction for high-performance catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Transition state (TS) search is crucial for illuminating chemical reaction mechanisms but remains the major bottleneck in automated discovery because of the high computational cost. Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and generative models have shown promise in accelerating TS search, but their comparative strengths and limitations remain unclear. In this study, the first systematic and rigorous benchmarking framework is established to evaluate the effectiveness of ML methods in TS search, enabling a standardized and application-relevant assessment of their performance. Using an end-to-end TS search workflow, seven representative MLIPs are benchmarked alongside React-OT, a state-of-the-art generative model. These results demonstrate that pre-trained foundation MLIPs frequently fall short in reliably localizing TSs without task-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, traditional energy and force metrics alone do not reliably predict TS search success, underscoring the need for more tailored evaluation criteria. Notably, with the same graph neural network architecture, React-OT frequently outperforms its MLIP counterpart, highlighting the potential of generative approaches for TS discovery. This benchmark serves as a critical foundation for the development and evaluation of future ML methods in chemical reactions, offering guidance for improving their generalizability and reliability in reactive chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics has provided a critical data foundation for the high-resolution characterization of tissue spatial domains. Traditional methods for spatial domain identification primarily rely on gene expression data from sampled spots in low-resolution spatial transcriptomic data, often overlooking valuable information between spots that can be crucial for domain identification. Furthermore, these methods are limited by their focus on gene expression data from neighboring spots, without fully integrating prior knowledge of cell types within the tissue's spatial structure. To address these challenges, SGCD, a novel method for tissue spatial domain identification based on data interpolation and cell type deconvolution is proposed. SGCD utilizes interpolation techniques to estimate gene expression data for cells in the gaps between spots and applies deconvolution to extract cell type information from both spots and interstitial regions. By integrating gene expression, cell type, and spatial location data, SGCD achieves accurate delineation of complex spatial domains through graph contrastive learning. Evaluations on various publicly available datasets, including the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, mouse brain, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer, demonstrate that SGCD significantly outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and detail, offering strong support for advancing the understanding of tissue functions and disease mechanisms.},

We developed an unsupervised radiomics-based subtyping system integrating multi-omics data to decode tumor biology and improve risk stratification. Analyzing five cohorts (n = 1700, including surgical cohorts and an advanced ccRCC cohort receiving combined tyrosine kinase inhibitor and immunotherapy [T-I] treatment), we extracted 1834 CT radiomic features, applying consensus clustering to a discovery cohort (n = 748) and validating across centers. Two subtypes emerged with distinct recurrence risks: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (adjusted HR = 2.75 for recurrence, 95% CI 1.42–5.33, P = 0.003). Cluster 2’s high recurrence risk was validated in three external cohorts (adjusted HRs: 1.76, 4.33, and 3.09; all P < 0.05). Radiogenomic analysis revealed Cluster 2 showed a higher frequency of VHL mutations and KDM5C mutations compared to Cluster 1, a more immunosuppressive microenvironment (reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, P < 0.01; suppressed interferon signaling pathways, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis P < 0.05), and lower PD-L1 expression. In the T-I treated advanced ccRCC cohort, Cluster 2 patients had shorter overall survival. This first unsupervised radiomic system stratifies ccRCC by recurrence risk, molecular drivers, and treatment efficacy, offering a framework for precision oncology.},

However, traditional heat management approaches, such as photothermal devices and radiative coolers, often face application limitations due to their complex construction, aesthetic constraints, and inability to adapt to diverse architectural requirements. This study proposes a colored thermal engineering glass fabricated through a simple annealing process, where Ag nanoparticles are formed on a TiO 2 film and an Ag layer. The structure of Ag layers can be easily controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature, allowing for systematic tuning of the optical efficiencies in the visible and long-wave infrared regions. Consequently, thermal management devices can selectively function as either a photothermal heater or a radiative cooler, depending on the morphology of Ag layers. In particular, the photothermal device can function as an anti-fogging solution for structural designs without requiring external energy. Furthermore, the stacked metal-insulator-metal structure induces plasmonic resonance phenomena, producing visible colors that range from vivid to dull hues. The tunable color variations enhance the suitability of the thermal management device for a wide range of architectural applications.},

Here, a generalizable strategy is introduced that leverages facile anion-lattice doping in high entropy materials to modulate the bandgap in high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs). By incorporating nitrogen into a single-phase high-entropy metal oxide/nitride (HEMO:HEMN) solid solution, a substantial bandgap reduction is achieved from 3.55 eV (HEMO) to ≈2.46 eV (HEMO:HEMN), significantly enhancing electronic conductivity. Unlike conventional bandgap tuning approaches that rely on cation substitution or heterojunction formation, this method exploits anion-mediated entropy stabilization, enabling uniform bandgap narrowing across the entire solid solution. This anion-lattice engineering strategy is broadly applicable to high-entropy systems, providing a new pathway for designing energy materials with tailored electronic properties. The resulting HEMO:HEMN solid solution exhibits a tenfold increase in capacitance and capacity compared to HEMO in supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery tests, demonstrating the transformative potential of anion-driven bandgap modulation for next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.},

CA-mimetic SAzymes with Zn–N 4 active sites in tetrahedral, distorted tetrahedral, and square-planar configurations are prepared by simple temperature-controlled carbonization of ZIF-8. The SAzyme with the distorted tetrahedral Zn–N 4 configuration displays superior catalytic CO 2 hydration activity, attributed to increased Lewis acidity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a pronounced Zn–OH affinity and localized electron accumulation at the distorted tetrahedral Zn site. These results demonstrate the critical role of precise geometric tuning in enhancing SAzyme efficacy and can be used to facilitate potential avenues for optimizing metal active centers in enzyme mimetics.},

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), consisting of DNAs and proteins released by neutrophils in response to infection, are major pathogenesis factors for pathogen-associated pulmonary fibrosis. By mimicking nucleic acid hydrolase, polymeric artificial DNases bearing imidazole units (PEG-PIm) are developed to degrade the DNAs and thus deconstruct NETs, inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis. By tailoring the PIm segments with varied imidazole units, the polymer hydrolase with a defined number of imidazole units outperforms other samples in the cleavage of DNAs and inhibits the transition of pulmonary fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. This polymer digests the DNAs complexed with cationic peptides, unlike natural DNase I. By aerosol inhalation, it reduces NET infiltration in lungs and significantly alleviates inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the optimized polymer may expose more effective imidazole units to the DNA backbones and thus enhance the affinity and hydrolysis of phosphodiester linkages. The function is also confirmed by systematic administration of PEG-PIm to rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, a strategy is provided for treating pulmonary fibrosis that can be applied in a pandemic to reduce high mortality because of pathogen infection.},

Herein, for the first time a novel photoresponsive nanozyme sensor array is presented that integrates metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and machine learning algorithms for the rapid, sensitive, and multiplexed detection of neurotransmitters.

Additionally, light-driven catalysis greatly accelerates the response speed of the nanozyme. Mimicking the mammalian olfactory system, the array responds to various neurotransmitters in a patterned manner, enabling accurate differentiation and quantification within minutes. It maintains high precision even in complex biological samples such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The biomimetic sensor can detect neurotransmitter signatures linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Here, a bidirectional phase separation spinning technique is introduced for continuous and rapid production (360 m h −1 ) of aerogel fibers at any desired length. Importantly, fibers can be directly dried at room temperature, eliminating the need for energy-intensive freeze-drying or other additional steps, significantly reducing energy consumption and processing time. Aerogel fibers produced using this method exhibit remarkable properties: low density (0.18 g cm − 3 ), high porosity (84%), and broad operational temperature range (−20 to 120 °C). Notably, the thermal insulation mat composed of these aerogel fibers achieves an exceptionally low thermal conductivity (31 ± 1.2 mW/(mK)). This work provides a novel strategy for the preparation of aerogel fibers, achieving energy savings and efficiency, positioning aerogel fibers as a promising alternative for next-generation textiles.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry-breaking nature of Janus materials enables the design of multifunctional compounds with distinct properties that are inaccessible to traditional materials. However, the limited availability of intrinsically stable Janus materials hinders a complete understanding of their full potential. Here, the first millimeter-sized Janus material, RhSeCl, is successfully synthesized through the precisely controlled chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the Janus character of RhSeCl, emphasizing its strong correlation with steric hindrance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses demonstrate the highly unusual oxidation states of Rh and Se, underlining their critical role in determining the formation of the inherent Janus structure. Interestingly, a clear second-harmonic generation (SHG) is observed in RhSeCl, weakening with the temperature. DFT calculations attribut the strong SHG response to the band nesting effect, with an intensity modulated by the temperature-dependent interlayer coupling. Notably, its damage threshold surpassed that of Janus MoSSe. Furthermore, devices based on RhSeCl exhibit promising optoelectronic performance at the visible wavelength range of 405–650 nm, showing a great opportunity for solar applications. These findings deepen the understanding of inherent Janus structures, paving the way for the development of new Janus compounds with versatile functionalities in advanced materials.},

It can dynamically modulate functional electrical stimulation based on muscle force signals, enabling continuous execution of wrist movements for stroke patients. The system markedly improves patient mobility, with wrist lifting angles increased from 14° to 47°, and lifting speed nearly doubled. Clinical trials confirm the system's superior efficacy in promoting motor recovery and reducing muscle spasms. Moreover, functional near-infrared spectroscopy highlights enhanced brain activity and promotes reconstruction of damaged neural pathways during LMMRE-FES therapy compared with the conventional electrical stimulation.

  abstract     = {Recent studies indicate a therapeutic potential of increased brain endocannabinoids (eCBs) in anxiety disorders, but the underlying brain circuits are still elusive. Here, it is observed that optogenetic inhibition and activation of anterior basolateral amygdala (aBLA) - ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections respectively decrease and increase anxiety avoidance behaviors. Then, the contributions of eCBs in aBLA–vHPC projections to anxiety avoidance are investigated by employing three newly developed synapse- and circuit-specific eCB-targeted viral strategies to achieve real-time monitoring of eCB release, in vivo optogenetic activation of CB1 receptors, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes. Prominent eCB release are surprisingly found at aBLA–vHPC glutamatergic synapses during anxiety avoidance, suggesting inhibitory effects of increased eCBs in aBLA–vHPC projections on anxiety avoidance. This idea is further supported by findings that specific activation of CB1 receptors at aBLA–vHPC synapses inhibit presynaptic glutamate release and reduce anxiety avoidance. In contrast, specific knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes at aBLA–vHPC synapses reduce eCB levels at aBLA–vHPC glutamatergic synapses and increase anxiety avoidance. Additionally, inhibition of aBLA-innervated vHPC glutamatergic neurons alleviates anxiety avoidance. Together, these findings reveal counteracting effects of increased eCB signaling in aBLA–vHPC circuits on anxiety avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, is implicated in various diseases, but effective therapeutic strategies remain limited. Lysosomal impairments cause iron dysregulation and initiate ferroptosis, which potentially contribute to ionizing radiation-induced tissue damages. Here, the role of intercellular lysosomal regulation in governing iron homeostasis and protecting against ferroptosis is investigated in models of stem cell aggregation and mandibular regeneration post-irradiation. Lysosomes are discovered to accumulate in specific regions within multi-stem cell aggregates and regulate cell aggregate formation based on iron control, which is occurred through hypoxic signaling-driven lysosomal redistribution mediated by extracellular vesicles. These vesicles exhibit lysosomal features and possess iron-regulating properties, which rescue lysosomal defects to restore iron homeostasis and mitigate ferroptosis in recipient endothelial cells against the irradiation challenge. Based on lysosomal regulation and anti-ferroptosis, these cell aggregate-released extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs) stimulate the growth of CD31 + endomucin + specialized vessels despite irradiation both in vitro and in vivo, which further promote bone regeneration of post-irradiation mandibular defect. These findings highlight the potential of taking CA-EVs as natural therapeutic agents to safeguard lysosomal function, modulate iron metabolism, and protect against ferroptosis, paving an avenue for combating post-irradiation endothelial injuries and enhancing tissue regeneration.},

Here, a facile approach is developed for fabricating large-scale continuous in-plane charged domain walls in Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO 3 ferroelectric films through thermally optimized growth control. Using Differential Phase Contrast Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy, an electric field fluctuation is identified across the charged domain wall. This fluctuation is accompanied by oxygen octahedron distortions, which allow the lattice to redistribute charges, as confirmed by integrated Differential Phase Contrast analyses. Additionally, Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy reveals variations in titanium oxidation states across the domain wall, which compensates for the charge accumulation and enhances the stability of the charged domain wall. This work presents a wafer-scale fabrication strategy for in-plane charged domain walls and provides atomic-scale insights into their stabilization mechanisms, offering a foundation for their integration into domain-wall-based nanodevices and on-chip applications.},

Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative hybrid system that integrates PTC film, thermoelectric generator (TEG), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). Through synergetic effects, the system combines the heating-catalysis-cooling effect of the PTC film with the moisture-induced adsorption/desorption heat of the MOFs, achieving year-round power generation, dehumidification, and air purification. Results show that Mn 7 Co 3 Ce 1 O x has a full-spectrum solar absorptivity of 94.3% and an atmospheric window emissivity of 95.7%. Under infrared light, the pollutant removal rate on the photothermal catalytic interface reaches 90.9%.

Traditional methods like ICP-OES are accurate but costly and complex. Therefore, this study proposes a new method based on lens-free digital holography (LDH) to detect and distinguish metal impurities in lead-acid battery electrolytes. The study uses a compact setup with a green LED light source and a CMOS camera to capture holographic images of impurities. The technique reconstructs clear particle images using angular spectrum algorithms and analyzes their reconstruction distances and gray-scale differences for identification. Results show that copper particles have a reconstruction distance of 1406.4 µm and a total gray-scale difference of 4.4681; tin particles have a reconstruction distance of 1414.85 µm and a total gray-scale difference of 0.5344; iron hydroxide has a reconstruction distance of 1647.85 µm and the total gray-scale difference of 13.5789. By combining these parameters, the method effectively distinguishes between copper, tin, and iron particles, even in mixed solutions.

  abstract     = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that overcoming these barriers requires a dual approach: inducing immunogenic tumor cell death (ICD) and enhancing the cancer immunity cycle by exogenous neoantigen targeting on the spleen. In this study, a novel strategy is presented combining irinotecan-loaded silicasomes with spleen-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying KRAS G12D mRNA and the toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist 3M-052. The goal is to establish a cancer immunity cycle by promoting endogenous tumor antigen release by the generation of KRAS-specific cytotoxic T cells. Using an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, it is demonstrated that this dual-platform approach significantly reduces tumor burden and extends survival compared to monotherapies. Bulk RNA sequencing and gene expression analyses further reveal synergy between the immune responses at the primary tumor site and the spleen, including maximal upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, antigen presentation pathways, and T cell activation markers. These findings indicate that the combinatorial strategy effectively bridges innate and adaptive immunity. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of nanocarrier-based immunotherapy to enhance PDAC immunity by integrating ICD induction with systemic immune reprogramming, offering a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory programmed cell death (PCD) that is causally linked to antitumor immune responses, but the therapeutic potential of pyroptosis has been limited by the lack of tumor-specific and controllable inducers. Here, it is reported that tumor-specific pyroptosis can be spatiotemporally triggered via near-infrared light (NIR-pyroptosis) by using an antibody-bound indocyanine green (ICG), a clinically approved and nontoxic fluorescent dye. Mechanistically, the key molecular steps are identified by which antibody-bound ICG generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) within lysosomes after internalization, leading to lysosomal membrane damage and the cytosolic release of cathepsin S (CTSS), which cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, and IL-1β independently of caspase-1, and thereby induces pyroptosis, while other cathepsin family members fail to cleave GSDMD. Functionally, in both ICAM1+ and HER2+ solid tumors, antibody-bound ICG-mediated NIR-pyroptosis triggers potent and durable antitumor immune responses through the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, NIR-pyroptosis synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy by activating adaptive immune cells via upregulated IFN-γ secretion. The findings identify CTSS as a novel enzyme for GSDMD cleavage and establish NIR-pyroptosis as a non-apoptotic anticancer modality, providing a promising opportunity to overcome apoptosis resistance in current cancer therapies.},

A significant challenge persists in designing coupled nanoassemblies with precisely controlled nanostructures to systematically investigate chirality enhancement. Departing from conventional approaches that incorporate chiral molecules, we present the co-assembly of achiral and chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into AB n -type nanoclustersand the correlation between inherent plasmonic chirality and the quantity of hotspots. Complementary polymer-grafted achiral nanospheres and chiral nano arrows assemble into stable AB n clusters through a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The coordination number ( n ) of AB n can be tuned from 2 to 7 by adjusting polymer configurations through modulation of solution pH. The g -factor of AB n exhibits a linear increase with the n value of AB n . Simulation results indicate that the enhanced optical chirality arises from the increase in electric field strength due to the increasing number of hotspots within the NP assemblies.},

  abstract     = {The global proliferation of high-value commodities has the intensified demand for advanced anti-counterfeiting solutions. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) present a viable authentication mechanism, yet existing implementations exhibit three critical limitations: suboptimal authentication accuracy, insufficient multi-level security architecture, and dependence on costly and specialized equipment for verification. To address these issues, this work utilizes colloidal photonic crystals to fabricate PUF anti-counterfeiting patterns spanning from the macro-to-micro scale. These patterns are integrated with the iris recognition algorithm to construct a multi-layered optical anti-counterfeiting system based on the structural color iris. This work experimentally and computationally demonstrates that the “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystals originate from the “coffee ring” effect. By modulating the “coffee ring” effect, the size of the colloidal photonic crystal iris patterns can be controlled, enabling switching between “Ring”-type and “Dot”-type colloidal photonic crystals. Furthermore, multiple characteristic parameters confirm that the PUF codes derived from encoded “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystal images exhibit uniqueness and readability. Finally, a multi-layered anti-counterfeiting system is constructed, comprising three components: structural color patterns, embedded “Morse codes” formed by “Ring”-type and “Dot”-type colloidal photonic crystals, and optical PUF labels based on the “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystals. This cost-effective system enables low-threshold, high-performance structural color anti-counterfeiting for premium products.},

  abstract     = {Originating from spin and orbital motion, van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetism has emerged as a significant platform to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions, including quantum computing, sensing, and data storage. However, currently, available vdW ferromagnetic materials can be achieved with mechanical exfoliation and low-temperature operation, which completely limits the monolithic integration of vdW ferromagnets with other functional materials. Nonetheless, the direct synthesis of room-temperature vdW ferromagnets has not been achieved commercially, owing to the imprecise control of the layer-by-layer growth, high-temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, herein, an artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform has been reported, which activates the nano-crystallization and its corresponding ferromagnetism in bulk VSe 2 via Ar + H 2 S plasma sulfurization. Sweeping the magnetic field, vdW ferromagnetism has been spatially resolved, which experimentally correlates with magnetization reversal behavior and domain pinning effects. Furthermore, nano-crystallization of VSe 2 is clearly validated with transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and selected area diffraction analysis. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform can artificially inject the ferromagnetism in bulk vdW VSe 2 , which has not been possible previously.},

  abstract     = {The development of bladder cancer is a complex, multistep process influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, but its exact etiology remains unclear. Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysregulation can impact the initiation and progression of cancers, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. This study observes that the beneficial gut bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis ( P. distasonis ) is significantly decreased in bladder cancer patients, and its low abundance is strongly associated with poor prognosis. P. distasonis is a next-generation probiotic which plays a vital role in human health. Furthermore, this work finds that P. distasonis culture medium inhibits metastasis and proliferation of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies that indole-3-acetic acid (3-IAA) produced by P. distasonis exerting similar tumor-suppressive effects. Mechanistically, 3-IAA activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which in turn downregulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) transcription in bladder cancer cells. Notably, the reduction of FASN expression decreases the ratio of MUFAs to PUFAs, thereby increasing ferroptosis sensitivity in bladder cancer cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that P. distasonis -derived 3-IAA can inhibit bladder cancer metastasis and proliferation, highlighting the AhR-FASN axis as a promising therapeutic target to inhibit bladder cancer progression.},

This challenge is addressed through a surface nanoarchitectonics strategy, constructing 2D mesochannel polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide heterostructures (mPPy/rGO) with ordered 1D mesochannels (~8 nm) parallel to the graphene surface. By confining the self-assembly of cylindrical polymer brushes on freestanding rGO substrates, directional ion highways are simultaneously engineered that significantly reduce transport tortuosity. In addition, corrosion-resistant polymer interfaces block oxygen penetration, and strong interfacial interactions between PPy and rGO ensure efficient electron transfer. The mPPy/rGO-based CDI cell achieves breakthrough performance: ultrahigh SAC of 84.1 mg g −1 (4.5× activated carbon, the salt concentration: 2 g L −1 ), and 96.8% capacity retention over 100 cycles in air-equilibrated saline solution (the salt concentration: 500 mg L −1 ).

  abstract     = {Although the intestinal clock (the circadian timing system in the gastrointestinal tract) is known to direct a wide variety of diurnal nutrients and metabolites, its role in the functioning of extra-intestinal tissues such as the brain remains elusive. Here the role of the intestinal clock in shaping cognitive function is investigated. It is found that Bmal1 -iKO mice (mice with Bmal1 [ Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 ] specifically knocked out in the intestine, a mouse line deficient in intestinal clock function) show a defect in cognitive memory irrespective of the time-of-day. Bmal1 -iKO-associated cognitive decline is attributed to impaired adenosine signaling and compromised long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Adenosine signaling promotes LTP via enhancing BDNF expression and inhibiting synapse loss. Furthermore, the impairment in adenosine signaling is accounted for by the reductions in intestinal absorption of and hippocampal level of adenosine but not by a change in adenosine receptors. Consistently, adenosine supplementation rescues cognitive deficits associated with the malfunction of the intestinal clock. Moreover, BMAL1 regulates the expression of ADK (adenosine kinase, a primary enzyme for adenosine clearance) in the small intestine and thus promotes intestinal adenosine absorption through REV-ERBα which binds directly to Adk P2 promoter to inhibit its transcription. Together, an unsuspected role of the intestinal clock in controlling cognitive memory is identified, highlighting the intestinal clock as a promising target for the management of cognitive disorders.},

This work describes mechanochromic CLCE symmetric hollow fibers with excellent radial helix alignment prepared by solvent evaporation-induced assembly and template assistance. The cylindrical symmetry renders the response identical in all directions perpendicular to the fiber axis. The hollow fibers show mechanochromic ability in the full visible spectrum, a large wavelength blueshift of 2.25 nm·% −1 under low strain. Excellent mechanochromic reversibility of 100 cycles and resilience are both devoted by cross-linking structure in the wall layer, which also contributes to reversible orientation-recovery of liquid crystal units during stretching-recovery cycles. Numerical models and experimental measurements demonstrate the hollow structure enabled fibers to produce air pressure inside when being stretched, and the fiber wall layer is subjected to greater stress compared to solid fibers, thus achieving high mechanochromic sensitivity. In addition, hollow fiber can still change color when subjected to the expansion stress inside the cavity, and programmable information display in fabric prolongs its application in intelligent textiles.},

For this, neutrophil-specific fluorine nanoparticles additionally equipped with either activating or inhibiting peptides for a background-free 19 F MRI-based theranostic approach are engineered. It is demonstrated that with this i) distinct effector functions can be specifically modulated in both murine and human neutrophils, ii) the disease-specific degree of neutrophil infiltration can be non-invasively monitored in vivo, and in turn iii) neutrophil effector functions can either be attenuated during a pharmacological challenge or amplified to ameliorate tissue damage during bacteria-driven acute colitis.

This study unveils a novel NF separation strategy based on the often-overlooked phenomenon of solute self-assembly. Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, a direct link between monophenol self-assembly and rejection behavior during NF is established. The self-assembly of monophenols, primarily driven by π–π stacking interactions, is shown to significantly influence their rejection rates, with larger, more numerous self-assemblies experiencing higher rejection. Furthermore, a clear relationship between monophenol structures and self-assembly strength is established, revealing that the number and Hydrogen (H)-bonding capacity of substituents on the aromatic ring dictate the propensity for self-assembly. This insight enables the development of a predictive model for monophenol self-assembly, which is validated through NF experiments using binary mixtures, confirming that predictable differences in self-assembly behavior can be leveraged for selective separation. This study establishes solute self-assembly as a tunable parameter for enhancing NF separation of similarly sized molecules.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cell-intrinsic features (e.g., genetic aberrations and dysregulation of signaling pathways) play pivotal roles in orchestrating the composition and functional state of the immune landscape, which in turn impact tumor progression and response to immunotherapy. Here, it is discovered that dysregulation of cancer cell-intrinsic SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) leads to the orchestration of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and the impairment of responses to PD-1 blockade by reprogramming the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). SMYD3 cooperates with Sp1 to transcriptionally promote sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) expression by modifying H3-K4 di-/trimethylation and consequently activating the transcription of CD47. CD47, a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, acts as the downstream effector molecule of the SMYD3 signal to promote the infiltration of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, protecting renal cancer cells from immune attack. In summary, the critical role of the cancer cell-intrinsic SMYD3-SREBP1-CD47 axis is elucidated in regulating the immune microenvironment in ccRCC and provides a potential therapeutic strategy to manipulate the tumor immune milieu in favor of antitumor immunity.},

The inflammatory microenvironment promotes ECM degradation, further exacerbating the vicious cycle of nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration. This study introduces the mRNA encoding a novel therapeutic transcription factor, Brachyury (Bry), into nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) using an injectable microsphere system composed of biomimetic GelMA/Fucoidan (FU) dual-component hydrogel (GF) and surface chemically grafted lipid nanoparticles (LNP) (BLNP@GF). The study aims to alleviate inflammatory response in the NP while restoring the ECM secretion function of NPCs and enhancing the ability of NPCs to withstand inflammatory stress, thereby restoring physiological balance in the NP microenvironment. The GF microspheres demonstrate injectability and porosity, facilitating efficient LNP loading through chemical grafting. In the LPS-simulated inflammatory microenvironment, sustained release of FU significantly reduces inflammatory activity in NPCs.

  abstract     = {The catalytic conversion of CO 2 into high-value C 2+ products offers a sustainable path toward carbon neutrality. However, traditional photocatalytic and thermal catalytic methods face challenges like low selectivity and yields. Herein, a novel Cu/MoS 2 photothermal catalyst is synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method, anchoring single-atom Cu on layered MoS 2 for CO 2 and H 2 O reduction into C 2 products (ethanol, acetylene, and ethane). Under optimal conditions (250 °C, 903 mW·cm −2 , 320–780 nm), the Cu 5% –MoS 2 catalyst achieves an ethanol yield of 3.1 mmol·g −1 ·h −1 , 4.6 times higher than blank MoS 2 . Mechanistic studies reveal that Cu improves light absorption and enhances CO 2 adsorption and *COOH accumulation at MoS 2 edge S sites, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mo–Cu dual sites stabilize *CHO intermediates, boosting C 2 product selectivity. The synergistic photothermal effect accelerates charge migration and surface reactions. This work provides cost-effective insights into photothermal CO 2 conversion for fuel production.},

However, clinical trials with cGAS-STING pathway agonists have faced setbacks thanks to their short biological half-life, lack of tumor specificity, and potential to promote tumor immune evasion. To address these challenges, a novel exosome-based drug delivery platform, termed cmExo aCD11b is developed, designed to precisely target and reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) in situ for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy. cmExo aCD11b is engineered to encapsulate high copy numbers of IL-12 mRNA and 2′3’-cGAMP (cGAMP) and is functionalized with CD11b antibodies for targeted delivery to macrophages. Notably, cmExo aCD11b facilitated the repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, thereby reprogramming the TME and enhancing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This immunomodulatory effect reversed the immunosuppressive milieu of the TME and significantly inhibited tumor progression. More importantly, cmExo aCD11b exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy in both murine pancreatic cancer and patient-derived xenograft models. These results suggest that cmExo aCD11b represents a promising approach for overcoming immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer, paving the way for its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.},

However, this intermediate state is recalcitrant to detailed structural investigation, as it is only transiently and sparsely populated. Here, this work investigates the intermediate state of an amyloid-forming human lysozyme variant (I59T) using CEST and CPMG RD NMR at low pH. 15 N CEST profiles probe the thermal unfolding of the native state into the denatured ensemble and reveal a distinct intermediate state. Global fitting of 15 N CEST and CPMG data provides kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, characterizing the intermediate state populated at 0.6%. 1 H CEST data further confirm the presence of the intermediate state displaying unusually high or low 1 H N chemical shifts. To investigate the structural details of this intermediate state, this work uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which recapitulate the experimentally observed folding pathway and free energy landscape. This work observes a high-energy intermediate state with a locally disordered β-domain and C-helix, stabilized by non-native hydrogen bonding and amide-π interactions, accounting for its anomalous 1 H chemical shifts. Together, these NMR and MD data provide the first direct structural information on the intermediate state, offering insights into targeting lysozyme amyloidosis.},

Herein, the hard carbon grafted by caffeic acid is developed via a surface reconstruction strategy, in which rich C═O moieties are introduced. Varied characterizations reveal that the existing C═O exhibits stronger adsorption energy on salt (PF 6 − ) than solvent (e.g., EC and DEC), thus accelerating salt decomposition to produce a stable inorganic SEI layer. Besides, C═O moieties can also adsorb K-ions reversibly, accounting for a high capacitive contribution. Benefiting from the double merits of C═O moieties, the interfacial stability and surface properties of the optimized sample are greatly improved, and as a result, the reversible capacity can reach 462.7 mAh g −1 (0.1 A g −1 over 50 cycles) and rate performance is quite superior as well (321.8 mAh g −1 at 2 A g −1 ). Besides, a prolonged cycle life of over 2000 cycles is smoothly realized at 2 A g −1 in ester-based electrolytes.

Therefore, there is a need for a multimodal wearable platform that can capture diverse exercise-related metrics. Here, a wireless soft athlete bioelectronic system is presented that monitors various physiological signals and metabolites during exercise. This system includes a smart-sensing lip guard that detects ventilated carbon dioxide, osmolality, environmental conditions, and humidity—key indicators of the metabolites expelled from the nose and mouth. Additionally, the cardiac patch complements the lip guard by monitoring multiple signals, such as electrocardiograms, heart rates, temperature, and motion. This integrated system is capable of detecting exercise-induced conditions such as dehydration, hyperventilation, and abnormal heart signals. By combining data from both physiological and environmental factors, the wearable device offers a comprehensive assessment of how external conditions influence an athlete's performance. Evaluating the device with human subjects under varying temperature conditions demonstrates its effectiveness in observing exercise performance, regardless of environmental factors, highlighting its significant potential for enhancing athlete healthcare and performance monitoring.},

However, aberrant activation of MDA5 by viral infections or gain-of-function mutations leads to severe autoimmune diseases, for most of which effective treatment is limited. Here, it is shown that inactivation of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8/UBPy) degrades the MDA5 protein, suppressing antiviral signaling and autoimmunity. It is found that viral infection modulates the AKT-dependent phosphorylation of USP8 at serine 718, which not only promotes the activation of USP8 but also enhances the association between USP8 and MDA5 and the consequent deubiquitination and stabilization of MDA5. Inactivation of USP8 specifically degrades the MDA5 protein regardless of the mutation pattern. Genetic deletion of Usp8 in mice contributes to decreased levels of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, inhibition of USP8 or AKT can effectively suppress MDA5-induced autoimmunity in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) mice and anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis (DM)/systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient cells. Therefore, these results highlight the critical roles of USP8 in innate antiviral immunity against RNA viruses and autoimmunity and provide a potential therapy for treating autoimmune diseases associated with MDA5.},

Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the culprits of DOR. By imposing OS damage on various kinds of ovarian cells including granulosa cells, OS can result in ovarian hypofunction and eventually lead to female infertility. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, HIGD1A, a mitochondrial inner membrane component, is found to be downregulated in granulosa cells upon OS exposure. By systematically studying the role of HIGD1A in regulating granulosa cell and ovarian functions as well as its corresponding mechanisms, a novel regulatory mechanism underlying OS-related female infertility is revealed, and provided a potential molecular target for anti-OS therapies.},

Recently, the hydrogen spillover effect has been proven to be one of the vital means to enhance the activity of the HOR catalyst. In this report, a facile and controllable electrodeposition strategy is proposed for synthesizing a tungsten (W)-doped copper (Cu) nanoalloy/WO 3 electrocatalyst with abundant metal-metal heterointerfaces to promote hydrogen spillover, i. e., the migration of * H from W/WO 3 sites to Cu substrates. CuW grown in situ on carbon paper (CP) demonstrates exceptional HOR performance (1.86 mA cm −2 at 0.05 V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability in alkaline media. XAFS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that alloying W atoms into the Cu lattice induces electronic modulation, significantly boosting the adsorption, decomposition, and oxidation of H 2 . The migration of * H from W/WO 3 sites to Cu sites via the hydrogen spillover effect has been validated by in - situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectra. This study may open up a new path for designing high-efficiency HOR electrocatalysts from the perspective of appropriate hydrogen spillover channel design.},

RNA sequencing of corneal tissue from HSK patients and healthy donors identifies a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Notably, hexokinase-2 (HK2), a pivotal glycolytic enzyme, exhibits the greatest up-regulation, coinciding with a marked reduction in the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in HSK corneas. Pharmacological inhibition of HK2 with lonidamine in human corneal epithelial cells reduces herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication while preserving cell viability. In a murine model of HSK, topical lonidamine restored respiratory-chain activity, lowered viral load, and accelerated corneal re-epithelialization; its early therapeutic efficacy surpassed that of ganciclovir, and combination therapy conferred additive benefit. These findings identify HK2-driven glycolytic reprogramming as a pathogenic hallmark of HSK and demonstrate that metabolic targeting concurrently restricts viral propagation and promotes tissue regeneration. Thus, metabolic intervention has the potential to complement direct antiviral therapy and represents a promising, clinically translatable strategy to preserve vision in HSK.},

  abstract     = {Unjamming transitions from a solid-like to a fluid-like state are a gateway to breast epithelial cancer invasion. However, the mechanical interplay between phase transitions and dimension transitions, in particular wetting, remains elusive, despite being critical for understanding the onset of metastatic dissemination. This study shows that unjamming, mediated by the RAB5A GTPase, alters carcinoma spheroid fluidity, rigidity, and rewires adhesion mechanics to drive supracellular active wetting as a new mode of tumor expansion. Spheroid fluidification enhances the selective expression of integrin subunits and increases focal adhesion dynamics, inducing a fluid-like spreading behavior on specific matrix ligands. Notably, nanoscale regulation of integrin clustering can select for distinct phase transitions at the collective scale upon wetting. In this framework, fluidized spheroids polarize into cohesive “supracells”, and maintain a stiff peripheral actin bundle as measured by nanomechanical mapping. Furthermore, a combination of Brillouin microscopy and 2.5D traction force analysis reveals a mechanical switch within the spheroid core, characterized by significant cell softening and a reduction in compressive forces exerted on the substrate, thereby mimicking the wetting of a liquid droplet. These findings establish unjamming-driven active wetting as a key mechanism to comprehend the molecular and biophysical underpinnings of solid tumor invasion.},

  abstract     = {Osteosarcoma, the most prevalent malignant bone tumour in children and adolescents, exhibits aggressive pulmonary metastasis and poor prognosis. This study identifies LncDARS-AS1 as a key regulator of metastasis via modulation of ATP1A1, the catalytic subunit of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase (NKA). Transcriptomic analyses, validated by qPCR in 217 osteosarcoma RNA samples, reveal that LncDARS-AS1 is significantly upregulated in metastatic lesions and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Functional assays confirm that silencing LncDARS-AS1 suppresses osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LncDARS-AS1 directly binds ATP1A1, preventing its interaction with the UBQLN4 and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby enhancing NKA activity. Protein-RNA interactions were validated using ChIRP, mass spectrometry, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Functional NKA activity was assessed using ion-sensitive fluorescent indicators and enzymatic assays. Additionally, digoxin, a cardiac glycoside targeting NKA, effectively inhibited tumour growth and metastasis at clinically safe concentrations. These findings uncover a novel LncDARS-AS1/ATP1A1 axis that promotes osteosarcoma metastasis through inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated degradation and provide a rationale for repurposing digoxin in osteosarcoma therapy. ATP1A1 emerges as a promising target for anti-metastatic intervention.},

  abstract     = {No effective treatments are currently available for central nervous system neurotrauma although recent advances in electrical stimulation suggest some promise in neural tissue repair. It is hypothesized that structured integration of an electroconductive biomaterial into a tissue engineering scaffold can enhance electroactive signaling for neural regeneration. Electroconductive 2D Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets are synthesized from MAX-phase powder, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility with neurons, astrocytes and microglia. To achieve spatially-controlled distribution of these MXenes, melt-electrowriting is used to 3D-print highly-organized PCL micro-meshes with varying fiber spacings (low-, medium-, and high-density), which are functionalized with MXenes to provide highly-tunable electroconductive properties (0.081 ± 0.053-18.87 ± 2.94 S/m). Embedding these electroconductive micro-meshes within a neurotrophic, immunomodulatory hyaluronic acid-based extracellular matrix (ECM) produced a soft, growth-supportive MXene-ECM composite scaffold. Electrical stimulation of neurons seeded on these scaffolds promoted neurite outgrowth, influenced by fiber spacing in the micro-mesh. In a multicellular model of cell behavior, neurospheres stimulated for 7 days on high-density MXene-ECM scaffolds exhibited significantly increased axonal extension and neuronal differentiation, compared to low-density scaffolds and MXene-free controls. The results demonstrate that spatial-organization of electroconductive materials in a neurotrophic scaffold can enhance repair-critical responses to electrical stimulation and that these biomimetic MXene-ECM scaffolds offer a promising new approach to neurotrauma repair.},

  abstract     = {Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by accelerated platelet destruction and defective platelet production. The thrombopoietin (TPO)-activated c-Mpl signaling pathway has been proven to promote megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production and thus has significant value in the clinical treatment of ITP. However, individual differences and unsustainable responses limit the clinical application of c-Mpl agonists. The cell membrane distribution of c-Mpl is crucial for the cell response to c-Mpl agonists. In the present study, this is observed that the distribution of c-Mpl on the megakaryocyte membrane is significantly reduced in ITP patients. The reduction is more severe in refractory patients. Then, this is verified that the membrane trafficking of c-Mpl is mediated by the Myosin-9/Rab6A complex, and demonstrates that the stability of this complex depends on Rab6A-GTPase. Furthermore, this is found that adiponectin promotes the membrane localization of c-Mpl by increasing the expression of Rab6A GEFs. Finally, this is revealed that adiponectin can assist thrombopoietic agents in the treatment of ITP mice. The results clarify the c-Mpl distribution defects in the cell membrane and the corresponding c-Mpl membrane transport mechanisms in megakaryocytes of ITP, providing new insights to improve the clinical efficacy of thrombopoietic agents for ITP patients.},

The model learns biological representations at local and global levels, to design natural-like species with enhanced diversity, or optimize protein properties and functions. Its modular nature also enables the integration with alternative pre-trained encoders for enhanced generalization capability. Outlier design can be implemented by adjusting the classifier-free guidance that enables PRO-LDM to sample vastly different regions in the latent space. The approach is demonstrated in generating a novel green-fluorescence-protein variant with notably enhanced fluorescence in multiple working scenarios along with increased solubility and stability. The model provides a versatile tool to effectively extract physicochemical and evolutionary information in sequences for designing new proteins with optimized performances.},

  abstract     = {Tetradecane, a long-chain alkane recently recognized as a volatile marker for early-stage mildew detection in stored grains and as a reference material in hydrocarbon studies, presents significant challenges for detection due to its inherent low reactivity and substantial molecular size. This study reports the synthesis of a microflower-like Fe@WO 3 / ZnCo 2 O 4 heterostructure for effective tetradecane sensing. The Fe@WO 3 / ZnCo 2 O 4 n-p junctions demonstrated significant alterations in electrical conductivity upon exposure to tetradecane at room temperature. The sensor achieved a reasonable detection limit of 78.4 ppb and a rapid recovery time of 36 s. The remarkable sensing performance is attributed to the synergistic interactions among multiple heterojunction interfaces, doping-induced active sites, the presence of oxygen vacancies, high-energy crystallographic facets, reduced grain size, and enhanced crystallinity, as supported by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. This work identifies a promising candidate for the detection of distinct volatile organic compounds, warranting further exploration in agricultural and emission monitoring applications while addressing a critical gap in metal oxide semiconductor sensors for the detection of large-molecule gases.},

Scanning transmission electron microscopy offers powerful capabilities for materials analysis and modification, but sample damage, drift, and scan distortions hinder single atom analysis and deterministic manipulation. Materials analysis and modification via electron–solid interactions can be transformed by precise delivery of electrons to a specified atomic location, maintaining the beam position despite drift, and minimizing collateral dose. Here a fast, low-dose, sub-20-pm precision electron beam positioning technique is developed, “atomic lock-on,” (ALO), which offers the ability to position the beam on a specific atomic column without previously irradiating that column. This technique is used to lock onto a single selected atomic location to repeatedly measure its weak electron energy loss signal despite sample drift. Moreover, electron beam-matter interactions in single atomic events are measured with time resolution. This enables observation of single-atom dynamics, such as atomic bistability, revealing partially bonded atomic configurations and recapture phenomena. This opens prospects for using electron microscopy for high-precision measurements and deterministic control of matter for quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The demand for hydrogen production compels the development of various strategies for water splitting. Among these strategies, the Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer (AEMWE) offers the advantages such as low cost and the production of high-purity hydrogen. Waste alkaline water generated from various industries can be directly used in the AEMWE system, due to its appropriate pH range of 13–14. While various nickel-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts have demonstrated adequate performance, their long-term stability remains a concern. To ensure long-term stability of AEMWE, it is crucial to address the potential poisoning effects of impurities present in waste alkaline water on nickel-based HER electrocatalysts. In this study, the Ni-CeO₂/Carbon (NCC) catalyst is employed for HER in waste alkaline water containing Li, Mo, and W ions. NCC exhibited an overpotential of 31 mV, showing ≈3 times less overpotential compared to the Ni/C. The XPS results and DFT calculations demonstrated the electrons transferring from CeO 2 to Ni, inducing the Electronic Metal-Support Interactions (EMSI) effects. The NCC shows 1 A cm −2 at 2.03 V in AEMWE while Ni/C needed 2.33 V to achieve the same current densities. The NCC maintaines long-term stability over 2000 h, with a degradation rate of 4.95%.},

  abstract     = {In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, how bacteria strategically navigate these factors is revealed. It is observed that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (≈0.25). Furthermore, it is found that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this 2D environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.},

In a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is found that impaired Kir4.1 channels in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) hindered myelin repair in the spinal cord. Using a thermal shift assay (TSA), the small molecule 2-D08 is identified, which effectively activated Kir4.1 channels and reduced demyelination in both EAE mice and marmosets. The neuroprotective effects are mainly due to enhanced phosphorylation of FYN tyrosine kinase, promoting OPCs differentiation.

Here, UTX is demonstrated to localize both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, notably, cytoplasmic UTX forms puncta and co-localizes in stress granules (SGs) upon different stresses in vitro. Mechanistically, the TPR domain of UTX plays a critical role in regulating SG disassembly by interacting with G3BP1, the central hub of SG, to disrupt the scaffold network of SG under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Importantly, a clinical UTX mutation, D336G in TPR domain, increases cytoplasmic location of UTX, and stabilizes SG. While UTX D336G promotes, WT UTX or UTX TPR inhibits, cell growth and tumorigenesis by regulating SGs both in vitro and in nude mice, and such regulation is G3BP1 dependent. Together, the results suggest a novel cytoplasmic function of UTX as a negative regulator of SG homeostasis, which is involved in stress and disease states such as tumorigenesis.},

  abstract     = {Radiation therapy (RT) is essential for treating thoracic malignancies but often causes significant lung damage. FLASH-RT, an ultra-high dose rate irradiation technique, shows potential in reducing radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) while maintaining tumor control. However, the underlying immune mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the immune and cellular responses to FLASH-RT versus conventional dose rate (CONV) RT during the early phase of RILI. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a dynamic landscape of the lung microenvironment is pictured during RILI within one-week post-irradiation. The analysis reveals that FLASH-RT induces a more immediate but transient cellular response, while CONV-RT causes sustained inflammation. FLASH irradiation significantly reduces neutrophil infiltration compared to CONV irradiation, particularly within the pro-inflammatory Ccrl2 + subset. FLASH irradiation also triggers stronger activation of CD4 + CD40L + Th cells, which are critical for regulating immune responses and balancing inflammation. Moreover, FLASH irradiation attenuates pro-inflammatory activation and intercellular signaling of Mefv⁺ monocytes, thereby restraining excessive macrophage-driven inflammation. Additionally, FLASH irradiation enhances TGF-β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, promoting tissue repair. These findings highlight FLASH-RT's superior immune modulation and reparative potential, providing valuable insights into its clinical application for minimizing radiation damage and enhancing lung recovery.},

  abstract     = {Autoimmune diseases, like spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have a high incidence and disability rate and are major diseases that seriously endanger human health. The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases involves the interaction among genetic factors, environmental factors, and immune disorders. The post-translational modified neoantigens are the key nodal of these three factors. Under the intervention of the external environment, changes in metabolic status in vivo induce metabolite-related post-translational modifications (PTMs). These PTM proteins and peptides, after being presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules of specific genotypes, can trigger autoreactive T cell expansions which are antigen-specific and then develop into autoimmunity. Such biological processes are a great challenge to the immune tolerance status and can be an important cause of autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract     = {Allergic asthma is a significant global health issue characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Current treatments only alleviate symptoms but fail to cure the disease due to its complex pathology. Lipid mediators from arachidonate metabolism are pivotal in immune regulation in asthma. Previously, coactosin-like protein (CLP) is identified as a regulator of leukotriene production in vitro. However, its role in asthma is unclear. In this study, it is found that CLP-deficient ( Cotl1 −/− ) mice challenged with house dust mite (HDM) exhibits exacerbated airway inflammation, macrophage polarization, and type 2 immune responses. CLP deficiency increased prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2 ) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and alveolar macrophages (AMs), activating the PGD 2 receptor chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) on immune cells. Notably, HDM exposure reduced pulmonary CLP levels in wild-type (WT) mice, and overexpression of CLP in Cotl1 −/− macrophages decreased HDM-induced PGD 2 in BAL and alleviated inflammation. Cotl1 −/− AMs exacerbated HDM-induced airway inflammation compared to WT AMs, and this effect is dependent on CRTH2 signaling. These findings reveal that CLP modulates macrophage polarization and suppresses the PGD 2 -CRTH2 pathway to alleviate airway inflammation, highlighting CLP as a promising therapeutic target for asthma.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac fibrosis, a key pathological feature of cardiac remodeling, is a major contributor to mortality in older patients with heart failure. The underlying mechanisms are complex, involving alterations in intercellular communication and chronic inflammation. This study investigates the role of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in aging-related myocardial fibrosis and its regulatory effects on autophagy through palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Here, plasma levels of IPA, a tryptophan-derived metabolite, are found to be reduced in older patients with heart failure, and this reduction is associated with deteriorating cardiac function. Notably, IPA supplementation significantly attenuated aging-related myocardial fibrosis. PPT1, a lysosomal enzyme involved in autophagy, is upregulated in macrophages during aging. IPA reversed aging-induced increase in PPT1 expression. Using PPT1 flox/flox Lyz2-cre mice, it is demonstrated that macrophage-specific deletion of PPT1 significantly reduced cardiac inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in aged mice. Furthermore, PPT1 silencing in macrophages reduced the expression of myocardial fibrosis markers in vitro. Mechanistically, IPA regulated PPT1 expression to modulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, thereby restoring autophagic activity in senescent macrophages and suppressing both inflammation and aging-related myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, IPA influenced the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to regulate PPT1 expression. These findings demonstrate that IPA inhibits PPT1, activates autophagy in macrophages, and mitigates aging-related myocardial fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Increasing evidence has clarified that atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with enhanced glycolysis, leading to lactate accumulation. However, whether glycolysis promotes AF remains unknown, as does whether histone lactylation plays a role in its pathogenesis. In the study, spontaneous AF mice are established to monitor AF susceptibility and atrial substrates at different ages (3, 5, 7 months), indicating that enhanced glycolysis acts as a promoter during AF development by inducing atrial fibrosis. The promoting effect of glycolysis on AF and the pivotal enzyme in driving glycolysis are confirmed by treatment with glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and adeno-associated virus-mediated atrial PFKM expression. Furthermore, lactate stimulates primary mouse cardiac fibroblast (CF) activation. Mechanistically, the observations indicated that atrial lactate accumulation promotes global lactylation and H3K18 lactylation in atrial fibroblasts. P300-mediated H3K18 lactylation up-regulates TGF-β1 transcription, leading to activation of CF, and thereby contributing to atrial fibrosis. The results reveal a novel role of the metabolic-epigenetic axis in AF pathogenesis, which raises the possibility of potential therapeutic strategies targeting AF.},

  abstract     = {Rhizosheath formation is facilitated by root hair length, root exudates, the soil microbes, which collectively enhance plant resistance to drought. This process partly results from the complex interaction between root exudates and microbes, a relationship that remains poorly understood. The roles of root exudates and microbes in rhizosheath formation in rice under soil drying (SD) conditions are investigated. In tetraploid rice, rhizosheath formation under SD is approximately 70% greater than in diploid rice. Inoculation of diploid rice with the rhizosheath soil microbiota from tetraploid rice significantly enhanced rhizosheath formation under SD. The bacterial genus Pseudomonas is identified as the key taxon promoting rhizosheath formation in tetraploid rice under SD. Tetraploid rice exhibits significantly higher root flavonoid concentration than diploid rice under SD. Overexpression of the chalcone synthase gene ( OsCHS1 ), a key gene involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, led to a significant increase in the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae in diploid rice. Pseudomonas nitroreducens , isolated from the rhizosheath of tetraploid rice, demonstrates chemotactic attraction to flavonoids, but this behavior is not observed in histidine kinase mutant Δ cheA . Diploid and tetraploid rice inoculated with P. nitroreducens and IAA biosynthesis complemented strain Δ iaaM -c formed larger rhizosheath under SD than those inoculated with its IAA biosynthesis mutant Δ iaaM . These results suggest that auxin-producing Pseudomonas , recruited by root flavonoids, enhances rice rhizosheath formation through the bacterial histidine kinase under SD. This finding may facilitate the improvement of environmental adaptation in polyploidy crops by regulating their interactions with beneficial soil microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation is a hallmark of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) characterized by immune cell infiltration and cytokine secretion. Stage-specific transcriptomic analyses of IVDD via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have primarily focused on nucleus pulposus cell phenotypes but not immune subpopulations. In other disease contexts, integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with scRNA-seq data has provided insights on pathomechanisms in relation to specific cellular subpopulations via single-cell disease relevance scores (scDRS). However, such an approach remains to be applied to IVDD. Here, the stage- specific analysis of IVDD in relation to Pfirrmann grading revealed a key transition in immune cells from a preponderance of LCN2 high myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during early degeneration to a surge of proinflammatory IL1B+ macrophages in advanced IVDD. scDRS implicated IL1B+ M1-like macrophages as a GWAS risk-enriched subpopulation associated with disease, while functional validation indicated an immunomodulatory effect of LCN2 high MDSCs via ANXA1-mediated inflammation suppression. Accordingly, LCN2 knockout mice exhibit accelerated IVDD, whereas recombinant LCN2 promoted macrophage polarization in vitro to the reparative phenotype by enhancing ANXA1 / Arginase-1 expression and countering LPS/IFN-γ-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype. This work identifies LCN2 high MDSCs as an immunoprotective subpopulation in early IVDD and highlights a potential role of LCN2 as a novel therapeutic agent.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer due to its aggressive clinical features and the lack of effective targeted therapeutics. Mitochondrial metabolism is intimately linked to TNBC progression and therapeutic resistance and is an attractive therapeutic target for TNBC. Here, it is first reported that human transmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65), a poorly characterized mitochondrial inner-membrane protein-encoding gene in human cancer, acts as a novel oncogene in TNBC to promote tumor growth, metastasis, and cisplatin resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Transcription factor MYC and DNA demethylase ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) coordinately upregulate TMEM65 in TNBC, and its upregulation is associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of MYC and TET3 attenuates TMEM65-driven TNBC progression. Mechanistic investigations reveal that TMEM65 enhances mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and its byproduct reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Increased ROS induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which in turn transcriptionally activates serpin family B member 3 (SERPINB3) to enhance TNBC stemness, thus leading to TNBC progression and cisplatin resistance. Collectively, these findings identify TMEM65 as a vital oncogene of TNBC, unveil its regulatory mechanisms, and shed light on its potential role in TNBC therapy.},

  abstract     = {High-brilliance circularly polarized γ-photon beams are of great significance for a wide range of applications. However, their generation through nonlinear Compton scattering must require a high-density longitudinally-spin-polarized electron beam and consequently is still a great challenge. Here, a novel method is proposed to generate such γ-photon beams via the vacuum dichroism (VD)-assisted vacuum birefringence (VB) effect, only utilizing a well-established unpolarized electron beam. A linearly polarized laser pulse is splitted into two subpulses with the first one colliding with a dense unpolarized electron beam to generate a linearly polarized γ-photon beam (via nonlinear Compton scattering), which then further collides with the second subpulse and is transformed into a circularly polarized one via the VB effect. It is found that by manipulating the relative polarization of two subpulses, one can “purify” the polarization of the γ-photon beam via the VD effect, thereby significantly enhancing the circular polarization of the γ-photon beam. Due to the VD assistance, the VB effect reaches optimal when the relative polarization is nearly 30°, not the widely used 45° in the common VB detection methods. The numerical results show that one can obtain a circularly polarized γ-photon beam with average degree of about 30% (43%) for energies above 500 (1000) MeV and brilliance of about 10 24 (10 23 ) photons/(s · mm 2 · mrad 2 · 0.1%BW) at 500 (1000) MeV by using a currently feasible laser with a peak intensity of about 10 22 Wcm − 2. And, it can be further improved to above 60% (75%) by increasing the laser pulse duration. Moreover, our method is shown to be robust with respect to the laser and electron beam parameters, and can also be used to efficiently confirm the well-known VB effect itself, which has been predicted a very long time ago but has not been directly observed in experiments yet.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with hypertension being a major contributor to both kidney damage and increased cardiovascular risk. Despite the established link between CKD and cardiovascular disease, the role of uremic toxins in monocyte-endothelial interactions under hypertensive conditions remains underexplored. Here, a 3D microfluidic model is developed to examine the effects of indoxyl sulfate on monocyte adhesion and extravasation across engineered microvessels embedded in hydrogels with different densities under controlled luminal pressure. Elevated pressure alone in absence of indoxyl sulfate significantly enhanced monocyte adhesion and extravasation, regardless of matrix density, while matrix density regulated adhesion and transmigration in the uremic environment. ICAM-1 is identified as a key driver of THP-1 monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Additionally, denser hydrogels primed monocytes toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with reduced phagocytic capacity, while softer hydrogels induced an anti-inflammatory-like phenotype with enhanced phagocytosis. However, the uremic environment reduced phagocytosis and shifted cells toward a pro-inflammatory-like state, irrespective of matrix density. This approach has the potential to dissect multiple factors that contribute to elevated cardiovascular risks in CKD patients and improve the understanding of mechanisms involved in monocyte dynamics in CKD-related cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disorder, and its associated microvascular dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. However, the mechanism governing metabolic regulation and functional heterogeneity of endothelial dysfunction remains incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of metabolic stress-induced activation of choline kinase α (CHKA) in endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations, contributing to diabetes-induced microvascular dysfunction. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), three distinct EC subclusters are identified within retinal vessels. Among them, one subcluster characterized by elevated CHKA expression is associated with enhanced angiogenic activity. CHKA silencing in ECs inhibited angiogenic effects and reduced retinal vascular dysfunction in diabetic murine models. CHKA silencing also disrupted NAD + metabolism, causing reduced NAD + levels. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD + , partially reversed the anti-angiogenic effects induced by CHKA silencing. Mechanistically, CHKA regulated endothelial dysfunction through the NAD + -SIRT1-Notch signaling. Clinical sample analysis and Mendelian randomization studies provided strong evidence linking increased CHKA expression with diabetic microvascular complications. Collectively, this study advances the understanding of endothelial heterogeneity and identifies CHKA as a critical regulator of pathological angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diabetic vascular complications.},

  abstract     = {Uncontrolled cell proliferation drives tumorigenesis and malignant progression, making cell cycle regulation a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation and metastasis by regulating the cancer-related proteins. Identifying key phosphorylation sites is essential for inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and optimizing therapy strategy. Here, this study reveals the strong association of oncogene Collaborator of ARF (CARF), a cell-division regulator interacting with p53, with prognosis and survival of lymphoma patients through pan-cancer analysis. In addition, this study finds that mammalian CARF shares homology with Kip-Related Protein6 (KRP6), a cell cycle inhibitor from higher plant Arabidopsis . KRP6 is regulated by casein kinase1 via phosphorylation at serines 75 and 109, which are conservative in CARF at serines 316 and 356. Systemic assays conducted with various B-cell lymphoma cell lines and a mouse xenograft model demonstrate that the non-phosphorylation variant of CARF inhibited cell proliferation and lymphoma formation more effectively than wild-type CARF, highlighting the crucial regulatory role of phosphorylation at these conserved sites in controlling B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation. A similar suppressive effect is observed with plant KRP6, suggesting a cross-species bioengineering application. These findings enlighten the application of phosphorylation-modified proteins as therapeutic targets in precise lymphoma treatments.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, ultimately leading to irreversible vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the significant risk factors in glaucoma; however, neurodegeneration continues even after effective IOP management, underscoring the need for neuroprotective therapies. This study investigates the role of connexin43 (Cx43), which is extensively expressed in retinal macroglia, in regulating microglial activation and optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma. A high-fidelity CRISPR-Cas13 (hfCas13X) system is employed to selectively target and knock down Cx43 expression in macroglia. The findings reveal that Cx43-mediated ATP release through hemichannels exacerbates microglial activation and neuroinflammation, thereby contributing to RGC loss. Notably, in a mouse model of chronic ocular hypertension (COH) glaucoma, knocking down Cx43 in macroglia using the hfCas13X system significantly promoted the survival of RGCs and the integrity of the optic nerve, and improved visual function. The hfCas13X system, which offers high-fidelity RNA editing with minimal off-target effects, represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for glaucoma, highlighting the potential of gene editing technologies in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract     = {Sweet potato ( Ipomoea batatas ) is a globally important autohexaploid root and tuber crop. Fusarium root rot threatens its entire growth, harvest, and storage period, thereby reducing yield and quality. Therefore, a deeper understanding of Fusarium pathogenicity and sweet potato defense is urgently required. Here, two single nucleotide polymorphisms are identified within the promoter region of the I. batatas CHY zinc-finger and ring protein1 ( IbCHYR1 ) gene that encode an E3 ubiquitin ligase linked to root rot resistance. In susceptible varieties, the high dosage allele Pro :: IbCHYR1 Hap1 leads to increased expression of IbCHYR1 . Overexpression of IbCHYR1 increases susceptibility to root rot and Fusarium wilt. IbCHYR1 interacts with the I. batatas CCCH-type zinc-finger protein ( IbZnFR ) to promote its degradation. IbZnFR confers resistance to root rot and Fusarium wilt and improves yield by more than 10%. The high dosage Pro :: IbZnFR Hap2 allele is associated with resistance to root rot disease. Moreover, FfRlpA2 , a conserved Fusarium effector, is identified as a protease inhibitor that stabilizes and hijacks IbCHYR1 to degrade IbZnFR , thereby inhibiting multiple defense pathways. These findings provide insights into Fusarium pathogenicity and a genetic basis for root rot research and improvement of disease-resistant sweet potato varieties.},

Antiangiogenic therapies are approved to treat different kinds of cancer. However, the success of these treatments is so far limited as some patients do not respond at all and others develop resistances. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving tumor angiogenesis and the variations in tumor vessels is crucial. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a fast volumetric imaging technique that provides detailed insights into tumor vascularization and perfusion of vessels in a label-free and non-invasive manner. An ultra-high resolution OCTA and confocal fluorescence imaging pipeline are developed to analyze tumor vascularization and blood perfusion in vivo, using a zebrafish cancer model. OCTA imaging operating at 800 nm is optimized to show slow blood flow allowing to compare the functionality of blood vessels in healthy and tumor-bearing zebrafish. Furthermore, effects of small compounds on tumor vascularization can be investigated with our setup. The key outcomes include a qualitative assessment of vascularization and blood vessel perfusion, along with a quantitative analysis of vessel structure, to evaluate how effective the drugs were at different concentrations.},

The attainment of ultralow CMC while sustaining the constant micelle presents a significant challenge. Here, by an ingenious pressurizing strategy, the ultralow CMC is obtained for the immobilized micelle. The ultralow CMC of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) is performed under pressure by the detection of encapsulated coumarin 35 (C35) attractively. At 0.80 GPa, the CMC of CTAB is decreased ≈111-fold to 8.3 ± 0.1 µ m compared to 917.2 ± 8.7 µ m at 0.10 MPa. The ultralow CMC under pressure is probed relying on the quenched fluorescence background of C35. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra confer a clear picture that the pressure-induced fluorescence quenching is ascribed to the reinforced competition for the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process of the C35. This study provides a robust strategy for achieving ultralow CMC, laying the groundwork for the efficient application of DSSCs.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies and epigenetic modifiers play a key role in HCC progression. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine-36 (H3K36me3) determines deposition of mRNA de novo N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification. However, it remains largely elusive how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are selected for proper m 6 A methylation. The current study provides evidence for L1CAM-AS1 as a novel H3K36me3-guided, m 6 A-modified lncRNA through integration of genome-wide H3K36me3 profiles and transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiles of HCC cells. The crucial m 6 A-modification site in L1CAM-AS1 exon 3 is recognized by IGF2BP1, leading to increased lncRNA stability. Oncogenic L1CAM-AS1 shows higher expression in HCC tissues than in normal specimens, and its elevated expression is associated with shorten patient survival. Mechanistically, L1CAM-AS1 interrupts binding of RAN to the E3 ligase OSTM1, suppresses RAN ubiquitination at Lys152 and Lys167, stabilizes RAN protein, enhances nuclear import of RELA (p65), and activates the NF-κB signaling, leading to up-regulated CCL2 expression. L1CAM-AS1-induced CCL2 secretion from HCC cells enhances M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Meanwhile, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages-released CCL5 augments RELA nuclear import in HCC cells, which in turn activates the NF-κB signaling. Given the critical role of macrophages in anti-tumor immunity, inhibition of the L1CAM-AS1-RAN axis promotes the efficacy of PD-1 blockade via TAM reprogramming in HCC mouse models. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into how epigenetic alternations are involved in antitumor immunity modulation and illustrates promising potentials of L1CAM-AS1 in immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatments for HCC.},

  abstract     = {While hydrogels are ideal building blocks for fabricating next-generation epidermal electronics to acquire high-fidelity electrical signals induced by motion and physiological activities, an unresolved issue remains: the differentiation and selection of sensing modes in hydrogel sensors. The novel design leverages numerous conductive nanosheets, randomly arranged in a series-parallel configuration, embedded within a highly compliant dielectric hydrogel. For the nanosheets, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is deposited on the surface of sulfonated cellulose nanosheets (SCNS) to function as microelectrodes (PEDOT@SCNS). The resulting nanosheet-based hydrogel (NSH) demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1356%), excellent adaptability (storage modulus of 102 Pa), and self-adhesiveness (21.7 kPa on pigskin). The nanosheet microelectrodes enable the formation of both microcapacitor arrays and conductive paths within the ultrasoft hydrogel, facilitating the construction of high-fidelity capacitive sensors and bioelectrodes for the real-time monitoring and classification of human activities and physiological states, respectively. This NSH, which significantly reduces skin-interfacial impedance, has demonstrated strong potential as candidate sensors for advanced applications in EMG, facial nerve monitoring, ECG, and brain activity monitoring, achieving reduced RMS noise (9.7 µV) and minimal motion artifacts.},

  abstract     = {Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV + ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibits a poorer prognosis with limited treatment options. Although recent evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system is associated with tumor progression, its role in EBV + DLBCL remains poorly understood. In the cohort, patients with EBV⁺DLBCL exhibit significantly shorter overall survival (OS). Two EBV + DLBCL cell lines are established and characterized. Although cell proliferation does not differ significantly in vitro, tumors derived from EBV + DLBCL cells demonstrate accelerated growth compared to their parental counterparts in mouse models. Mechanistically, transcriptome analysis reveals the upregulation of axonogenesis-related genes and pathways in EBV + DLBCL tumors. Immunostaining confirms increased nerve fiber infiltration in SUDHL6-EBV xenografts and enhance neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia co-cultured with EBV + DLBCL cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that sympathetic nerves promote tumor growth via β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), which are attenuated by selective β2AR blockers. Clinically, EBV⁺DLBCL patient samples show more sympathetic nerve fibers and higher β2AR expression, both of which are associated with poorer survival. Furthermore, a meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is linked to a reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality. Together, these findings suggest that sympathetic nerve innervation drives the progression of EBV + DLBCL via β2ARs, highlighting a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, triggering out adverse outcomes. A stacked multimodal machine learning model is constructed and validated for early identification and prognosis stratification of NAFLD by integrating genetic and clinical data sourced from 36 490 UK Biobank and 9 007 Nanfang Hospital participants and extracted its probabilities as in-silico scores for NAFLD (ISNLD). The efficacy of ISNLD is evaluated for the early prediction of severe liver disease (SeLD) and analyzed its association with metabolism-related outcomes. The multimodal model performs satisfactorily in classifying individuals into low- and high-risk groups for NAFLD, achieving area under curves (AUCs) of 0.843, 0.840, and 0.872 within training, internal, and external test sets, respectively. Among high-risk group, ISNLD is significantly associated with intrahepatic and metabolism-related complications after lifestyle factors adjustment. Further, ISNLD demonstrates notable capability for early prediction of SeLD and further stratifies high-risk subjects into three risk subgroups of elevated risk for adverse outcomes. The findings emphasize the model's ability to integrate multimodal features to generate ISNLD, enabling early detection and prognostic prediction of NAFLD. This facilitates personalized stratification for NAFLD and metabolism-related outcomes based on digital non-invasive markers, enabling preventive interventions.},

Conventional epoxy-crosslinked networks are inherently brittle, leading to a lack of these traits. Drawing inspiration from mussel nacre and byssus, a bionic epoxy/MXene network is developed, featuring a multi-type dynamic bond system and an inverse-artificial nacre structure. Through hierarchical assembly, the network integrates side-chain quadruple hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), dynamic disulfide bonds, and interfacial H-bonds, facilitating rapid energy dissipation. This epoxy demonstrates exceptional performance through meticulous engineering, exhibiting impressive toughness (210.75 MJ m −3 ), exceeding that of spider silk by 30%. It also shows remarkable stretchability (864.72%) and rapid self-healing capabilities (90.0% recovery within 2 h at 25 °C). This combination of these properties is consistently maintained under various environmental conditions due to the protection of the dynamic bonds by the hydrophobic chains. Furthermore, the bionic network enhanced the composites with superior gas impermeability and high interfacial adhesive strength (9.58 MPa). This study offers novel insights into the development of high-performance, durable protective coatings, and flexible devices designed for enhanced tolerance to harsh marine environments.},

The optimization of lyophilization formulations and operations is a slow process that could be accelerated by on-line analytics. In recent years, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has garnered increasing attention from both academia and industry in biopharmaceutical and food engineering fields. As a non-invasive, rapid, non-destructive, accurate, and automated tool that combines advantages from both spectroscopy and imaging techniques, HSI holds significant potential for analyzing and optimizing lyophilization processes and products. However, the huge and information-rich datasets generated from HSI are difficult to be modeled and interpreted properly. This article reviews and discusses the literature on the application of HSI on lyophilization, and the strategies that use the resulting data to build models. Such strategies include preprocessing, spectral unmixing, classification and regression, and data fusion. From the data modeling and application perspectives, the current challenges and future prospects regarding HSI techniques for lyophilization are addressed. This article is intended to provide guidance and insights for non-specialist researchers and engineers into leveraging HSI and the data-driven modeling strategies for addressing a wide range of lyophilization-related challenges.},

Albeit a few advances along c-MOF platforms in enhancing their EMW absorption performances, reticular modulation-led inter/intra-layer conduction and polarization loss remains an unmet challenge. To address this, a ligand substitution-guided bottom-up structural control strategy is introduced to study the depth of reticular modulation-led inter/intra-layer conduction and polarization loss in c-MOFs under an electromagnetic (EM) field. A family of triphenylene-X ligands (X = −NH 2 , −OH, and −SH) is harnessed to afford an isoreticular family of three Cu-based c-MOFs. Thanks to the distinct Cu─X bonds, such a platform allowed to systematically study the synergistic features of conduction and polarization loss in EMW absorption enhancement. One of the trio, Cu 3 (HITP) 2 (X = −NH 2 ; HITP, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) is identified with an optimal EM loss capacity under the EM field, achieving a record-high reflection loss of −63.03 dB in the effective absorption range of 3–18 GHz band. Setting up a new benchmark for EM loss among c-MOFs, this study introduces a way to leverage control in the charge mobility characteristics of Cu─X bonds relative to the dielectric losses at both molecular and atomic scales.},

  abstract     = {Zinc plays a crucial role in the gut barrier function and are widely used for the prevention of bowel disease. However, the mechanism via which zinc supplementation exerts this regulatory effect is unclear. The present study identifies and characterizes the zinc-responsive activation of AKT and demonstrates its function in alleviating gut barrier dysfunction. Mechanistically, zinc increased intracellular SAM production, a methyl donor, by promoting the activation of the metallochaperone ZNG1-METAP1 complex. Subsequently, zinc facilitates methylation (symmetrical dimethylarginine, SDMA) of AKT at residues R391 and R15, which is facilitated by PRMT5. The AKT SDMA modification promotes AKT translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and its interaction with mTORC2, ultimately promoting AKT activation and cell proliferation. Notably, histidine has an antagonistic effect on zinc-induced the AKT activation, cell proliferation, and gut barrier improvement by chelating zinc. These results demonstrate that zinc activates AKT and alleviates gut barrier dysfunction by inducing activation of the ZNG1-METAP1-PRMT5-AKT SDMA pathway, and highlight that limiting histidine intake may have effective therapeutic potential for bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.},

However, challenges remain, particularly in solid tumors where immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and T cell exhaustion limit effectiveness. Combining ICB with CAR T cell therapy has shown potential but requires further optimization for effective synergy. Here, the bioinformatic analysis identified that CXCL13 expression is highly elevated in T cells from patients who respond to ICB, indicating its possible role in enhancing T cell antitumor responses. Mouse CAR T cells are engineered to overexpress CXCL13 and observed that these cells displayed reduced exhaustion, increased central memory phenotype, and improved mitochondrial function and proliferation in an AKT-mTOR dependent manner. CXCL13-overexpressing CAR T cells show significantly increased antitumor activity in vivo, particularly when combined with PD-1 inhibition, promoting the expansion and persistence of early exhausted CD8 + CAR T cells. CXCL13 also conferred similar in vitro phenotypic enhancements in human CAR T cells as observed in murine cells.

Selected formulations encompassing lipid nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles have already attained regulatory approval for clinical treatment. Nonetheless, achieving precise spatiotemporal control of exogenous nanomedicine within intricate physiological environments remains a formidable challenge. Drawing inspiration from evolutionarily optimized natural biological architectures, the development of biomembrane-derived nanostructures with unique biological activities provides a new impetus for designing personalized antitumor drugs. Biomembrane-derived constituents, particularly cell membrane, extracellular vesicles, and other bioactive payloads, have inherited their precise targeting, specific tumor killing, and dynamic tumor immunosuppressive microenvironments remodeling properties in antitumor intervention. Here, the diverse biomembrane engineering strategies to equip the biomembrane with plentiful functionalities are highlighted. Moreover, the cutting-edge innovations of mammalian cells/bacteria/plants-derived biomembrane nanostructures and their applications for advancing cancer nanomedicine development are systematically reviewed. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities are proposed to realize the whole potential of biomembrane nanomedicine toward clinical transformation.},

  abstract     = {Metal-free graphitic carbon nitride has been considered as a promising candidate for hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) photosynthesis, with the advantage of low-cost, high stability, and environmentally friendly capacity. However, such a solar-to-chemical conversion still suffers from limited light utilization, confined surface adsorption, and restricted reduction/oxidation reaction pathway. At this juncture, this bottleneck has been overcome through diverse modifications over carbon nitride, such as defect engineering graphitic carbon nitride with modulated physical and chemical properties, which performs satisfactory visible-light absorption, sufficient active sites, and promotes charge transfer kinetics for artificial solar-to-chemical conversion. In this review, the recent advances for H 2 O 2 photosynthesis over defective graphitic carbon nitride are described, including the existing principles for H 2 O 2 formation, the factors affecting photosynthesis, the fabrication strategies toward novel materials, and the detailed pathways for H 2 O 2 formation. The functions of defects, the properties of materials, and the reaction mechanisms, and the selectivity, as well as in situ characterizations for catalyst synthesis and pathway exploration, have been summarized clearly.

Here, two novel 0D PTA 2 MnBr 4 (PTA = phenyltrimethylammonium) are synthesized and DMA 2 MnBr 4 (DMA = dimethylammonium) wafer with a manipulation of octahedra are synthesized by a precise molecular design. Structural analysis reveals that the PTA-functional group with extended π -conjugation lengths increases the Mn─Mn distance, results in a lower energy transfer and reduced exciton binding energy compared to DMA⁺ (linear carbon chain). Consequently, PTA 2 MnBr 4 demonstrates an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and prolonged exciton lifetime. The engineered X-ray detector based on PTA 2 MnBr 4 wafer exhibits a higher sensitivity of 1122 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 and a lower detection limit of 95 nGy air s −1 , while DMA 2 MnBr 4 device are 708.2 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 and 180 nGy air s −1 , respectively, which paves the way for high-efficiency photoelectronic applications.

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in LUAD progression, yet the biological role of lncRNA TMEM99 remains unexplored. In this study, its function in inhibiting autophagy in LUAD is explored. Using RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), TMEM99 is found upregulated in LUAD tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor patient outcomes. In vivo and in vitro assays confirmed that TMEM99 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibits autophagy. Mechanistically, the 3′ end of TMEM99 binds to the K‑homology domain 1 (KH1) and KH4 domains of far upstream element‑binding protein 3 (FUBP3), stabilizing its protein. The TMEM99-FUBP3 complex binds to p21 mRNA and recruits IGF2BP2 in an N⁶‑methyladenosine (m⁶A)-dependent manner, which enhances mRNA stability and translation efficiency. This study reveals that TMEM99 plays a crucial regulatory role in LUAD autophagy and presents a novel cytoplasmic regulatory mechanism contributing to LUAD progression.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis. Anthocyanins (ACN) have excellent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the key pathways of mastitis disease progression and the therapeutic effects of ACN on mastitis remain poorly understood. In this study, using cows, goats, and mice as animal models, the efficacy of ACN extracts from crabapple fruit is investigated in alleviating the severity of mastitis and blood milk barrier (BMB) damage. A monomeric component, cyanidin 3- O -galactoside (C3Gal) is identified, that exhibited considerable effect on mastitis. Mechanistically, C3Gal regulated mastitis progression by inhibiting PANoptosis activation, and suppressing gasdermin D N-terminal activity to regulate BMB damage during mastitis. These findings establish PANoptosis as a critical pathway in the rapid progression of mastitis and highlight the potential of ACN extracts as effective alternatives to antibiotic for mastitis treatment. This study provides a promising strategy for the discovery and application of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, expands the application of ACN in inflammatory diseases, and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory effect.},

However, rather than solely addressing these disadvantages, hydrogen's inevitable role in sustainable metallurgy should be leveraged to create new and potentially superior materials. Here, it is shown that using hydrogen in the form of metal hydrides introduces a barrier to mechanical alloying, stabilizing otherwise unattainable microstructures. Severe plastic deformation of a composite of the equiatomic high entropy alloy (HEA) TiVZrNbHf and Cu leads to amorphization, while substituting the HEA with its hydride preserves the two-phase structure. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the significantly different hydrogen affinities, together with the restricted dislocation motion in the hydride, create a barrier to mechanical alloying. This hydride route could enable new microstructure states, even in well-studied material systems. It opens an additional dimension in designing materials containing phases with diverging hydrogen affinities, offering tighter control over mechanical alloying.},

By modulating the humidity level between the glass layers, the smart window enables the dynamic and coordinated modulation of solar and thermal radiation via the reversible adsorption and desorption of water vapor by the PTFE/PVA composite. The results indicate that the humidity-controlled smart window demonstrates superior capabilities in solar modulation (54.4%) and thermal radiation modulation (51.4%). Statistical analysis reveals that compared to ordinary windows and low emissivity (Low-E) windows, PTFE/PVA windows reduce total annual energy consumption by ≈25% and 40%, respectively.

Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for preventing permanent damage. Current methods rely largely on qualitative assessments with limited accuracy, and those that exploit invasive pressure measurements often prove inadequate. Herein, a soft materials-based multimodal sensor probe is introduced, as well as the mechanical and thermal influences to monitor intra-compartmental pressure, tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ), and blood flow simultaneously at a common location within an affected compartment. The system integrates three sensors into a thin, flexible probe capable of real-time, wireless data transmission. The device allows for continuous monitoring with high reproducibility and sensitivity, to enhance diagnostic accuracy relative to current clinical practice, with the potential to early diagnosis of an acute compartment syndrome that requires fasciotomies. Large animal model studies, including short- and intermediate-term reliability assessments, highlight the key engineering features. The results reveal expected inverse relationships between pressure, StO 2 , and flow rate under simulated compartment syndrome conditions. This multimodal approach enhances diagnostic precision, offers real-time insights, and promises to yield improved outcomes through a comprehensive, quantitative diagnosis of compartment syndrome.},

The challenge of early diagnosis and the inefficacy of current therapeutic strategies underscore the urgent need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as critical regulators of post-transcriptional processes and are implicated in cancer progression. Here, the study identifies Staufen Double-Stranded RNA Binding Protein 2 (STAU2) as an oncogenic RBP with high expression in PDAC, which is significantly associated with metastasis. It is demonstrated that STAU2 directly binds and regulates cytoskeletal associated protein Palladin (PALLD) and mediates IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), thereby promoting metastasis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Moreover, a 2′-methoxyethoxy (2′-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting STAU2 is developed, which effectively inhibited downstream targets in vitro and in vivo. STAU2-ASO treatment significantly suppressed PDAC progression and metastasis, with a demonstrated safety profile in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Targeting Nampt to modulate NAD + metabolism and exert antitumor effects has become a research hotspot in the field of cancer metabolism. But early clinical trials have only achieved modest results, primarily due to the need for improved efficacy and the occurrence of severe systemic adverse effects. Therefore, enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing the adverse effects of Nampt inhibitors are urgent challenges. The research reveals that the Nampt inhibitor FK866 can induce ferroptosis in colorectal cancer cells via the NAD + /Stat3/Gpx4 signaling axis. Furthermore, the combination of FK866 and the Stat3 inhibitor C188-9 demonstrates a strong synergistic antitumor effect. Importantly, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hydrogel that encapsulates FK866 and C188-9 for in situ drug delivery, effectively reducing systemic side effects, is developed. Intriguingly, mass cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) analysis indicates that the combined treatment with FK866 and C188-9 exerts antitumor effects by increasing the infiltration of CD8 + T cells and neutrophils into the tumor, as well as enhancing the expression of immune-regulatory molecules, including IFN-γ, IL-10, and perforin. Thus, this localized treatment not only minimizes systemic adverse effects, but also markedly amplifies antitumor efficacy through the modulation of both tumor cells and the tumor immune microenvironment, representing a promising antitumor treatment strategy.},

  abstract     = {MXenes have demonstrated exceptional performance in energy applications, yet their potential in photovoltaic systems, particularly in lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs), remains underexplored, with no strategic studies addressing how MXene composition influences critical photovoltaic performance. Here, we present the first strategic screening of M 2 X-type MXenes (including Hf 2 CT x , Zr 2 CT x , Ta 2 CT x , Nb 2 CT x , Mo 2 CT x , and V 2 CT x ) for rational heterojunction design with Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , focusing on the interplay between properties of MXenes and photovoltaic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MXenes can induce substantial electronic states near the Fermi level, creating superior charge transfer paths in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , with V 2 CT x exhibiting the lowest interfacial contact barrier and the highest carrier transfer efficiency. Complementary ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses further demonstrate that the functional termination groups like ─F in MXenes effectively passivate Br vacancies in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , thereby enhancing crystallization and suppressing defect densities. Consequently, the experimental results yielded a trend in line with the calculations, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with V 2 CT x represented a 36% improvement, accompanied by exceptional stability. By establishing quantitative structure-property relationships between MXenes and Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , this work provides a universal materials selection paradigm for developing high-performance, environmentally-friendly photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common digestive tract malignant cancer with high incidence and mortality rate. Many studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs are involved in the progression of various types of tumors. The lncRNA protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P1) promotes the progression of ESCC, but the molecular mechanism behind this is still unclear. In this study, PDIA3P1 is highly expressed in ESCC, produces more lactate by regulating glycolysis, and the increased lactate upregulates lactylation levels to drive tumor progression. Mechanistically, PDIA3P1 competes with miR-152-3p to prevent degradation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, and disrupts the binding between membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) to reduce ubiquitination degradation of HK2, thereby promoting glycolysis. High activity glycolysis produces more lactate, which upregulates the level of histone H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la) and promotes the transcription of target bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7). Functionally, BMP7 is involved in the regulation of ESCC progression by PDIA3P1 both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) mediated m6A modification enhances the stability of PDIA3P1 through Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) dependent recognition. Taken together, these findings reveal the key role of PDIA3P1 regulates glycolysis-H4K8la-BMP7 axis in the progression of ESCC and provides new insights into the interplay between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic regulation.},

Owing to their neighboring position and the diagonal relationship in the periodic table to lithium, Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Li + ions feature commonalities in terms of ionic radius, carried charge, and charge density. The present study aims to shed light on the similarities but also differences of Ca electrolytes and metal anodes in comparison to their Mg and Li counterparts in terms of transport properties and processes at the anode/electrolyte interface, respectively. To ensure comparability, an electrolyte comprising B(hfip) 4 − anions in monoglyme is applied in either case. By executing galvanostatic polarization and pulsing with different separator materials, the separator tortuosity, diffusion coefficient, and transference number are determined. Further, the charge transfer characteristics as well as the adsorption layer and solid electrolyte interphase formation are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The cation charge density was found to be crucial for diffusion and desolvation processes, yet surprisingly, also a cation-dependent separator tortuosity was observed. The study concludes with a recommendation on suitable separators for each metal battery system.},

While crystallographic features of Li influence deposition morphology, the orientation of Li crystals during electrodeposition and their temporal evolution under varying kinetic and interphasial conditions remain unclear. This study investigates Li microstructures during electrodeposition at ultra-high capacities (up to 12 mAh cm⁻ 2 ) and over repeated cycling, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the microstructural evolution of Li depends on the interplay between interphasial properties and deposition kinetics. A layer-by-layer epitaxial Li growth with a coherent lattice orientation is achievable under homogeneous interphase and slow deposition kinetics. However, at higher capacities or extended cycling, deterioration of interphase homogeneity disrupts crystal matching, resulting in island-like deposits with randomly oriented single-crystalline grains. In contrast, an inhomogeneous interphase and faster kinetics lead to whisker-like Li deposits. These results demonstrate that while cohesive interactions between depositing Li crystals can result in isolated single-crystalline grains, maintaining interphase homogeneity and stability is essential to enable coherent lattice matching for layer-by-layer epitaxial growth. This study reveals Li microstructural evolution and offers insights for designing stable interphases and optimizing conditions for durable, high-capacity LMBs.},

Efficient heat dissipation in electrically insulating packaging materials is currently limited by the thermal conductivity of thermal-interface materials (TIMs) and their ability to effectively direct heat toward heat sinks. In this study, MgO-based composites with high thermal conductivities are fabricated to achieve excellent thermal performances by optimizing the heat-transfer path. These composites are produced using a protein foaming method, which effectively forms interconnected ceramic-filler networks. Additionally, the liquid phase formed during the sintering of MgO enhances the bonding with the epoxy matrix, thereby improving the thermal conductivity of the composites. As a result, the composites with 54.64 vol% MgO achieve a high thermal conductivity of 17.19 W m −1 K −1 , which is 101 times higher than that of pure epoxy, 3.7 times higher than that of randomly dispersed composites, and even superior to that of nitride-based composites. Moreover, the composites also exhibited a low thermal-expansion coefficient (27.76 ppm °C −1 ) and high electrical-insulation strength (51.51 kV mm −1 ), ensuring good thermal and electrical performance for electronic-packaging applications. The strategic design of the TIM microstructures for effectively directing heat offers a promising solution for efficient thermal management in integrated electronics.},

  abstract     = {Developing high damping alloys (HDAs) with large elastic strain has attracted growing attention due to the increasing demand for energy absorption with overload reliability and reusability. However, damping capacity inherently conflicts with elasticity, because the former requires a liable movement of crystal defects while the latter opposite. To deal with the damping-elasticity paradox, the advantage of pseudobinary eutectic reaction and rapid cooling of laser powder bed fusion is taken to fabricate a bulk NiTiSn nanocomposite with a two-level hierarchical structure. The first-level architecture is composed of martensitic NiTi nanolamellae and reinforced Ti 3 Sn nanolamellae. In addition to lattice strain matching and lamellar boundary strengthening, a novel mechanism of martensite reorientation mediated by reversible stress-induced detwinning-twinning is activated to generate large elastic strain. A high density of nanotwins and nanodomains within NiTi nanolamellae constitute the second-level architecture, which provides pronounced internal friction for high damping capacity. As a result, our NiTiSn nanocomposite exhibits a record-high integration of damping capacity (tanδ > 0.10) and elastic strain (exceeding 4.5%), as well as superb stability under cyclic overload. This research not only represents a major breakthrough in achieving HDAs with outstanding damping and elastic strain but also offers a novel paradigm for high-performance functional and structural materials.},

A representative immunosuppressive mechanism is the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells with the help of exosomal PD-L1. Another common mechanism is to promote tumor metastasis by promoting the seeding and growth of metastatic cancer cells in distant organs. Therefore, the removal of TExo can provide many benefits for the treatment of cancer patients. Here, a bio orthogonal r eaction- d riven e xosome e limination (Biordee) strategy that promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis by using IgG Fc to engineer endogenous TExo (TExo-Fc) was developed. The Biordee strategy effectively reduced the levels of TExo in the circulatory system by leveraging the interaction of IgG Fc with FcγRII/III receptors of macrophage, which further broke down the body's immunosuppression and enhanced the immune response after chemotherapy. Moreover, the Biordee strategy inhibited breast cancer liver metastases, which were enhanced by promoting chemotherapy-induced TExo release.

Herein, the first case of engineering polyploid genomes with desirable traits via unisexual–sexual reproduction transition is provided. First, a group of genome-reconstructed amphitriploids (GR-A3n) is generated involving unisexual gynogenetic Carassius gibelio , sexual C. auratus , and sexual C. cuvieri . Then, we found that the gynogenesis ability have transferred from C. gibelio to some of the GR-A3n females. This study subsequently established three GR-A3n clones with distinct herpesvirus resistance and in which differential transcriptome profiles are characterized in two main hematopoietic organs. Most genes of the hemoglobin metabolism pathway is found to exhibit high expression levels, as in C. cuvieri , which led to efficient hemoglobin biosynthesis and blood oxygen homeostasis during infection, thereby resulting in strong herpesvirus resistance. Furthermore, this study determined the resistant and susceptible haplotypes derived from chromosome 12B of C. cuvieri , which should be responsible for resistance differences between GR-A3n clones. Overall, this study establishes an approach for genetic improvement through polyploid genome design in animals.},

  abstract     = {Infiltrating monocytes can exert both protective and pathogenic effects during central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. However, the metabolic mechanisms that govern these divergent roles remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and metabolic flow analysis of brain and bone marrow (BM) is used to map the metabolic signatures of monocyte-derived cells (MCs) during lethal West Nile virus encephalitis. Trajectory analysis shows that BM monocytes progress through three metabolic profiles before migrating to the brain and differentiating into a pro-inflammatory HIF1-α⁺ MC population. This population further diverges into an inflammatory, iNOS⁺ MC subset with high glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, and a protective, glycolytically quiescent, antigen-presenting MC subset. Daily in vivo glycolysis inhibition reduces neuroinflammation and disease signs without increasing viral load. This effect does not reflect a broad reduction in myelopoiesis but rather a selective decrease in iNOS⁺ MC migration, revealing distinct glycolytic dependencies among MC subsets. HIF1-α activity remains independent of glycolysis, enabling functional differentiation of antigen-presenting MCs without impairing antiviral responses by cervical lymph node T cells. This study identifies key metabolic drivers of MC function in viral CNS disease, in which selective metabolic reprogramming reduces severe neuroinflammation, demonstrating a promising therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic H 2 O 2 synthesis from water and oxygen by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted much attention currently. However, conventional COFs often suffer from insufficient stability and activity due to the unclear structure-activity relationship mechanisms. Herein, a series of quinoline-linked COFs-R (-R = -OH, -OMe, -H, -Br, -CN) synthesized via multi-component reactions (MCRs) is reported to systematically modulate their pore microenvironments and enhance photocatalytic performance. Experimental results reveal that the electron-donating capacity of substituents significantly enhances charge separation efficiency, with H 2 O 2 production activity exhibiting a negative correlation to the Hammett parameters ( σ p ) of the -R groups. Notably, the COF-OH and COF-OMe, bearing the strong electron-donating group, achieve a remarkable H 2 O 2 generation rate of 4458 and 4138 µmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ in the pure water system. Theoretical calculations confirm that substituents optimize the collective donor structure within the π-conjugated triazine framework, boosting photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the universal Hammett relationship observed in benzylamine coupling reactions establishes a critical structure-activity model for rational COF design. This work provides fundamental insights into the microenvironment engineering of COFs for efficient H 2 O 2 production and advances the development of sustainable photocatalytic materials.},

  abstract     = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) dominate the tumor stroma in colorectal cancer (CRC), fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment that supports tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting CAF-derived cytokines and secreted proteins offers potential new avenues for CRC treatment. Here, vitronectin (VTN) is identified as a significantly up-regulated gene in CAFs, correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, through multi-dataset analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence. Comprehensive analyses, including cytometry by time -of- flight (CyTOF), in vitro co-culture assays, transgenic mouse models, and azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced CRC models, demonstrate that VTN enhances CRC proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. CyTOF analysis shows a reduced proportion of M2-type macrophages in fibroblast-specific VTN knockout mice ( Vtn fl/fl S100a4-Cre + ), with VTN promoting M2 macrophage polarization in vitro. Mechanistically, VTN upregulates SLC6A8 expression in CRC cells and macrophages by enhancing FAK phosphorylation, which increases creatine and ATP uptake, promoting cancer progression and macrophage polarization. Targeted VTN knockout in fibroblasts significantly improves the efficacy of immunotherapies and reduces CRC progression. These findings highlight the dual role of CAF-derived VTN in driving CRC malignancy and modulating immune responses, positioning VTN as a promising therapeutic target in CRC management.},

This study presents a hardware-implemented RC system utilizing multifunctional memristors fabricated using a single process. By leveraging a ferroelectric-based memristor (FM) as a volatile reservoir layer and a redox-based memristor (RM) as a non-volatile readout layer, seamless integration without additional fabrication steps is achieved. The dual-functional memristor structure enables electrical conversion from FM to RM, enhancing system scalability and versatility. Comprehensive electrical measurements, including low-frequency noise analysis and weight update linearity evaluation, validate the memristors’ performance. Potentiation and depression processes achieve a linearity factor improvement to ensure precise synaptic weight tuning, with cycle-to-cycle variation <2.3%. Additionally, the ferroelectric-based memristor exhibits a cycle-to-cycle variation of 3.52%, maintaining distinct reservoir states with minimal overlap. Offline training demonstrates a high classification accuracy of 93.3% on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, while online training achieves an accuracy of 88.2% with incremental pulse schemes, surpassing the accuracy of identical pulse schemes (65.1%).

  abstract     = {In diabetes, pancreatic β cells degenerate from their mature differentiated state to a dedifferentiated state. BRD4 plays a pivotal role during embryogenesis and cancer development, but its function in modulating β-cell differentiation remains unknown. In this study, multiple models including calorie restriction db/db mouse, long-term and acute conditional knockout mouse, and human islet organoids are adopted to assess BRD4 function in β cells. Two hundred twenty-two young patients with diabetes are also recruited for whole exome sequencing (WES) to screen for BRD4 mutations. This study shows that BRD4 expression is significantly reduced in human diabetic β cells while significantly increased after calorie restriction in the diabetic mouse. β cell differentiation is impaired after long-term and acute Brd4 knockout. BRD4 knockdown in human islet organoids results in the loss of differentiation and reduction of insulin synthesis. It is found that p.R749C can significantly affect BRD4 signaling and might play roles in diabetes development in patients. This study also shows that ATF5 is a direct target of the BRD4 pathway in β cells. Targeting BRD4-mediated regulatory networks may hold promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies to maintain the differentiated state of β cells.},

The separation of orbital and spin components is proposed as the most current idea. However, it remains extremely difficult to develop studies sensitive to both types of AM using direct wave field measurements. Here, theoretical explanation and experimental proof of the acoustic spin-orbit AM conversion are reported. A formulaic description of spin-orbit AM conversion in coupled fields of two nonparaxial Bessel acoustic vortices is given by a thorough theoretical derivation. Experimental results of wave field measurements provide compelling evidence for spin-orbit AM conversion via passive artificial structures. Based on this conversion, contactless high-resolution manipulation of micro-objects is further achieved, as demonstrated by the controlled rotation of Rayleigh particles and their translation along a circular trajectory. This work provides deeper insights into the AM physics of classical waves and has significant implications for acoustic sensing, acoustic imaging, and particle manipulation based on acoustic radiation force or torque.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) present considerable potential as next-generation logic switches owing to their ultra-thin structure and exceptional electrical properties. Although recent advancements have achieved impressive direct current (DC) performance in individual devices, research on the architectural design of CNT-based transistors remains limited. This gap is critical, as device architecture directly influences power consumption and switching speed at the circuit level. In particular, the balance between parasitic capacitance and resistance, key factors determining resistive-capacitive (RC) delay, has not been thoroughly addressed. In this study, top-gate CNT metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) that employ a novel low-κ extension doping technique are presented. This approach utilizes a stacked SiO x /AlF x layer (κ = 3.9 and 2.5) to enhance device performance while minimizing parasitic capacitance between the top gate and contact metal. The proposed approach improves the driving current by 8.4 times and reduces the total resistance by 85% when compared with CNT MOSFETs with undoped extensions. The doping level is tunable from 0.5 nm −1 to 0.59 nm −1 , with electrostatic doping driven by negative charges at the SiO x ​/AlF x interface. The benchmarking results demonstrate the record-low κ-value and physical thickness presented by the proposed approach, highlighting its potential for high-performance, high-speed applications.},

  abstract     = {High energy-density Li metal batteries with improved safety and cyclic performance can be achieved by adopting solid polymer electrolytes. However, current solid polymer electrolytes show inferior room-temperature ionic conductivity and Li-ion transference number (t Li+ ), impeding their practical applications. Herein, a 3-(pyridinium)propane-1-sulfonate zwitterionic covalent organic framework (PSZ-COF) incorporating a eutectic-like ion-conductive phase is prepared by making a complex with N -methyl- N -propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Pyrrol-FSI) and Li salts in its channels as a solid electrolyte (eutectic PSZ-COF). The eutectic PSZ-COF possesses a zwitterionic Li-salt-dissociating mode, a Pyrrol-FSI Li-cation-transporting carrier, and a pyridinium anion-holding trap in the ordered channels, providing a high ionic conductivity (0.127 mS cm −1 ) and t Li+ (0.62) at room temperature. Moreover, the eutectic PSZ-COF can suppress Li dendrites and drive a LiF/Li 3 N-rich solid electrolyte interface layer on a Li anode. Computational simulations reveal that the time-evolved average distance and hoping distance of Li + ions are significantly reduced in the eutectic PSZ-COF, allowing their facile migration. The all-solid-state Li metal batteries bearing eutectic PSZ-COF with a lithium iron phosphate(LFP) cathode (2.0 mg cm − 2 ) exhibit an initial capacity of 153.3 mAh g −1 , 99.9% Coulombic efficiency, and 100% capacity retention over 150 cycles at room temperature.

However, the limited penetration depth of conventional ultra violet (UV)-visible irradiation and the tumor hypoxia microenvironment significantly constrain the efficacy of immune-regulatory PDT. Here, a mitochondria-targeting enhanced nanoplatform (NZ @TG ) is reported, activated by near-infrared (NIR) light-driven PDT, to address these challenges and amplify systemic anti-tumor immunity. This nanoplatform employs an interfacial lanthanide-organic triplet photosensation mechanism to realize localized oxidative damage of oxygen-rich mitochondria under NIR irradiation. Simultaneously, the exacerbated hypoxia induced by PDT activates a TH302 prodrug, resulting in cell cycle arrest in highly proliferative tumor cells. These combined effects trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to activate immune responses. This approach demonstrates significantly enhanced tumor ablation in deep-seated lesions in orthotopic liver tumor models and induces long-term anti-tumor immune memory. Moreover, the NIR-PDT-induced immune activation markedly improves the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy efficacy. This strategy offers a robust modality for immune activation in cancer therapy, paving the way for effective treatment of deep-seated tumors and preventing recurrence.},

Under chemical pressure, Eu 2+ migrates from Ba 2+ to Na + lattice sites in NRBBO, leading to a gradual decrease in the FWHM, making it more competitive for display applications. The existence of chemical pressure in the lattice is demonstrated through a high-pressure spectrum. The migration of Eu 2+ lattice sites under chemical pressure is verified by XRD refinement, low-temperature spectrum and EXAFS. NRBBO: 0.11Eu 2+ can be effectively excited by NUV and blue light, with an emission peak at 512 nm and a FWHM of 54 nm.

Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived epiblast models mimicking gastrulation processes have sparked significant interest in bridging this gap. However, as a newly emerging field, bioengineered models show limited production throughput and complexity in recapitulating epiblasts’ disc-shaped morphogenesis. Here, a well-defined laminin/alginate bioink to create epiblast-like models from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using electro-assisted bioprinting is proposed. This approach enables the generation of large-scale hiPSC-laden microgels that not only facilitate mass transfer but also mimic the structural characteristics of early embryos, which allow hiPSCs to self-organize into disc-like epiblast models with consistent morphology and phenotype. With adaptability to human embryonic stem cells, this method demonstrates the versatility of engineering reproducible epiblast-like models using various PSC lineages. Importantly, the bioactive components and physical confinement provided by the bioink, and the endogenous regulation of the WNT signaling pathway, contribute to disc-like morphogenesis, recapitulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition critical in the gastrulation process, and generation of the posterior epiblast population, directing the mass production of manipulable embryonic models for studying the spatiotemporal events and possible defects in early human development.},

Mechanistically, GSDMD-CT, released upon virus infection, interacts separately with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and tank-binding kinase (TBK1), promoting the selective autophagic degradation of RIG-I via K48-linked polyubiquitination at Lys181 and TBK1 via K27-linked polyubiquitination at Lys487 by the E3 ligase TRIM28, which serves as a recognition signal for the cargo receptor NDP52 and TOLLIP, respectively. Moreover, the P414, Q416, and E459 amino sites are crucial for GSDMD-CT in counteracting antiviral responses.

Current tissue-engineering strategies have limitations in addressing these challenges. This study has regulated BMSC differentiation by optimizing the GT/PCL ratio and topological structure of nanofibrous materials, systematically comparing three different materials (r5G5P, a5G5P, and a7G3P), and employing a “rolling and folding” method in order to construct BMSC-NFMC composite structures. This approach achieves effective vascular isolation between the bone and cartilage layers. After implantation in nude mice, the a5G5P group exhibits distinct natural osteochondral tissue structural characteristics, which become more stable after 8 weeks of in vivo culture. Transcriptome sequencing analysis reveals that under ischemic conditions, the a5G5P group effectively regulates cartilage formation by inhibiting the Rap1 pathway and subsequently activating the ERK pathway. In rabbit articular osteochondral defect repair experiments, the a5G5P group successfully regenerates complete articular osteochondral structures similar to those of the adjacent natural tissues.

  abstract     = {The synthesis of cellulose pellicles by bacteria offers an enticing strategy for the biofabrication of sustainable materials and biomedical devices. To leverage this potential, bacterial strains that overproduce cellulose are identified through directed evolution technology. While cellulose overproduction is linked with a specific genetic mutation, the effect of such mutation on the intracellular protein landscape and on the structure and mechanical properties of the cellulose pellicles is not yet understood. Here, the proteome of bacteria evolved to overproduce cellulose is studied and its effect on the structure and mechanics of the resulting cellulose pellicles is investigated. Proteomic analysis reveals that the protein landscape of the evolved bacteria shows pronounced differences from that of native microorganisms. Thanks to concerted changes in the proteome, the evolved bacteria can generate cellulose pellicles with exquisite structure and improved mechanical properties for applications in textiles, packaging, and medical implants.},

However, existing methods fail to comprehensively characterize the 3D structures of molecules and neglect the electronic structural information that significantly influences key properties such as molecular reactivity, strong electrostatic interactions, and chemical adsorption. Therefore, here, a novel molecular representation learning method is constructed, Q-GEM, incorporating quantum and geometric structural information enhancement, based on the quantum chemical property database QuanDB and SSL methods. Q-GEM comprises a GNN embedded with the molecular electronic and complete 3D geometrical structural information as well as several well-designed multiscale SSL tasks, achieving superior absolute molecular conformation prediction and conformational discrimination. The Q-GEM achieved state-of-the-art performance in 12 out of 13 prediction tasks on the MoleculeNet dataset, with an average performance improvement of 3.3% and 2.0% for classification and regression prediction tasks, respectively. Moreover, an average performance improvement of 5.2% is achieved in three localized quantum chemical properties, fully demonstrating the excellent performance of Q-GEM in distinguishing molecular electronic structures.

Due to their simple shape, flexibility, and conformability, HFDEAs are promising candidates for complex applications within soft robotics. This paper offers a comprehensive comparison between the actuation behavior of planar and HFDEAs using both analytical and numerical models. An electro-mechanical model establishes analytical correlations between the applied voltage and resulting strain. The results from the simplified model are subsequently compared with a numerical model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where simulations are run in more realistic conditions. Supporting experiments are conducted on HFDEAs with different geometries to validate the model. A geometric factor, β, is introduced to account for the influence of geometric parameters on actuator performance. The results show that HFDEAs exhibit higher strain compared to planar films. Among the different fiber geometries, those with smaller internal diameters and thinner walls exhibit higher axial strain and holding force while using the least amount of material. This study highlights the advantages of hollow fiber DEAs compared to their planar counterparts, especially in applications where lighter, more efficient structures with greater strain capabilities are essential.},

It supports analog multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) operation in a compact and highly parallel manner, which can significantly enhance computing efficiency. However, applying memristive computing in advanced network structures, such as deep neural networks and multimodal networks, is inefficient because the partial analog computing requires frequently exchanging data between analog and digital domains. Here, a perovskite memristive computing unit with flexible reconfigurability and desired nonlinearity through fully vapor deposition is reported. It enables performing all the mathematical operations necessary for Transformer ANNs completely in the analog domain. A prototypical attention module is implemented by combining cells configured in different operators of dynamic MAC, activation, and softmax functions. By cascading the modules in a multi-layer Transformer network, a neuromorphic engine is fabricated and tested RGB-T tracking and visual question answering tasks, fully considering device non-idealities. It is found that the network performance is close to that of operating on a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated workstation, but it consumes only 1.7% energy and increases power efficiency by 58 times.

  abstract     = {Bacterial endophthalmitis is an ophthalmological emergency that can lead to permanent blindness, and high-efficiency therapeutic strategies that can completely eradicate pathogens within a short timeframe are needed. However, intrinsic limitations of this disease, such as low administration frequency and dosage, render most currently available nano-antibacterial strategies inapplicable. To address this challenge, a bio-targeted catalytic strategy that is based on a bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst (MoS 2 /Fe@mercaptophenylboronic acid@hyaluronic acid, MFBH) and suitable for treating bacterial endophthalmitis is proposed. The results show that MFBH exhibits high-efficiency peptidoglycan-targeted catalytic antibacterial capacity against both standard and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus . Notably, the in vivo results demonstrate that MFBH achieves effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis at an extremely low dose (≈4 µg kg −1 ) via a single intravitreal injection without causing retinal damage. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of MFBH is comparable to that of vancomycin. Mechanistic analysis reveals that MFBH induces enhanced ferroptosis-like bacterial killing by accelerating reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Further investigations show that the generation of abundant ROS is closely associated with the sulfur vacancies and exposed of reactive Mo 4+ on the surface of the prepared artificial biocatalyst. In summary, this bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst provides a promising strategy for treating endophthalmitis.},

  abstract     = {Liver fibrosis is a severe liver disease directly linked to chronic inflammation, in which hepatic macrophages play a key role. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is the receptor of nutrient-sensing hormone ghrelin that has essential functions in metabolism, inflammation, and wound-healing. However, the role of GHSR in liver fibrosis is unknown. This study uses a carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced liver fibrosis mouse model to investigate the role of macrophage GHSR in liver fibrosis. CCl 4 induces macrophage accumulation and inflammatory responses, noticeably increases GHSR expression in the liver. It is found that macrophage Ghsr deletion ( Ghsr-MϕKO ) attenuates CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis and inflammation, showing reduced hepatic monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and suppressed proinflammatory responses. In macrophages, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression is positively correlated with GHSR expression. GHSR-associated TGF-β1 in macrophages activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by promoting the crosstalk between macrophages and HSCs. Macrophage GHSR controls inflammation and TGF-β1 expression via protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated Forkhead box protein O 1 (Foxo1) phosphorylation at S273; Foxo1-S273D mutation, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of Foxo1 at S273, shows exacerbated CCl 4 -induced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, targeting the macrophage GHSR−Foxo1 signaling may provide a new strategy to treat liver fibrosis.},

This study demonstrates a breakthrough in overcoming the conventional fatigue limit ceiling in high-strength as-quenched martensitic steel by enhancing resistance to crack initiation. In the as-heat-treated state, high-angle boundaries with large elastic misfits and plastic incompatibility served as precursory sites for intrusions/extrusions (these are defined as “crack embryos”), eventually leading to fatigue crack initiation. Remarkably, after the pre-fatigue training, surface crack initiation is entirely suppressed, doubling the fatigue limit with minimal change in tensile strength. A novel concept of “crack embryo engineering” is introduced, which targets the prevention of crack embryo formation by extracting intrinsic microstructural self-optimization against fatigue deformation: macroscopic hardness homogenization and selective nano-hardening of the precursory sites. This self-optimization strategy offers a versatile approach to improving fatigue limit in general steels, providing an effective alternative to tempering heat treatment that inevitably sacrifices tensile strength.},

This study aims to develop and validate a Vision Transformer (ViT) model based on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to classify HER2-zero, -low, and -positive breast cancer patients and to explore its interpretability. The model is trained and validated on early enhancement MRI images from 708 patients in the FUSCC cohort and tested on 80 and 101 patients in the GFPH cohort and FHCMU cohort, respectively. The ViT model achieves AUCs of 0.80, 0.73, and 0.71 in distinguishing HER2-zero from HER2-low/positive tumors across the validation set of the FUSCC cohort and the two external cohorts. Furthermore, the model effectively classifies HER2-low and HER2-positive cases, with AUCs of 0.86, 0.80, and 0.79. Transcriptomics analysis identifies significant biological differences between HER2-low and HER2-positive patients, particularly in immune-related pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, Cox regression analysis demonstrates that the prediction score is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 2.52; p = 0.007). These findings provide a non-invasive approach for accurately predicting HER2 expression, enabling more precise patient stratification to guide personalized treatment strategies.

  abstract     = {Icephobic surfaces offer a passive protection strategy against icing hazards in industrial applications. However, the improvement of surface icephobicity is normally accompanied by a compromise in mechanical properties and restrains the practical application of current icephobic surfaces/materials. Here, a generic strategy for icephobic material design is reported to address this conflict through interfacial elastic instability prompted by the synergistic integration of fibrous construction (FC) frameworks with icephobic polymers. The FC-based material structures could induce periodically localised/amplified stress at the ice/solid interface, leading to interfacial elastic instability and facilitating effective ice detachment. Low ice adhesion strength is achieved, while the tensile strength of the materials is enhanced by 19 times more than the polymer matrix due to the reinforcement from the FC frameworks. Based on the serrated features of the shear forces and numerically simulated interfacial stress distribution, a new theoretical model is established to interpret the nature of interfacial elastic instability and undulatory interfacial stress. This work provides fundamental insights for designing high-performance icephobic materials that transcend traditional performance trade-offs, advancing both surface science and materials for practical ice mitigation.},

  abstract     = {The rapid emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has outpaced the development of traditional antibiotics, necessitating the exploration of more effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, the design of a Cu 7 S 4 multifunctional nanozyme, activated by near-infrared (NIR) light is presented, that demonstrates enhanced antibacterial activity. Cu 7 S 4 is synthesized with varying defect structures by utilizing different templates, which substantially optimize its absorption to H 2 O 2 and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) molecules. This process generates an optimal electronic structure, producing efficient antibacterial activity through photodynamic and photothermal synergetic processes. Specifically, the Cu 7 S 4 nanozyme with dual defects ( VCu and VCuCuCuSSS ) exhibits peroxidase-like (POD), catalase-like (CAT), and GSH-depletion properties, effectively inactivating drug-resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Notably, in a mouse wound model infected with P. aeruginosa , the nanozyme demonstrates significant antibacterial efficacy, promoting wound healing under NIR light. This multifunctional Cu 7 S 4 nanozyme presents a promising new strategy for combating drug-resistant bacterial infections.},

  abstract     = {Brain organoid technology has revolutionized the ability to model human neurodevelopment in vitro. However, current techniques remain limited by their reliance on simplified endothelial cell populations. Multi-Region Brain Organoids (MRBOs) are engineered that integrate cerebral, mid/hindbrain, and complex endothelial organoids into one structure. Unlike earlier approaches based on isolated Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, the endothelial organoids contain diverse vascular cell types, including progenitors, mature endothelial cells, pericytes, proliferating angiogenic cells, and stromal cells. The strategy employs sequential modulation of key developmental pathways to generate individual organoids, followed by optimized fusion conditions that maintain regional identities while supporting cellular integration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals that MRBOs develop discrete neural populations specific to each brain region alongside specialized endothelial populations that establish paracrine signaling networks. Integration analysis with human fetal brain data shows that MRBOs contribute to 80% of cellular clusters found in human fetal brain tissue (Carnegie stages 12–16). CellChat analysis identifies 13 previously uncharacterized endothelial-neural signaling interactions. Endothelial-derived factors are uncovered that support intermediate progenitor populations during hindbrain development, but not cerebral development, revealing a role for endothelial populations in regional brain patterning. This platform enables matching of multiple developmental regions while incorporating endothelial components, providing opportunities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders with disrupted neural-endothelial interactions.},

  abstract     = {Nitric oxide (NO), a pivotal redox signaling molecule, coordinates plant development and immune responses through S -nitrosylation-mediated protein modification. While NO-dependent S -nitrosylation fine-tunes immune responses, whether pathogens hijack this process to subvert plant immunity remains unclear. Here it is shown that S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which maintains NO homeostasis by degrading S -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), positively regulates tomato resistance to Phytophthora capsici . Active-site mutations in GSNOR abolished its function in plant defense. Remarkably, GSNOR is manipulated by PcRD18, which is an RxLR effector of P. capsici that is involved in virulence of this oomycete pathogen. PcRD18 elevates the cellular NO content and S -nitrosylation levels by dually inhibiting GSNOR activity and promoting its autophagy-mediated degradation via enhanced ATG8c interaction. Structure analysis reveals critical PcRD18-GSNOR interaction interfaces and mutations in these sites of PcRD18 abolish its ability to interact with GSNOR, thereby blocking the effector's ability to elevate NO levels, suppress the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and enhance virulence. GSNOR mutations disrupting PcRD18 binding produced a mutant form of GSNOR enhancing Phytophthora resistance. These findings unveil a pathogen strategy to subvert NO homeostasis through effector-mediated hijacking of GSNOR and suggest that engineering the host-pathogen interface to disrupt the interaction between GSNOR and PcRD18 will enhance crop disease resistance.},

  abstract     = {Radiation-induced damage to normal tissue seriously disrupts the execution of radiotherapy (RT) and therefore attenuates its efficacy. Exploring new strategies to enhance the efficacy and reduce toxicity of RT has great clinical importance. Here, a PD-L1 affibody (Z PD-L1 ) grafted Janus Ag/Ag 2 S nanoarchitectures is developed as “reactive oxygen species lever” to enhance radiocatalysis and relieve radiation enteritis. The nanoplatform can achieve abundant energy deposition in the form of high-energy electrons within tumors upon X-ray exposure. Subsequently, the transfer of electrons from Ag 2 S to Ag moiety enables effective electron–hole pair separation, which greatly improves the radiocatalysis efficiency in generating highly toxic hydroxyl radical (•OH). Due to the specific binding to tumor PD-L1, Z PD-L1 endows this nanoplatform with efficient tumor targeting and meanwhile reduces immune suppression of T cells by achieving PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, intensifying RT-induced immunologic cell death. Notably, the presence of the Ag moiety allows the nanoplatform to act as an H 2 O 2 scavenger in intestinal tissues during metabolism, effectively relieving radiation enteritis. Moreover, systemic administration of the nanoplatform coupled with Mn-DOTA can guide RT timing selection by magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, this nanoplatform can substantially improve RT effectiveness with reduced radiation enteritis, demonstrating considerable potential in tumor RT.},

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates that optical absorption of the CsPbBr 3 quantum dots can be significantly enhanced through monolithic integration with the Tamm plasmon (TP) structure. This integration enables the resulting TP photodetector to achieve a higher photocurrent and a more linear power dependence compared to the reference device with a nonresonant configuration. The enhancement is confined to the designed resonant energy, while photons with off-resonance energies are fully reflected, making the TP photodetector an ideal candidate for compact and efficient image sensors, eliminating the need for additional filters or bulky microlenses for color discrimination or photon collection. Furthermore, the photocurrent generated by the TP photodetector can be regulated by varying light pulse stimulations, enabling it to mimic the synaptic dynamics of the human brain. By integrating the functions of perception, processing, and memorization of visual images, its potential for facial recognition through simulation based on a 64 × 64 array of TP photodetectors under the artificial neural network-based weight-update expectation thresholding model is demonstrated. These findings mark a significant step forward in utilizing all-inorganic perovskite materials for compact, color-filter-free image sensors and open new avenues for photonic neural computations on a single platform.},

  abstract     = {While previous studies have primarily examined the impacts of singular interventions on GHG emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removals (CDR), few studies explore complementarities and antagonisms when multiple interventions are simultaneously operationalized. Here, the aim is to examine how stacking of two pathways for mitigation–CDR, via soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and GHG emissions avoidance via antimethanogenic feed additives–impacts net GHG emissions associated with sheep production. A nonlinear programing approach is invoked to elicit optimal combinations of grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives to maximize farm profit and/or minimize net GHG emissions. It is shown that stacking multiple interventions realizes that greater abatement and profit do any singular intervention. Adoption of 3-NOP feed supplement with 15- and 30-paddock high stocking rate systems is the most prospective stacked intervention for concurrent profit maximization and emissions minimization. It is contended that (1) increasing payments for farming of carbon and ecosystems services relative to that of wool and meat will stimulate participation in carbon markets, (2) economics of participation in carbon markets tend to be more favorable for larger farms than smaller farms due to economies of scale and (3) adoption of optimal grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives can realize more profit from sheep production and carbon farming than enterprises that only derive income from sheep production.},

The results demonstrated that podocyte-specific RIPK3-KO alleviated albuminuria, mesangial matrix proliferation, foot process fusion, and podocyte loss in DKD mice. Additionally, podocyte RIPK3 is upregulated in renal biopsies with DKD and expression is negatively correlated with albuminuria. In vitro, knockdown of RIPK3 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibition with GSK'872 prevented podocyte injury. RNA sequencing of mouse podocytes revealed that the knockdown of RIPK3 can alleviate HG-induced activation of the NF-κB-related inflammatory pathways. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 by GSK'872 alleviated podocyte damage, and reduced proteinuria in DKD mice. Overall, these results uncovered a novel role of podocyte RIPK3 in promoting podocyte injury and DKD progression by regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling independent of necroptosis, offering novel insights and potential therapeutic strategies for DKD management.},

  abstract     = {Dysregulated RNA splicing has emerged as a pervasive yet understudied feature of cancer. The small GTPase RAC1 undergoes splicing changes in multiple cancers. However, the in vivo functional disparities between the two major RAC1 isoforms, RAC1B and the canonical RAC1A, and their therapeutic implications in cancer remain largely unexplored. Here, RAC1B is found to be significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, particularly in those harboring EGFR mutations. Through isoform-specific overexpression and depletion assays in murine and cellular models of EGFR -mutant LUAD, it is revealed that RAC1B, but not RAC1A, promotes LUAD cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, RAC1B stabilizes EGFR by inhibiting its lysosome trafficking and degradation. This function is mediated by the specific binding of RAC1B to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GDS1, which activates RAC1B. The splicing factor RBM10 which is frequently mutated in LUAD is further identified as a negative regulator of RAC1B . Importantly, utilizing LUAD patient-derived organoid and xenograft models, it is demonstrated that targeting RAC1B potently suppresses tumor growth and enhances the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. Together, the findings delineate functional differences and underlying mechanisms of RAC1 isoforms in LUAD tumorigenesis, highlighting a promising therapeutic route via targeting RAC1B for lung cancer.},

Although promising, the lack of appropriate structural design strategy and limitation of sensing performance in the clinical samples remain challenging for the practical application of nanozymes. Herein, a novel copper silicate nanozyme (CSHSs-Ar) with enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity is synthesized through a facile in situ valence-engineered approach. After the optimization of synthesis, the resultant CSHSs-Ar nanozymes containing nearly 60% of Cu + hold a higher peroxidase-like catalytic activity and a better catalytic specificity than the other two derivatives (CSHSs and CSHSs-air). Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that CSHSs-Ar nanozymes are more beneficial toward the activation of H 2 O 2 compared with CSHSs and CSHSs-air. On this basis, the well-developed CSHSs-Ar nanozyme-involved system is employed as an efficient colorimetric sensor for the detection of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) and prediction for periodontitis. Moreover, several visual molecular logic gates are explored as a proof of concept to the application of CSHSs-Ar nanozymes with superior peroxidase-like catalytic activity.

In a mouse I/R model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model, it shows that HINT3 expression is downregulated after I/R. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of HINT3 exacerbates myocardial injury, impairs cardiac function, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, whereas HINT3 overexpression mitigates these effects.

  abstract     = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory lung injury for which effective therapeutic agents are lacking. Excessive endothelial cell (EC) activation is a critical trigger of inflammation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as prominent regulators of inflammatory responses. The previous study identified secretory autophagosomes (SAPs), a novel class of EVs, as a prognostic marker in ARDS, raising questions of whether and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Here, it is shown that inflamed macrophage-derived SAPs (MSAPs) exacerbate lung injury by weakening the role of ECs as gatekeepers of immune cell transport within the lung. Bioinformatics and functional studies reveal that tRF-5004b is a key molecule of MSAPs in mediating endothelial activation. Mechanically, tRF-5004b directly interacts with the nuclear transporter KPNA2, thereby facilitating the association between KPNA2 and the transcription factor p65. This interaction enhances p65 nuclear translocation, a process implicated in EC activation. Additionally, the level of tRF-5004b is positively correlated with the severity of ARDS, and patients with high tRF-5004b levels have a poor prognosis. Overall, it is found that tRF-5004b-enriched SAPs induce acute lung injury by promoting p65 nuclear translocation to activate ECs, suggesting that tRF-5004b may be a novel therapeutic target for ARDS.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in proteomics sequencing have significantly enhanced our ability to explore cell-type-specific signatures within complex tissues, providing critical insights into disease mechanisms. However, current proteomic technologies often suffer from low resolution, resulting in the mixing of multiple cell types during profiling. To address this limitation, cell-type deconvolution methods are developed to infer cellular composition from proteomic data. While most existing deconvolution methods are focused on transcriptomics, their application to proteomics is hindered by the weak correlation and divergent quantification between transcriptome and proteome data. Although a few proteomic-specific deconvolution methods are recently emerged, they still exhibit limited capability and performance, partly because they only extract shared information from individual samples while ignoring higher-order relationships between them. Here, GraphDEC is proposed, a novel graph neural network-based method for dec iphering cell type proportions in proteomic profiling data. GraphDEC begins by simulating bulk samples from single-cell proteomic data to create reference data, which is then used to infer cell types in target datasets. Specifically, GraphDEC employs an autoencoder to extract low-dimensional representations from both reference and target proteomic data, enabling the construction of similarity relationships among samples. These relationships, combined with proteomic data, are processed by a graph neural network that integrates a multi-channel mechanism and a hybrid neighborhood-aware approach to learn highly effective representations. To optimize the model, GraphDEC utilizes multiple loss functions, including triplet loss, domain adaptation loss, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, ensuring robust performance and mitigating batch effects. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that GraphDEC achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic proteomic datasets from different sequencing technologies and real-world spatial proteomic datasets. Furthermore, GraphDEC exhibits strong generalization capabilities, showing high efficiency when applied to cross-species proteomic data and even transcriptomics.},

  abstract     = {Plasma volume fluctuations limit the utility of circulating lipidomics in chronic heart failure (CHF). In contrast, red blood cell (RBC) membrane lipidomics may serve as stable biomarkers that are unaffected by plasma volume changes. Two cohorts are included to investigate the association between RBC indicators and CHF. RBC membrane lipidomics is first used to characterize CHF and its impact on plasma volume overload (PVO) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The first cohort (n = 507,638) shows that the erythrocyte stress index (ESI), better than traditional RBC indicators, is associated with the prevalence of CHF with odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 1.57 (95% CI,1.55-1.59). ESI is also linked with in-hospital death in CHF. Another cohort (n = 1,550) indicated RBC membrane lipidomics ceramide subtype Cer 18:0;O2/16:0 and lysophosphatidylethanolamine subtype LPE 18:0 has an AUC of PVO with 0.75 and 0.61. The above two lipids are risk factors of PVO with OR of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.47-1.80) and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06-1.16). They also are risk factors for MACE, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07) and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.10).

  abstract     = {Transition metal oxides (TMOs) simultaneously possessing strong spin-orbit coupling, near room-temperature ferromagnetism, and excellent conductivity are scarce while they show great potential applications in oxide spintronics. Here, a TMO with all these features is reported, existing as an interfacial phase in the 4 d Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 layer sandwiched by two LaMnO 3 layers. This phase is well conductive and ferromagnetic in a wide temperature range, with the highest Curie temperature of ≈275 K among the 4 d /5 d -TMOs. Particularly, this interfacial phase shows a considerably improved saturation magnetization (≈2 µ B /Ru, twice that of the bulk counterpart), and a greatly reduced coercive force. All these features are highly desired by the application of spin-orbit torque. Due to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, such a Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 interfacial phase exhibits a significantly larger anomalous Hall conductivity than the typical 3 d oxide ferromagnet La 2/3 Sr 1/3 MnO 3 near room temperature. Analyses based on the techniques of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized-neutron reflectometry, and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a magnetic exchange interaction between the interfacial phases of Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 and LaMnO 3 and an obvious expansion of the interfacial Mn─O─Mn bond angle, stabilizing the high-temperature ferromagnetic state of the CSRO/LMO interface.},

  abstract     = {Cas12j-8 is a compact Cas nuclease discovered from the metagenome of giant bacteriophages, consisting of only 717 amino acids and recognizing the ‘5-TTN-3′ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. However, its low gene editing efficiency in mammalian cells limits its application in therapeutic gene editing. To address this limitation, structure-guided mutagenesis is employed to replace key negatively charged residues with arginine, strengthening DNA binding. The resulting quintuple mutant, engineered Cas12j-8 (enCas12j-8), demonstrates robust on-target editing efficiency comparable to LbCas12a while maintaining low off-target effects. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs) are developed using enCas12j-8, achieving up to 29.54-fold C-to-T and 36.57-fold A-to-G conversion efficiency compared with the wild-type at the dominated sites, respectively. Notably, enCas12j-8 enables multiplexed editing of three genomic loci simultaneously via a single crRNA array, achieving efficiencies comparable to single-guide approaches. Additionally, enCas12j-8-ABE facilitates the disruption of splice acceptor sites, effectively inducing exon skipping in the SOD1 gene. This strategy holds potential significance for therapeutic genome modulation. These findings establish enCas12j-8 as a versatile, high-precision tool for genome engineering, combining efficient delivery, multiplexing capability, and compatibility with diverse editing modalities.},

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of micrometer-to-millimeter components, referred to as “macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA),” offers an efficient approach for constructing cell-scale 3D bioactive structures with flexible modular designs. Compared with available 3D bio-printing or conventional modular assembly of cell-material units, MSA is advantageous in decoupling material preparation and cell loading processes by directing cell adhesion after the preparation of 3D structures, which minimizes the trade-off between cell viability and material selection. But the challenge lies in efficient self-sorting of different cells and spatially controlled cell distribution. Hence, MSA is combined with the surface chemistry of orthogonally specific peptides to different cells and magnetic manipulation, and fabricated 3D bioactive structures that direct cell sorting. Microscale polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) components are modified with 1) Arg-Glu-Asp-Val and Val-Ala-Pro-Gly peptides affinitive to endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), respectively, and 2) host/guest molecules as “supramolecular glues” for precise structuring and interfacial bonding. Self-sorting and spatially controlled adhesion of ECs and SMCs is achieved to mimic layered vascular structures. This “Lego-like” strategy is free of compromising cell viability with structure design, thus contributing to spatially intricate and bioactive 3D architectures, and promoting the development of MSA from fundamental advances to applications.},

  abstract     = {The nervous system plays a pivotal regulatory role in the maintenance of bone homeostasis, and the protective effects of dopamine and its receptors on bone metabolism are emerging. Despite these protective roles, the functional contribution of dopaminergic signaling, particularly through specific receptor subtypes, remains unexplored in glucocorticoid (GC)-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) pathogenesis. Here, the dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1), a G protein-coupled receptor with few identified bone-related functions, is identified as a positive regulator of GC-induced apoptosis. The dopamine levels in the serum of GC-associated ONFH patients are significantly lower than those in the normal population. The protein and gene expression levels of DRD1 and the number of DRD1-positive cells are abnormally elevated in the pathological state of GC-associated ONFH, and DRD1 is expressed in osteoblasts. Overexpression of DRD1 attenuates GC-induced osteogenic inhibition and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, overexpression of DRD1 elevates cAMP levels, activates downstream protein kinase A, and inhibits GC-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis through the ATF3/CHOP signaling pathway, thus improving bone homeostasis. Importantly, Madopar, an FDA-approved dopaminergic agent, inhibits GC-induced osteoblastic apoptosis and ONFH via DRD1. Collectively, this study not only deciphers a previously unrecognized DRD1-mediated neuro-osteogenic axis but also repurposes an FDA-approved drug (Madopar) for precision ONFH management.},

The docking step utilizes a novel fingerprint that greatly simplifies and accelerates the surface complementarity evaluation. As proof-of-concept, we designed protein binders to target three distinct epitopes on two different oncogenic targets; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-7 receptor-α (IL-7Rα). Experimental characterization of only 24 candidates identified nanomolar binders against each of the target epitopes, where the binders belonged to five different folds.

  abstract     = {Disturbed blood flow and the resulting oscillatory low shear stress (OSS) are key contributors to vascular endothelial dysfunction and the initiation of atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mediators that translate abnormal hemodynamic signals into pathological vascular endothelial responses remain unclear. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are classical mechanosensors in the vascular endothelium. Here, using vascular endothelial-specific knockout mice, in vitro parallel plate flow chamber systems, and phosphoproteomic analysis, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is identified as a central mediator of OSS-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction. Mechanistically, OSS promotes GRK2 phosphorylation at serine 29, which subsequently activates the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), increasing the expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecules intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). In parallel, AP-1 promotes nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A 1 (NR4A1) transcription, which anchors liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to the nucleus and suppresses downstream AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, leading to metabolic dysregulation and impaired vascular endothelial homeostasis. These findings underscore the GRK2/AP-1 signaling axis as a crucial mechanotransduction cascade linking disturbed flow to vascular endothelial dysfunction. Given the important role of GPCRs in mechanotransduction, targeting GRK2 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis.},

In this study, a 1D phase transition ion-pair compound is investigated, triethylmethylammonium bis(1,2-maleonitriledithiolato)nickelate (abbr. [Et 3 MeN][Ni(mnt) 2 ], 1 ), composed of flexible Et 3 MeN + cation and planar radical [Ni(mnt) 2 ] − anion. This salt undergoes a paraelastic-ferroelastic phase transition at ≈233/224 K (on heating/cooling), driven by spin-lattice interactions. Importantly, the phase transition couples spontaneous strain, bistable magnetism with switchable dielectric properties. Another distinctive feature of 1 is its pronounced dielectric anisotropy and high dielectric permittivity, which arise due to a barrier layer capacitor effect due to cation displacement polarization and significant electron polarization of the highly conjugated anions. These findings provide a versatile molecular design strategy for developing magnetoelectric and mechanically multifunctional materials, with promising applications in next-generation electronic and smart devices that leverage coupled physical properties.},

  abstract     = {Current attempts to transform our fossil fuel-based society into a sustainable one involve learning from and employing the biochemistry of nature. The process of photosynthesis is exemplary for utilizing sunlight as a regenerative energy source. Enzymes like hydrogenases, which reduce protons to molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) under ambient conditions, are model biocatalysts for generating sustainable, clean fuels. In green algae, photosynthesis and hydrogenases are coupled through ferredoxin, a small electron transfer protein. Here, it is shown that several plant-type ferredoxins can interact with a chemically synthesized active site cofactor analog of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in a way that allows comparably high H 2 evolution rates. UV–vis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the natural [2Fe-2S] clusters of the ferredoxin hosts must be absent for a functional interaction of polypeptide and cofactor mimic and that the apo-ferredoxins shield the H 2 -producing cofactor from the solvent. The hybrid proteins exhibited higher O 2 tolerance than natural [FeFe]-hydrogenases and generated H 2 in light-dependent cascades based on photosystem I or the chemical photosensitizer proflavine. These features and the combination of natural hosts and cofactors might contribute to establishing sustainable light-dependent H 2 production systems.},

Benefiting from the “guidance” of ε-poly-L-lysine on O3HT chains alignment, the graft copolymer with optimized grafting density exhibits an extended conjugation length and increased crystallite size of O3HT. Thin films of three copolymers, upon doping, demonstrate appreciable conductivity under ambient conditions. EPL- g -O3HT-1 could be fully break down over 12 days by enzymatic degradation. EPL- g -O3HT-1 also displays excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, attributed to its high ɛ-poly-L-lysine content. It is further demonstrated the versatility of EPL- g -O3HTs in transient electronics for electromyography sensors for muscle signal acquisition and as the channel material in organic electrochemical transistors. Combining tunable conductivity, controlled biodegradability, and antimicrobial properties, EPL- g -O3HT copolymers hold significant potential for diverse transient electronic applications, including skin and implantable electronics, where degradable electronics with antimicrobial properties are highly desirable.},

  abstract     = {Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most common chronic diseases among children globally, affecting the health and quality of life of children. Despite various treatments, cariogenic bacteria persist, resulting in a pessimistic outlook for the prevention and treatment of ECC. A notable presence of persister cells is found within the cariogenic bacterial population, with their dormancy enabling them to evade antiseptics. Mechanistically, the downregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) leads to protein aggresome formation, converting active cariogenic bacteria into persisters, which confers dual defensive barriers through metabolic inertness and concomitant reduction of membrane permeability, rendering conventional antimicrobials ineffective. Given these findings, Ti 3 C 2 MXene, a 2D nanomaterial acting as a “nanothermal knife” to disrupt persister cell membranes is developed. Ti 3 C 2 -mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) upregulated HSPs, inhibited aggresome formation, and prevented persister dormancy, showing efficacy against planktonic and biofilm cariogenic persisters. This PTT strategy demonstrates remarkable efficacy against planktonic cariogenic persisters and multispecies biofilms. Furthermore, the in vivo establishment of aggressive caries models reveals a substantial reduction of cariogenic pathogens following combined Ti 3 C 2 -mediated PTT and antimicrobial treatment, effectively suppressing caries progression. This light-assisted antibacterial strategy may aid ECC prevention.},

However, most previous works usually necessitate abundant inputs equivalent to signal probes or computing elements, and present only single-channel outputs, causing DNAs’ over-consumption, limited computing functions, flexibility, and maneuverability. Herein, assisted with a catalytic-hairpin-assembly (CHA) amplifier and rational orthogonal design, the first universal weak-inputs-strong-outputs DNA system (named CP-WISO) with contrary logic responses is reported, which exhibited noticeable advantages over previous works. 1) Excellent FRET effect of dual-signal DNA probes (Cy3/Cy5) brought enriched contrary logic output channels; 2) One-step CHA amplification avoided DNAs’ over-consumption, high cost, and complexity; 3) A library of CP-WISO DNA logic nanodevices with the manipulated orthogonal design is realized, accompanied with enhanced flexibility, maneuverability, and computing proficiency; 4) Even and odd parity generators/checkers (pG/pC) are concurrently operated based on the “XOR∧XNOR”-type CP-WISO nanodevice, ensuring the recognition of erroneous bits and secure molecular data transmission; 5) Additionally, taking miRNA-499, miRNA-21 and miRNA-122 as alternative model targets, the “YES∧NOT” and “AND∧NAND” CP-WISO nanodevices achieved intelligent identification and ratiometric fluorescent detection of miRNAs in human serums, promoting the early diagnostics of acute myocardial infarction and liver cancer.},

  abstract     = {Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) playing a critical role in its progression. Metabolic reprogramming, particularly lactate accumulation, drives immune suppression within the TME. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 30 LUAD samples, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving 29,863 patients and 55,586 controls, and clinical data from 220 LUAD patients, we identified N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) as a key pathogenic gene in LUAD, strongly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that NDRG1 stabilizes lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby enhancing glycolysis and promoting lactate accumulation. This process fosters immune suppression by inducing M2 macrophage polarization, impairing CD8 + T cell function, and upregulating immunosuppressive genes. Furthermore, histone H3K18 lactylation in macrophages exacerbates this immunosuppressive state. Clinically, elevated NDRG1 expression correlates with increased PD-L1 levels, a higher abundance of immunosuppressive macrophages, and reduced CD8 + T cell infiltration, contributing to immunotherapy resistance. Conversely, low NDRG1 expression is associated with enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration and improved therapeutic outcomes. Preclinical studies demonstrated targeting NDRG1 suppresses tumor growth, alleviates immune suppression, and boosts anti-PD-L1 efficacy. These findings establish NDRG1 as a critical LUAD regulator and a promising immunotherapy target.},

The formation of Ag 40 @Ag 12 involves three stages, including initial crystallization of Ag 40 NCs, partial decomposition (self-sacrifice) of Ag 40 NCs enabling Ag 12 assembly, and epitaxial-growth crystallization of the Ag 12 NCs. The partially decomposed Ag 40 NCs provide starting materials for the formation and crystallization of Ag 12 NCs to encapsulate the Ag 40 seeds, while the residual Ag 40 loses its crystallinity in solution simultaneously.

Transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channel inhibition mitigates tubular injury and renal fibrosis in murine models of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and 2-month chronic post–ischemia-reperfusion injury (2m post-I/R). Through integrated analysis of single-cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from UUO mice treated with the selective TRPC6 inhibitor SH045, here the renoprotective cell composition and cell type-specific transcriptional programs are defined. We explored translational aspects by conducting an in-depth scRNA-Seq analysis of kidney samples from patients with CKD. These results reveal global transcriptional shifts with a dramatic diversification of inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Notably, a distinct subpopulation of novel endothelial cells is delineated, which is termed ECRIN, that regulate inflammatory networks implicating VEGF and GAS signaling pathways. The data also indicates that inhibition of TRPC6 channels triggers a Prnp transcription factor regulatory network, which contributes to the alleviation of renal fibrosis. The key findings are supported at the protein level by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. We observed similar patterns in the chronic 2m postI/R injury model. These findings provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic benefits of TRPC6 inhibition in CKD.},

Developing a culture system to bridge the gap is thus crucial. Here, a multicellular approach is employed using human glia and vascular cells to optimize a 3D brain vascular niche model that enabled not only long-term culture of patient derived GBM cells but also recapitulation of key features of GBM heterogeneity, in particular invasion behavior and vascular association. Comparative transcriptomics of identical patient derived GBM cells in 3D and in vivo xenotransplants models revealed that glia-vascular contact induced genes concerning neural/glia development, synaptic regulation, as well as immune suppression. This gene signature displayed region specific enrichment in the leading edge and microvascular proliferation zones in human GBM and predicted poor prognosis. Gene variance analysis also uncovered histone demethylation and xylosyltransferase activity as main themes for gene adaption of GBM cells in vivo. Furthermore, the 3D model also demonstrated the capacity to provide a quiescence and a protective niche against chemotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are dynamic macromolecular condensates that act as crucibles to modulate cellular processes. Since MLOs form in the absence of lipid membranes, it is important to understand how their effective regulation is achieved by the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) system. To address this question, a comprehensive mapping of the proteostasis network (PN) of MLOs, comprising over 220 000 protein–protein interactions is reported. This analysis reveals how regulatory proteins (PN proteins) occupy central roles in the overall protein–protein interaction network of MLOs. It is then investigated which branches of the PN are most important in the regulation of MLOs, finding that the anabolic component, which makes up ≈30% of the PN, is more closely involved than the catabolic component, which makes up the remaining ≈70% of the PN. It is also found that translation-related PN proteins and molecular chaperones play central roles in MLO regulation. Finally, how specificity may be achieved despite shared PN components is explored. These findings suggest that HSP70 chaperones function as generic MLO regulators, while client-specific HSP70 co-chaperones confer specificity to the chaperone action. These results identify the composition of the PN of MLOs, rationalize its organization, and reveal central roles of molecular chaperones in protein regulation within MLOs.},

  abstract     = {Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy without effective treatment due to limited knowledge of its development and tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics are employed to comprehensively investigate the development trajectories and the TME. The results revealed that PSCC cells mimicked the differentiation and tissue organization of normal penile epithelium, independent of the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status. Notably, a spatial subtype, Tum_1, appeared at early stage of tumor differentiation and in tumor–normal boundary regions. This subtype exhibited enhanced basal-like and stemness features and showed high LAMC2 expression, which activated laminin-integrin signaling via ITGA6/ITGB4, promoting tumor invasiveness. Furthermore, the results indicated that HPV-positive basal stem-like neoplasms dampened the immune function of T cells and macrophages, promoting an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor progression. Supporting this, the patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma who have high expression of HPV-positive Tum_1 signatures derived greater benefit from PD-1 blockade therapy. In summary, the findings provide a comprehensive spatial landscape of the PSCC TME and suggest potential treatment approaches targeting laminin-integrin interaction and immunotherapy, especially in HPV-positive patients.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is widely acknowledged as a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, facilitating plaque formation through various mechanisms. Although both conditions are linked to the aging process, the relationship among cellular senescence, diabetes, and atherosclerosis remains inadequately understood. This study presents evidence that elevated glucose levels expedite the progression of atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage senescence. Increased glucose levels are shown to induce senescence in macrophages, which enhances the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and facilitates the formation of foam cells. This mechanism is driven by lactate production via glycolysis, which activates the lactate receptor GPR132, thereby promoting macrophage senescence. The activation of GPR132 is implicated in mediating senescence and lipid uptake through Src phosphorylation. The deletion of GPR132 markedly reduces macrophage senescence and atherosclerosis in mouse models. Furthermore, saracatinib, a specific Src inhibitor, has been demonstrated to effectively alleviate diabetic atherosclerosis in experimental settings. In clinical samples, elevated plasma lactate levels and the activation of the GPR132-Src pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are positively associated with coronary stenosis. These findings propose a potential mechanism through which diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis via the lactate-GPR132-Src pathway, underscoring macrophage senescence as a pivotal target in the context of diabetic atherosclerosis.},

  abstract     = {Aging impairs nutrient metabolism and accelerates biological aging, negatively affecting health and longevity. The Targeting Aging and Longevity with Exogenous Nucleotides (TALENTs) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05243108) aimed to explore whether nucleotides (NTs) supplementation can delay biological aging and improve health outcomes in the elderly. The trial is a 19-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Chengdu, China, with 121 participants (60–70 years). Participants are randomly assigned to either NTs (1.2 g day −1 ) or placebo group (1:1). The results of primary outcomes showed that NTs had significantly greater reduction in median DNA methylation age compared to placebo over 19 weeks (β = −3.08 years, 95% CI: −5.07 to −1.10, P = 0.0023), with a trend toward reduction observed over 11 weeks (β = −1.94 years, 95% CI: −4.32 to 0.45, P = 0.11); whereas no significant difference changes of leukocyte telomere length are showed between groups (week 11: β = 0.09, 95% CI: −0.10 to 0.29, P = 0.36; week 19: β = 0.12, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.28, P = 0.18). Insulin sensitivity improved in the NTs group, with a significant reduction in HOMA-IR over 19 weeks (β = −0.45, 95% CI: −0.86 to −0.04, P = 0.033). No severe adverse events or significant changes in safety indicators are reported. Together, our findings establish that NTs may delay biological aging and improve insulin sensitivity with a well-tolerated safety profile.},
