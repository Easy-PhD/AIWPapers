  abstract     = {The etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. From a pathological point of view, several complex hypotheses, such as impaired neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and aggregation of amyloid- (A ), are considered crucial contributors to the pathophysiology of AD. Recent studies have primarily focused on AD treatment strategies targeting drugs that intervene in cerebral deposition of aggregated amyloid- (A ) polymers, often found in the form of amyloid plaques. In this paper, we present intuitive mathematical models that clarify the treatment of AD in the presence of inhibitory drugs. These models elucidate the intricate kinetics involved in A formation and the interaction of drugs with these processes. We discuss two categories of drugs: first, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act as monomer inhibitors of A aggregation, and second, drugs that directly interact with A aggregated polymers. We initially analyze each drug independently and then assess their combined effects. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the first type of drug reduces the equilibrium state value of aggregated filaments, whereas the second model of drug exhibits even greater efficacy in reducing the equilibrium state value of aggregated filaments. Furthermore, we conduct simulations of the simultaneous application of both drugs. The results are compared with the experimental data.},

  abstract     = {Onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, is a vector-borne disease caused by Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by infected female blackflies. It affects millions of people globally, with the greatest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we develop a deterministic mathematical model that integrates multiple control measures, including sterile insect technique (SIT), mechanical control, chemical control, public health education, and ivermectin treatment, to manage the transmission of onchocerciasis. We employ the next-generation matrix method to calculate the blackfly offspring reproduction number and the basic reproduction number . Sensitivity analysis, conducted using the normalized forward sensitivity index, highlights the biting rate as the most positive influence on driving onchocerciasis dynamics, while the mortality rate of female blackflies has a significant negative impact on disease containment. To identify the optimal control strategy for onchocerciasis infections, we apply optimal control theory, considering five time-dependent controls which are public health education, treatment, mechanical control, SIT, and chemical control. Using Pontryagin's maximum principle, we derive the optimality system for controlling onchocerciasis. By implementing forward-backward Runge–Kutta method in Matlab, we identify the most optimal strategy for controlling, preventing, and treating onchocerciasis in both human and blackfly populations. The results suggest that a combined strategy focusing on public health education, treatment, and chemical control offers the most effective approach for combating onchocerciasis.},

The study examines equilibrium points, with a specific focus on the tumor-free and high-tumor state, to evaluate local stability. The fixed-point theorem is applied to confirm the existence and uniqueness of solutions, and global stability is established through the Hyers–Ulam–Rassias method. Numerical simulations, carried out using the zwo-step Adams-Bashforth method across various fractional orders, unveil the system's complex behaviors.

In order to prevent and mitigate this degradation, a better understanding of its causes is urgently needed. In this endeavor, mathematical models of ecosystem structure and function are useful tools. An ecological model is presented here that is both global and applicable to terrestrial and marine environments. An interaction between plant–herbivore–carnivore–omnivore is examined in this study. To determine sensitive parameters, a global sensitivity analysis was performed. The equilibria and stability of the system have been analyzed analytically as well as numerically. Additionally, different kinds of bifurcation are discussed (transcritical, saddle-node, and Hopf). A bistable behavior was observed in the system. A very low herbivore consumption rate will cause carnivores and herbivores to become extinct, while a slightly high value will cause all populations to survive. In population models, stochasticity enhances accuracy, realism, and utility. Consequently, we extend the proposed model from its deterministic version to its stochastic version. An important feature of the noise-induced perturbed system is the occurrence of noise-induced transitions.},

  abstract     = {Discrete orthogonal moments, such as the dual-Hahn moments, often exhibit limitations in accurately reconstructing signals, which reduces their effectiveness in applications that require precise recovery, particularly for 1D signals and color images. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel transform called the quaternionic integer reversible dual-Hahn transform (QIRDHT). This innovative approach enables simultaneous and lossless processing of 1D signals and color images, while being particularly well suited for resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, chaotic systems play a crucial role in cryptography, especially for secure key generation. However, the classical Hénon system has several drawbacks, including a restricted range of control parameters, limited sensitivity to initial conditions, and a tendency to generate periodic sequences. To overcome these limitations, we propose an enhanced hyperchaotic system that combines the dynamics of the Hénon system and logistic maps. This new hyperchaotic system exhibits richer dynamic behavior and a broader range of control parameters, significantly improving the security of encryption schemes. By integrating QIRDHT with this hyperchaotic map, we develop an efficient scheme for generating and extracting multiple zero-watermarks. The robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated against various geometric and common signal processing attacks using different medical images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of PSNR, BER, and NC, ensuring enhanced protection of medical images.},

First, we establish by exploiting the semigroup theory that the system is well-posed. Through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov functional, we establish the exponential stability result for the solutions of the system. The exponential stability of the system's solutions is established under a pertinent assumption regarding the weight of the delay. This assumption posits that the damping effect through heat conduction is sufficiently potent to stabilize the system, even when a time delay is introduced. Importantly, the robustness of our result is noteworthy, as it does not hinge on any specific relationships among system parameters.},

The proposed methodologies center on a subgradient extragradient approach that combines an inertial technique, a self-adaptive procedure, and a viscosity approximation scheme. These algorithms use variable step sizes that are dynamically updated in accordance with previous iteration outcomes. A key advantage of the proposed methods is their ability to function eliminating the need for prior knowledge of Lipschitz constants or line search techniques. Instead, the step sizes are determined through simple calculations at each iteration. The convergence analysis is established under relaxed assumptions.

The nonlocal term is introduced in the intraspecific competition among the predator species. A density-dependent cross-diffusion is considered to model the movement behavior of species. First, the temporal system is examined, where the existence, boundedness, and stability of the equilibrium points are ascertained. Bifurcation analysis also reveals the presence of saddle-node, transcritical, Hopf bifurcations, and codimension-2 bifurcation such as the Bogdano–Takens bifurcation. The behavior of the system is inspected both in the presence and absence of nonlocal interaction. It is observed that the nonlocal interaction tends to destabilize the coexisting equilibrium. For lower values of diffusion coefficient, spatially nonhomogeneous solutions are detected. For higher values of diffusion coefficient, domain-induced Turing instability switching is observed. Moreover, when the domain size is small, the coexisting equilibrium is stable irrespective of the value of the diffusion coefficient. Furthermore, the stabilizing effect of harvesting effort is also seen. The formulated system is numerically solved using the operator splitting method. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate all the theoretical findings.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript provides a comprehensive investigation of the Zabolotskaya–Khokhlov (Z-K) equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation essential for modeling wave propagation in acoustics. The main goal is to formulate and assess a hybrid numerical approach that combines finite difference and differential quadrature techniques, utilizing both Fourier and Lagrange basis functions to improve accuracy and efficiency. The problem formulation commences with defining the parameters and physical meaning of the Z-K equation, succeeded by its discretization in both temporal and spatial domains utilizing the proposed hybrid methodology. We systematically investigate the application of the differential quadrature method for approximating spatial derivatives while utilizing the finite difference method for temporal discretization. The paper introduces a quasi-linearization technique based on Taylor expansion of the nonlinear temporal terms. This dual methodology facilitates a versatile and resilient handling of the nonlinear features of the Z-K equation. A comprehensive error analysis is performed, establishing limits on both temporal and spatial errors related to the numerical solutions. The results indicate that the hybrid approach markedly enhances accuracy relative to conventional methods, with error barriers determined through meticulous mathematical derivation and corroborated by numerical simulations. The proposed scheme provides an error estimate of orders for both Lagrange and Fourier bases, respectively. The results indicate the method's effectiveness in capturing the complex behavior of wave propagation, rendering it a viable instrument for applications in acoustics and related domains. This study enhances the numerical solutions of the Z-K equation and offers insights into the wider use of hybrid approaches for solving nonlinear wave equations.},

We begin by establishing the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions with non-Lipschitz coefficients. Subsequently, we explore the tightness of the slow component concerning the time scale parameter . We then examine the properties of the frozen equation associated with the fast component. Finally, we demonstrate that the slow component converges to the averaged equation in probability and mean-square under different conditions, as goes to zero, respectively.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the stochastic nonlinear Kodama (SNLK) equation influenced by multiplicative noise interpreted in the Stratonovich sense. The equation is significant for modeling complex physical systems in fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear optics. We employ both the Kumar–Malik method and the polynomial expansion technique to construct exact soliton solutions in various functional forms, including Jacobi elliptic, hyperbolic, exponential, and trigonometric types. The combination of these two analytical methods provides a novel framework for investigating nonlinear wave structures in stochastic environments. To complement the analytical results, numerical simulations are conducted using Maple (or Mathematica) software, which confirm the accuracy and dynamic consistency of the solutions. These simulations also offer deeper insight into the behavior and evolution of the solutions under random influences. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the applied methods, making them suitable for a wider class of nonlinear partial differential equations. This work contributes to a better theoretical and computational understanding of stochastic wave phenomena and lays the groundwork for further exploration in related physical contexts.},

  abstract     = {Superquadrics are one of the most suitable geometric tools for modeling many complex shapes in nature. It is possible to model many objects, human figures, and living creatures in nature in a suitable way by means of superquadrics. On the other hand, quaternions are useful in mathematics, especially for computations involving three-dimensional rotations, such as in robotics, computer vision, magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional computer graphics, and texture analysis in crystallography. In addition, considering that nature is built according to a rotation principle, a structure combining superquadrics and quaternion algebra can be a very useful and usable structure in the mentioned areas and many others. For this purpose, in this study, a new kinematic structure is defined, called a superquadric motion in Lorentz 3-space. For this purpose, first, an inner product and a vector product compatible with superquadrics and superquadric space are defined via the Gielis superformula. Then, the new algebraic structure, called superquadric quaternions, and their properties are given. In this study, the defined superquadric motion and the hyperbolic split quaternion perform a superquadric rotation motion on the superquadric hyperboloids in 3D Lorentz space. Finally, some examples are visualized by mathematical programs to show the applicability of these constructions.},

The proposed model is studied in the presence of a fear effect induced by the predator's presence, which can lead to significant reductions in the prey's reproduction rate. The system is assumed to exist in a patchy environment consisting of two distinct patches (patch ). The prey migrates between these patches in search of food, while the predator moves between patches in pursuit of prey. The movement of both prey and predator is assumed to be fast compared to their growth and interactions. To capture the system's dynamics, slow and fast time scales are introduced. An aggregated model for the prey and predator populations is derived. The positive invariance and boundedness of all feasible solutions in the aggregated system are established. The necessary conditions for the feasibility and stability of various fixed points in the aggregated model are determined. Furthermore, the existence of periodic solutions is numerically verified through Hopf bifurcation and Hopf-Hopf (double-Hopf) bifurcation around coexistence points. The existence of a branch point (transcritical bifurcation) is also analyzed by satisfying all the conditions of Sotomayor's theorem. Additionally, a two-parameter bifurcation analysis is conducted, including generalized Hopf bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Several numerical simulations, performed using MATLAB and MATCONT, illustrate and validate the analytical results.},

The prey's reproduction rate is modeled as a decreasing function of predator density and fear intensity, while predator dynamics follow a modified Holling type II functional response. Analytical investigations establish conditions for the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as persistence and bifurcations, including transcritical and Hopf types. Numerical simulations reveal that higher fear intensity or intraspecific competition stabilizes dynamics by suppressing oscillations, whereas their reduction leads to limit cycles via supercritical or subcritical Hopf bifurcations. Two-parameter bifurcation analysis uncovers generalized Hopf bifurcations and bistability. Stochastic simulations with Gaussian white noise indicate that low-intensity fluctuations preserve coexistence, while stronger noise destabilizes the system. Global sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters affecting population dynamics. A brief comparative discussion shows that excluding mechanisms such as noise simplifies the system and reduces its dynamical complexity.},

The stability analysis results indicate that when the , the corruption-free equilibrium points are asymptotically stable both locally and globally, whereas the endemic equilibrium points are asymptotically stable locally when the .

One of the equations, describing the evolution of a biomass density, exhibits degenerate and singular diffusion. The other equations are either of advection-reaction-diffusion type or ODEs. Under very general assumptions, the existence of weak solutions is proven by considering regularized systems, deriving uniform bounds, and using fixed point arguments. Assuming additional structural assumptions we also prove the uniqueness of solutions. Global-in-time well-posedness is established for Dirichlet and mixed boundary conditions, whereas, only local well-posedness can be shown for homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Using a suitable barrier function and comparison theorems, we formulate sufficient conditions for finite-time blow-up or uniform boundedness of solutions. Finally, we show that solutions of the degenerate parabolic equation inherit additional global spatial regularity if the diffusion coefficient has a power-law growth.},

  abstract     = {The widespread application of dual quaternion across various fields has propelled the study of its matrix theory into recent focus. We develop a structure-preserving algorithm for dual quaternion matrix LU decomposition (DQLUD). Theoretically, we rely on the dual matrix representation of dual quaternion matrices to transform the operations in the DQLUD and reduce the computational complexity based on the special structure of the dual matrices. Furthermore, we not only design a structure-preserving algorithm for the partial pivoting DQLUD by utilizing the order relation of dual numbers but also present a structure-preserving algorithm for the Cholesky decomposition of dual quaternion Hermitian positive definite matrices. Numerically, comparisons with other available algorithms are carried out, which demonstrate that our proposed structure-preserving algorithm incurs less computational cost. Finally, we translate the idea of designing structure-preserving algorithms to the LU decomposition of dual complex matrices and successfully apply it to designing a strict authentication scheme for color images and the process of color image watermarking.},

These conditions lead to distinct four-dimensional partial differential equations for both option holders and writers, derived from a dynamic hedging strategy. The equations are solved numerically using an explicit finite-difference approach due to their high nonlinearity. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of transaction costs and conducts a sensitivity analysis on key parameters. The proposed methodology can be easily extended to price other option types in a multifactor stochastic volatility or stochastic interest rate setting with transaction costs.},

Among them, how to estimate learning rates for various learning problems remains a fundamental theoretical problem. By far, most of the existing research only focuses on single-output learning. To strengthen the theoretical support of multioutput learning, we study the learning rates of multioutput regression with kernel methods and -regularization. We obtain an explicit learning rate, which reveals the quantitative dependency on both the output dimensions and the sample size. Our results cover a broader scope than previous works and improve upon them in certain special cases.

  abstract     = {The growing trend of automation in engineering significantly increases the complexity of engineering systems and necessitates a deeper understanding of the coupling of physical and cyber components interacting within the systems. A typical example of such a highly coupled system is an autonomous construction site, where robotic systems aim to enhance the efficiency of the construction process. To adequately address, define, and model the structure of such engineering systems, it is essential to use the tools of abstract mathematics, which provide a sufficient level of abstraction to describe entire systems as well as interactions between their components. Moreover, the use of abstract mathematics enables conceptual modelling at different levels of details and abstraction, and, thus, providing possibilities to work not only on a meta-level, but also on the meta-meta-level. In this context, a meta-metamodelling approach to the formal description of engineering systems via the coupling of categorical ontology logs and abstract definitions for individual components has been proposed in recent years. The goal of this paper is to further develop the meta-metamodelling approach, emphasizing its practical applicability for engineering systems by considering practical problems on autonomous construction sites. In particular, a connection between the meta-meta-level and the meta-level is discussed as well as the advantages of using the tools of abstract mathematics are underlined.},

The Qdenga vaccine was introduced in 2022 to prevent dengue infection. Building on this, we develop a threshold-based dynamical model of the dengue fever epidemic that incorporates vaccination, vaccine inefficacy, and asymptomatic carriers. We first formulate the arithmetic expression for the control reproduction number and then use properties of complex modulus and proof by contradiction to establish the local asymptotic stability of both dengue-free equilibrium and dengue-infected equilibrium of the model. Furthermore, by constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions and applying the generalized Lyapunov-LaSalle theorem, we obtain the global dynamic properties of the two equilibria. In particular, we confirm weak persistence for to achieve the global attractivity of the dengue-infected equilibrium. Notably, we conduct numerical simulations and analyze the transmission dynamics of the disease in conjunction with official data from Brazil and the results of parameter estimation. These numerical findings are consistent with our theoretical results. Additionally, sensitivity analysis using MATLAB is carried out to identify parameters with significant impact on our model. Our numerical simulation results suggest that taking into account vaccination and potential vaccine inefficacy can lead to more accurate simulations of real-world scenarios. This consideration also plays a significant role in devising feasible epidemic control strategies and enhancing targeted vaccine development. Specifically, Qdenga received approval for use in Brazil in March 2023. Relevant authorities in Brazil are encouraged to actively promote vaccination campaigns in order to reduce the infection rate.},

In the proposed control problem, we deal with a system that is under the noninstantaneous impulsive effects and infinite delay. The sufficient condition for the existence of a mild solution for the proposed nonlinear control system has been established by using Dhage's fixed-point theorem. Further, the approximate controllability results are established using piecewise defined control function and under the consideration that the corresponding linear system is approximate controllable. The main findings have been established by using the facts concerning the semigroup theory of operators, fixed-point technique, fractional calculus, and the theory of multivalued maps. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the abstract results.},

  abstract     = {We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the Zakharov-Shabat system. Representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in the unit disk. The coefficients of the series are computed following a simple recurrent integration procedure. This essentially reduces the solution of the direct scattering problem to the computation of the coefficients and location of zeros of an analytic function inside of the unit disk. The solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficient. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.},
