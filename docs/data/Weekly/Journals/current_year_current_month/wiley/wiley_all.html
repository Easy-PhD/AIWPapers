  abstract     = {Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aimto mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Additionally, they reduce the burden on the limited number of human cyber experts available to respond to an attack. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objectivesuch as minimising the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectivespresent when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursuing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defense game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining the critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO) and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defense game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a hybrid methodology for evaluating leading retail companies based on customer perspectives, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven sentiment analysis with fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). The framework integrates large-scale customer review analysis with expert decision-making to provide a comprehensive assessment of retail performance. The process begins with AI-based text mining to collect and analyze customer reviews, extracting emotional tones and identifying frequently mentioned criteria. Expert judgment is then applied to refine, organize, and assign importance to these criteria. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set MCDM methodology is employed to address uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and qualitative expert opinions by translating them into a structured quantitative evaluation. This hybrid approach offers a balanced assessment that combines subjective and objective dimensions. As a case study, 2000 customer reviews from each of four major U.S. retailers—Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target—were analyzed to derive key evaluation criteria based on user feedback. The proposed method distinguishes itself through its unique integration of sentiment analysis and decision-makers' expert evaluations, enabling a holistic and robust evaluation of alternatives. By bridging customer perceptions with expert analysis, this methodology provides a deeper, more nuanced understanding of retailer performance, contributing to improved supplier selection and business decision-making processes. A second analysis, enabled by this methodology, also highlighted key performance differences among the retailers in areas such as customer service, delivery experience, and return/refund processes. Among the findings, Target and Amazon showed the strongest overall sentiment performance, while Costco excelled in return policies and Walmart exhibited weaker results in customer service and delivery. As a result, this hybrid methodology offers valuable insights for both decision-makers aiming to optimize supplier selection and customers seeking better shopping experiences.},

  abstract     = {This review evaluates classical machine learning-based hypertension prediction models, emphasizing their role in addressing global health burdens , particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension affects over 1.28 billion people globally and contributes to cardiovascular disease and mortality. The review compares machine-learning techniques with traditional methods, focusing on key datasets, evaluation metrics, and model development to advance early detection and effective hypertension management. The review used the PRISMA framework, using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE explorer to identify studies published between 2020 and 2024 on machine learning techniques, predictive models, and early detection of hypertension based on relevance, methodological rigor, and inclusion criteria. The study analyzed hypertension prediction models across various countries, including the US, England, Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and several African countries. The models' performance varied with AUC statistic values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, indicating a wide range of predictive accuracy. Machine learning techniques generally reported higher performance metrics than traditional statistical methods. Risk factor heterogeneity was evident, with models like random forest, logistic regression, and gradient-boosted trees showing high predictive accuracy. Emerging techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ensemble methods improved unbalanced data set performance. The review explores the potential of machine learning-based hypertension prediction models in healthcare, highlighting their ability to accurately predict hypertension risk, tailor interventions to specific populations, and optimize healthcare resources in low- and middle-income countries. However, challenges include data quality, model explainability, and ethical considerations. Despite these, ML integration offers scalable and cost-effective solutions, especially in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on diverse datasets, advanced feature integration, and longitudinal validations.},

  abstract     = {The sterile insect technique (SIT) represents a highly effective and promising method for combating tsetse fly-related infections, which involves the release of sterilized male tsetse flies in the assigned zones. However, tsetse fly rearing poses specific challenges, particularly in the tsetse sex separation, as this process is labor-intensive and incurs significant costs. Here, we report a simple model that classifies tsetse flies by sex using an object detection model based on the YOLO algorithm. This paper also conducted a comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLO11 deep learning models, focusing on their efficacy in tsetse fly detection and classification using a range of performance metrics and statistical analysis. The findings reveal that the classification accuracy of YOLO11 stands at 97.6%, whereas YOLOv8 achieves 95.6%. The classification precision of YOLO11 in identifying tsetse flies is 88.6%, while that of YOLOv8 is 85.9%. Additionally, YOLO11 demonstrates an inference speed of 13.0 ms, slightly faster than YOLOv8's 13.4 ms in tsetse sex detection. Moreover, YOLO11 outperformed YOLOv8 in both F1 score and mAP@0.5–0.9, a success attributed to its enhanced architectural design. However, statistical tests indicate there is no significant difference between the two models, achieving p values ≥ 0.05 for all metrics. This study adds value to tsetse rearing and fly-based disease control by offering automated tsetse sex detection insights into its practical uses in real-world contexts. Furthermore, this research enriches the understanding of the two models with tsetse flies as the focal point and recommends a more effective and accurate detection approach. Finally, integrating the model with the mobile object detection Android app will reduce tsetse sex sorting dependency on experienced technical experts and enhance tsetse rearing productivity.},

Repetitiveness is a common characteristic of human behavior. Repetitiveness indicates which node is updated frequently and its importance. A chatbot needs to solve a situation regarding how quickly it will access its neural memory to retrieve information. Thus, the ranking of nodes in a neural network is necessary to allocate them to the chatbot's memory. The proposed ranking methodology takes affinity, number of edges, adjacency, average weight, and update time interval parameters into account to calculate the ranked value of each node. After that, a ranking tree is generated. This tree is finally considered the memory navigation path in that neural graph. If a node updates regularly with each clock pulse, which resembles a repetitive task, then its ranked value increases. This node should get preference over other low-ranked nodes. This study provides an approach to convert a neural graph into a ranking tree and a path to navigate through it. Thus, the chatbot can identify which node is more promising and has a shorter path than other nodes for information retrieval.},

It divides these numbers into nine groups based on their first digit, with the largest category comprising numbers beginning with 1, followed by those starting with 2, and so on. Each neuron within a neural network (NN) is associated with a numerical value called a weight, which is updated according to specific functions. This research examines the Degree of Benford's Law Existence (DBLE) across two language model methodologies: (1) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and (2) long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, this study investigates whether models with higher performance exhibit a stronger presence of DBLE. Two neural network language models, namely: (1) simple RNN and (2) LSTM, were selected as the subject models for the experiment. Each model is tested with five different optimizers and four different datasets (textual corpora selected from Wikipedia). This results in a total of 20 different configurations for each model. The neuron weights for each configuration were extracted at each epoch, and the following metrics were measured at each epoch: (1) DBLE, (2) training set accuracy, (3) training set error, (4) test set accuracy, and (5) test set error. The results show that the weights in both models, across all optimizers, follow Benford's Law. Additionally, the findings indicate a strong correlation between DBLE and the performance on the training set in both language models. This means that models with higher performance on the training set exhibit a stronger correlation of DBLE.},

In this paper, thematic analysis has been performed on unstructured opinions obtained from 11 experts about the integration of LLMs in the field of software development to understand their benefits and limitations using two natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis and keyword extraction and analysis. Sentiment analysis suggests that most experts were optimistic and pragmatic about the use of generative artificial intelligence in software development, although some experts engaged in critical reflection.

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to become an essential tool for defending against machine-speed attacks on increasingly connected cyber networks and systems. It will allow self-defending and self-recovering cyber-defence agents to be developed, which can respond to attacks in a timely manner. But how can these agents be trusted to perform as expected, and how can they be evaluated responsibly and thoroughly? To answer these questions, a Test and Evaluation (T&E) process has been developed to assess cyber-defence agents. The process evaluates the performance, effectiveness, resilience, and generalizability of agents in both low- and high-fidelity cyber environments. This paper demonstrates the low-fidelity part of the process by performing an example evaluation in the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained as part of Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 2. The process makes use of novel Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) metrics, which can be used in combination with performance metrics such as the RL reward. MoE are tailored for cyber defence, allowing a greater understanding of agents' defensive abilities within a cyber environment. Agents are evaluated against multiple conditions that perturb the environment to investigate their robustness to scenarios not seen during training. The results from this evaluation process will help inform decisions around the benefits and risks of integrating autonomous agents into existing or future cyber systems.},

  abstract     = {The brain tumor grows abnormally in the human brain, which causes brain cancer. Death rates have been rising annually for the past few decades due to negligence of early treatment of brain tumors. To reduce the death rate, early identification of tumors is crucial. Early brain tumor detection may potentially lower the risk of life. Manual tumor diagnosis is complex, challenging, and time-consuming for medical professionals. Therefore, automatic detection and segmentation methods simplify the diagnosing procedure. Thus, automatic segmentation and classification methods are taken up to make the diagnosis process easy. This research proposes a two-dimensional cumulative sum average filter (2D-CSAF) for preprocessing images and an improved deviation sparse fuzzy C-means (IDSFCM) with neighbor information for segmenting brain tumors from magnetic resonance images. The novel IDSFCM segmentation increases the noise reduction capability and enhances segmentation accuracies. The hybrid modified sine cosine algorithm-crow search algorithm (MSCA-CSA)–based WELM model is proposed to classify the brain tumor. The MSCA-CSA algorithm optimizes the weights of the WELM model to increase the classification capability. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique is employed to extract the features from the segmented images, and extracted features are given as input to the MSCA-CSA-WELM model for classification. The brain tumor dataset from Harvard Medical School is considered for this research. The proposed IDSFCM segmentation achieved 99.53% segmentation accuracy. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity performance measures are considered for the classification. The classification performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The proposed MSCA-CSA–based WELM model outperformed feature extraction–based classifiers, achieving 99.37% accuracy, 99.87% sensitivity, and 99.44% specificity during training.},

  abstract     = {A neurodevelopmental illness called autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently associated with sensory problems including an excessive or insufficient sensitivity to noises, scents, or touch. Children with autism typically do not talk much and keep to themselves, but they can imitate certain actions from cartoons and movies. They may exhibit unsafe or unexpected behavior as a result. Early detection and therapy can assist in improving the diseases. In this study, we suggested a data-driven machine learning (ML) model for examining the autism dataset of diverse age groups (toddlers, children, and adults) to classify autism in the initial stage. The proposed ML model can efficiently analyze autism patients’ datasets and correctly classify and detect ASD features. We utilized a data preprocessing technique followed by feature selection methods using information gain and Pearson correlation. Then, we employed five different ML classifiers (KNN, RF, SVM, NB, and MLP) together with a hyperparameter optimization strategy. We assess their work using performance metrics such as prediction accuracy and the F1-measure. After comparing the accuracy between different classifiers, SVM produced the highest accuracies of 98%, 99%, and 100% for the toddler, child, and adult datasets while MLP produced an accuracy of 0.94 for the Pakistani child dataset, respectively. These thorough experimental assessments suggest that correct fine-tuning of the ML techniques can be crucial in the classification of autism in individuals of various ages. We believe that the thorough feature significance analysis presented in this study can guide medical professionals’ judgment when screening ASD individuals. In comparison with other methods currently used for the timely identification of ASD, the suggested framework has shown encouraging results.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of the digital age, data have become insecure, which requires techniques to secure data. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has become an increasingly secure technology for storing next-generation digital data. DNA provides superior capabilities due to its high and efficient storage capacity and long lifespan. Protecting these data is of utmost importance, especially data with sensitive content. In this study, the proposed encryption algorithm is a new and novel contribution; a new cryptographic methodology is presented that leverages the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank to create cryptographic keys. This key dictionary is created by nucleotide sequences created from the GenBank database. The proposed methodology uses databases such as the National Center GenBank, which contains huge repositories of genetic information, to improve the effectiveness of data security. By converting traditional digital data into DNA sequences, this methodology provides new features of cryptographic protection. The security and reliability of the proposed methodology were thoroughly tested through simulation and data analysis. The results indicate that the proposed encryption methodology has a superior ability to withstand many types of cryptographic attacks, which confirms its effectiveness and strength in data protection. The paper also presented several findings, including a low encryption time of 250 ms and decryption time of 230 ms, as well as a memory usage of 50 MB for large datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrated exceptionally high stability. Across all these metrics, the proposed approach outperformed other existing methods. The proposed methodology is applicable to ensure the security and integrity of DNA-based digital storage systems. This methodology was developed independently and has not been previously studied. This modern methodology represents an advance in digital data security and protection, providing an advanced solution in the digital age of cybersecurity.},

Models explored for regression in this paper include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN).

This study developed a neural network classifier to determine the nutritional requirements for four types of Type 2 diabetic patients: those with chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, or all three conditions. The classifier was trained using Kenya Food Composition Tables data on food nutrients and processing techniques. The neural network had five layers, including three hidden layers with 10 neurons each, using tanh and sigmoid activation functions, gradient descent optimization, cross-entropy loss function, and 0.1 learning rate. Training used 40 hidden neurons per layer, 60,000 epochs and 0.2 learning rate. The neural network was evaluated against random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The neural network achieved high performance with 91.4% accuracy, 88% recall, 86.8% precision, and 87.3% F1-score.

  abstract     = {The prevailing method for grading oil palm fruit bunches in mills relies on human graders conducting visual inspections, resulting in frequent errors and inconsistent assessments. This is a significant open problem when developing a detector for oil palm fruit ripeness and oil content, which are related factors. Current trends focus on computer vision techniques based on image processing and machine learning to improve grading of oil palm fruit bunches at an individual factory, resulting in limited diversity of the data used for evaluation. Collecting data from all factories offers informational advantages but raises privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes federated learning (FL) to develop local and global prediction models for grading oil palm fruit ripeness while preserving data privacy. FL facilitates collaborative model training across factories, mitigating privacy risks and enhancing model development efficiency. The proposed model uses the color of palm husks to determine the ripeness stage, which is used as a factor in predicting the yield of oil from the crop. A predictive model was created using FL principles with a training dataset of 5209 images, which was divided into two subsets: single-palm (2571 images) and multipalm (2638 images). The classification accuracy of a global model was 90.0%, while the local models were expanded to include private data for each of 4 testing clients. The predictive global and local models from FL were used to implement the system in a web application form and to validate its performance in calling the oil palm ripeness stage.},

Proper garbage waste processing, management, and recycling are crucial for both ecological and economic reasons. Computer vision techniques have shown advanced capabilities in various applications, including object detection and classification. In this study, we conducted an extensive review of the use of artificial intelligence for garbage processing and management. However, a major limitation in this field is the lack of datasets containing top-view images of garbage. We introduce a new dataset named “KACHARA,” containing 4727 images categorized into seven classes: clothes, decomposable (organic waste), glass, metal, paper, plastic, and wood. Importantly, the dataset exhibits a moderate imbalance, mirroring the distribution of real-world garbage, which is crucial for training accurate classification models. For classification, we utilize transfer learning with the well-known deep learning model MobileNetV3-Large, where the top layers are fine-tuned to enhance performance. We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.37% and also evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These results demonstrate the model’s strong generalization in aerial/top-view garbage classification.},

This study proposes an AutoGluon–Shapley additive explanations (AutoGluon-SHAP) approach, which automatically predicts concrete mechanical strength while providing insightful interpretations of the results. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enhance global accessibility to the model. AutoGluon leverages powerful algorithms such as LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, random forest, ensembles, and neural networks within its TabularPredictor to automate model selection. The models were trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 1760 concrete samples sourced from the published literature, encompassing diverse concrete types, cement brands, additives, target compressive strengths, and curing periods. Results show that the WeightedEnsemble_L2 predictive model demonstrated robust performance in estimating flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths. All the predictive models achieved high performance with R 2 of more than 0.98 for all the strengths’ properties. SHAP offered both global insights into the influence of the predictors on mechanical strength and local explanations for individual predictions, ensuring transparency and reliability.

This study presents a comprehensive hybrid modeling approach to predict oil prices in the context of Russia and Ukraine across three distinct periods: before the war, during the war, and the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a hybrid system combining Random Forest, ElasticNet, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor models. These models were integrated through a Voting Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy. Our analysis revealed varying levels of predictive performance across the different periods. Prior to the war, the models showed strong predictive capabilities, evidenced by low mean-squared error (MSE) values and high coefficients of determination ( R 2 ). However, during the war, the models struggled to capture extreme volatility, resulting in significantly increased MSE and negative R 2 values. Predictions for the immediate aftermath of the conflict demonstrated improvements, with a reduction in MSE and positive R 2 values, indicating a return to relatively more stable market conditions. Notably, combining data from both before the war and war periods could further improve predictive accuracy, as it would reduce the impact of the conflict’s volatility on model performance. These results emphasize the challenges of forecasting oil prices in periods of geopolitical instability and underscore the importance of hybrid modeling approaches to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics.},

In this study, we propose an efficient approach combining dynamic contrast stretching (DCS) method, advanced morphological operation–based segmentation, triangle thresholding, and a final postprocessing step. Our preprocessing step enhances the contrast of retinal images acquired under various lighting conditions, enabling reliable and accurate segmentation. This enhancement is achieved using the DCS method, which is compared to two widely used contrast enhancement techniques: adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The second step combines morphological operations and triangle thresholding to enhance vessel structures, eliminate noise, and separate blood vessels effectively. Postprocessing addresses artifacts and ambiguous areas at image boundaries. Our approach is evaluated using widely recognized reference datasets, including Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and High-Resolution Fundus (HRF). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we achieve average accuracy rates of 98.08%, 97.14%, and 98.94% for the DRIVE, STARE, and HRF datasets, respectively. In addition, our method is distinguished by exceptionally fast execution times, reaching 0.013 s for the DRIVE and STARE datasets.

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus has posed a grave threat to human health. Automated segmentation of COVID-19 lung computed tomography (CT) scans is a crucial diagnostic tool that aids physicians in providing accurate and timely diagnoses, as it contains significant radiomics information. Given that the specificity for discriminating between the causes of conventional pulmonary features is lower than its sensitivity, the primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a CT-based radiomics model capable of distinguishing between COVID-19 and other lung diseases. To address this, we propose an efficient, modified radiomics feature processing method that integrates an optimal aerial perspective (OAP) parameter-based intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) with a 50-layer residual deep neural network (ResNet50 DNN) for autolesion segmentation (ALS-IOAP-DNN). To further enhance COVID-19 lesion estimation, novel optimization strategies, including a hybrid simulated annealing-cuckoo search (SA-CS) algorithm, are introduced alongside the original SA method. The SA-CS algorithm extends SA by preventing entrapment in local minimum and enhancing global exploration. Five benchmark functions are used to accelerate convergence and address the issue of local optima. As a result, the hybrid approach outperforms 10 recent studies on two publicly available datasets (COVID-CT-Dataset and HUST-19), achieving an average accuracy score of 100% across different epochs, along with perfect accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. The proposed models significantly outperform the baseline model, with accuracy improvements of 13.6% on Data1 and 2.5% on Data2. While the baseline model achieves 88% accuracy on Data1 and 97.6% on Data2, the proposed ALS-IOAP-DNN4 model attains perfect accuracy (100%) on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ALS and advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, the use of OAP with IDCP enhances the precision of COVID-19 lesion estimation, underscoring its significance in COVID-19 diagnosis and medical imaging management.},

Highly accurate and reliable T w forecasts are essential for the ecological management of rivers. This study evaluates the performance of machine learning-based predictive models in forecasting T w in the Catu River. The models were trained using climatic and hydrological data collected from 2009 to 2016 and validated with real data from 2023. The evaluated models include backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Random Forest, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Air2Stream, and NARX, employing nine input variables such as atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and water vapor concentration. The results show that the BiLSTM model achieved the best performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12°C and R 2 = 0.98, followed by BPNN with an RMSE of 0.18°C and R 2 = 0.91, and the Random Forest model, which obtained an NSE of 0.95. These models demonstrated a strong ability to predict T w under both normal and extreme conditions, capturing the thermal dynamics of the Catu River with high precision during events involving minor thermal variations. Conversely, the NARX and Air2Stream models exhibited lower performance, proving more prone to errors under conditions of extreme variability. The findings of this study provide valuable scientific insights for river T w prediction and the protection of aquatic ecosystems, with practical applications in water resource management in tropical regions.},

  abstract     = {Biometric security systems must be able to detect phony fingerprints to provide reliable authentication. The findings of this study suggest a hybrid approach to the detection of fake fingerprints that uses information on the texture and shape of the fingerprint. The novelty of this approach lies in integrating both traditional fingerprint information and geometric features obtained through wavelet transformation, which has not been extensively explored in previous studies. The proposed procedure uses the traditional fingerprint information and the geometric features that may be collected by wavelet modification. This allows it to take advantage of the complementary capabilities that these two types of capabilities offer. In addition, the hybrid feature set improves the system’s robustness and accuracy by leveraging each feature type’s unique strengths. To achieve this goal, the standard fingerprint information and the geometric aspects of the fingerprint are combined. It is possible to efficiently identify authentic and forged fingerprints by using these hybrid features and training a gradient boosting classifier. The findings of the studies demonstrate that the suggested technique achieves an accuracy of 96% on medium spoofing photos from the SOCOFing dataset, 97% on hard spoofing images, and 98% on mixed spoofing images. This high level of accuracy, especially on mixed spoofing images, showcases the effectiveness of the novel hybrid approach in diverse and challenging scenarios. This places it in the position of being the most accurate way currently accessible among the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method’s scalability and adaptability make it suitable for real-world applications, potentially setting a new standard in biometric security. There is a great deal of optimism that the technique that has been described can increase the reliability and safety of biometric systems when used in situations representative of the actual world.},

This study proposes an efficient spectrum-sharing technique for dual-hop CRNs using NOMA, optimized by an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm and guided by a single-input single-output fuzzy rule-based system (SISO-FRBS). In this setup, a distant primary transmitter communicates with the primary receiver via a secondary NOMA relay. The objective is to maximize the sum data rate of secondary users (SUs) while minimizing total transmission power. SISO-FRBS enhances the IABC search process by dynamically guiding the search agents, improving both optimization quality and convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the primary data rate benchmark of 5 bit/s/Hz at a transmit power of 19 mW, compared with 23 mW with traditional ABC, achieving a 19.04% improvement in power efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Computer vision plays a crucial role in current day tasks due to its wide range of merits and applications in many fields like disease diagnosis, medical decisions, military, security, scientific applications, and business. Identifying plant species upon their leaf images is a very challenging and complex task. In this study, we introduced a model for classifying a variety set of plant leaves using different techniques such as factorization machine (FM), dimensionality reduction (DR), and ensemble learning (EL). In our study, FM is used as a classification algorithm, whereas DR is included in two stages, namely, feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS). FE has been used to extract the features from images in tabular form; on the other hand, FS is used to reduce the size of the data by getting rid of noisy (redundant and irrelevant) features. In addition, we utilized two methods for FS, filter-based and wrapper-based approaches. The used filter was the minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and the used wrapper was the improved binary cuckoo search algorithm that is based on Lévy flight and abandon nest functions. Regarding EL, it was used to declare different versions of FM by passing different subsets of features that are deduced from the original ones to improve its performance. We used the Swedish and Flavia leaf datasets for training and testing phases. The proposed model achieved a high performance in terms of accuracy that produced 95.67% on Swedish dataset and 99.6% on Flavia dataset. According to the results and in comparison to other methods, we proved that our proposed model ensures a favorable plant leaf classification approach. Finally, the proposed wrapper FS approach showed very good results without setting up the number of features to be selected by the user.

Recently, there has been an increase in the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in hydrogeology to estimate GWL in monitoring wells. This study presents a novel technique for predicting GWL changes that uses three independent datasets: historical GWL and climatic variables (CVs) data such as rainfall and temperature influencing groundwater dynamics. In our experimental research, the models’ prediction output on real-world datasets ensures that the model’s significant patterns are recorded while taking into account the noise in the data, resulting in a perfect balance of bias and variance. The DL models’ results show a significant score of root mean square error (RMSE) between 2.20 and 12.40 and coefficient of determination ( R -squared between 0.84–0.99), showing a significant improvement in RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) in the testing and validation categories, when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. This study improves our understanding of GWL modeling and provides decision-makers with a reliable tool for controlling change. The study advances environmental modeling by exhibiting methodological complexity and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data analysis in water resource management.},

  abstract     = {Stroke disease has been the leading cause of death globally for the last several decades. Thus, the death rate can be decreased by early recognition of disease and ongoing surveillance. However, the largest obstacle to perform advanced analytics using the conventional approach is the growth of massive amount of data from various sources, including patient histories, wearable sensor devices, and medical data. The current technology that could have a large impact on the healthcare sector is the integration of machine learning with big data analytics (scalable machine learning), particularly in the early diagnosis of this disease. To address this issue, a scalable stroke disease prediction model for a multinode distributed environment, which was developed by combining big data analytics concepts with machine learning to handle extensive healthcare datasets, an aspect not seen in the prior literature on stroke disease detection, is presented in this work. We have implemented four scalable algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient-boosting tree, and decision tree, using a dataset that was collected from a Medical Quality Improvement Consortium database. As a result, two worker nodes and one master node were used to analyze the dataset. The model’s performance was assessed using performance metrics including the area under the curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. With an accuracy of 94.3% and an AUC score of 99%, the random forest was determined to be better based on the experimental results. It was also shown that the main risk factor for stroke disease is diabetes, which is followed by hypertension. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of using Spark’s scalable machine learning techniques to forecast stroke disease and identify risk factors earlier. The findings of this study can be utilized by physicians as clinical decision aids to aid in the more accurate identification of stroke disease.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of subscriber traffic is a critical challenge in telecommunication networks, as it is essential for making informed decisions to maintain consistent service quality. Various artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been explored for this purpose, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being particularly popular. However, RNNs often suffer from the gradient vanishing problem, which reduces their effectiveness in processing long sequences of data. Long short–term memory (LSTM) networks partially address this issue by controlling the propagation of learning errors, but they still face challenges related to convergence speed and residual learning errors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new hybrid RNN architecture that combines features of Jordan and Frasconi networks for improved subscriber traffic prediction. The proposed architecture integrates two sublayers, a sigmoid and a Gaussian function, within a hidden layer that forms a loop. This configuration enables the network to leverage incremental learning through restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) at the local level, while also benefiting from global learning through backpropagation. The architecture was tested on a dataset consisting of cellular traffic data collected from a telecommunication operator in Cameroon. The results demonstrated that the hybrid RNN model outperforms traditional Jordan and Frasconi networks, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.18 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.61 using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64. In addition, the hybrid model showed superior performance in terms of RMSE, MAE, and convergence speed compared to the existing models. These findings suggest that the proposed model could support telecom operators in proactive congestion management and resource optimization.},

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to predicting readmissions frequently lack accuracy. This presents a critical challenge, as identifying patients at high risk for readmission is essential for implementing preventive measures. The study introduces a novel method that employs machine learning to automatically extract features from patient data, eliminating labor-intensive manual feature engineering. The primary goal is to develop predictive models for unplanned readmissions for UTI patients at Jordan University Hospital within 3 months postdischarge. This is executed through a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from January 2020 to June 2023. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study identifies high-risk patients by evaluating demographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics, ensuring model reliability through thorough optimization, validation, and performance assessment. Three predictive models were developed as follows: a gradient-boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The GBC, SGD, and LR achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99%, 95%, and 89%, providing strong confidence in the methodology. The study’s findings reveal key risk factors associated with readmissions, enhancing our understanding of this process and offering a valuable framework for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal cell growth, which leads to tumor formation. Autonomous breast cancer detection has seen good progress. However, there are still several challenges to robust detection. This survey article explores the complexities inherent in multiclass classification for breast cancer diagnosis, aiming to improve patient care, efficiency, and timeliness. In our study, we focus on using histopathology slide images and assess the current state of breast cancer classification, particularly with artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks. The histopathology images are key tools in the diagnosis process, allowing pathologists to visually assess tissue samples for signs of cancer. Our analysis reveals several challenges that hinder the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods. One significant issue is the need for more diversity in the existing datasets, which often fail to represent a wide range of patient populations. This limitation reduces the accuracy of diagnostic results, mainly when applied to different clinical environments. Furthermore, class imbalances within these datasets, where certain cancer types or stages are underrepresented, lead to biased diagnoses, with more common cases being easily identified while rarer cases are frequently missed. Another challenge is the limited generalizability of current diagnostic techniques, which perform well in controlled environments but often need to improve when applied to new, unseen data from different institutions or imaging systems. Additionally, the complexity of histopathological analysis means that it can be difficult for clinicians to interpret certain findings, leading to uncertainty in the diagnostic process. Our study reveals that addressing these issues requires collaborative efforts to improve the quality of datasets, reduce class imbalances, and develop optimal standardized diagnostic methods. By overcoming these challenges, we can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and global healthcare. We believe that by examining several factors and variables and conducting an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, this study will contribute to the state of the art and benefit researchers in both computing and medical domains.},

  abstract     = {In today’s mobile communication society, the integration of mobile technology in education has revolutionised learning through m-Learning. This approach leverages wireless mobile technology and computing, enabling learners to access educational resources anytime and anywhere, thereby enhancing flexibility and freedom. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and PDAs, facilitate m-Learning by providing mobility and interactive learning environments. M-Learning is characterised by its personalised, collaborative, and ubiquitous nature, offering learners context-aware experiences tailored to their immediate surroundings and needs. Context awareness plays a pivotal role in m-Learning, distinguishing it from traditional education by dynamically adapting content delivery based on factors beyond just location, including time, network conditions and user preferences. This adaptability poses significant challenges in designing effective teaching strategies that meet diverse learner requirements. To address these challenges, this study explores the application of machine learning techniques—specifically “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)”—in developing a Context-Aware m-Learning platform. Performance comparisons based on RMSE, MAE and accuracy metrics reveal ANFIS as the optimal method for enhancing the proposed m-Learning system, aligning with the contextual demands and parameters defined for effective mobile education. ANFIS’s ability to minimise absolute prediction errors more effectively than the other methods. In terms of accuracy, ANFIS again leads the performance metrics, achieving an accuracy of 82.46% with 10 neurons. In comparison, ANN and KNN achieved accuracies of 81.17% and 80.74%, respectively. These accuracy values indicate that ANFIS not only reduces prediction errors but also consistently delivers higher predictive accuracy.

This study introduces a cutting-edge transformer-based model specifically tailored for long-term time-series forecasting, aimed at improving the performance of PV generation systems. Leveraging the robust attention mechanisms and parallel processing capabilities inherent in encoder–decoder transformer architecture, the model effectively captures intricate relationships within weather data. A unique positional encoding layer is incorporated to bolster the model’s comprehension of the chronological sequence of data points. Furthermore, the multihead attention mechanism adeptly identifies interactions between key meteorological factors, especially temperature and radiation, which are crucial for precise PV generation predictions. Evaluation using real-world weather datasets reveals that the proposed model significantly surpasses conventional forecasting methods in mean squared error and mean absolute error metrics. This work underscores the applicability of transformer models in predicting temperature and radiation for PV generation, offering a scalable and efficient forecasting solution vital for sustainable energy management.

This research investigates the application of deep feature extraction for classifying eight different ocular diseases. The VGG16, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, was employed for feature extraction, while the fine k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was utilized for classification. Experimental results showed an initial classification accuracy of 89.2% using features from Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps and 83.1% using Multiscale Retinex (MSR) enhanced images. However, combining both feature sets led to an improved classification accuracy of 96.5%. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain, including the need for models that generalize across diverse patient imaging and demographics modalities, the accessibility of extensive annotated datasets, and the interpretability of models. Ethical issues and legal frameworks are also crucial for the safe and fair implementation of AI in medical services.

The models were trained using historical price, weather, and rainfall data using time-series forecasting methods, specifically LSTM and CNN. The findings indicate that stepwise feature selection minimizes prediction errors and improves MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. Preliminary experiments revealed that the LSTM model with feature selection outperformed the other models, particularly in feature selection. Employing standard hyperparameters of 100 epochs, 32 batches, and five windows, the model demonstrated superior performance with a lower MSE (0.0010), RMSE (0.0274), MAPE (3.7803), and MAE (0.0158) than the CNN model. Statistical hypothesis testing revealed significant variations between the LSTM and CNN models, with feature selection p -values below 0.05. These results indicate that LSTM with feature selection models optimized through refined hyperparameters leads to more accurate Thai morning glory price forecasting, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in their decision-making processes. Additionally, this study can forecast prices for 5, 7, 14, and 21 days in advance based on different Window_len values, addressing various planning needs. The 5- and 7-day forecasts support short-term decision-making, such as scheduling harvest cycles and weekly market planning, whereas the 14-day forecast assists farmers in optimizing planting schedules and logistics. Furthermore, the 21-day forecast is beneficial for medium-term market planning, including negotiating forward contracts and adjusting distribution strategies to maximize profitability.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis of this disease is of utmost importance to increase the survival rate and enhance the healthcare system. Many machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to facilitate automated early diagnosis of this cancer. However, label noise in medical images and the dependence on a single model can lead to suboptimal model performance, which could potentially hinder the development of a sophisticated automated solution. In this paper, we address label noise in training data and propose a stacking-ensemble model for classifying colorectal cancer along with a trustworthy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Initially, a variety of filtering methods are extensively analyzed to determine the most suitable image representation, with subsequent data augmentation techniques. Second, a modified VGG-16 model was proposed with fine-tuning that was utilized as a feature extractor to extract meaningful features from the training samples. Third, a prediction uncertainty and probabilistic local outlier factor (pLOF) were applied to the extracted features to address the label noise issue in the training data. Fourth, we adopted a random forest–based recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) feature selection method with various combinations of features to recursively select the most influential ones for accurate predictions. Fifth, four base ML classifiers and a metamodel were selected to build our final stacking-ensemble model, which integrates the prediction probabilities of multiple models into a meta-feature set to ensure trustworthy predictions. Finally, we integrated these strategies and deployed them into a web application to demonstrate a CAD system. This system not only predicts the disease but also generates the prediction probabilities of each class, which enhances both clarity and diagnostic insight. Our proposed model was compared with different state-of-the-art ML classifiers on a publicly available dataset and demonstrated the highest accuracy of 92.43%.},

  abstract     = {Neural machine translation (NMT) model processes sentences in isolation and ignores additional contextual or side information beyond sentences. The input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate contextually correct and meaningful translation. Relying solely on the input text could yield translations that lack accuracy. Side information related to either source or target side is helpful in the context of NMT. In this study, we empirically show that training an NMT model with target-side additional information used as knowledge can significantly improve the translation quality. The acquired knowledge is leveraged in the encoder-/decoder-based model utilizing multiencoder framework. The additional encoder converts knowledge into dense semantic representation called attention. These attentions from the input sentence and additional knowledge are then combined into a unified attention. The decoder generates the translation by conditioning on both the input text and acquired knowledge. Evaluation of translation from Urdu to English with a low-resource setting yields promising results in terms of both perplexity reduction and improved BLEU scores. The proposed models in the respective group outperform in LSTM and GRU with attention mechanism by +3.1 and +2.9 BLEU score, respectively. Extensive analysis confirms our claim that the translations influenced by additional information may occasionally contain rare low-frequency words and faithful translation.

  abstract     = {A traffic network exhibits inherent characteristics of networks while also possessing unique features that hold significant research value. In this study, the limitations of static graph structures and the challenges of accurately modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic flow have been addressed through a hybrid GCN-gated recurrent unit (GRU)-transformer model. The proposed model integrates a dynamic topology module (DTM) with graph attention networks (GATs), GRUs, and transformer-based temporal modules to adaptively capture the evolving dynamics of traffic networks. The DTM dynamically updates graph structures based on real-time traffic conditions, while GATs focus on identifying critical spatial relationships. GRUs efficiently capture temporal dependencies, and the transformer model captures long-term sequential patterns, providing a comprehensive framework for real-time traffic forecasting. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using the METR-LA dataset, which comprises traffic data from 207 sensors at 5-minute intervals. The model demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, achieving RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 4.125%, 2.985%, and 5.432%, respectively, for 15-minute predictions, with an R 2 value of 0.928. For longer prediction horizons (30, 45, and 60 min), the model consistently outperformed baseline methods, maintaining competitive RMSE and MAPE values. The experimental setup included normalization, graph construction using adjacency matrices, and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and robustness. The integration of spatial and temporal features through the GCN-GRU-transformer framework enhanced the model’s ability to generalize across varying traffic scenarios, including peak hours and disruptions. Compared to traditional methods, which often rely on static graphs and fail to adapt to real-time changes, the hybrid model effectively addresses both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. The results indicate its robustness in handling complex traffic dynamics, adaptability to real-world variations, and potential applications in intelligent transportation systems. Future work will focus on incorporating multimodal data sources and enhancing computational efficiency to achieve broader scalability and deployment in smart city infrastructures.},

Consequently, hate speech and offensive content have turned out to be a widespread issue that negatively affects both individuals and society and needs to be controlled through detection and removal. This paper aims to provide a further understanding of the meaning of hate speech and offensive language and to provide a comprehensive discussion of the various techniques to detect hate speech and offensive language. A systematic literature review (SLR) of 90 research papers published between 2018 and 2024 was conducted to discover gaps within the literature. This review revealed challenges and possibilities for further development and improvement of previous findings. The results show that most of these works classified hate speech and offensive language using techniques from machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and the most common performance metrics were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The benchmark datasets are also described. Twitter was the most commonly utilized social network for obtaining datasets, while Facebook is sometimes used. Moreover, the findings of this review offer insight into research trends in Arabic hate speech and offensive language, as well as new research directions. The most interesting finding is that until now most Social Media Network Developers have not included autodetection of hate speech or offensive language plugins. Finally, this study presents a guideline for choosing the best strategies and techniques to detect and predict Arabic offensive language and hate speech.},

These models are built on top of Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT). These base predictor models leverage historical energy consumption patterns to capture temporal intricacies, including seasonal variations and rolling averages. In addition, we employed feature engineering methodologies to further enhance their predictive abilities. The accuracy of each ensemble model was evaluated by assessing various performance indicators, including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination R 2 .

  abstract     = {A vast variety of neural network (NN)–based controllers use indirect adaptive control structures for their implementation, which primarily aims at estimating the nonlinear dynamics of the system and thereby generating a suitable control action. However, the most commonly used gradient descent weight update rule of the NN-based indirect adaptive controllers often fails to identify the system dynamics appropriately, and the control action becomes ineffective on the system under control. Further, a significant number of existing works in this domain employ randomized or suboptimal initial NN weights, which can potentially hamper the transient performance of the control loop. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative control scheme that utilizes the strength of indirect adaptive control of NN, along with the robustness of the PID controller. Since the PID control structure is often independent of plant dynamics and generates a control action to mitigate any error between the reference and the current plant output, it can be easily augmented with the control action generated by inverse neural network (INN) to mitigate any effects of unlearnt dynamics by INN. Further, we have used a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to optimize the initial weights of the INN along with the PID controller’s parameters to get an optimal control performance. The proposed INN + PID controller scheme has been tested on a cart-mounted inverted pendulum system due to its challenging control requirement owing to its intricate nonlinear dynamics. Detailed simulation studies for the proposed INN + PID and PID controllers have been carried out for various control requirements, viz. set point tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness testing. Further, an extensive comparative study has been devised based on the integral of absolute error (IAE) to test the efficacy of the proposed INN + PID controller against the conventional PID controller. Through extensive comparative studies, it was deduced that the proposed INN + PID controller is capable of handling the intricate nonlinear dynamics of the cart-mounted inverted pendulum system and provides a sturdy stabilization of the angular position of the pendulum with respect to the desired trajectory and superior transient control in comparison with the conventional PID controller. In terms of quantitative comparison, the improvement in IAE achieved by the proposed INN + PID controller was found to be 94.84%, 94.62%, and 69.86% better in comparison to the conventional PID controller for set point tracking, disturbance rejection for introduced impulsive force, and time-varying force variation, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer spreads quickly as the skin is the most vulnerable organ, and melanoma (MEL) is a fatal type of skin cancer. Detecting MEL in the early stage can hugely increase the chance of a cure. There are several methods based on machine learning to detect MEL from dermoscopic images. However, increasing the accuracy of detection is still challenging. This paper presents a new method for MEL detection that considers the combination of deep and handcrafted time–frequency local features. After short preprocessing, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract the deep features. To this end, feature maps at the output of the flatten layer are considered as deep features. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are handcrafted local features computed from the four subbands of one-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT). After the fusion of the mentioned features, semisupervised discriminant analysis (SDA) reduces the highly correlated and redundant features. The Bayesian optimizer finds the optimum parameters of the SDA and Gaussian kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to maximize the classification accuracy. The HAM10000 dataset with data augmentation is considered to assess the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method reaches the accuracy and sensitivity of 94.19% and 96.22%, respectively. The most challenging parts of the proposed method are extraction of deep features and tuning the parameters of SDA and Gaussian-SVM.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on developing an intelligent administrative chatbot for Roman Urdu to overcome the language barrier that hinders individuals who are not fluent in English from utilizing existing chatbot frameworks. While chatbot architectures can be rule based or artificial intelligence (AI) based, the core objective of a chatbot is to effectively address user queries across diverse domains. AI-based chatbots have demonstrated higher interactivity, scalability, adaptability to human interests, and evolving knowledge compared with rule-based architectures. However, the majority of existing chatbot frameworks is in English, which poses a challenge in regions like Pakistan where only a small percentage of the population is proficient in English. In response to this challenge, this research introduces an intelligent administrative chatbot specifically developed for Roman Urdu. Roman Urdu is the practice of writing Urdu, the native language of Pakistan, using the English alphabet. The proposed chatbot allows students to post their questions in either English or Roman Urdu, enabling them to obtain conclusive answers. The chatbot system utilizes a sentence analysis approach to generate relevant and productive responses to user queries. The core building block of the proposed chatbot is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. To train the model, a dataset was meticulously collected from various administrative offices at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, initially in English and subsequently translated into Roman Urdu using different writing styles. The effectiveness of the proposed system was evaluated through a human judgment approach, assessing the contextual relevance and productivity of the chatbot’s responses to relevant questions. In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the language gap in chatbot frameworks, enhancing accessibility and usability.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition is a reliable biometric technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to identify and verify an individual’s identity based on facial features. Its rapid development has enabled integration into diverse applications, including security systems, access control, forensics, and mobile devices. However, challenges such as recognizing faces across different ages persist, presenting opportunities for further research. Developing robust face recognition models requires substantial training datasets, but manually labeling large collections of facial images is both time-intensive and costly. Our previous study demonstrated that a ResNet-50 model trained on a dataset of 44,000 facial images, combining the original FaceScrub dataset with HyperStyle age and smile augmentations, achieved an F1-score of 79%, significantly outperforming the model trained solely on the authentic FaceScrub dataset (F1-score: 63%). Building upon these findings, this study explores a broader range of augmentation styles, including pose and domain adaptation, e.g., Pixar, Toonify, Sketch, and Disney, using the HyperStyle scheme. Models trained with domain adaptation showed reduced performance (F1-score: 64%) due to the domain gap introduced by cartoon-like styles. In contrast, models trained with pose augmentation achieved an F1-score of 75%, demonstrating the importance of augmentations resembling real-world variations. When training incorporated all augmentation styles, e.g., age, smile, pose, and domain adaptation, the F1-score reached 78%, slightly lower than the model trained with age and smile augmentations only (F1-score: 79%). To further evaluate the impact of age and smile augmentations, additional experiments were conducted using various CNN models, including VGGNet-16, MobileNetV3Small, SEResNet-18, and ResNet-50, under different hyperparameter configurations. Among these, ResNet-50 achieved the highest F1-score (82%), surpassing VGGNet-16 (60%), MobileNetV3Small (65%), and SEResNet-18 (81%). The study also introduced modifications to the HyperStyle scheme in both the preprocessing and postprocessing stages, which further enhanced model performance. The ResNet-50 model trained with the modified HyperStyle scheme, and the original FaceScrub dataset achieved the highest F1-score of 83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these modifications in improving face recognition performance.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of fake online and AI–generated news content poses a significant threat to information integrity. This work leverages advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms to effectively detect fake and AI–generated content. The utilized dataset, combined with multiple open-source datasets, comprises 43,000 real, 31,000 fake, and 80,000 AI–generated news articles and is augmented with an ensemble large language model. We combined three open-source LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-NEO, and Distil-GPT-2) into an ensemble LLM to generate new news titles, selecting the best outputs through majority voting for further dataset expansion. Preprocessing involved data cleaning, lowercasing, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. We applied six machine learning and five natural language processing models to this dataset. The two top-performing natural language–based models (RoBERTa and DeBERTa) have been combined to develop an ensemble transformer model. Among the machine learning models, random forest achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92.49% and an F1 score of 92.60%. Among the natural language processing models, the ensemble transformer model attained the highest results, with 96.65% accuracy and an F1 score of 96.66%. The proposed ensemble model is optimized by applying model pruning (reducing parameters from 265M to 210M, improving training time by 25%) and dynamic quantization (reducing model size by 50%, maintaining 95.68% accuracy), enhancing scalability and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead. The DistilBERT-Student model, trained using a balanced combination of feature- and logit-based distillation from the RoBERTa-base Teacher network, achieved strong classification performance with 96.17% accuracy. Visualize-based attention maps are constructed for different news categories to enhance the interpretability of the applied transformer–based ensemble news detection models. Finally, a website was developed to enable users to identify fake, real, or AI–generated news content.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of cold-deck, mean, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation techniques for predicting thyroid disease using a dataset of 9172 observations with 31 clinical features (5.2% missing values). Feature importance analysis identified thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine index (FTI) as consistently significant biomarkers across all imputation methods. Five classifiers—Naïve Bayes, linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, and recurrent neural networks (RNN)—were assessed on imputed datasets, with performance evaluated through accuracy, F1 score, and recall. The KNN imputation method enhanced LightGBM’s accuracy by 0.47% over mean imputation (99.06% vs. 98.99%) and by 1.47% over cold deck (99.06% vs. 98.59%), demonstrating its superiority in preserving feature relationships and enhancing predictive power. LightGBM achieved the highest performance with KNN imputation (accuracy: 99.06%, F1: 97.57%, and recall: 97.83%), outperforming other classifiers by 2.5%–4.0% in accuracy. These results underscore the necessity of robust imputation techniques for reliable thyroid disease prediction.

Traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, are limited by fixed cluster numbers and sensitivity to outliers, often missing small or irregular fraud patterns. This research introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm (AD-KMeans) that dynamically adjusts the number of clusters based on variance and density thresholds, enabling better identification of hidden fraudulent activity. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the proposed method is evaluated against standard K-means using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1-score, silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index (DBI), and the Calinski–Harabasz index (CHI). Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed AD-KMeans achieves the highest fraud recall (91.2%) and F 1-score (87.6%), improving recall by 22.3 percentage points over the best hybrid model (hybrid DNN + clustering, 68.9%) and F 1-score by 11.5 points (from 76.1% to 87.6%). Moreover, it identifies distinct fraud-prone clusters and adapts effectively to data structure variations.

Therefore, early prediction and detection are critical, leading to timely and appropriate interventions at early stages. Four ensemble tree-based algorithms were used in this study: adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and extremely randomized trees, investigating their ability to predict heart disease. Data related to heart disease clinical features was obtained from the open Kaggle Machine Learning Dataset repository. Adaptive Boosting stands out as the highest performer, achieving an average testing accuracy of 93.70%, precision of 93.71%, recall of 93.70%, and F1 score of 93.69%, along with the highest AUC score of 0.9708, across all competing models considered in the study. These metrics indicate a superior ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, effectively making it particularly valuable for clinical applications where early detection can save lives. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework adopted to investigate the relative importance of the features in predicting heart disease revealed the most influential predictors (ST slope, chest pain type, old peak, and cholesterol), further aiding the understanding of heart disease mechanisms. Future work should explore the integration of ensemble learning algorithms with real-time patient monitoring systems.

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF)-based personalized recommendation systems are among the most widely adopted strategies for addressing information overload in modern markets. However, a significant challenge that hinders the effectiveness of these systems is data sparsity. To address this limitation, advanced methodologies such as matrix factorization and deep learning models have been developed to improve CF system performance in sparse data scenarios. Despite their advancements, most existing models rely solely on either implicit or explicit user–item interactions to generate recommendations. Traditional CF approaches often struggle with sparsity, necessitating the development of hybrid methods that integrate both explicit and implicit feedback to enhance performance. To address this gap, this study introduces DeepBlendRec, an innovative deep learning-based framework that leverages both explicit user ratings and implicit user behaviour. By utilizing this dual-input methodology, the model captures richer information regarding user–item interactions, thereby significantly improving recommendation accuracy. DeepBlendRec employs an enhanced autoencoder with a constrained decoder to process implicit ratings, thereby improving reconstruction quality and facilitating the creation of robust latent space representations. Simultaneously, explicit ratings are processed through a multilayer perceptron. The reconstructed outputs are then fused to generate a Top-N recommendation list. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MovieLens datasets demonstrate that DeepBlendRec consistently outperforms existing models across several key performance metrics, including mean-squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), precision, recall, and F1-score. These results highlight the potential of DeepBlendRec to advance the capabilities of recommendation systems in handling data sparsity and improving predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel approach to engineering design optimization through the development of an improved mountain gazelle optimizer (iMGO) that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) techniques. The enhanced algorithm effectively addresses engineering optimization challenges by identifying optimal design solutions within specified constraints. In particular, iMGO significantly improves solution diversity and mitigates the risk of premature convergence to local optima, thereby overcoming the limitations of the original MGO. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using 12 functions from the CEC 2022 benchmark suite, and the algorithm was applied to five engineering problems, including the design of an I-beam, pressure vessel, three-bar truss, cantilever beam, and tension spring. Comparative results indicate that iMGO outperforms established metaheuristic techniques, such as MFO, WOA, GOA, MPA, TSO, and SCSO, as well as the original MGO. The results validate iMGO’s effectiveness in navigating the complexities of constrained engineering optimization. For instance, in practical applications, the manufacturing cost of the pressure vessel design was reduced from 6014.4537 to 5915.3358, and the weight of the tension spring was decreased from 0.0149154 to 0.0130101 relative to the original MGO. These enhancements underscore the significant potential of iMGO in real-world applications across aerospace engineering, structural design optimization, energy system planning, and other fields, thereby contributing to more efficient and sustainable engineering solutions.},

First, in order to enhance the efficiency of cooperative hunting, a novel task allocation method is proposed based on a leader–follower structure, where follower and leader MSVs perform the target encircling task and the target tracking task, respectively. Second, on the basis of task allocation, adaptive control design is employed for the follower MSVs to enhance the control performance of target encircling; optimal feedback control design combined with adaptive feedforward control design is considered using the RL algorithm for the leader MSVs to ensure the optimality of target tracking. Finally, the stability of the multi-MSV hunting control system is guaranteed and all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov theory in the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation results.},

  abstract     = {While analyzing health data is important for improving health outcomes, class imbalance in datasets poses major challenges to machine learning classification models. This work, therefore, considers the class imbalance problem in stroke prediction using models such as K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree. This work balances the stroke dataset, thereby enhancing model performance, through various oversampling strategies: random oversampling (RO), ADASYN, SMOTE, and SMOTE–Tomek. Compared to the results of the imbalanced dataset, all applied oversampling techniques enhanced the correct classification of stroke events by the ML model. Among these, RO–SVM with RBF kernel was the best in terms of sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F1-score, and accuracy values, offering the highest results with respective values of 89.87%, 94.91%, 92.36%, 89.64%, and 89.87%. After applying oversampling techniques, all the machine learning classifications were good enough to classify stroke status, especially for the minority class. This study has highlighted the importance of class imbalance issues in health datasets. Precise detection of instances of minority classes can be enhanced considerably by employing classification models with the implementation of hybrid strategies to effectively solve class imbalance issues, which, in turn, will help improve healthcare outcomes. Further research in integrating more advanced deep learning techniques into other health datasets with imbalances is encouraged to further validate or refine class imbalance approaches, as effective handling of imbalanced classes can substantially promote predictive model performance in the analysis of healthcare.},

  abstract     = {The elongation period of cotton fiber development is crucial for ensuring cotton quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation remain unclear. This study reveals that SER02 _ A11 , which is preferentially expressed during the fiber elongation period, encodes serine protease inhibitors (serpins). A previously uncharacterized SNP 517th is localized in the gene's coding region between Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum , leading to the premature translation termination and low expression of GhSER02 in G. hirsutum . However, in G. barbadense , normal protein translation and high expression of GbSER02 are observed. Ectopic GbSER02 expression or site-directed GhSER02' mutagenesis (but not GhSER02 ) promotes trichome and root cell elongation in Arabidopsis , indicating that SNP 517th causes the dysfunction of GhSER02 . Overexpressing GbSER02 in G. hirsutum increases fiber length. GbSER02 interacts with the transcription factor GhVOZ1 (vascular one-zinc-finger protein) in the cytoplasm, alleviating the inhibitory effect of GhVOZ1 on GhGA3ox1 expression, thereby promoting gibberellin synthesis. Subsequently, the cell wall loosening-related genes GhXTH2 and GhEXPA1 are significantly upregulated whereas the flavonoid metabolism-related gene GhCHS1 is significantly downregulated, ultimately improving fiber length. Collectively, this study reveals the essential role of the GbSER02-GhVOZ1-GhGA3ox1 module in regulating fiber quality and provides novel insights into the mechanism of fiber development in cotton.},

  abstract     = {Cancer patients have a higher risk of all types of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Cardiologists are encountering a growing number of cancer patients with CVDs, and an increasing number of cancer patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The mechanistic link between cancer and CVDs remains elusive. Here, the meta-analysis shows the increased incidence ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing PCI with cancer compared with non-cancer. We experimentally demonstrated that cancer aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in two models of lung cancer in mice. Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cancer mice exacerbated cardiac I/R injury in vivo and in vitro, while inhibition of tumor EVs secretion by lipid-coated polyacrylic acid/calcium phosphate nanoparticles delivered a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor (GW4869) showed the opposite results. Lung-specific miR-485-3p sponges mediated by Adeno-associated virus 6 suppress cardiac damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in CC10-KRAS G12D mice post-I/R. Mechanistically, PPARGC1A/PGC-1α is post-transcriptionally repressed by miR-485-3p in cardiomyocytes, leading to the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I subunits and ATP synthesis. Taken together, our findings reveal for the first time that cancer can aggravate cardiac injury and mitochondrial dysfunction by releasing miR-485-3p-enriched extracellular vesicles derived from cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Creation of well-curated databases tailored to specific structural motifs can underpin and drive materials discovery, as the properties of materials are governed by composition and structure. The role of such motifs in directing the intricate interplay between structure and properties is exemplified by intermetallic compounds with structures that contain kagome layers that exhibit a variety of exotic physical states. Two prevailing approaches have previously been applied to identify such materials: evaluation of structural topology or geometry assessment, however, both present limitations if deployed individually. We augment topological screening with geometrical filtering to allow versatile control over the identification of kagome layers. Applying this approach with minimal further constraints labels over 9000 kagome-containing intermetallics which are assigned to four structural classes, revealing connections between symmetry, composition, direct space structure, and flatband electronic structures in reciprocal space. A machine learning model is used to predict new element combinations that favour the formation of kagome layers. Several highly-ranked phase fields correspond to known kagome-containing materials that were absent from the training dataset, demonstrating that the workflow can identify chemistries affording kagome layers. This motivates the extension of the approach beyond kagome to other property-conferring motifs, such as honeycomb, square planar or triangular plane nets.},

To maximize their efficacy, adjuvants and their combinations are investigated to prepare vaccines with whole tumor antigens. By comparing different nano/micro-vaccines, ≤ 400 nm and 2.5 µm, respectively, are identified as their optimal sizes. When used alone, the optimal cancer vaccine cures all or most tumor-bearing mice with melanoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma lung metastasis. The landscape of immune cells in the blood, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes of vaccine-treated mice is systematically investigated using single-cell sequencing. The diversity of CD8 + T cell receptors (TCR), CD4 + TCR, and B cell receptors (BCR) in cured mice is higher than that in uncured mice. By comparing 21 samples, several biomarkers, including KLRG1, S100A4, S1PR5, IL2Ra, and IKZF2, were identified to distinguish responders and non-responders to immunotherapy. Moreover, S100A4, S1PR5 and KLRG1, are biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy in mouse cancer models and patients with cancer. Hence, this study presents an optimized cancer vaccine that cures most tumor-bearing mouse models and the landscape of immune cells in non-responders and responders to immunotherapy.

However,  the structural component alterations and immune cell infiltration characteristics of choroid plexus (ChP) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain incompletely understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis, the accumulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) in the ChP stroma post-TBI is identified. Intracerebroventricular adoptive transfer of ILC2 is further indicated to exhibit a tendency to colonize the ChP and significantly alleviate pathogenic immune infiltration during the acute phase of TBI, as well as maintain hippocampal integrity during the chronic phase. Sensory-motor function and memory impairments in TBI mice are also improved under ILC2 treatment. Mechanistically, ILC2 is induced by ChP fibroblasts derived IL33 and anchored to stroma fibroblasts via the VCAM-1/Integrin α4β7 pathway. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus reveals that ILC2-derived AREG promotes the initiation of neurogenesis by interacting with EGFR on early-stage neurogenic cells. Overall, these findings highlight that ChP-resident ILC2, through optimizing the immune microenvironment and promoting neurogenesis after TBI, may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

This research has uncovered that polysulfide anions (K 2 S x ), which serve as reducing catalysts, can also effectively act as sulfur reagents, providing the formation of C( sp 3 )–S bonds through a photoredox catalysis with an oxidative photocatalyst tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and dual hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) process.

  abstract     = {Rotator cuff tears often require surgical reconstruction; however, outcomes remain suboptimal, primarily because of the challenges in fully restoring the tendon–bone interface (TBI). The normal fibrocartilaginous transition zone is often replaced by fibrous scar tissue, thereby increasing the risk of retears. A porous hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel is developed to encapsulate adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Gelatin microspheres served as porogens to create micropores within the hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel (HMs), and hollow gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel microspheres are used to encapsulate BMP-2 (GMBs). In vitro experiments confirm substantial proliferation and homing of ADSCs within the porous hydrogel system. When the ADSCs-loaded composite hydrogel (HMs/MBs/ADSCs) is applied to a rat rotator cuff injury model, it effectively reconstructs the fibrocartilage transition zone and promotes TBI healing. Transcriptome sequencing is performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BMP-2-induced fibrocartilage reconstruction. Furthermore, integrated in vitro sequencing reveals that HMs/MBs/ADSCs modulated the tissue microenvironment to enhance tissue regeneration, primarily through BMP-2′s regulation of the paracrine effects of ADSCs. This study explores the comprehensive pathway through which HMs/MBs/ADSCs enhance tissue regeneration, emphasizing the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and ADSCs, and offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying TBI healing.},

  abstract     = {Leaf senescence significantly impacts both the yield and quality of non-heading Chinese cabbage (NHCC). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of leaf senescence in NHCC remain poorly understood. Here, transcriptome changes are first profiled, and found that ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways are activated during leaf senescence. Further mining of ET, SA, and DNA methylation pathway genes identified that EIN3A and CMT2 are induced and repressed, respectively, during leaf senescence. A whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis revealed a global reduction of DNA methylation during leaf senescence, with the most dramatic decline occurring in the 1 kb regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) and downstream of transcription end sites (TES). Knocking down of EIN3A and CMT2 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) demonstrated that EIN3A is crucial for ET- and age-triggered leaf senescence, while CMT2 plays an inhibitory role. It further showed that EIN3A directly represses the expression of CMT2 to release its “braking” role on senescence-associated genes ( SAGs ) expression. Thus, the study uncovers a pivotal antagonistic interaction between ET signaling and DNA methylation, which may be involved in setting the pace for the progression of leaf senescence in NHCC.},

  abstract     = {Effective bone regeneration remains a significant challenge in surgical practice, particularly due to the limitations associated with autologous bone grafting, such as donor site morbidity and limited bone availability. This study investigated the potential of human bone-derived endothelial cells (b-ECs) in mediating bone regeneration, especially in conjunction with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm-MSCs). It is demonstrated that b-ECs retain unique osteoinductive properties post-isolation, crucial for promoting bone formation in vivo. Utilizing ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models in immunodeficient mice, these findings revealed that the synergistic interaction of b-ECs and bm-MSCs induced rapid and substantial bone formation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of b-ECs in bone repair strategies. The distinct expression of KIT ligand (KITLG) in b-ECs emerged as a key factor in these processes. KITLG expression by b-ECs facilitated the recruitment of c-Kit+/CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to the osteovascular niche, leading to robust osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs, a process regulated by Notch signaling. Moreover, inducing KITLG expression in non-bone-derived endothelial cells conferred similar osteoinductive capabilities. These findings not only enhance the understanding of the intricate interplay between vascular and bone tissues but also open avenues for developing innovative cell-based approaches for bone regeneration therapy.},

  abstract     = {Livestock farming and conventional meat production pose significant environmental, health, and animal welfare challenges. In seeking sustainable alternative solutions, cultivated meat technology typically utilizes differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) into muscle cells for in vitro meat production. However, understanding the molecular determinants governing MPC differentiation into muscle cells, and the potential enhancement of this process through modulation of signaling pathways, remains limited. Herein, we characterized the molecular landscape associated with bovine MPC differentiation in vitro by employing multiomics, and explored its augmentation by small molecules, together leading to identification of media that enhanced myogenic differentiation compared with conventional methods in both 2D cultures and tissue-engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, we compared conventional and enhanced differentiation media, demonstrating that the enhanced media gave rise to unique progenitor-like cell populations, while simultaneously promoting differentiation into myocytes and contractile myotubes expressing a wide array of myogenic markers that more closely resemble bovine muscle cells in vivo. The improved method for promoting myogenic differentiation in 2D and 3D formats, together with the corresponding molecular roadmap, may prove valuable for cultivated meat applications.},

  abstract     = {Exposed to mechanical confinement, mammalian cells can establish remarkable unspecific adhesion, which is independent of integrins. How cells facilitate such adhesion remains unclear. Here, it is investigated how mammalian cells exposed to compression initiate unspecific and integrin-mediated adhesion. It is observed that with increasing compression, cells increase adhesion to collagen I or fibronectin and strengthen adhesion faster. Under low and medium compression, cells minimally increase unspecific adhesion to substrates that lack specific binding sites for cell surface receptors, such as integrins. However, under high compression, mammalian cells switch to a strong unspecific adhesion state, which significantly contributes to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Thereby cells use the glycocalyx to directly facilitate strong unspecific adhesion and to enhance early integrin-mediated adhesion. The mechanistic insight of how cells unspecifically adhere to substrates under confinement opens avenues to better understand cell adhesion in development, homeostasis, disease, and in a wide range of biotechnological and medical applications in which cells are exposed to mechanical confinement.},

Thus, more effective combination therapies are needed. This study finds that cystine and cysteine levels in tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are significantly higher than adjacent non-tumor tissues. Cystine deficiency polarizes macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, secreting more TNF-α, CXCL9, and CXCL10. However, using a cystine-free diet marginally reduces the development of lung cancer in vivo. A cystine-free diet slightly reduces lung cancer progression in vivo. Further studies show that cystine deprivation or erastin-mediated transport inhibition increased PD-L1 expression in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combining a cystine-free diet or IKE injection with PD-L1 antibody treatment significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies indicat that cystine deficiency-induced GSH depletion activates NF-κB in macrophages by reducing its glutathionylation. This effect can be reversed by replenishing GSH or using an NF-κB inhibitor. At the same time, lung cancer patients with better responses to immunotherapy are found to have lower serum GSH levels. These findings suggest that targeting cystine metabolism combined with PD-L1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy.},

Furthermore, integrating nanocatalysts into nanodiodes has narrowed the gap between model systems and practical catalysts, demonstrating hot electron excitation in nanoparticle-based systems.

  abstract     = {Ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury associated with recanalization therapy in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) exacerbates the initial brain damage. However, it remains a clinical challenge due to limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of I/R injury. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated succinate oxidation in microglia extracellular traps (MiETs) formation and neuronal injury after cerebra I/R injury. The results show that microglia are the main cell type producing extracellular traps (ETs) at 24 h at cerebral parenchyma after cerebral I/R. Additionally, oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) could induce MiETs formation and increased level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Microglia switches toward glycolysis with enhanced SDH activity and upregulated expression of SDH subunit A (SDHA) during MiETosis. Dimethyl malonate (DMM), a competitive SDH inhibitor, could reduce MiETosis by inhibiting succinate oxidation and mtROS production during reperfusion. Furthermore, DMM is found to alleviate neuronal injury after OGD/R exposure and neurological behavior disorders after cerebral I/R, and the effect is similar to MiETosis inhibitor BB-Cl amidine. These findings reveal a novel functional state of microglia and the role of succinate oxidation in MiETosis after cerebral I/R and provide a novel potential target for the treatment of AIS.},

METTL14-mediated m 6 A modification stabilized LINC01094 by recruiting the reader protein IGF2BP2, which contributed to the upregulation of LINC01094 expression in BC. Gain- and loss-of-function assays validated that LINC01094 triggered a switch in glucose metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, promoting BC progression both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01094 promoted the dimeric assembly and nuclear translocation of PKM2 by acting as a “molecular scaffold” for the PKM2/JMJD5 complex. This, in turn, facilitated energy metabolic reprogramming and cell proliferation induced by HIF1-α/β-catenin. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of LINC01094 is evaluated through the administration of the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 in mouse xenografts.

  abstract     = {Potassium-ion batteries, which possess unique advantages such as lower K + /K redox potential compared to sodium and superior interfacial charge transfer dynamics, demonstrate considerable viability for grid-level energy storage deployment. However, the development of potassium electrodes remains constrained by sluggish solid-state diffusion of K + within electrodes and progressive structural failure by the large volume variation during (de)intercalation, which requires a thorough understanding ionic transport, size effects, and electro–chemo–mechanical properties of electrodes, to achieve rational design and controlled synthesis. This review initiated with a comprehensive evaluation of potassium-based batteries from five aspects: energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, and cost. Afterward, a systematical examination for key aspects of potassium electrodes from a unique perspective is provided, starting with the fundamental scientific issues of transport properties (key features, anomalous cases, regulation, measurement and prediction) and size effects (kinetics, thermodynamics, potassium storage and transport mechanisms), while further discussing the specific electro–chemo–mechanical properties (composition–structure regulation, nanostructure and interface engineering). Additionally, this review highlights the construction of high-entropy electrodes and the pivotal role of machine learning in developing potassium electrodes. This review aims to provide critical guidance for future basic research and industrial applications of potassium electrode materials.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal to sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. Yet, its sluggish kinetics in acidic media and reliance on expensive noble metal catalysts limit its efficiency in these applications. Spinel cobalt(II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 )-based catalysts are cost-effective alternatives with high theoretical catalytic activity. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their poor stability in acidic electrolytes. This review critically examines recent advances in enhancing the stability of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of acidic OER are first analyzed to illustrate how different catalyst design strategies can be used to improve their stability. Next, five key catalyst design strategies reported in recent studies are summarized: 1) constructing protective surface layers, 2) modulating reaction pathways, 3) controlling cobalt redox dynamics, 4) tuning cobalt-oxygen covalency, and 5) stabilizing lattice oxygen. Further, recent research progress in understanding the structure-activity-stability relationship of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts is summarized, with a focus on identifying their catalytically active sites, tracking surface reconstruction, and elucidating degradation mechanisms. This review ends with a discussion of future research directions for addressing key challenges in realizing durable, high-performance Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER applications.},

  abstract     = {Coordinating transcription and replication via transcription factors (TFs) is a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes. The role of TFs in regulating these processes in cancers remains unclear. Here, it is shown that oncogenetic ETS transcription factor ETV4 controls DNA replication through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ETV4 localizes to specific DNA replication origins and interacts with the origin recognition complex subunits ORC1 and ORC6 during the G1/S phase, facilitating origin formation. Using quantitative in situ analysis of protein interactions at DNA replication forks (SIRF) assays, it is shown that ETV4 transiently localizes to replication forks in the S phase. It interacts with replicative helicase MCM2 N-terminal, histone H3, and histone-chaperone FACT and is involved in histone processing during replication. Additionally, ETV4 transcriptionally regulates key replisome genes MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM10, and ORC1, influencing their expression and recruitment to chromatin. Due to its binding at the origin-promoter locus like the MCM4 gene, ETV4 overexpression increases R-loop formation, DNA damage, and cell death under external replication stress induced by topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor. These findings highlight the dual role of ETV4 in replication and transcription and suggest that targeting TOP1 could be a synthetic-lethal approach in ETV4-overexpressed lung cancer.},

These mechanisms involve protein–protein interactions between receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and MLKL, MLKL phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions between MLKL and MLKL, and MLKL-lipid interactions. In this review, the specificity of MLKL activation mechanisms is discussed across different species and describe the processes by which MLKL transitions from an auto-inhibited to a membrane-embedded state.

Herein, this study focuses on the development of an innovative fluorescent probe that exhibits heightened spectral sensitivity to microenvironmental changes and its advanced HSFI application. First, the comprehensive investigation of various donor-π-acceptor molecules uncovers the critical role of π-spacer on the wavelength sensitivity to microenvironment polarity. Based on this insight, a new fluorescent probe Lipi-PS of whose wavelength sensitivity represents the highest level so far is rationally developed. Further combining with the features of lipid droplets (LDs) targeting and high photostability of Lipi-PS , as well as the newly established wavelength and polarity encoding method, HSFI is successfully realized in cells, tissues, and zebrafishes. Accordingly, the structural morphologies, fluorescence wavelengths, and polarities are intuitively visualized in the HSFI images. Notably, a special HSFI of single LD is achieved using Lipi-PS in a custom-built 3D-SpecDIM system, allowing 5D tracking ( xyzλt ) of individual LDs for the first time. This enables unprecedented correlation of polarity-dynamic behavior at the single-LD level.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to etiopathogenesis and progression of heart failure (HF). The underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Transcription factor FOXM1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development. The present study explores its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics in postmitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs). FOXM1 is significantly upregulated in ischemic heart tissues from humans, mice, and pigs. CM-specific Foxm1 -knockout mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy features associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Foxm1 -knockout mice reveal robust, specific downregulation of gene programs important for mitochondrial energetics and homeostasis. Analysis of proteome and ubiquitinome data reveal that FOXM1 deficiency in CMs promotes LKB1 ubiquitination and impairs the AMPK signaling and energy metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identifies that E3 ligase MKRN1 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 on Lys146, which in turn, inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway and impairs energy homeostasis in mice with HF. CM-specific Mkrn1 knockout ameliorates cardiac dysfunction by rejuvenating the impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics induced by FOXM1 deficiency. FOXM1 overexpression preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics and protects against myocardial I/R injury in both rodent and porcine models. In conclusion, FOXM1 is actively involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics during HF. FOXM1 may be a potential promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and HF.},

Herein, two corundum-type medium-entropy oxide ceramics (MEO-1 and MEO-2) are synthesized through solid-state reaction sintering under controlled oxygen partial pressures. MEO-1 is a single-phase corundum-type oxide (Al 0.41 Cr 0.26 Fe 0.31 Ti 0.02 ) 2 O 3 , while MEO-2 incorporates (Fe 4 Al 3 Cr) 0.25 TiO 5 whiskers to reinforce (Al 0.40 Cr 0.25 Fe 0.30 Ti 0.05 ) 2 O 3 . By regulating variable valence ions at different oxygen partial pressures, the whiskers achieved a maximum average length of 28.3 µm and a length-to-diameter ratio of 17.7 at 50.6 kPa, significantly enhancing the fracture toughness of the MEO-2, which possesses the optimal flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of 321 ± 8 MPa, 22.4 ± 1.5 GPa, and 3.87 ± 0.12 MPa m 1/2 , respectively. Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker law (BFDH) simulation elucidates that oxygen partial pressures can effectively regulate ionic diffusion behavior and whisker growth. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the whisker growth direction [0 4 0] aligns with the high shear modulus direction, contributing to the strengthening mechanism. This work provides new insights for designing high-performance medium/high-entropy ceramics, highlighting the critical role of oxygen partial pressure in regulating whisker growth and improving mechanical properties.},

This study presents two types of STOMs with an area of 11.4 cm 2 , exhibiting homogeneous appearance while retaining up to 92% of their respective small-area cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). Precise laser structuring minimized the area loss originating from the sub-cell series interconnection, allowing narrow cell stripes down to 1.25 mm. This enables a metal-less top electrode composed solely of PEDOT:PSS without compromising fill factor. For a module, an additional challenge is to ensure a low resistance series interconnection between sub-cells.

  abstract     = {Copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have emerged as a remarkable class of CO 2 reduction reaction catalysts that are distinguished by their unparalleled reactivity, but effectively modulating the transport pathway of charge carriers between Cu NCs by feasible chemical means is still challenging. Herein, a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy is proposed to modulate the fast electron transport pathway formed between clusters. A copper-sulfur–nitrogen cluster [Cu 4 (SN) 4 ] (denoted Cu 4 SN ) is first synthesized; subsequently, the SN ligands in Cu 4 SN are coupled covalently via a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy to yield CC –Cu 4 SN , which exhibits enhanced conductivity and photocarrier transport. As expected, CC –Cu 4 SN shows a high photocatalytic CO production rate of 29.98 µmol g −1 h −1 with ≈99.5% selectivity in CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as sacrificial agents, which is more than 10 times superior to that observed with Cu 4 SN . Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the covalent crosslinks between clusters accelerate the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, increase the light utilization ability, favor CO 2 adsorption and * COOH generation, thereby accounting for the increased CO 2 photoreduction activity. This work presents a novel thermally induced internal covalent crosslinking strategy for synthesizing novel cluster-based covalent polymers with enhanced stability and catalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of high-performance electrocatalysts is crucial for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Compositionally complex solid solutions comprising multiple metals offer promising catalytic properties, yet their exploration is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible compositions. In this work, human-decision driven combinatorial sputtering of thin-film materials libraries and high-throughput characterization is combined with Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the quaternary composition space Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Using this method, the global activity optimum of pure Ru is identified after covering less than 20% of the complete composition space with six materials libraries. Six additional libraries are fabricated to validate the activity trend. The resulting dataset is used to formulate general guidelines for the efficient composition of space exploration with combinatorial synthesis paired with Bayesian optimization.},

ALKBH5 induces ferroptosis in the HH/R model by mutating the 3′-UTR of G3BP1 mRNA and m 6 A sites at positions 142 and 173. Mutations of sites 142 and 173 only partially affect the levels of p53 N/T , SLC7A11 and ferroptosis. G3BP1, YBX1 and p53 protein can bind to each other, and p53 can inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 via nuclear binding to the promoter region of SLC7A11 mRNA. The p53 and YBX1 proteins can synergistically enter the nucleus to aggravate cell damage, while G3BP1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and inhibits p53 binding to SLC7A11 by blocking the entry of the p53 and YBX1 proteins into the nucleus. ALKBH5 promotes G3BP1 expression through m 6 A methylation at m 6 A sites 142 and 173. Subsequently, G3BP1, YBX1, and p53 interact with each other, the amount of synergistic nuclear translocation of YBX1 and p53 is reduced, and the level of p53 nuclear translocation that inhibiting SLC7A11 transcription is decreased, thereby inhibits cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and reducing myocardial tissue damage during myocardial IRI in diabetes.},

However, the limited stability of natural enzymes, along with interference from electro-oxidizable species, continues to pose significant challenges for their long-term application. Herein, an integrated wearable system is presented for nonenzymatic glucose monitoring in sweat at the point of care. This system integrates a flexible microfluidic glucose sensor patch for sweat sampling and measurement, using Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) confined within phthalocyanine-based conductive metal–organic frameworks (Pc-MOFs) as electrode materials, and a flexible printed circuit board for signal/analysis and wireless communication. The microfluidic sensor patch based on Pc-MOFs confined Pt-NPs exhibits significantly improved nonenzymatic glucose sensing performances. This is attributed to the ultrasmall size of Pt-NPs and the confinement effect within the Pc-MOF channels, which regulates the glucose adsorption intensity and increases the electrocatalytic activity to glucose oxidation. During the continuous monitoring process, the glucose concentration is calibrated in sweat by accounting for fluctuations in pH and temperature, and evaluated the performance of the wearable device in monitoring sweat glucose levels in human subjects over a 12-h period, achieving data as accurate as that obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography.},

  abstract     = {Regulating the orientation and dynamics of interfacial water is essential for optimizing electrocatalytic reactions, yet it remains challenging due to its intrinsic disorder. Here, it is demonstrated that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on an Ir single-atom Au catalyst actively restructures the hydrogen-bond (HB) network, accelerating ammonia oxidation reaction kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that plasmonic excitation shifts the HB network toward a more flexible configuration, favoring the formation of three-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (3HB·H 2 O) while suppressing cation-associated species (K + ·H 2 O). This transformation enhances the dehydrogenation process and stabilizes reaction intermediates, leading to a 28% increase in NH 3 oxidation kinetics. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy further confirms that LSPR-driven polarization at the Ir active site compresses the Ir─O bond from 1.73 to ≈1.58 Å by generating electron vacancies, thereby accelerating deprotonation with * OH during oxidative electrolysis. Extending this principle to an LED-driven plasmon-assisted symmetric wastewater electrolyzer, achieving a 40-fold current enhancement and 94% ammonia removal efficiency over 120 h at 1 V under landfill leachate-like conditions.},

Polyglycolic acid (PGA) is widely used in biomedical and packaging fields. Here, this study introduces an electrochemical degradation strategy for PGA waste that couples its conversion with seawater-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using rosette-like high-entropy NiCoFeMnAlO x nanosheets (r-NCFMAO). The PGA-derived glycolic acid oxidation reaction (GAOR) achieves 100 mA cm −2 at 1.36 V versus RHE, benefiting from abundant hydroxyl species (OH*) that lower the required potential by over 190 mV compared to the oxygen evolution reaction. This method produces ≈90% CO 3 2− , and subsequent Ca 2+ precipitation recovers 77% of CaCO 3 , a valuable material in construction and papermaking. Electrochemical analysis, quasi in situ electron paramagnetic resonance, and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal continuous OH − oxidation enhancing GAOR activity, while density functional theory confirms that OH* lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining C─C bond cleavage and C─H bond activation. The integrated GAOR ‖ HER system sustains performance for over 300 h at industrial current densities and is applicable to upcycling various plastics.

  abstract     = {Low-temperature annealing is traditionally employed to relieve residual stresses in metallic materials, typically resulting in softening. However, a novel finding in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) CoNiV medium entropy alloy (MEA) is reported, where low-temperature annealing induces significant hardening without sacrificing ductility. Specifically, after annealing at 530 °C, the yield strength increases from 503 to 653 MPa, while maintaining plasticity of ≈60%. The comprehensive analysis reveals that this unexpected strengthening is attributed to the development of multi-scale chemical short-range orderings (SROs) during the annealing process. These SROs, particularly a newly formed L12-type ordered structure (SRO-2), enhance material strength by promoting dislocation slip planarity and reducing dislocation entanglement. This study demonstrates that low-temperature annealing can effectively optimize atomic-scale structures in complex alloys distinct from that in conventional alloys, thereby improving their mechanical properties. These findings extend the conventional understanding of annealing effects and highlight the potential for leveraging SROs to design high-performance materials.},

The ionogel, synthesized from the molecular network construction of Gly-lignin, 1-butyl-3-vinylimidazole tetrafluoroborate (BVIMBF 4 ), and benzyl methacrylate (BZMA), forms a stable and elastic 3D conductive network through both chemical and physical crosslinking. This structure imparts remarkable mechanical properties, including considerable adhesion (30.4 kPa on flame-retardant gloves), tensile strength (5.8 MPa), and high ionic conductivity. Notably, through the formation of a protective carbonized/B₂O₃ layer and chemical barrier gases during combustion, the ionogel exhibits excellent flame retardancy, with a weight loss of 41.8% at 800 °C. Additionally, GLI achieves real-time thermal sensing via its negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior (TCR = −0.58% °C −1 ). Even after exposure to fire, GLI retains its temperature and motion-sensing capabilities.

  abstract     = {This work elucidates an important open question in the field of mechanically soft magnetorheological elastomers (MREs): how microstructural rearrangements during magnetic actuation modulate their viscoelastic behavior. Experimental assays are provided on mechanically confined and very soft MREs that, under magnetic actuation, show an order of magnitude increase in relaxation times compared to purely mechanical cases. It is demonstrated that such a modulation in the viscous response can be tuned by the amplitude and actuation rate of the magnetic stimuli, and is intrinsically linked to microstructural rearrangements of the magnetic particles. Motivated by these experimental observations, magnetic actuation protocols are conceived to enable mechanical responses in soft materials with force-memory. Specifically, due to the magnetically induced long-term viscous relaxation, one can induce magnetic-driven yielding by introducing material hardening during cycling loading. This mechanical memory of the MRE can be subsequently removed by releasing the magnetic stimuli for h, resetting the material performance and its microstructural state. These mechanisms are deeply understood by a combination of different experimental approaches and a new theoretical magneto-mechanical continuum model. The results reported herein respond to unraveled fundamental questions in soft MREs, and provide a game-changing concept for designing a new branch of soft sensor-actuator and reservoir computing systems.},

However, most of existing topologically protected couplers exhibit a constant transmission coefficient within the bandgap, and achieving continuously tunable transmission coefficients remains challenging. Here it is experimentally showed that a four-port coupler consisting of quantum valley Hall effect-based waveguides can exhibit continuously tunable transmission coefficients from one input port to each of the two output ports over the bandgap, while the rest port is consistently isolated by the topological protection. Further topologically protected digital signal transfer is demonstrated with frequency shift keying modulation in the coupler, revealing the data-transfer capability close to the theoretical limit established in the digital communication scheme.

However, most kirigami structures can only deform freely within a 2D plane, with limited out-of-plane deformability, making them inadequate for constructing periodic objects with arbitrary 3D shapes. Here, a novel class of 3D mechanical metamaterials with hyperbolic kirigami tessellations has been developed. By projecting hyperbolic kirigami templates onto three types of triply periodic minimal surfaces, candidate structures are developed with remarkable properties. An extreme negative Poisson's ratio of -1 and tunable mechanical multistability are uncovered through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments thanks to the flexible kirigami geometry. Notably, the structure achieves a maximum volume expansion of up to 488% during auxetic morphing. Furthermore, programmable morphing behaviors are demonstrated through voxelated assemblies of kirigami unit cells with varying geometrical parameters. The novel design strategy presented in this work based on hyperbolic kirigami tessellations opens up new avenues toward auxetic and multistable mechanical metamaterials with broad applications spanning shape-morphing architectures, deployable space structures, and soft machines.},

Here, a base-mediated multicomponent polymerization strategy using readily available elemental sulfur, aromatic diamines, and aromatic dialdehydes is developed to synthesize unprecedented polybenzothiazoles with scalability. By efficient alkaline activation of substrates through nucleophilic sulfurization-cyclization cascades, this method enables economically viable kilogram-scale production in a one-pot process with high yields (73–98%) and monomer universality, including previously incompatible electron-deficient aromatic amines. The resulting polybenzothiazoles unlock their long-overlooked potential in precious metal recovery, demonstrating selective, rapid, and efficient extraction (>99%) of gold (Au), palladium (Pd), and platinum (Pt) from ultra-trace concentrations (1 ppb) to complex matrices including surface water, e-waste, and spent catalyst leachates. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic nitrogen (N)/sulfur (S) participation and π-conjugation in their fused heterocycles govern metal coordination selectivity and redox stability. This work establishes a practical yet versatile platform to advance polybenzothiazoles from synthesis to resource utilization, highlighting their transformative role in addressing critical challenges through adaptive material design and precious metal recovery.},

  abstract     = {Coating technology is widely used in diverse fields such as energy, healthcare, and aerospace because of the advantages of simple fabrication, low cost, stability, and customized functions. However, conventional coatings fall short in meeting the emerging demands due to their single functionality and non-responsiveness. Inspired by natural prototypes, microcapsule-based intelligent coatings (MICs) that exhibit remarkable responsiveness to external stimuli have been developed and used in various fields such as corrosion protection and anti-fouling. Comprehensively understanding the responsive mechanisms and optimization strategies of MICs can maximize their adaptability and flexibility, which are highly desired for their precise preparation and actual applications. Therefore, this review focuses on recent progress of MICs, varying from bioinspired designs, material selections, stimulus responses, and diverse applications, providing more inspiration to design advanced MICs. First, biological prototypes used in the fabrication of MICs are briefly introduced. Then, the material selections and stimulus responses of MICs, as well as their advantages and disadvantages are emphasized. Later, applications are focused according to their functions, including anti-corrosion, anti-fouling, self-lubricating, and temperature regulation. Finally, the scientific challenges and prospects in designing MICs, focusing on the requirements of developing new structures using machine learning and achieving new applications, are highlighted.},

In contrast, BioBridge designs an Inductive-Associative pipeline inspired by the workflow of scientists who base their accumulated expertise on drawing insights into novel drug-target pairs from weakly related references. BioBridge predicts novel drug–target interactions using limited sequence data, incorporating multi-level encoders with adversarial training to accumulate transferable binding principles. On these principles basis, BioBridge employs a dynamic prototype meta-learning framework to associate insights from weakly related annotations, enabling robust predictions for previously unseen drug-target pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioBridge surpasses existing models, especially for unseen proteins. Notably, when only homologous protein binding data is available, BioBridge demonstrates robust efficacy for virtual screening of the epidermal growth factor receptor and adenosine receptor, underscoring its potential in drug discovery.},

However, techniques for flexible dual-modal sensors mainly rely on integrating multiple sensing units on a platform, thus inducing extra costs and complexities associated with the fabrication and data processing. In this paper, a flexible dual-modal sensor is presented, which contains only one sensing unit, i.e., single-crystalline silicon-based diode, for the real-time, independent, and continuous monitoring of light and temperature. Operation modes for photodetection and temperature sensing of the flexible dual-modal sensor are switchable by controlling the biased condition. In addition, both experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the crosstalk between light and temperature can be conveniently decoupled by short-circuit current and forward current of silicon-based diodes. Finally, the flexible dual-modal sensor is implemented as a platform to realize the continuous monitoring of photoplethysmography (PPG) and skin temperature of fingertips. These presented results offer paths to the construction of multifunctional, flexible bioelectronic devices or integrated platforms for biomedical uses.},

To explain the difference in attitudes toward AI agents, existing research has primarily focused on environmental factors. However, evolutionary psychology research suggests that the mechanism of outgroup rejection has a genetic basis, highlighting the need to explore the potential genetic underpinnings of negative attitudes toward AI agents as an outgroup in human society. This study examines the genetic basis of negative attitudes toward AI agents and their relationship with related personality traits, using a twin study design to assess negative attitudes toward AI agents, victim sensitivity, and moral preferences. Univariate genetic analyses revealed significant heritability of these negative attitudes. Bivariate analyses further identify shared genetic influences between victim sensitivity and personal-level fear and wariness toward robots. Similarly, a shared genetic basis is observed between the moral preferences concerning authority and sociotechnical blindness anxiety toward AI agents. These findings extend the understanding of social cognition in AI agents by emphasizing the role of genetic factors in shaping attitudes toward them. Moreover, they provide new insights for enhancing public acceptance of AI agents and optimizing human-machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {Modeling complex semiconductor fabrication processes such as Ohmic contact formation remains challenging due to high-dimensional parameter spaces and limited experimental data. While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, quantum machine learning (QML) is investigated as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) is developed combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Ω·mm when validated on experimental data. Noise robustness and generalization are further assessed through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models can provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial instability in aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) leads to uncontrolled dendrite growth and water-induced parasitic reactions, limiting their practical applications. In this work, a novel superhydrophobic HfO 2 -coated functionalized glass fiber separator is proposed. Characterized by its high dielectric constant, HfO 2 can autonomously generate an oriented electric field under external electric field stimulation, ensuring uniform distribution of the electric field and Zn 2+ flux at the interface. This strategy not only enhances Zn 2+ transport kinetics but also effectively suppresses the migration of SO 4 2− via electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the HfO 2 @GF separator promotes the deposition of Zn 2+ along the Zn (100) and Zn (002) crystal planes, facilitating the preferential exposure of the unique Zn (101) crystal plane. Additionally, its superhydrophobic property effectively inhibits interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the symmetrical cell exhibits an ultra-long cycling life of 4660 h at 5 mA cm −2 and 1 mAh cm −2 , and maintains stable operation up to 5050 h at 10 mA cm −2 . The Zn||I 2 full battery maintains 87.75% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles at 10C. Furthermore, the stacked Zn||I 2 pouch battery provides an Ah-level capacity (1.64 Ah). This work provides a new insight into the construction of highly stable interfacial chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Gold is an effective catalyst for low-temperature CO oxidation, yet its mechanism remains debated. Among the various proposed mechanisms, increasing attention has been given to a possible electrochemical pathway in recent studies. Here, experimental evidence is reported that CO oxidation at room temperature in electrolytes proceeds via coupled electrochemical CO oxidation and oxygen reduction half-reactions, i.e., the mixed-potential-driven mechanism. A model system is designed with deposited Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) on carbon paper acting as spatially separated electrodes in a single electrolysis cell. After shorting the two electrodes, the reaction current and mixed potential of the overall CO oxidation are measured without any externally applied bias. Independent current–potential curves for each half-reaction are also obtained under identical experimental conditions. The intersection points of these curves, representing the predicted mixed potential and net current, showed good agreement with the values measured in the short-circuited system. These results provide clear evidence that CO oxidation in aqueous media proceeds via a mixed-potential-driven mechanism, analogous to corrosion. This finding provides strong support for the hypothesis that low-temperature CO oxidation over-supported Au catalysts in the presence of water vapor proceeds via a similar electrochemical pathway in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.},

Moreover, LiTFSI ionic liquids are introduced into the healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) to prepare a transparent healable compliant electrode (PHT-IL) that does not obscure the light emission of PHT-ZnS:Cu dielectric elastomer. Then, an integral healable DEA (ISDEA) with an excellent interfacial interaction is constructed by coating two sides of PHT-ZnS:Cu with PHT-IL. The optimized ISDEA displays an actuated strain of 17.0% at 15 kV mm −1 with a healing efficiency of 91.9%. The integrated ISDEAs are used as soft anti-counterfeiting labels and soft intelligent keyboards for information transmission, encryption, and human-machine interaction, showing prospective applications in the realm of data leakage prevention and personal privacy protection.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this maturation are not yet fully understood. In this study, YTHDC1 is identified as a key positive regulator of hepatocyte maturation and an essential factor in maintaining liver homeostasis. YTHDC1 expression increases in the liver after birth, and hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ythdc1 impairs hepatocyte maturation, leading to reduced liver weight, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. These defects contribute to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. YTHDC1 supports postnatal hepatocyte maturation and liver function by enhancing the expression of key transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2, at the posttranscriptional level through m 6 A recognition. Restoring FOXA1 or FOXA2 expression mitigates the phenotypic defects observed in Ythdc1 -HKO mice. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 binds to the m 6 A regions of Foxa1 and Foxa2 mRNAs, promoting their expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which YTHDC1 regulates hepatocyte maturation.},

Here, the label-free and non-invasive detection of multiple tau variants dynamics across developmental stages, age-related variants, and various APOE isogenic genotyes is presented to investigate the APOE –tau axis using human cerebral organoids (hCOs) combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SERS signals successfully identifies four developmental stages of hCOs: embryonic body, neuronal differentiation, maturation, and maintenance phases. Temporal dynamics of age-related tau protein secretion are observed, reflecting characteristics associated with AD, which are diminished by astrocyte expression. PCA-based dimensionality reduction of SERS signals further reveals distinct clustering for different APOE isogenic genotypes, with tau protein secretion increasing from APOE2/E2 to APOE4/E4 , providing direct insight into the APOE –tau axis in AD. This study introduces a novel method for the non-invasive clinical assessments of disease conditions, dynamics, and the relationship between APOE and tau in AD.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising strategy for obesity treatment. It is previously identified βFaar as a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulator of islet β-cell function in individuals with obesity, but its effect on WAT browning is not well understood. In this study, it is discovered that βFaar expression in adipose tissue markedly decreases with the progression of obesity in both mice and humans. βFaar in adipose tissue reduces lipid droplet (LD) size in WAT and promotes a browning phenotype in inguinal WAT (iWAT), leading to the amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. These effects can be attributed to crosstalk between βFaar and proteins within the master regulatory pathways of LD formation and WAT browning, including RAS oncogene family 18 (RAB18) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). Specifically, βFaar inhibits LD swelling by binding to RAB18 and promoting IRF4 nuclear translocation, increases uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription, and further induces iWAT browning by binding to karyopherin subunit alpha 6 (KPNA6). Together, these results demonstrate the critical roles of βFaar in regulating iWAT browning and preserving metabolic health; thus, βFaar may be a potential therapeutic target for management of obesity and related disorders.},

  abstract     = {Engineering functional 3D tissue constructs is essential for developing advanced organ-like systems, with applications ranging from fundamental biological research to drug testing. The generation of complex multicellular structures requires the integration of external geometric and mechanical cues with the ability to activate genetic programs that regulate and stimulate cellular self-organization. Here, it is demonstrated that gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels serve as effective matrices for 3D cell culture, supporting both in situ genetic manipulation and cell growth. HEK293T cells embedded in GelMA remained viable and proliferated over 16 days, forming clusters within the matrix. Efficient gene delivery is achieved in the 3D hydrogel environment using both plasmid DNA and mRNA as gene vectors. Furthermore, in situ prime editing is applied to induce permanent genetic modifications in embedded cells. To achieve spatially confined gene expression, gel-embedded channels are introduced that allowed localized stimulation via doxycycline perfusion through a Tet-On system. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating gene delivery, inducible expression, and spatial control within GelMA-based hydrogels, establishing a versatile framework for engineered 3D cell systems with programmable genetic activity.},

  abstract     = {Syngas production through CO 2 electrochemical reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has attracted numerous attention for reducing carbon emissions and increasing chemical feedstocks. However, the precise regulation of H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas remains a challenge, especially through simple and feasible methodologies. In this work, a novel composite electrocatalyst, copper-indium/black phosphorus ( CuIn/BP ) is developed, using a simple one-step co-reduction method for efficient CO 2 RR. It is found for the first time that there is a linear relationship between BP content in CuIn/BP and the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas. Consequently, the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas can be precisely tailored by simply adjusting the BP content in CuIn/BP . A total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H 2 reached ≈ 100% along with a current density of 135.2 mA cm −2 . Mechanistic studies suggest that the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species are in situ generated in CuIn/BP , where the CuIn phases mainly contribute to CO generation, while the Cu 3 P species promote H 2 formation. The variation in BP content modulates the proportion of the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species, leading to the variations in H 2 /CO molar ratios. Thus, this study provides an efficient and simple strategy to tailor the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas for various industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen, produced via renewable-energy-driven water electrolysis, is among the most promising new energy carriers. Ru is a potential catalyst for this purpose; however, its strong hydrogen binding strength results in poor reaction kinetics, limiting its application potential. Creating a new Ru structure by introducing a second element is crucial for optimizing its catalytic performance. However, only a few studies have explored this approach, leaving the understanding of how chemical composition influences Ru's structure and catalytic activity elusive. Here, a systematic study is reported on Si decoration of Ru, achieving a tunable local environment around Ru and optimized reaction kinetics. By constructing a Ru-SiO x interleaved Turing-patterned structure, the ratio of Si coordinated to Ru is tuned by well-designed selective etching. With increasing Si content, the H-binding strength on the Ru center is progressively weakened, resulting in a V-shaped trend in hydrogen production activity. The optimized sample exhibits a low overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline solution, along with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec −1 , surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C. This study establishes a valuable framework for optimizing the surface properties and catalytic activity of noble metals.},

Typically, the various rate constants are obtained by numerically fitting of the photoluminescence (PL) decay, but it is overlooked whether or not the solution of such a fit is unique. Using an analytical model, it is demonstrated that for typical TADF emitters only the sum of k S and k ISC , and the sum of k T and k rISC can be uniquely obtained from the transient PL decay and PL quantum yield (PLQY) experiments. Depending whether nonradiative losses stem from singlets or triplets, various combinations of k T and k rISC , k S and k ISC can be used to obtain the same transient PL decay, while keeping the PLQY constant. The only exception is the case of unity PLQY that allows for a direct determination of all relevant kinetic rates from just a single transient PL measurement. It is further shown that additional PL measurements in oxygen atmosphere with complete triplet quenching are redundant, since the results can be explicitly predicted from PL measurements in inert atmosphere. Using the TADF emitter CzDBA with a PLQY as high as 90% as a model system, it is demonstrated that by a combination of PL decay, PLQY, and OLED device modeling it is possible to quantify all the individual kinetic rates. For CzDBA neat film with PLQY as high as 90%, the majority of nonradiative losses stems from triplets, showing it is vital to conduct comprehensive studies on the molecular origin of nonradiative losses in the future.},

However, achieving uniform and stable coverage of the textured silicon substrate with hole-selective layer (HSL) remains a significant challenge. Herein, a HSL material, DPAICz ((indolo[2,3-a]carbazole-11,12-diylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(phosphonic acid)), is reported specifically designed for textured silicon substrate. Compared to the typical HSL material 2PACz, DPAICz features a π-expanded conjugated core and multiple anchoring groups, forming a split-standing configuration with anchoring groups positioned on opposite sides, resulting in superior anchoring stability on textured substrate under external stimuli. Moreover, DPAICz exhibited a larger molecular dipole moment and a more pronounced p-type characteristic, enhancing the interfacial hole extraction efficiency. Consequently, wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells employing DPAICz as the HSL achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.42%. Introducing the DPAICz into monolithic silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells greatly improved their performance, achieving a remarkable PCE of 32.55% in 1 cm 2 area. Importantly, the unencapsulated tandems based on DPAICz exhibited significantly enhanced long-term operational stability, retaining 96% of its initial PCE after 880 h of continuous 1-sun light soaking at 45 °C under open-circuit condition.},

Solid-state memristive devices, such as crossbar arrays and percolated nanoparticle (NP) networks, already demonstrate these properties. However, closer similarity to neural networks is expected from liquid-state systems, including polymer melts, which remain largely unexplored. Here, the resistive switching in silver/poly(ethylene glycol) (Ag/PEG) nanofluids, prepared by depositing gas-aggregated Ag NPs into PEGs of varying molecular mass, is investigated. These systems form long-range conductive NP bridges with reconfigurable resistance states in response to an electric field. The zeta-potential of Ag NPs and molecular mobility of PEG determine the prevalence of low resistance (ohmic) state, high resistance states (poor conductance) or intermediate transition states governed by space-charge-limited conduction or electron tunneling. The occurrence of these states is given by the interparticle gaps, which are determined by the conformation of PEG molecules adsorbed on the NPs. It is presented, for the first time, an equivalent circuit model for the Ag/PEG system. These findings pave the way to adopt polymer melts as matrices for neuromorphic engineering and bio-inspired electronics.},

Understanding the structure-property relationship is essential for the realization of their use in spintronic, valleytronic, and optoelectronic applications. Herein, after the high pressure-temperature synthesis of 3R-MoS 2 in a large volume cubic press, a concomitant experimental and theoretical high-pressure study of 3R-MoS 2 is reported, leading to the discovery of pressure-induced reversible isostructural phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Concurrent with the isostructural transitions, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed, owing to strong interlayer interaction and charge redistribution across the van der Waals gap under pressure. The pressure-induced enhancement of interlayer interactions together with the robust intrinsic layer stacking in 3R-MoS 2 prevent the layers from sliding under pressure and hinder a corresponding volume collapse. This study on continuous pressure-tuning of crystal and electronic structure in 3R-MoS 2 will play a vital role in developing the next-generation devices involving coupling of structural, optical, and electrical properties of 3R-polytypes of TMDs and other layered materials.},

However, achieving this heterogeneity within a single material remains a significant challenge. Here, a strategy to engineer spontaneously generated heterogeneous surface and bulk structures within a material is introduced. The resulting material is termed phase-separation and underwater reconfiguration-enhanced (PURE) elastomers. PURE elastomers integrate the high elasticity of the bulk with superior immunocompatibility at the surface. By de novo designing the immunomodulatory and alkyl acrylate monomer structures, this is regulated that the copolymer's spatial configurations, ultimately influencing its condensed structure. Tuning the alkyl side chain length facilitates the formation of a distinctive phase-separation pattern in elastomers that accommodates large deformations, resulting in excellent toughness and low hysteresis. Moreover, this phase structure supports a water-induced surface phase reconfiguration, aligning with in vivo applications. This reconfiguration enriches immunomodulatory groups at the material surface, significantly enhancing immunocompatibility. Consequently, these elastomers exhibit extremely low fibrotic capsule formation for up to one year in mice and two months in non-human primates. This findings introduce a class of durable, fibrosis-resistant materials and establish a new strategy for designing heterogeneous polymeric elastomers with broad biomedical applicability.},

FemXpress performs robustly on both simulated and real datasets, without requiring parental genomic information, and can also identify genes that escape XCI. Applying FemXpress to single-cell RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues of a cynomolgus monkey, we reveal heterogeneity in XCI origin across organs and cell types. In each organ, we identify candidate XCI-escaping genes, and within each cell type, we observe gene expression differences associated with XCI origin, potentially contributing to phenotypic variability. Furthermore, FemXpress demonstrated strong performance in phasing XCI in scRNA-Seq datasets from embryos and colon tumors. In summary, FemXpress provides a powerful approach for XCI status analysis, offering new insights into XCI dynamics at single-cell resolution.},

However, the practical application of traditional ceramic aerogels is constrained by their inherent mechanical brittleness. Herein, a strategy is proposed to customize mechanically tunable aerogels by armoring ceramic nanounits with pyrolytic carbon (PyC). The PyC encapsulating layers with various thicknesses are transformed into ductile tights or rigid armors, facilitating the mechanical customization of BN@PyC aerogel from superelasticity to rigidity across scales. Interestingly, the PyC armor imparts unique versatility to the aerogel, including flame retardancy, elastic response conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, owing to the thermal stability of the PyC armor, the BN@PyC aerogel maintains its mechanical integrity even after high-temperature thermal treatment, and exhibits an unexpected resistance to butane torch ablation. Integrating mechanical stability, high-temperature resistance, and multifunctionality, BN@PyC aerogels offer new possibilities for scalable applications in extreme environments. This facile strategy of armoring brittle ceramic aerogels with PyC provides a novel reference for customizing the mechanical properties of multifunctional aerogels.},

The key advancement lies in the stable polarized interface created by the ionogel, which enables rapid charging and high charge retention, leading to a significant instantaneous power within the first few raindrops and achieving an 8-fold increase in saturation performance over conventional design. The harvester only requires 25 droplets to reach saturation and maximum electrical output, achieving an impressive power density of 235.11 W m −2 and a conversion efficiency of 6.77%, being the highest recorded for ionogel and hydrogel-based droplet energy harvesters. Additionally, the adhesive nature of the ionogel enhances the device's stability and versatility in varying energy generation and steam leakage applications. This work advances the pursuit of sustainable energy harvesting by bridging materials science with practical application.},

This review explores the unique optical properties and tunable characteristics of these complexes, which enable effective reactive oxygen species generation and near-infrared light absorption for targeted cancer cell destruction. Metal-ligand complexes are classified based on their ligands and metal ions. The ligands include tetrapyrrolic structures, polypyridine, and polyphenols, while the metal ions comprise transition and noble metals. Their individual contributions to enhancing therapeutic efficacy are also explored. Fundamental interactions, including ligand-to-metal charge transfer and metal-ligand coordination, are examined. These interactions significantly influence the photoreactivity and biocompatibility of the complexes. Recent advances integrating metal-ligand complexes with other modalities, such as chemo-phototherapy and immunotherapy, are highlighted. These combinations offer promising approaches for synergistic tumor eradication. The challenges of ligand diversity, delivery optimization, and the underexplored mechanisms in PAT are also discussed. By integrating recent progress and prospective applications, this review emphasizes the critical importance of metal-ligand complexes in innovating cancer theranostic technologies.},

Here, it is reported that downregulation of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15B) significantly correlated with poor outcomes in patients with KRAS mut -PDAC. Mechanistically, KRAS mut /ERK1-elicited phosphorylation of ABHD17C promotes depalmitoylation and membrane-to–cytoplasm translocation of ALOX15B, facilitating proteasome-dependent degradation of ALOX15B via interaction with the E3 ligase complex CUL4/DDB1/DCAF10. Notably, treatment with methyl protodioscin (MPD), a steroid saponin primarily purified from polygonatum sibiricum rhizome, restored the S-palmitoylation and membrane location of ALOX15B via disruption of the ABHD17C/ALOX15B interaction, consequently resulting in significant inhibition of growth rate of patient-derived KRAS mut -PDAC organoids in vitro and KRAS mut -PDAC-formed tumor in vivo via induction of ferroptosis. Therefore, these findings unveil a prominent role of ferroptosis evasion in KRAS mut -PDAC progression and highlight the potential of targeting KRAS/ERK1/ABHD17C/ALOX15B axis in KRAS mut -PDAC treatment.},

Conventional hydrovoltaic nanogenerators are constrained by their limited power density and suboptimal long-term stability. Therefore, a transpiration-driven electrokinetic power generator (TEPG) based on silk yarn coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/divinyl sulfone (DVS) and designed as a wearable hydrovoltaic nanogenerator offering outstanding power generation efficiency and water stability is presented in this study. Given its hydrophilic surface, mechanical durability, and high aspect ratio, silk yarn is used to design a yarn-based TEPG system to achieve high spatial-efficiency and maximize volumetric power density. Furthermore, the covalent crosslinking agent, DVS, is introduced to sustain the long-term, high-power production efficiency of PEDOT:PSS. The devised yarn-type TEPG system generates a maximum power of 112 µW cm −3 with artificial sweat. A system comprising 25 yarn-type TEPGs arranged in a series–parallel configuration is implemented utilizing the high spatial-efficiency of the sewable yarn-type TEPG.

  abstract     = {Incorporating conductive nanomaterials into polymers yields a new class of piezoresistive strain-sensing materials. While possessing monotonic resistance-strain behavior is a fundamental requirement for any material used for strain sensing, polymer nanocomposites frequently exhibit nonmonotonic resistance responses under strain, which limits their application prospects. In this study, physical experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to determine a feasible solution to overcome this limitation. The corresponding results demonstrate that regulating the initial inter-nanofiller junction geometry imparts complete control over the monotonic piezoresistive behavior of polymer nanocomposites. Mechanistically, monotonically increasing resistance responses under tension can be achieved by promoting active diffusion that causes van der Waals force-driven barrier crossing of nanofillers (resulting in direct contact between nanofillers, e.g., at elevated curing temperatures) during curing; thus, during deformation, nanofillers primarily move away from one another. Conversely, suppressing diffusion during curing causes barrier crossing of nanofillers, which results in resistance reduction, under deformation owing to stress-driven local rearrangement of polymer molecules in heterogeneous shear transformation zones. The mechanistic insights provided by this study can guide the design of next-generation, advanced strain-sensing materials in the future.},

However, while Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 mediated H3K27me3 clearly contributes to the formation of repressive chromatin loops in Arabidopsis , the role of PRC1 mediated H2Aub remains unclear. Notably, in the Arabidopsis genome, H2Aub and H3K27me3 marks do not always co-localize, and some regions are marked exclusively by H2Aub, but the contribution of these only-H2Aub regions to chromatin looping remains largely unexplored. By using Capture-High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (C-Hi-C) to specifically enrich interactions associated with H2Aub regions, it is find that H2Aub loops are preferentially established between two H2Aub enriched regions. Although pure only-H2Aub-loops can be detected, H2Aub regions tend to interact with regions marked by both H2Aub and H3K27me3, contributing to the formation of PcG hubs. Furthermore, it is find that maintaining appropriate level of H2Aub and H3K27me3 is essential for the stability of H2Aub loops and that the formation of these loops reinforce gene repression.

Without confirming the identifiability of these parameters, model predictions may be unreliable, limiting their usefulness for understanding biological mechanisms or informing experimental and clinical decisions. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework is proposed for practical identifiability analysis in dynamic models. Starting from a rigorous mathematical definition, it is proved that practical identifiability is equivalent to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability is further established, introducing an efficient metric that simplifies and accelerates identifiability assessment compared to traditional profile likelihood methods. To address non-identifiable parameters, new regularization terms are incorporated, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. Additionally, an optimal experimental design algorithm is developed to ensure all parameters are practically identifiable from collected data. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and biological models demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.},

This study introduces AntiBMPNN, an advanced deep-learning framework that leverages an antibody-specific 3D dataset, a fine-tuned message-passing neural network (MPNN), a frequency-based scoring function, and AlphaFold 3 to achieve highly accurate antibody sequence design. AntiBMPNN surpasses ProteinMPNN with a perplexity of 1.5 and over 80% sequence recovery. Its scoring function, combined with AlphaFold 3, effectively prioritizes sequences based on structural recovery, positional stability, and biochemical or complex properties. Experimental validation highlights a 75% success rate in single-point antibody design. AntiBMPNN consistently outperforms AbMPNN, AntiFold, and ProteinMPNN in designing complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1-3, yielding stronger binding affinities. For CDR1 of huJ3 (anti-HIV nanobody), it achieves a half maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 9.2 nM (nanomolar), better than ProteinMPNN (135.2 nM) and AntiFold (59.3 nM), and comparable to AbMPNN (6.6 nM). For CDR2 of the D6 nanobody (targeting CD16), AntiBMPNN reaches 0.3 nM, outperforming AbMPNN (2.3 nM), AntiFold (0.7 nM), and ProteinMPNN (0.7 nM). In CDR3 of huJ3, it achieves 1.7 nM, surpassing AbMPNN (51.2 nM), with no detectable activity from AntiFold or ProteinMPNN.

Spinodal decomposition, a mechanism of phase separation, can result in a highly interconnected pore morphology, though controlling this process is difficult in practice, limiting its application for in vitro models. Here, a straightforward method is introduced for dynamically halting the phase separation of a gelatin methacryloyl and poly(vinyl alcohol) (GelMA-PVA) polymer blend in the context of a biofabrication process based on dynamic interface printing (DIP). This is enabled by a novel approach based on the concerted application of acoustic mixing and photocuring to structure the pore size, orientation, and interconnectivity in hydrogels. This approach accordingly enables spatially addressable fabrication of 3D hydrogel architectures, with the potential to enhance the functionality of engineered tissues via tailored microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Food-grade lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) have been widely used as functional carriers of various nutrients and clinical drugs; however, the potential for FLNs to induce substantial biological effects is often overlooked. Here, it is found that FLNs are first delivered to the early endosomes and then preferentially fused with lipid droplets (LDs) after entering the cells through endocytosis. This process leads to a notable LDs accumulation, which in turn triggers autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. The cascade ultimately promotes tumor cell growth and invasion. However, autophagy inhibition while FLNs treatment counteracts these effects and further causes mitochondria damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and excessive LDs accumulation, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. This indicates a potential anti-tumor strategy. The animal tests further demonstrate that intratumoral injection of FLNs together with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis without harming normal cells in mice, confirming a promising and safe anti-tumor strategy of applying FLNs under autophagy inhibition conditions. The findings represent a substantial step forward in comprehending the biological effects of biomedical carriers.},

Consequently, the development of suitable intratumoral microbiota analysis methods is crucial. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) involves straightforward operations and provides precise results, the “direct smear method” limits the identification of bacterial subspecies. Furthermore, the issue of inadequate quantification with MALDI MS renders it unsuitable for direct analysis of intratumoral bacteria. To address these challenges, a novel ionic liquid in this study is employed, called norharmane conjugated to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Nor@DHB) for the direct detection of intratumoral bacteria using MALDI MS. Because gram-negative bacteria are dominant within cancer cells, lipid A is selected as the chemical fingerprint for bacterial identification. The results demonstrated that using Nor@DHB can enhance the lipid A signal by an order of magnitude and achieved a good linear relationship within a concentration range of 0.01–80 ng mL −1 . Here, this method is successfully applied to the direct analysis of lipid A in actual clinical samples. Subsequent machine learning and nomogram models further confirmed the correlation between characteristic lipid A ions and LC patient clinicopathological features, which are further validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

Positive correlations between Gal3 expression and renal fibrosis are observed in both DKD patients and mice.

Genetic ablation of Gal3 globally or specifically in macrophages, as well as pharmacological inhibition of Gal3, significantly attenuated kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, macrophage-derived Gal3 interacted with TGFβ receptor2 (TGFBR2) and Pro-TGFβ1, preventing TGFBR2 proteasomal degradation in fibroblasts and increasing TGFβ1 levels in the diabetic kidney.

While these motifs are known to modulate phosphorylation efficiency, their quantitative impact on target site phosphorylation within long intrinsically disordered substrates remains largely unexplored. Using NMR spectroscopy, JNK1-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1, a 450-amino acid disordered substrate, is investigated, identifying eleven phosphosites with distinct phosphorylation efficiencies. By selectively disrupting JNK1 binding to the D- and F-motifs of JIP1, the determinants of phosphorylation efficiency are uncovered. Specifically, it is found that the D-motif selectively enhances phosphorylation in the C-terminal direction in a length-dependent manner, impressively increasing the phosphorylation efficiencies of sites located at sequence distances exceeding 120 amino acids, while the F-motif primarily promotes phosphorylation of a site located immediately N-terminal to the F-motif. Additionally, docking-site-independent phosphorylation is observed, whose efficiency is dictated by the intrinsic sequence preference of JNK1, as inferred from motif scores derived from positional scanning peptide arrays. The work highlights how docking site motifs and sequence context synergistically regulate phosphorylation efficiency, emphasizing the critical role of substrate architecture in determining MAPK-mediated signaling outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in the synthesis of biomimetic materials, the scalable fabrication of high-performance bulk materials under ambient conditions remains a formidable challenge— particularly when it comes to achieving rapid processing while preserving superior mechanical properties. Herein, inspired by nacre's “brick-and-mortar” structure, this work develops an energy-efficient approach that utilizes ice-templating technology as the structure framework and carbon mineralization for rapid CaCO 3 production, resulting in a strong yet tough carbon mineralized material (CMM) while also fixing CO 2 . This material replicates both the hierarchical microstructure and chemical composition of nacre. By precisely controlling the freezing dynamics with dual temperature gradients, this work creates an ordered lamellar skeleton composed of γ-dicalcium silicate (γ-C 2 S). The rapid, in situ carbon mineralization under mild conditions generates interspersed CaCO 3 grains within this structure, which are then infiltrated with gelatin to form a nacre-like CMM with exceptional mechanical properties. The resulting material exhibits a flexural strength of 45 MPa (eight times that of a cement-hydrogel composite) and a fracture toughness of 2.03 MJ m −3 (a 20-fold improvement over unmodified CMM), while maintaining a density of only 1.2 g cm −3 . The enhanced performance stems from multiscale toughening mechanisms, including crack deflection, secondary crack formation, and strong interfacial bonding, all of which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-performance synthetic materials through the synergistic integration of biomimetic principles with carbon mineralization, offering promising applications in the development of sustainable infrastructure and carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Effective management of postoperative pain and wound healing presents significant challenges in clinical settings, driving the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. The analgesic and wound healing effects of hydrogen (H 2 ) have gradually been recognized; however, the lack of efficient hydrogen delivery systems remains a major limitation. This study introduces a novel transdermal drug delivery system, which utilizes sustained-release photothermal microneedles (MNs) to ameliorate incisional pain and accelerate wound healing. Polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZIF-8@ammonia borane (AB) nanoparticles with photothermal conversion properties are designed, along with temperature-responsive QX-314-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for controlled release, which are delivered in vivo by dissolvable MNs. In vitro results showed that PDA@ZIF-8@AB nanoparticles can release H 2 continuously for up to 5 days in an acidic microenvironment, while the photothermal properties of PDA facilitated controlled release of QX-314 through 6 cycles of near-infrared (NIR) exposure. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MN system provided sustained analgesia for up to 5 days and promoted wound healing in the acidic microenvironment of postoperative incisions. Upon NIR exposure, the photothermal conversion of PDA activated membrane ion channels and induced thermally triggered deformation of PCL@QX-314 microspheres, allowing for on-demand release of QX-314 and targeted neuronal uptake, thus offering personalized analgesia. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo studies confirmed the biocompatibility of the system. This innovative approach not only highlights the dual role of H 2 in pain relief and wound healing but also provides a new personalized treatment strategy for postoperative pain management with promising clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT) has emerged as a promising approach due to its remarkable anticancer efficacy. However, hypoxic tumor microenvironment and insufficient energy deposition severely reduce the radiotherapy outcomes. Herein, lonidamine (LND)-loaded Fe(III) metal-Pt(II) porphyrin framework (FPTM-LP) is designed for radiosensitization through hypoxia alleviation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification. Specifically, the high-Z element Pt effectively absorbs X-ray photons to generate •OH for RT while transferring X-ray energy to porphyrin (TCPP), which stimulates the generation of 1 O 2 for RDT. Moreover, by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, the weak acidity and glutathione (GSH)-responsive release of LND achieves O 2 economization, which promotes the generation of ROS and stabilizes DNA damage. Intriguingly, Pt(II)TCPP exhibits the capability of O 2 concentration-dependent near infrared luminescence imaging-guided RT-RDT. Moreover, the decomposition of FPTM-LP under high concentration of GSH generates large amounts of Fe 2+ , leading to the augmented production of •OH via Fenton reactions. In brief, this work presents a radiosensitizer with a unique and efficient mechanism of self-monitoring hypoxia alleviation and increasing ROS levels for enhanced cancer RT-RDT. The radiosensitization potency of FPTM-LP is confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in vivo, proclaiming a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dots (CDs) have elicited attention in photodynamic antimicrobial applications, but their susceptibility to aggregation limits their effectiveness. Herein, CDs@ZIF-8 nanocomposites are synthesized. The results reveal that they have superior dual photodynamic enhanced antimicrobial properties, specifically 7.63 log 10 CFU mL −1 (lg) elimination for Escherichia coli (only 3.12 lg with CDs and 4.18 lg with ZIF-8) and 7.27 lg elimination for Staphylococcus aureus (only 4.17 lg with CDs and 2.94 lg with ZIF-8). Optoelectronic property analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial properties of CDs@ZIF-8 can be attributed to their narrow bandgap and higher binding affinity for O 2 , which facilitates the photo-generated e − –h + pairs separation and promotes the generation of 1 O 2 and •O 2 − . Furthermore, the CDs@ZIF-8/polycaprolactone/ethyl cellulose nanofibrous films are prepared by microfluidic-blow-spinning, which have prominent antimicrobial properties and extend the shelf life of strawberries from 6 to 12 d.

Consequently, the D-A polymer PTZ-Pz shows a high specific capacity of 208 mAh g −1 . The electrode exhibits an ultra-long cyclability of more than 80 000 cycles, with an excellent rate performance of 116 mAh g −1 at 20 A g −1 . Benefiting from the fast kinetics, the PTZ-Pz cathode can operate well at a high mass loading of 44.2 mg cm −2 .

  abstract     = {Red mark syndrome (RMS) is a disease affecting rainbow trout. Although the precise etiology of this disease is still under debate, a Midichloria-like organism (MLO) is suspected as the triggering agent. RMS provokes characteristic skin lesions. Previous investigations pointed to a local immune response characterized by a B cell influx. To elaborate on these findings, here, this study extensively characterizes systemic and local B cell responses in RMS-affected fish. The local influx of IgM+ B cells to the skin lesions is confirmed, and a differentiation of these B cells to plasma-like cells is demonstrated. IgM repertoires suggested a polyclonal activation of local B cells and some trafficking between skin and head kidney. Finally, the fact that transcripts of the gene coding for MLO 16S rRNA are found in sorted skin IgM + B cells and non-IgM + skin leukocytes reveals the capacity of this intracellular bacterium to be internalized by B cells, where it may possibly directly interfere with intracellular pathways. The data significantly advances the knowledge on RMS and provides another example of a fish pathology in which fish B cells seem pivotal, possibly because of the specific ways in which teleost B cells intrinsically sense and respond to pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is increasingly recognized as a negative prognostic factor for cancers, including osteosarcoma. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to chemoresistance in osteosarcoma remain unclear. This study found obesity is significantly associated with poor responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. In vitro, adipocyte-conditioned medium (Adi-CM) induced cisplatin resistance, while peritumoral adipocytes and diet-induced obesity (DIO) reduce the cisplatin efficacy in vivo. Mechanistically, Adi-CM enhanced DNA repair by the PARP1/ATM pathway activation. Proteomic analysis identified A1BG, a secreted protein upregulated in adipocytes from chemoresistant patients, as a key mediator of this effect. A1BG depletion in adipocytes restored cisplatin sensitivity, whereas recombinant A1BG enhanced resistance and promoted DNA repair. Further investigation revealed a direct interaction between A1BG and NAMPT, leading to the stabilization of NAMPT and an increased NAD + production. This enhanced PARP1 activity and subsequent DNA repair. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT and PARP1 using FK886 and Olaparib, respectively, reversed Adi-CM-induced cisplatin resistance and restored cisplatin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells, DIO mouse models, and patient-derived organoids. A novel link between obesity and cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma is established, highlighting the A1BG/NAMPT/PARP1 axis as a critical driver. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming obesity-associated chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.},

The role of migrasomes in endothelial-immune interactions remains unclear. This study explores migrasome evolution in the atherosclerotic (AS) microenvironment, highlighting their function as amplifiers in the inflammatory cascade. Through analysis of ApoE −/- mouse models and single-cell multi-omics data, migrasome activity is mapped using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) algorithms. Co-culture systems and anti-Cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) blocking experiments are employed to investigate immune-metabolic reprogramming triggered by migrasome cargo signaling. Advanced imaging and functional studies demonstrated that the interaction between amyloid protein precursor (APP) ligands on endothelial cells and CD74 receptors on macrophages triggers endothelial cells to produce more migrasomes. The clinical relevance of these findings is confirmed through CD74 blocking experiments, which effectively disrupted migrasome-mediated signaling and attenuated atherosclerotic progression. Importantly, migrasome content is positively correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis. These results fundamentally challenge existing paradigms of intercellular communication by establishing migrasomes as dual-functional entities – serving both as biomarkers of endothelial stress and molecular drivers of immune microenvironment deterioration. The discovery of the “migrasome-APP-CD74” signaling network opens new avenues for developing organelle-targeted therapies to interrupt the vicious cycle of vascular inflammation.},

However, the mechanisms regulating ID1 ubiquitination in ESCC are not well understood. This study identifies TRIM21 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ID1 for K11-linked ubiquitination at lysine 91. Unlike typical ubiquitination that marks proteins for degradation, TRIM21-mediated K11 ubiquitination does not affect ID1 stability. Instead, it disrupts the ID1-TCF12 interaction, releasing TCF12 to activate SLC31A1, a copper transporter. Elevated SLC31A1 expression increases intracellular copper, inducing cuproptosis and inhibiting ESCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Functional assays show that overexpressing TRIM21 suppresses ESCC progression, while TRIM21 knockdown promotes growth. Clinically, low TRIM21 expression correlates with advanced disease stage and poorer patient survival rate, underscoring its prognostic value. Additionally, Sorafenib treatment upregulates TRIM21, enhancing ID1 ubiquitination, increasing SLC31A1 expression, and inducing cuproptosis. These findings uncover the TRIM21-ID1-TCF12-SLC31A1 axis as a critical pathway in ESCC progression, suggesting that targeting this axis with Sorafenib can offer a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and improving patient outcomes.},

This study conducted a comprehensive prognostic meta-analysis involving 2,968 patients with diffuse glioma and established a comprehensive machine learning framework with nested resampling of 18 machine learning algorithms, and developed the Immune Glioma Survival Signature (IGLoS). This signature, comprising CCL19, ICOSLG, IL11, PTGES, TNFAIP3, and TRAF3IP3, has been demonstrated to predict survival outcomes across a range of cancers and to correlate with tumor progression at the level of multi-omics.

Furthermore, siRNA screening has underscored the critical role of TRAF3IP3 in modulating PDL1 expression and immune pathways, with implications on the ERK pathway and NFATC2 involvement. Through single-cell analysis of published and in-house datasets, TRAF3IP3 exhibited selective enrichment in NPC-like and MES-like tumor cells, and showed a dual functionality in mediating T-Cell Exhaustion.

  abstract     = {Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is one of the significant characteristics of poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), strongly associated with high mortality rates. Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial treatment modality for OSCC LNM, yet its limited response rate severely restricts its clinical application. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered immunogenic cell death (ICD), is often hindered by lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, which also contributes significantly to the lack of response to immunotherapy. Herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodrug loaded with orlistat (ORL) is developed, designated as ORL@Cu-MOF. This nanodrug is designed to respond and release under the high glutathione (GSH) stimulus of the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby inducing cuproptosis and suppressing fatty acid metabolism in OSCC cells. In vivo, ORL@Cu-MOF effectively triggers cuproptosis and inhibits fatty acid metabolism, exerting antitumor effects in mouse models and remodeling the TME. Furthermore, the combination of ORL@Cu-MOF with programmed death receptor-1 (αPD-1) significantly enhances immunotherapy outcomes, transforming “cold tumors” into “hot tumors”. This study is the first to report the synergistic use of cuproptosis induction and fatty acid metabolism suppression in the treatment of metastatic cancer, offering novel insights for the care and management of LNM of OSCC.},

The screening focuses on a wide range of ferrite systems (M 1-x Fe x O y , M═Mn, Al, Mg, Co, Ni, 0.05< x< 0.95) and particularly underscores the (MgMnCo) 1-x Fe x O y system for its high oxygen capacity during redox cycles. Remarkably, (MgMnCo) 0.65 Fe 0.35 O y achieves state-of-the-art turnover number and a higher theoretical solar-to-fuel efficiency of 43.6% compared to benchmark ceria at 17.4%. CALPHAD-based thermodynamic analysis and spectroscopic electronic structure analysis reveal that the excellent redox performance of this material is attributed to the simultaneous contributions of Fe and Mn cations. This dual active feature is discovered for the first time in any ferrite cycles to the best of available knowledge, offering significant opportunities to explore new multi-cation ferrite systems in the related research field. In addition, the screening methodology employed here can potentially be extended to other thermochemical processes.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the morphology of the active layer is crucial for achieving high photovoltaic conversion efficiency in all-polymer solar cells (APSCs). Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an essential post-treatment strategy for controlling active layer morphology. However, most current SVA are conducted ex situ, limiting their ability to accurately reveal the morphological evolution of active layers of APSCs. In this study, in situ synchrotron radiation GIWAXS and in situ UV–vis spectroscopy combined with GISAXS is used to monitor the morphological evolution of PM6/PY-IT blends during the SVA process in real-time. Results showed that the PY-IT absorption peak exhibited a red shift under a nonpolar carbon disulfide vapor, while a blue shift is observed during the SVA process with a polar chloroform vapor. The SVA process can be divided into three stages: solvent swelling, recrystallization, and molecular rearrangement. For thermally pre-annealed samples subjected to chloroform SVA, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased by 15.1%. The improved PCE stems from reduced crystal plane spacing (d-spacing), enhanced crystal coherence length, and optimal phase separation via SVA. Pre-annealing suppresses excessive swelling, emphasizing the reordering dynamical role in the morphology of APSCs. This study offers insights into balancing SVA conditions to maximize performance and minimize adverse effects.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between the intestinal commensal microflora and the mucosal immune system. Non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis , a common human colon symbiote, has been shown to alleviate colitis. However, the underlying mechanisms of this alleviation remain incompletely understood. Herein, it is demonstrated that promoting the secretion of B. fragilis outer membrane vesicles (Bf OMVs+ ) enhances its ability to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, while inhibiting B. fragilis OMV secretion (Bf OMVs− ) reduces this effect. Bf OMVs+ alleviates colitis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Further, B. fragilis OMVs (Bf-OMVs) are isolated and extracted, then administered them intraperitoneally to DSS-induced colitis mice, observing that Bf-OMVs can target intestinal tissues, the spleen, and bone marrow, and they are internalized by neutrophils to inhibit NET formation, thereby alleviating colitis. The expression profile of miRNAs in Bf-OMVs is assessed, revealing that Bf-OMVs are enriched with mmu-miR-like sRNA, miR-5119, which targets and inhibits PD-L1, leading to the suppression of GSDMD-mediated NET release and promoting the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), culminating in the alleviation of colitis. These findings provide new insights into the role of B. fragilis OMVs in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD.},

Despite its potential relevance, the role of this interaction in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unexplored due to the lack of effective molecular tools. To address this, we employed SRiApt, an aptamer generated through the recently established Blocker-SELEX pipeline. Its biological stability is improved by phosphorothioate modifications to form PT f -SRiApt. Using this aptamer, the critical role of the SCAF4-POLR2A interaction in driving TNBC tumor growth and immune regulation is uncovered. PT f -SRiApt effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells with elevated SCAF4 and POLR2A expression. Additionally, PT f -SRiApt promotes premature mRNA termination, boosting antigen presentation and promoting T-cell infiltration. Analysis of patient samples further confirmed the negative correlation between SCAF4-POLR2A interaction and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, highlighting the potential of PT f -SRiApt in improving immune efficacy. Together, the work provides a powerful tool not only for dissecting previously “undruggable” protein-protein interactions but also for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.},

Activation of nociceptors in acute inflammatory pain (AIP) significantly reduced sleep by 45–50% in the first 6 h, with reduced sleep spindle density for 1–3 h post-AIP. Additionally, an “optogenetic pain (Opto-Pain)” model is implemented to produce acute peripheral pain-induced awakenings that reduced sleep comparable to AIP. Both pain models are used to test the role of wake-promoting neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that express Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (PBel CGRP ) in relaying nociceptive stimulus from the dorsal horn as part of the spine-ponto-amygdaloid tract. Blocking PBel CGRP neurons with genetic ablation or optogenetic inhibition attenuated sleep loss. To dissect the PBel CGRP pathways, the terminals are then optogenetically silenced post-AIP and found the reversal of sleep disturbances in the following descending order of effectiveness: substantia innominata of the basal forebrain (SI-BF) > central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) > bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) > the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In SI-BF and CeA, a similar reversal of AIP-induced sleep loss occurred with pharmacological blocking of either CGRP or NMDA receptors.

While tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) mediate intercellular communication, their role in shaping TAMs phenotypes and function remains unclear. This study explores how TNTs facilitate the transfer of tumor-derived materials, particularly fatty acids, to TAMs, affecting macrophage polarization and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations in the TME. Enrichment analysis pinpointed key substances transferred via TNTs. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyzed the fatty acids involved. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated TNTs-mediated material transfer, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the associated signaling pathways. TNTs are the primary route for transferring tumor-derived fatty acids, notably arachidonic acid (AA), to macrophages. This transfer reprogrammed TAMs from anti-tumor CD5L + to pro-tumor TREM2 + phenotypes, increasing CCL18 secretion, reducing phagocytic activity, and impairing CD8 + T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, AA activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, driving TAMs polarization. These findings are confirmed in xenograft models, where TNTs-induced TAMs exhibited enhanced pro-tumor properties. TNTs-mediated transfer of tumor-derived AA reprograms TAMs via PI3K-AKT activation, promoting immune suppression and tumor progression, highlighting TNTs and PI3K-AKT as potential therapeutic targets in iCCA.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary vascular remodeling, which current therapeutic targets fail to alleviate disease severity, plays a key role in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Irisin is identified as a protective factor involved in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in PAH remains unknown. To investigate, plasma irisin levels and its local pulmonary artery expression are measured in patients with PAH and mouse models. Irisin expression is significantly decreased in patients with PAH and PAH mouse models. Furthermore, overexpression and exogenous injection of irisin effectively alleviate hemodynamic and right-heart function in PAH mouse models, meanwhile, it also reverses proliferation and cell cycle progression of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To illustrate the mechanism of irisin exerts on PAH, Enolase 1 is identified as a key irisin-interacting protein. Irisin suppresses proliferation of PDGF-induced PASMCs by promoting ubiquitination status of Enolase 1 via E3 ligase of down regulated protein 4 in neural precursor cell development. Co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking analyses verifies the interaction and binding sites between irisin and its interactive proteins. Overall, these findings suggest that, irisin is a novel protective factor downregulated in PAH. By ubiquitination, irisin promotes Enolase 1 degradation and suppresses cell proliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria in changing environments rely on motility and sensory mechanisms to locate optimal conditions. This process depends on specialized chemoreceptors to sense environmental stimuli. Exceptionally high numbers of chemoreceptor genes are present in magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), which combine magnetic alignment via intracellular magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) and oxygen sensing for a unique navigation strategy toward low-oxygen zones, called magneto-aerotaxis. However, chemoreceptors for aerotaxis in MTB have not been experimentally identified. This study examines chemoreceptors in the model MTB Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense . Gene deletion analysis shows that M. gryphiswaldens e relies on a complex and partly redundant set of chemoreceptors to sense oxygen. Within this diverse repertoire of chemoreceptors, a receptor formed by two interacting proteins is identified that plays a key role in aerotaxis. Interaction assays and microscopy confirm that both proteins interact within polar-lateral regions in the cell. Moreover, genetic, biochemical, and motility experiments demonstrate that the chemoreceptor complex promotes a cellular response away from oxygen via the redox cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), independent of magnetic fields. These findings provide first insights into how MTB control oxygen sensing at the molecular level, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying bacterial navigation and highly complex chemosensory systems.},

Early infiltration of macrophages predicts the adverse outcome of grafts, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Significant infiltration of M1 macrophages and upregulation of Rictor in macrophages are observed in ABMR allografts. Deficiency of Rictor in macrophages exacerbates histological injury and shortens the survival of ABMR allografts by promoting macrophage M1 polarization. Additionally, loss of Rictor in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation through activating NF-κB. Mechanistically, Rictor upregulates E3 ubiquitin ligase SOCS1 to enhance K48-linked ubiquitination of p65, thereby suppressing macrophage M1 polarization. Taken together, Rictor ameliorates acute ABMR following kidney transplantation by suppressing macrophage M1 polarization through the p65-NLRP3 axis and may serve as a therapeutic target for ABMR.},

  abstract     = {Angiogenesis is vital for tumor growth and metastasis, with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) being key pro-angiogenic cells recruited by tumor-secreted chemokines. High levels of TAMs contribute to tumor progression and antiangiogenic therapy resistance. Therefore, intensive study of the regulatory mechanisms of TAMs recruitment during tumor development is important for the discovery of new antitumor and antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ENH levels positively correlated with microvessel density and TAMs infiltration. Further exploration revealed that ENH promoted LUAD angiogenesis and growth by stimulating TAMs recruitment and M2 polarization. Mechanistically, ENH in LUAD induced YAP nuclear aggregation to promote CCL5 transcription, thereby increasing monocyte chemotaxis and ultimately increasing TAMs infiltration and M2 polarization. Besides, we found that ENH interacted with YAP through LIM domains, which significantly triggered the formation of YAP-KPNA2 complexes. Consequently, YAP is imported into the nucleus by KPNA2 and then promoted CCL5 transcription. Notably, ENH knockdown also significantly increased the chemosensitivity. Together, ENH functions in LUAD cells to mediate macrophage infiltration and M2 polarization, which in turn promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth, and targeting ENH offers a promising target for antiangiogenic therapy through immune modulation.},

The method leverages the Two-Point Correlation function to directly estimate the variance from a single image, thereby enabling phase fraction prediction with associated confidence levels. The approach is validated using open-source datasets, demonstrating its efficacy across diverse microstructures. This technique significantly reduces the data requirements for representativity analysis, providing a practical tool for material scientists and engineers working with limited microstructural data.

  abstract     = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive nature and limited response to immunotherapy. This study identifies lactate-induced histone lactylation as a novel epigenetic mechanism in SCLC, contributing to immune escape and poor therapeutic outcomes. By identifying the LDH-H3K18La-Nur77 axis, new insights into the metabolic regulation of immune responses in SCLC are offered. Multi-omics analysis, including metabolomics and TCR sequencing, is used to compare serum samples and immune cell profiles from SCLC patients. Data from Shanzhong cohort (n = 222), along with a validation cohort from the IMpower133 study (n = 264), demonstrates that LDH levels are associated with poorer outcomes following immunotherapy. ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays reveal that lactate-induced histone lactylation at H3K18La induces transcriptional activation of Nur77 in naïve CD8 + T cells, leading to tonic TCR signaling, which impairs antigen recognition and prevents effective anti-tumor activity. In preclinical SCLC models, lactate inhibition reduces Nur77 expression, restores T cell function, and enhances the efficacy of PD-1 blockade, leading to a decreased tumor burden and improved survival. This study uncovers a novel mechanism of immune escape in SCLC through lactate-driven histone lactylation and provides the first evidence that targeting lactate metabolism can enhance immunotherapy effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Fibroblast collagen synthesis is a hallmark of the pathogenesis and progression of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). However, the factors that trigger the abnormal activation of fibroblasts in PF are still not well understood. Using proteomics and single-cell sequencing dataset screening, extra accumulation of Cathepsin K (CTSK) is detected in the periphery as well as in fibroblasts in the lungs of PF mouse models. Addition of recombinant CTSK (rCTSK) aggravates collagen accumulation and PF progression in bleomycin-induced PF mice. Mechanically, CTSK underwent endocytosis through interaction with sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), which is engaged in TGF-β1 induced SMAD3 activation for downstream glutaminase 1 (GLS1) upregulation and glutamine enrichment. In turn, extra glutamine increases collagen synthesis in fibroblasts. More significantly, serum CTSK levels positively correlated with glutamine levels and poor prognosis in patients with PF. Thus, the results identify CTSK as a novel regulator of fibroblast activation that remodels glutamine metabolism and promotes collagen synthesis during PF pathogenesis. The correlation between peripheral CTSK and glutamine levels implies its future feasibility in the prediction and prevention of PF progression.},

However, maternal DNA contamination in SECM significantly hampers the reliability of embryonic chromosome ploidy profiles, leading to false negative results, particularly at high contamination levels. Here, we present DECENT ( de ep c opy number variation (CNV) r e co n s t ruction), a deep learning method to reconstruct embryonic CNVs and mitigate maternal contamination in SECM from single-cell methylation sequencing of cfDNA. DECENT integrates sequence features and methylation patterns by combining convolution modules, long-short memory, and attention mechanisms to infer the origin of cfDNA reads. The benchmarking study demonstrated DECENT's ability to estimate contamination proportions and restore embryonic chromosome aneuploidies in samples with varying contamination levels. In contaminated SECM clinical samples, including one with more than 80% maternal reads, DECENT achieved consistent CNV recovery with invasive tests. Overall, DECENT contributes to enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness of cfDNA-based noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing, establishing a robust groundwork for its extensive clinical utilization in the field of reproductive medicine.},

Structured light enables spatial control of beams, offering new opportunities for underwater sensing, imaging, and signal transmission. However, compact and robust water-immersed photonic devices remain challenging to realize. Among various approaches, dielectric metasurfaces are particularly promising for underwater optics due to their flat form factor and subwavelength phase control. Nevertheless, current platforms suffer from instability in liquids, incomplete phase modulation, or strong sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Here, ultrathin water-immersed metasurfaces composed of gallium phosphide (GaP) Huygens’ integrated resonance units (HIRUs) operating in the visible regime are demonstrated. By leveraging the high refractive index and low optical loss of GaP, and integrating both forward and inverse design strategies, metasurfaces with planar geometry (≈1/5 of the operating wavelength), enhanced fabrication tolerance, and stable in-liquid operation are realized. These metasurfaces generate various structured light beams in water, including abruptly autofocusing (AAF) beams, Bessel beams, optical vortices, and Gaussian focusing beams. This work establishes a scalable and reliable platform for underwater nanophotonics and emerging IoUT-related applications.},

Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) are vital for tendon repair, with their stemness crucial to healing outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD248 in regulating TSPC stemness and assessed the therapeutic potential of si-CD248-loaded liposomes in promoting tendon-bone healing under osteoporotic conditions. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified increased TSPC populations, particularly a unique subcluster, TSPC-0, with elevated CD248 expression in osteoporotic tendon samples. CD248 + TSPCs displayed reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and impaired migration, driven by altered FAK-JAK-STAT1 signaling. si-CD248-loaded liposomes were formulated and characterized, demonstrating efficacy in inhibiting CD248 expression, restoring TSPC stemness, and promoting tendon-bone healing. In osteoporotic mice, liposome treatment significantly enhanced tissue regeneration, improving histological scores, collagen organization, and biomechanical properties. This study reveals that elevated CD248 expression negatively impacts TSPC stemness and impairs healing under osteoporotic conditions.

  abstract     = {Porcine extended potential stem cells (pEPSCs), which exhibit both self-renewal and pluripotency, are promising for application in both agricultural biotechnology and regenerative medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these two interconnected properties remain elusive. Here, two types of CRISPR-Cas9 screenings are conducted in pEPSCs. This fitness screening identified several genes essential for cell viability, including PRMT1 , MYBL2 , and NASP . Concurrently, FACS-based screenings revealed genes crucial for pluripotency, such as SOX2 , ZFP42 , and FOXH1 . Notably, it is demonstrated that FOXH1 is required for maintaining pluripotency in pEPSCs, which complements the understanding of its role in mesendoderm specification. pEPSCs lacking FOXH1 exhibited a flatter and more dispersed clonal morphology, accompanied by downregulation of pluripotency genes and upregulation of lineage-specific genes. Additionally, FOXH1 knockdown significantly impaired blastocyst formation during early pig embryogenesis. Functionally, the dual role of FOXH1 in pluripotency maintenance and cell differentiation is validated: FOXH1 preserves pluripotency by enhancing chromatin accessibility at pluripotency gene loci, while also influencing lineage specification through H3K4me3 modification at developmental related genes. Thus, these findings uncover a novel role of FOXH1 involved in the core regulatory network that orchestrates gene expression programs to maintain the pluripotency state of pEPSCs and provide valuable insights into categorizing gene function.},

  abstract     = {Most patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) may initially experience high-frequency hearing loss linked to greater vulnerability of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlear basal turn. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this susceptibility in the high-frequency region remains unclear. Here, NOX2 is first identified as a differentially expressed gene related to oxidative damage in the apical and basal turns through single-cell RNA sequencing. In mouse cochleae damaged by neomycin and noise, Nox2-positive OHCs increase progressively from the apex to base, indicating that NOX2 expression clearly differed significantly between the apical and basal OHCs. In NOX2 knockout mice, OHC damage caused by neomycin and noise exposure is significantly reduced. Furthermore, knocking out NOX2 increases the expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and Nrf2 nuclear translocation in OHCs. In addition, Nrf2 inhibitors counteract the protective effect of NOX2 knockout against neomycin. Finally, when Nox2 is used as the target, ginsenoside Rg1 is identified as a compound with protective effects against neomycin-induced hearing loss. In summary, these results indicate NOX2 is highly correlated with high-frequency OHCs vulnerability in the cochlea and is a potential intervention target for the clinical treatment of SNHL.},

However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially shows that plating starts at the interface between the electrode and the current collector where also a high degree of micropore filling and formation of pseudo-metallic sodium is found. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.},

Nitrate reduction is a complex multielectron, multiproton reaction, leading to multiple reaction pathways and numerous by-products. Moreover, the product distribution and Faradaic efficiency are highly dependent on the applied potential, often resulting in competing reactions, such as the hydrogen evolution reaction, which increase energy consumption. Therefore, the development of low-cost, highly active, highly selective, and scalable electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction is critical to advancing this field.

It also compiles and analyzes a wide range of research examples in the field, discusses current challenges, and offers perspectives on future research directions.

  abstract     = {Cobalt-free LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO) has recently emerged as a highly promising cathode material owing to its benefits of a high operating voltage platform (≈4.7 V vs Li), high theoretical energy density (≈650 Wh kg −1 ), eco-friendliness, and resource abundance. However, it has also demonstrated low cycle and poor rate performances. Researchers have hitherto identified multiple LNMO failure and degradation mechanisms, including the Jahn-Teller effect, Transition Metal (TM) dissolution, electrolyte decomposition, and Oxygen Vacancies (OVs). The Jahn-Teller effect causes structural material degradation, while TM dissolution could lead to the loss of reactive species and interfacial side reactions. On the other hand, OVs and electrolyte decomposition accelerate capacity decay. Notably, deeply understanding LNMO structural failure mechanisms and the targeting of corresponding modifications presents a vital avenue for modulating its surface-interface structure and improving its electrochemical performance. Although researchers have extensively investigated the failure mechanisms of LNMO to elucidate its modification strategies, a comprehensive and detailed summary of the latest research advancements has yet to be provided. In this work, the research background, encompassing the advantages and disadvantages of LNMO cathode materials, is first introduced. The crystal structure and discharge mechanisms, among other fundamental principles of LNMO, are subsequently analyzed. Finally, recent research findings on the aforementioned failure mechanisms in high-voltage spinel LNMO are synthesized. Subsequently, a critical assessment of recent advancements in modification strategies targeting the failure mechanisms of LNMO is performed, encompassing the tools employed (e.g., doping modification, surface coating, morphology and size management, and surface orientation management) as well as their synergistic effects. Finally, potential future research directions to guide the rational design of high-performance LNMO, particularly manganese-based spinel cathode material, are proposed.},

Herein, a nano-electro-platform is shown that enables non-invasive screening of aggressive cell subpopulations from heterogeneous tumor samples. Single-cell sequencing further reveals immune evasion pathways associated with their aggressive behavior. Targeting the screened aggressive cells, the platform implements a unique nanopore-focused electric field, which genetically remodels the cells to generate extracellular vesicles (EVs) with significantly enhanced tumor-targeting and therapeutic capabilities. The engineered EVs effectively activate macrophages and T cells, leading to robust tumor cell elimination and metastasis inhibition in lung cancer metastasis models.

  abstract     = {Intraocular drug implants are increasingly used for retinal treatments, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, due to the rapidly aging global population. Although these therapies show promise in arresting disease progression and improving vision, intraocular implant-based therapies can cause unexpected complications that require further surgery due to implant dislocation or uncontrolled drug release. These frequent complications of intraocular drug implants can be overcome using magnetically controllable degradable milliscale swimmers (MDMS) with a double-helix body morphology. A biodegradable hydrogel, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, is employed as the primary 3D printing material of MDMS, and it is magnetized by decorating it with biocompatible polydopamine-encapsulated iron-platinum nanoparticles. MDMS have comparable dimensions to commercial intraocular implants that achieve translational motions in both aqueous and vitreous bodies. They can be imaged in real-time using optical coherence tomography, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging. Thanks to their biodegradable hydrogel-based structure, they can be loaded with anti-inflammatory drug molecules and release the medications without disrupting retinal epithelial viability and barrier function, and decrease proinflammatory cytokine release significantly. These magnetically controllable swimmers, which degrade in a couple of months, can be used for less invasive and more precise intraocular drug delivery compared to commercial intraocular drug implants.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) as the terminal stage of various cardiac diseases, its underlying molecular mechanisms still remain elusive. Emerging evidence have implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a multifaceted role in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and HF. Here, it is identified that a lncRNA forkhead box O6, opposite strand (Foxo6os) is significantly downregulated in murine HF model induced using transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Knockdown of Foxo6os accelerates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reflects as elevated expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7). Conversely, Foxo6os overexpression can improve cardiac function and alleviate adverse cardiac remodeling. Mechanistically, Foxo6os directly interacts with myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3), which then recruits protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) to facilitate MYBPC3 phosphorylation, resulting in maintaining myocardial contractility and postponing HF progression. Therefore, these findings underscore the critical role of Foxo6os in preserving cardiomyocyte contractile function, suggesting a potential for Foxo6os as a novel therapeutic target of HF.},

  abstract     = {Flexible lithium metal batteries (LMBs) using polymer-based solid-state electrolytes (PSSEs) are highly desirable for wearable applications because of the potential advantages in energy density and safety. Recently, ether-based polyelectrolytes have received extensive attention because of their good stability, high ionic conductivity, and Li metal anode compatibility. However, it typically forms organic-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at the cathode, which is still a pain point that impedes the high-voltage performance. To address this challenge, herein a fluorinated plasticizer, bis(2-fluoroethyl) ether (BFE) is reported, which can be easily blended into ether-based PSSE and enables high-voltage-stable flexible LMBs. The BFE and PSSE molecules form an atypical hydrogen bond interaction, which weakens the interaction between PSSE and lithium ions. This leads to the formation of an anion-rich solvation structure that generates inorganic-rich and high-voltage-stable CEI. The oxidation stability of PSSE is improved from 4.4 V to over 4.7 V after introducing the BFE molecules. LMBs using BFE-blended PSSE can couple with high-voltage cathode and retain 80% capacity after 480 cycles at 1C. Full cells show high energy density (752.2 Wh L −1 ) outstanding capacity retention per cycle (99.88%), and high flexibility with almost identic charge/discharge characteristics after 4000 bending cycles.},

  abstract     = {Traditional biomaterial design often prioritizes empirical knowledge over disease mechanisms and pathological dynamics, resulting in imprecise solutions in complex clinical conditions. Age-related osteoporosis (A-OP) is a disease associated with aging, characterized by a dysfunctional pathological microenvironment that hinders the osseointegration of conventional titanium implants. To develop a targeted titanium implant for A-OP, rat single-cell transcriptomics is integrated with human serum-derived transcriptome data to investigate dynamic changes in skeletal stem cells (SSCs) during aging, which guided the implant design. These findings reveal that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within SSCs interact via a feedback loop: HSCs undergo premature senescence, leading to depletion of HSCs and secondary senescence of MSCs. Senescent MSCs exhibit adipogenic bias, perpetuating the pathological cycle of A-OP. Using core genes identified in the transcriptome analyses, resveratrol is selected and utilized it and a GelMA-chitosan hydrogel to decorate titanium implants for localized delivery. In the A-OP microenvironment, the hydrogel enables sustained responsive release of resveratrol, which reverses MSC senescence and redirects differentiation from adipogenic to osteogenic lineages, thereby breaking the pathological cycle. This multi-omics-driven implant design enhances precision and offers a novel methodology for biomaterial development.},

  abstract     = {Superelastic aerogels with ultralow thermal conductivity have essential advantages for advanced thermal management systems in energy-efficient buildings. However, inorganic aerogels suffer from brittleness and poor processability, whereas their organic counterparts experience high production costs and inadequate elastic recovery. This study used a dual-template (ice and bubble) strategy to fabricate ultralight, superelastic aerogels with hierarchical porosity inspired by stress-dissipating dome architectures. Microbubbles are engineered via a modified “Tessari method” to create macropores (≈100 µm) while ice-templating introduced aligned pores of a few µm in size during freeze-drying. The synergistic interplay of a rigid gelatine (Ge) skeleton, flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nodes, and potassium salt-enhanced crystalline domains yielded aerogels with exceptional elasticity, ultralow density and thermal conductivity. Flame retardancy is achieved through potassium salt-mediated catalytic carbonization, reducing the peak heat release rate by 54% and enabling self-extinguishing behavior. Microbubble introduction in precursors can provide macropores for aerogels, which dispersed internal stress during the deformation of aerogel, whereas dynamic hydrogen bonds enabled rapid water-assisted self-healing ability and closed-loop recyclability. Scalable production using commercial compressed air foaming systems and a low raw material cost further highlight its industrial viability. Combined with biodegradability and superior thermal insulation, this work advances sustainable, fire-safe aerogels for multifunctional applications.},

Here, a spatiotemporally and hierarchically-guided bone regeneration hydrogel with a Janus structure is engineered through a sequential photocuring protocol, which features full barrier protection by the outer dense phase and superior osteoconductivity within the inner loose phase. The Janus hydrogel exhibits stable spatiotemporal layering, adaptable degradation, asymmetrical combination of network structures, and mechanical strength. The dense phase, with space maintenance capacity, completely covers the defective area, continuously blocking fibroblast infiltration, and preventing bacterial adhesion. In addition, the loose phase is shape-adapted to the defective cavity, allowing osteoblast-associated cells to migrate and create a favorable osteogenic microenvironment. In situ implantation of this Janus hydrogel effectively promoted osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in both mouse calvarial and rat periodontal bone defect models. Furthermore, the osteogenic efficiency achieved by the Janus hydrogel implanted in mouse calvarial defects and rat periodontal defects is increased by 42% and 13.7%, respectively, as compared with previous studies. These findings thus demonstrated the synergy of protective barrier function, osteoconductive properties, and adaptive degradation within a single scaffold, which is conducive to bone regeneration.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary adaptation of skin repair drives sequential regenerative phases: epidermal proliferation rapidly restores barrier function, followed by dermal reconstruction through extracellular matrix remodeling to establish structural support, yet the molecular coordination of this spatiotemporal program remains unclear. While the endocrine system is crucial in modulating wound repair, the critical hormone receptors orchestrating tissue-layer-specific responses are unidentified. Here, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and in vivo/in vitro analyses in mouse models of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, as well as wound and skin organoid models, are employed to identify the thyroid hormone receptor Thra as a key regulator of phase-coupled regeneration through two distinct yet coordinated mechanisms. In the initial phase, epidermal Thra activates glutathione metabolism via Gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT), driving keratin filament assembly to accelerate reepithelialization. In the subsequent phase, dermal Thra mediates the Serum Amyloid A3 (SAA3)-Fibronectin 1 (FN1) interaction, establishing angiogenic niches essential for matrix maturation. Using the self-assembled epidermis-dermis dynamic skin organoid model, Thra's role in simulating the wound healing process is further confirmed. This study highlights the essential role of spatiotemporal adaptability in wound repair using Thra as a paradigm and provides insights for developing clinical strategies to enhance skin wound healing.},

However, considerable bystander editing significantly compromise its accuracy. Point mutagenesis, a powerful approach for gradient-tuning protein function, facilitates the generation of diverse plant phenotypes to meet the demands of complex environments and consumer preferences. Here, a series of plant base editors is engineered by fusing three optimized TadA8e variants, TadA9, TadA-LM, and TadA-dual, with a PAM-flexible SpRY nickase (SpRYn, with 5′-NNN PAM recognition). These editors enable A-to-G, C-to-T, and dual-base (simultaneous A-to-G and C-to-T) conversions within a highly condensed active window (1–3 nucleotides). Performance evaluations reveal that the TadDBE (TadA Dual-Base Editor) achieves the most robust outcomes, delivering dual-base editing efficiencies ranging from 2.3% to 61.4%, while maintaining minimal off-target activity. Utilizing TadDBE, targeted point mutagenesis is performed on OsBadh2 , a gene encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), a key aromatic compound. This approach yields rice lines exhibiting gradient-tuned aromatic profiles and optimized levels of 2-AP and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

Herein, in this work, the role of cyano substitution is systematically investigated in the central unit of SMAs and design a novel cyano-functionalized wide-bandgap acceptor UF-BCN. The introduction of the cyano group significantly enhances the surface energy of the molecule and substantially deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level due to its strong electron-withdrawing capability, then leading to a blue-shifted absorption. When introduced as the third component in the D18:BTP-eC9, UF-BCN demonstrates complementary light absorption, strong intermolecular interactions, and excellent compatibility with BTP-eC9 to form a mixed acceptor phase, enabling it to function as an effective morphological modulator within the ternary system. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on D18:BTP-eC9:UF-BCN achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.34%.

In this study, recent advances in understanding the formation and functions of plant peptide hormones, distinguishing between non-secretory and secretory peptides and their respective physiological roles are reviewed. These peptide hormones interact intricately with receptor kinases to regulate multiple signal transduction pathways. Plant peptide hormones are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation within both shoot apical and root apical meristems, as well as in the development of various organs. They also play a central role in plant reproduction, particularly in coordinating male-female gametophyte interactions for successful fertilization. Furthermore, plant peptide hormones contribute to abiotic stress responses and immune responses against biotic stresses. An overview of the multifaceted roles of plant peptide hormones in growth, development, and environmental adaptability, emphasizing their importance in plant biology are presented.

Furthermore, the cell-repellent interface can also be patterned on the sub-micron electrode layer without compromising its electrical and electrochemical performance.

For downstream tasks, MGPT employs learnable functional prompts, embedded with task-specific knowledge, to enable robust performance across a range of tasks. MGPT demonstrates the ability of seamless task switching and outperforms competitive approaches in few-shot scenarios. MGPT emerges as a robust solution to the complexities of multi-task learning and the challenges associated with limited data in drug development.},

  abstract     = {In situ disclosure about the complex four-electron transfer of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial to further optimization of electrocatalysts. However, tracing the formation and evolution of unstable intermediates remains challenging. Here, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis and imaging technique are developed to in situ monitor the important intermediate hydrogen peroxide intermediate (OOH*) on transition-metal-based 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM─TCNQ) metal–organic framework materials as OER catalysts. Thanks to the highly selective ECL probe L-012 to OOH*, the ECL signal evolution (e.g., onset ECL potential and maximal ECL intensity) is bridged with the generation and accumulation of OOH*, allowing for convenient and quick judgment to the rate-determining step of OER. Due to the spatial and temporal resolution of ECL microscopy, it is found that the phase I of Cu─TCNQ shows better catalytic activity. The COMSOL simulation also shows the heterogeneous current distribution during the OER reaction, in agreement with ECL imaging results. Finally, the ECL approach enables to compare the OER performance of three TM─TCNQ, well explaining the free energy profiles for different reaction intermediates. Therefore, the proposed ECL analysis and microscopy provide an alternative way to understand the detailed elemental steps in OER, thus further indicating the direction for high-performance catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Transition state (TS) search is crucial for illuminating chemical reaction mechanisms but remains the major bottleneck in automated discovery because of the high computational cost. Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and generative models have shown promise in accelerating TS search, but their comparative strengths and limitations remain unclear. In this study, the first systematic and rigorous benchmarking framework is established to evaluate the effectiveness of ML methods in TS search, enabling a standardized and application-relevant assessment of their performance. Using an end-to-end TS search workflow, seven representative MLIPs are benchmarked alongside React-OT, a state-of-the-art generative model. These results demonstrate that pre-trained foundation MLIPs frequently fall short in reliably localizing TSs without task-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, traditional energy and force metrics alone do not reliably predict TS search success, underscoring the need for more tailored evaluation criteria. Notably, with the same graph neural network architecture, React-OT frequently outperforms its MLIP counterpart, highlighting the potential of generative approaches for TS discovery. This benchmark serves as a critical foundation for the development and evaluation of future ML methods in chemical reactions, offering guidance for improving their generalizability and reliability in reactive chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics has provided a critical data foundation for the high-resolution characterization of tissue spatial domains. Traditional methods for spatial domain identification primarily rely on gene expression data from sampled spots in low-resolution spatial transcriptomic data, often overlooking valuable information between spots that can be crucial for domain identification. Furthermore, these methods are limited by their focus on gene expression data from neighboring spots, without fully integrating prior knowledge of cell types within the tissue's spatial structure. To address these challenges, SGCD, a novel method for tissue spatial domain identification based on data interpolation and cell type deconvolution is proposed. SGCD utilizes interpolation techniques to estimate gene expression data for cells in the gaps between spots and applies deconvolution to extract cell type information from both spots and interstitial regions. By integrating gene expression, cell type, and spatial location data, SGCD achieves accurate delineation of complex spatial domains through graph contrastive learning. Evaluations on various publicly available datasets, including the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, mouse brain, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer, demonstrate that SGCD significantly outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and detail, offering strong support for advancing the understanding of tissue functions and disease mechanisms.},

Two subtypes emerged with distinct recurrence risks: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (adjusted HR = 2.75 for recurrence, 95% CI 1.42–5.33, P = 0.003). Cluster 2’s high recurrence risk was validated in three external cohorts (adjusted HRs: 1.76, 4.33, and 3.09; all P < 0.05). Radiogenomic analysis revealed Cluster 2 showed a higher frequency of VHL mutations and KDM5C mutations compared to Cluster 1, a more immunosuppressive microenvironment (reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, P < 0.01; suppressed interferon signaling pathways, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis P < 0.05), and lower PD-L1 expression. In the T-I treated advanced ccRCC cohort, Cluster 2 patients had shorter overall survival.

This study proposes a colored thermal engineering glass fabricated through a simple annealing process, where Ag nanoparticles are formed on a TiO 2 film and an Ag layer. The structure of Ag layers can be easily controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature, allowing for systematic tuning of the optical efficiencies in the visible and long-wave infrared regions. Consequently, thermal management devices can selectively function as either a photothermal heater or a radiative cooler, depending on the morphology of Ag layers. In particular, the photothermal device can function as an anti-fogging solution for structural designs without requiring external energy. Furthermore, the stacked metal-insulator-metal structure induces plasmonic resonance phenomena, producing visible colors that range from vivid to dull hues. The tunable color variations enhance the suitability of the thermal management device for a wide range of architectural applications.},

Here, a generalizable strategy is introduced that leverages facile anion-lattice doping in high entropy materials to modulate the bandgap in high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs). By incorporating nitrogen into a single-phase high-entropy metal oxide/nitride (HEMO:HEMN) solid solution, a substantial bandgap reduction is achieved from 3.55 eV (HEMO) to ≈2.46 eV (HEMO:HEMN), significantly enhancing electronic conductivity. Unlike conventional bandgap tuning approaches that rely on cation substitution or heterojunction formation, this method exploits anion-mediated entropy stabilization, enabling uniform bandgap narrowing across the entire solid solution. This anion-lattice engineering strategy is broadly applicable to high-entropy systems, providing a new pathway for designing energy materials with tailored electronic properties. The resulting HEMO:HEMN solid solution exhibits a tenfold increase in capacitance and capacity compared to HEMO in supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery tests, demonstrating the transformative potential of anion-driven bandgap modulation for next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary fibrosis resulting from recurrent lung inflammation due to pathogen infection may lead to serious problems and death. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), consisting of DNAs and proteins released by neutrophils in response to infection, are major pathogenesis factors for pathogen-associated pulmonary fibrosis. By mimicking nucleic acid hydrolase, polymeric artificial DNases bearing imidazole units (PEG-PIm) are developed to degrade the DNAs and thus deconstruct NETs, inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis. By tailoring the PIm segments with varied imidazole units, the polymer hydrolase with a defined number of imidazole units outperforms other samples in the cleavage of DNAs and inhibits the transition of pulmonary fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. This polymer digests the DNAs complexed with cationic peptides, unlike natural DNase I. By aerosol inhalation, it reduces NET infiltration in lungs and significantly alleviates inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the optimized polymer may expose more effective imidazole units to the DNA backbones and thus enhance the affinity and hydrolysis of phosphodiester linkages. The function is also confirmed by systematic administration of PEG-PIm to rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, a strategy is provided for treating pulmonary fibrosis that can be applied in a pandemic to reduce high mortality because of pathogen infection.},

  abstract     = {Neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, pose a significant global health challenge due to their complex pathogenesis and widespread prevalence. These disorders are often associated with disruptions in neurotransmitter regulation, leading to progressive cognitive and motor impairments. Conventional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and lack the sensitivity required for early-stage detection. Herein, for the first time a novel photoresponsive nanozyme sensor array is presented that integrates metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and machine learning algorithms for the rapid, sensitive, and multiplexed detection of neurotransmitters. Wherein, Zn(II) meso-Tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (ZnTCPP) -based MOFs, with their large specific surface area, enhance the interaction between reactant substrates and catalytic active sites within the material, significantly improving response sensitivity. Additionally, light-driven catalysis greatly accelerates the response speed of the nanozyme. Mimicking the mammalian olfactory system, the array responds to various neurotransmitters in a patterned manner, enabling accurate differentiation and quantification within minutes. It maintains high precision even in complex biological samples such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The biomimetic sensor can detect neurotransmitter signatures linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This platform offers significant potential for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of neurological conditions.},

  abstract     = {Aerogel fibers have emerged as a promising solution in thermal insulation. Yet, the current preparation methods pose challenges: they are either inefficient for continuous production or involve energy-intensive and time-consuming steps like freeze-drying or supercritical drying, thus restricting their practical utility. Here, a bidirectional phase separation spinning technique is introduced for continuous and rapid production (360 m h −1 ) of aerogel fibers at any desired length. Importantly, fibers can be directly dried at room temperature, eliminating the need for energy-intensive freeze-drying or other additional steps, significantly reducing energy consumption and processing time. Aerogel fibers produced using this method exhibit remarkable properties: low density (0.18 g cm − 3 ), high porosity (84%), and broad operational temperature range (−20 to 120 °C). Notably, the thermal insulation mat composed of these aerogel fibers achieves an exceptionally low thermal conductivity (31 ± 1.2 mW/(mK)). This work provides a novel strategy for the preparation of aerogel fibers, achieving energy savings and efficiency, positioning aerogel fibers as a promising alternative for next-generation textiles.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry-breaking nature of Janus materials enables the design of multifunctional compounds with distinct properties that are inaccessible to traditional materials. However, the limited availability of intrinsically stable Janus materials hinders a complete understanding of their full potential. Here, the first millimeter-sized Janus material, RhSeCl, is successfully synthesized through the precisely controlled chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the Janus character of RhSeCl, emphasizing its strong correlation with steric hindrance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses demonstrate the highly unusual oxidation states of Rh and Se, underlining their critical role in determining the formation of the inherent Janus structure. Interestingly, a clear second-harmonic generation (SHG) is observed in RhSeCl, weakening with the temperature. DFT calculations attribut the strong SHG response to the band nesting effect, with an intensity modulated by the temperature-dependent interlayer coupling. Notably, its damage threshold surpassed that of Janus MoSSe. Furthermore, devices based on RhSeCl exhibit promising optoelectronic performance at the visible wavelength range of 405–650 nm, showing a great opportunity for solar applications. These findings deepen the understanding of inherent Janus structures, paving the way for the development of new Janus compounds with versatile functionalities in advanced materials.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies indicate a therapeutic potential of increased brain endocannabinoids (eCBs) in anxiety disorders, but the underlying brain circuits are still elusive. Here, it is observed that optogenetic inhibition and activation of anterior basolateral amygdala (aBLA) - ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections respectively decrease and increase anxiety avoidance behaviors. Then, the contributions of eCBs in aBLA–vHPC projections to anxiety avoidance are investigated by employing three newly developed synapse- and circuit-specific eCB-targeted viral strategies to achieve real-time monitoring of eCB release, in vivo optogenetic activation of CB1 receptors, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes. Prominent eCB release are surprisingly found at aBLA–vHPC glutamatergic synapses during anxiety avoidance, suggesting inhibitory effects of increased eCBs in aBLA–vHPC projections on anxiety avoidance. This idea is further supported by findings that specific activation of CB1 receptors at aBLA–vHPC synapses inhibit presynaptic glutamate release and reduce anxiety avoidance. In contrast, specific knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes at aBLA–vHPC synapses reduce eCB levels at aBLA–vHPC glutamatergic synapses and increase anxiety avoidance. Additionally, inhibition of aBLA-innervated vHPC glutamatergic neurons alleviates anxiety avoidance. Together, these findings reveal counteracting effects of increased eCB signaling in aBLA–vHPC circuits on anxiety avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, is implicated in various diseases, but effective therapeutic strategies remain limited. Lysosomal impairments cause iron dysregulation and initiate ferroptosis, which potentially contribute to ionizing radiation-induced tissue damages. Here, the role of intercellular lysosomal regulation in governing iron homeostasis and protecting against ferroptosis is investigated in models of stem cell aggregation and mandibular regeneration post-irradiation. Lysosomes are discovered to accumulate in specific regions within multi-stem cell aggregates and regulate cell aggregate formation based on iron control, which is occurred through hypoxic signaling-driven lysosomal redistribution mediated by extracellular vesicles. These vesicles exhibit lysosomal features and possess iron-regulating properties, which rescue lysosomal defects to restore iron homeostasis and mitigate ferroptosis in recipient endothelial cells against the irradiation challenge. Based on lysosomal regulation and anti-ferroptosis, these cell aggregate-released extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs) stimulate the growth of CD31 + endomucin + specialized vessels despite irradiation both in vitro and in vivo, which further promote bone regeneration of post-irradiation mandibular defect. These findings highlight the potential of taking CA-EVs as natural therapeutic agents to safeguard lysosomal function, modulate iron metabolism, and protect against ferroptosis, paving an avenue for combating post-irradiation endothelial injuries and enhancing tissue regeneration.},

Here, a facile approach is developed for fabricating large-scale continuous in-plane charged domain walls in Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO 3 ferroelectric films through thermally optimized growth control. Using Differential Phase Contrast Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy, an electric field fluctuation is identified across the charged domain wall. This fluctuation is accompanied by oxygen octahedron distortions, which allow the lattice to redistribute charges, as confirmed by integrated Differential Phase Contrast analyses. Additionally, Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy reveals variations in titanium oxidation states across the domain wall, which compensates for the charge accumulation and enhances the stability of the charged domain wall.

Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative hybrid system that integrates PTC film, thermoelectric generator (TEG), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).

The study uses a compact setup with a green LED light source and a CMOS camera to capture holographic images of impurities. The technique reconstructs clear particle images using angular spectrum algorithms and analyzes their reconstruction distances and gray-scale differences for identification. Results show that copper particles have a reconstruction distance of 1406.4 µm and a total gray-scale difference of 4.4681; tin particles have a reconstruction distance of 1414.85 µm and a total gray-scale difference of 0.5344; iron hydroxide has a reconstruction distance of 1647.85 µm and the total gray-scale difference of 13.5789. By combining these parameters, the method effectively distinguishes between copper, tin, and iron particles, even in mixed solutions.

It is hypothesized that overcoming these barriers requires a dual approach: inducing immunogenic tumor cell death (ICD) and enhancing the cancer immunity cycle by exogenous neoantigen targeting on the spleen. In this study, a novel strategy is presented combining irinotecan-loaded silicasomes with spleen-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying KRAS G12D mRNA and the toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist 3M-052. The goal is to establish a cancer immunity cycle by promoting endogenous tumor antigen release by the generation of KRAS-specific cytotoxic T cells. Using an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, it is demonstrated that this dual-platform approach significantly reduces tumor burden and extends survival compared to monotherapies. Bulk RNA sequencing and gene expression analyses further reveal synergy between the immune responses at the primary tumor site and the spleen, including maximal upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, antigen presentation pathways, and T cell activation markers. These findings indicate that the combinatorial strategy effectively bridges innate and adaptive immunity. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of nanocarrier-based immunotherapy to enhance PDAC immunity by integrating ICD induction with systemic immune reprogramming, offering a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory programmed cell death (PCD) that is causally linked to antitumor immune responses, but the therapeutic potential of pyroptosis has been limited by the lack of tumor-specific and controllable inducers. Here, it is reported that tumor-specific pyroptosis can be spatiotemporally triggered via near-infrared light (NIR-pyroptosis) by using an antibody-bound indocyanine green (ICG), a clinically approved and nontoxic fluorescent dye. Mechanistically, the key molecular steps are identified by which antibody-bound ICG generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) within lysosomes after internalization, leading to lysosomal membrane damage and the cytosolic release of cathepsin S (CTSS), which cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, and IL-1β independently of caspase-1, and thereby induces pyroptosis, while other cathepsin family members fail to cleave GSDMD. Functionally, in both ICAM1+ and HER2+ solid tumors, antibody-bound ICG-mediated NIR-pyroptosis triggers potent and durable antitumor immune responses through the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, NIR-pyroptosis synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy by activating adaptive immune cells via upregulated IFN-γ secretion. The findings identify CTSS as a novel enzyme for GSDMD cleavage and establish NIR-pyroptosis as a non-apoptotic anticancer modality, providing a promising opportunity to overcome apoptosis resistance in current cancer therapies.},

Departing from conventional approaches that incorporate chiral molecules, we present the co-assembly of achiral and chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into AB n -type nanoclustersand the correlation between inherent plasmonic chirality and the quantity of hotspots. Complementary polymer-grafted achiral nanospheres and chiral nano arrows assemble into stable AB n clusters through a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The coordination number ( n ) of AB n can be tuned from 2 to 7 by adjusting polymer configurations through modulation of solution pH. The g -factor of AB n exhibits a linear increase with the n value of AB n . Simulation results indicate that the enhanced optical chirality arises from the increase in electric field strength due to the increasing number of hotspots within the NP assemblies.},

X-ray absorption spectroscopy is employed to depict lanthanide earth elements that can lower lattice strain and accelerate the diffusion of Li + .

  abstract     = {The global proliferation of high-value commodities has the intensified demand for advanced anti-counterfeiting solutions. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) present a viable authentication mechanism, yet existing implementations exhibit three critical limitations: suboptimal authentication accuracy, insufficient multi-level security architecture, and dependence on costly and specialized equipment for verification. To address these issues, this work utilizes colloidal photonic crystals to fabricate PUF anti-counterfeiting patterns spanning from the macro-to-micro scale. These patterns are integrated with the iris recognition algorithm to construct a multi-layered optical anti-counterfeiting system based on the structural color iris. This work experimentally and computationally demonstrates that the “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystals originate from the “coffee ring” effect. By modulating the “coffee ring” effect, the size of the colloidal photonic crystal iris patterns can be controlled, enabling switching between “Ring”-type and “Dot”-type colloidal photonic crystals. Furthermore, multiple characteristic parameters confirm that the PUF codes derived from encoded “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystal images exhibit uniqueness and readability. Finally, a multi-layered anti-counterfeiting system is constructed, comprising three components: structural color patterns, embedded “Morse codes” formed by “Ring”-type and “Dot”-type colloidal photonic crystals, and optical PUF labels based on the “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystals. This cost-effective system enables low-threshold, high-performance structural color anti-counterfeiting for premium products.},

  abstract     = {Originating from spin and orbital motion, van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetism has emerged as a significant platform to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions, including quantum computing, sensing, and data storage. However, currently, available vdW ferromagnetic materials can be achieved with mechanical exfoliation and low-temperature operation, which completely limits the monolithic integration of vdW ferromagnets with other functional materials. Nonetheless, the direct synthesis of room-temperature vdW ferromagnets has not been achieved commercially, owing to the imprecise control of the layer-by-layer growth, high-temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, herein, an artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform has been reported, which activates the nano-crystallization and its corresponding ferromagnetism in bulk VSe 2 via Ar + H 2 S plasma sulfurization. Sweeping the magnetic field, vdW ferromagnetism has been spatially resolved, which experimentally correlates with magnetization reversal behavior and domain pinning effects. Furthermore, nano-crystallization of VSe 2 is clearly validated with transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and selected area diffraction analysis. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform can artificially inject the ferromagnetism in bulk vdW VSe 2 , which has not been possible previously.},

Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysregulation can impact the initiation and progression of cancers, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. This study observes that the beneficial gut bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis ( P. distasonis ) is significantly decreased in bladder cancer patients, and its low abundance is strongly associated with poor prognosis. P. distasonis is a next-generation probiotic which plays a vital role in human health. Furthermore, this work finds that P. distasonis culture medium inhibits metastasis and proliferation of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies that indole-3-acetic acid (3-IAA) produced by P. distasonis exerting similar tumor-suppressive effects. Mechanistically, 3-IAA activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which in turn downregulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) transcription in bladder cancer cells. Notably, the reduction of FASN expression decreases the ratio of MUFAs to PUFAs, thereby increasing ferroptosis sensitivity in bladder cancer cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that P. distasonis -derived 3-IAA can inhibit bladder cancer metastasis and proliferation, highlighting the AhR-FASN axis as a promising therapeutic target to inhibit bladder cancer progression.},

By confining the self-assembly of cylindrical polymer brushes on freestanding rGO substrates, directional ion highways are simultaneously engineered that significantly reduce transport tortuosity. In addition, corrosion-resistant polymer interfaces block oxygen penetration, and strong interfacial interactions between PPy and rGO ensure efficient electron transfer. The mPPy/rGO-based CDI cell achieves breakthrough performance: ultrahigh SAC of 84.1 mg g −1 (4.5× activated carbon, the salt concentration: 2 g L −1 ), and 96.8% capacity retention over 100 cycles in air-equilibrated saline solution (the salt concentration: 500 mg L −1 ).

  abstract     = {Although the intestinal clock (the circadian timing system in the gastrointestinal tract) is known to direct a wide variety of diurnal nutrients and metabolites, its role in the functioning of extra-intestinal tissues such as the brain remains elusive. Here the role of the intestinal clock in shaping cognitive function is investigated. It is found that Bmal1 -iKO mice (mice with Bmal1 [ Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 ] specifically knocked out in the intestine, a mouse line deficient in intestinal clock function) show a defect in cognitive memory irrespective of the time-of-day. Bmal1 -iKO-associated cognitive decline is attributed to impaired adenosine signaling and compromised long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Adenosine signaling promotes LTP via enhancing BDNF expression and inhibiting synapse loss. Furthermore, the impairment in adenosine signaling is accounted for by the reductions in intestinal absorption of and hippocampal level of adenosine but not by a change in adenosine receptors. Consistently, adenosine supplementation rescues cognitive deficits associated with the malfunction of the intestinal clock. Moreover, BMAL1 regulates the expression of ADK (adenosine kinase, a primary enzyme for adenosine clearance) in the small intestine and thus promotes intestinal adenosine absorption through REV-ERBα which binds directly to Adk P2 promoter to inhibit its transcription. Together, an unsuspected role of the intestinal clock in controlling cognitive memory is identified, highlighting the intestinal clock as a promising target for the management of cognitive disorders.},

This work describes mechanochromic CLCE symmetric hollow fibers with excellent radial helix alignment prepared by solvent evaporation-induced assembly and template assistance. The cylindrical symmetry renders the response identical in all directions perpendicular to the fiber axis. The hollow fibers show mechanochromic ability in the full visible spectrum, a large wavelength blueshift of 2.25 nm·% −1 under low strain. Excellent mechanochromic reversibility of 100 cycles and resilience are both devoted by cross-linking structure in the wall layer, which also contributes to reversible orientation-recovery of liquid crystal units during stretching-recovery cycles. Numerical models and experimental measurements demonstrate the hollow structure enabled fibers to produce air pressure inside when being stretched, and the fiber wall layer is subjected to greater stress compared to solid fibers, thus achieving high mechanochromic sensitivity. In addition, hollow fiber can still change color when subjected to the expansion stress inside the cavity, and programmable information display in fabric prolongs its application in intelligent textiles.},

For this, neutrophil-specific fluorine nanoparticles additionally equipped with either activating or inhibiting peptides for a background-free 19 F MRI-based theranostic approach are engineered. It is demonstrated that with this i) distinct effector functions can be specifically modulated in both murine and human neutrophils, ii) the disease-specific degree of neutrophil infiltration can be non-invasively monitored in vivo, and in turn iii) neutrophil effector functions can either be attenuated during a pharmacological challenge or amplified to ameliorate tissue damage during bacteria-driven acute colitis.

This study unveils a novel NF separation strategy based on the often-overlooked phenomenon of solute self-assembly. Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, a direct link between monophenol self-assembly and rejection behavior during NF is established. The self-assembly of monophenols, primarily driven by π–π stacking interactions, is shown to significantly influence their rejection rates, with larger, more numerous self-assemblies experiencing higher rejection. Furthermore, a clear relationship between monophenol structures and self-assembly strength is established, revealing that the number and Hydrogen (H)-bonding capacity of substituents on the aromatic ring dictate the propensity for self-assembly. This insight enables the development of a predictive model for monophenol self-assembly, which is validated through NF experiments using binary mixtures, confirming that predictable differences in self-assembly behavior can be leveraged for selective separation. This study establishes solute self-assembly as a tunable parameter for enhancing NF separation of similarly sized molecules.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cell-intrinsic features (e.g., genetic aberrations and dysregulation of signaling pathways) play pivotal roles in orchestrating the composition and functional state of the immune landscape, which in turn impact tumor progression and response to immunotherapy. Here, it is discovered that dysregulation of cancer cell-intrinsic SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) leads to the orchestration of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and the impairment of responses to PD-1 blockade by reprogramming the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). SMYD3 cooperates with Sp1 to transcriptionally promote sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) expression by modifying H3-K4 di-/trimethylation and consequently activating the transcription of CD47. CD47, a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, acts as the downstream effector molecule of the SMYD3 signal to promote the infiltration of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, protecting renal cancer cells from immune attack. In summary, the critical role of the cancer cell-intrinsic SMYD3-SREBP1-CD47 axis is elucidated in regulating the immune microenvironment in ccRCC and provides a potential therapeutic strategy to manipulate the tumor immune milieu in favor of antitumor immunity.},

  abstract     = {Extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolic disorders and the establishment of inflammatory microenvironment are the primary pathological alterations associated with intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). The inflammatory microenvironment promotes ECM degradation, further exacerbating the vicious cycle of nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration. This study introduces the mRNA encoding a novel therapeutic transcription factor, Brachyury (Bry), into nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) using an injectable microsphere system composed of biomimetic GelMA/Fucoidan (FU) dual-component hydrogel (GF) and surface chemically grafted lipid nanoparticles (LNP) (BLNP@GF). The study aims to alleviate inflammatory response in the NP while restoring the ECM secretion function of NPCs and enhancing the ability of NPCs to withstand inflammatory stress, thereby restoring physiological balance in the NP microenvironment. The GF microspheres demonstrate injectability and porosity, facilitating efficient LNP loading through chemical grafting. In the LPS-simulated inflammatory microenvironment, sustained release of FU significantly reduces inflammatory activity in NPCs. Successful transfection with Bry mRNA upregulate ECM synthesis in degenerated NPCs. In a rat tail puncture IVDD model, local application of BLNP@GF microspheres effectively improved ECM remodeling in NP tissue, thereby ameliorating puncture-induced IVDD. In conclusion, FU-functionalized GelMA hydrogel microspheres loaded with Bry mRNA provide a promising new strategy for reversing IVDD.},

However, traditional photocatalytic and thermal catalytic methods face challenges like low selectivity and yields. Herein, a novel Cu/MoS 2 photothermal catalyst is synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method, anchoring single-atom Cu on layered MoS 2 for CO 2 and H 2 O reduction into C 2 products (ethanol, acetylene, and ethane). Under optimal conditions (250 °C, 903 mW·cm −2 , 320–780 nm), the Cu 5% –MoS 2 catalyst achieves an ethanol yield of 3.1 mmol·g −1 ·h −1 , 4.6 times higher than blank MoS 2 . Mechanistic studies reveal that Cu improves light absorption and enhances CO 2 adsorption and *COOH accumulation at MoS 2 edge S sites, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mo–Cu dual sites stabilize *CHO intermediates, boosting C 2 product selectivity. The synergistic photothermal effect accelerates charge migration and surface reactions. This work provides cost-effective insights into photothermal CO 2 conversion for fuel production.},

However, clinical trials with cGAS-STING pathway agonists have faced setbacks thanks to their short biological half-life, lack of tumor specificity, and potential to promote tumor immune evasion. To address these challenges, a novel exosome-based drug delivery platform, termed cmExo aCD11b is developed, designed to precisely target and reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) in situ for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy. cmExo aCD11b is engineered to encapsulate high copy numbers of IL-12 mRNA and 2′3’-cGAMP (cGAMP) and is functionalized with CD11b antibodies for targeted delivery to macrophages. Notably, cmExo aCD11b facilitated the repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, thereby reprogramming the TME and enhancing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This immunomodulatory effect reversed the immunosuppressive milieu of the TME and significantly inhibited tumor progression. More importantly, cmExo aCD11b exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy in both murine pancreatic cancer and patient-derived xenograft models. These results suggest that cmExo aCD11b represents a promising approach for overcoming immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer, paving the way for its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.},

However, this intermediate state is recalcitrant to detailed structural investigation, as it is only transiently and sparsely populated. Here, this work investigates the intermediate state of an amyloid-forming human lysozyme variant (I59T) using CEST and CPMG RD NMR at low pH. 15 N CEST profiles probe the thermal unfolding of the native state into the denatured ensemble and reveal a distinct intermediate state. Global fitting of 15 N CEST and CPMG data provides kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, characterizing the intermediate state populated at 0.6%. 1 H CEST data further confirm the presence of the intermediate state displaying unusually high or low 1 H N chemical shifts. To investigate the structural details of this intermediate state, this work uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which recapitulate the experimentally observed folding pathway and free energy landscape. This work observes a high-energy intermediate state with a locally disordered β-domain and C-helix, stabilized by non-native hydrogen bonding and amide-π interactions, accounting for its anomalous 1 H chemical shifts. Together, these NMR and MD data provide the first direct structural information on the intermediate state, offering insights into targeting lysozyme amyloidosis.},

  abstract     = {Constructing an “ether solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)”-like layer in ester electrolyte is highly attractive to realize excellent capacity and cycling stability for hard carbon anode, but has barely been mentioned yet. Herein, the hard carbon grafted by caffeic acid is developed via a surface reconstruction strategy, in which rich C═O moieties are introduced. Varied characterizations reveal that the existing C═O exhibits stronger adsorption energy on salt (PF 6 − ) than solvent (e.g., EC and DEC), thus accelerating salt decomposition to produce a stable inorganic SEI layer. Besides, C═O moieties can also adsorb K-ions reversibly, accounting for a high capacitive contribution. Benefiting from the double merits of C═O moieties, the interfacial stability and surface properties of the optimized sample are greatly improved, and as a result, the reversible capacity can reach 462.7 mAh g −1 (0.1 A g −1 over 50 cycles) and rate performance is quite superior as well (321.8 mAh g −1 at 2 A g −1 ). Besides, a prolonged cycle life of over 2000 cycles is smoothly realized at 2 A g −1 in ester-based electrolytes.

Therefore, there is a need for a multimodal wearable platform that can capture diverse exercise-related metrics. Here, a wireless soft athlete bioelectronic system is presented that monitors various physiological signals and metabolites during exercise. This system includes a smart-sensing lip guard that detects ventilated carbon dioxide, osmolality, environmental conditions, and humidity—key indicators of the metabolites expelled from the nose and mouth. Additionally, the cardiac patch complements the lip guard by monitoring multiple signals, such as electrocardiograms, heart rates, temperature, and motion. This integrated system is capable of detecting exercise-induced conditions such as dehydration, hyperventilation, and abnormal heart signals. By combining data from both physiological and environmental factors, the wearable device offers a comprehensive assessment of how external conditions influence an athlete's performance. Evaluating the device with human subjects under varying temperature conditions demonstrates its effectiveness in observing exercise performance, regardless of environmental factors, highlighting its significant potential for enhancing athlete healthcare and performance monitoring.},

However, aberrant activation of MDA5 by viral infections or gain-of-function mutations leads to severe autoimmune diseases, for most of which effective treatment is limited. Here, it is shown that inactivation of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8/UBPy) degrades the MDA5 protein, suppressing antiviral signaling and autoimmunity. It is found that viral infection modulates the AKT-dependent phosphorylation of USP8 at serine 718, which not only promotes the activation of USP8 but also enhances the association between USP8 and MDA5 and the consequent deubiquitination and stabilization of MDA5. Inactivation of USP8 specifically degrades the MDA5 protein regardless of the mutation pattern. Genetic deletion of Usp8 in mice contributes to decreased levels of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, inhibition of USP8 or AKT can effectively suppress MDA5-induced autoimmunity in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) mice and anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis (DM)/systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient cells. Therefore, these results highlight the critical roles of USP8 in innate antiviral immunity against RNA viruses and autoimmunity and provide a potential therapy for treating autoimmune diseases associated with MDA5.},

Recently, the hydrogen spillover effect has been proven to be one of the vital means to enhance the activity of the HOR catalyst. In this report, a facile and controllable electrodeposition strategy is proposed for synthesizing a tungsten (W)-doped copper (Cu) nanoalloy/WO 3 electrocatalyst with abundant metal-metal heterointerfaces to promote hydrogen spillover, i. e., the migration of * H from W/WO 3 sites to Cu substrates. CuW grown in situ on carbon paper (CP) demonstrates exceptional HOR performance (1.86 mA cm −2 at 0.05 V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability in alkaline media. XAFS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that alloying W atoms into the Cu lattice induces electronic modulation, significantly boosting the adsorption, decomposition, and oxidation of H 2 . The migration of * H from W/WO 3 sites to Cu sites via the hydrogen spillover effect has been validated by in - situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectra. This study may open up a new path for designing high-efficiency HOR electrocatalysts from the perspective of appropriate hydrogen spillover channel design.},

  abstract     = {Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is a leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, with current therapies primarily targeting viral replication rather than addressing host-cell injury. RNA sequencing of corneal tissue from HSK patients and healthy donors identifies a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Notably, hexokinase-2 (HK2), a pivotal glycolytic enzyme, exhibits the greatest up-regulation, coinciding with a marked reduction in the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in HSK corneas. Pharmacological inhibition of HK2 with lonidamine in human corneal epithelial cells reduces herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication while preserving cell viability. In a murine model of HSK, topical lonidamine restored respiratory-chain activity, lowered viral load, and accelerated corneal re-epithelialization; its early therapeutic efficacy surpassed that of ganciclovir, and combination therapy conferred additive benefit. These findings identify HK2-driven glycolytic reprogramming as a pathogenic hallmark of HSK and demonstrate that metabolic targeting concurrently restricts viral propagation and promotes tissue regeneration. Thus, metabolic intervention has the potential to complement direct antiviral therapy and represents a promising, clinically translatable strategy to preserve vision in HSK.},

  abstract     = {Perovskite-based detectors for γ-rays have emerged relatively recently and have attracted limited attention. Although increasing efforts are being directed towards their development, the absence of an adaptive processor, systematic theoretical framework, and various applications limit its further development. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the commercial detectors, electrode configuration is improved to reshape the bias electric field, guide the effective signal carrier, and mitigate the noise from the side section. Through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental comparisons, the clear improvement of energy resolution from 7% to ≈5% is demonstrated, and the highest resolution of 1.9% is observed. Furthermore, to fill up the research framework of radiation, the definition of X-ray sensitivity is extended to quantitatively describe the γ-ray response, and assess the performance of γ-ray detectors, reaching a sensitivity ≈10 5 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 . Based on these, a spectral-enhanced imaging strategy is proposed to broaden the application of γ-Ray detectors, where the spectral dimension of images is utilized to improve contrast and enhance imaging quality.},

  abstract     = {Unjamming transitions from a solid-like to a fluid-like state are a gateway to breast epithelial cancer invasion. However, the mechanical interplay between phase transitions and dimension transitions, in particular wetting, remains elusive, despite being critical for understanding the onset of metastatic dissemination. This study shows that unjamming, mediated by the RAB5A GTPase, alters carcinoma spheroid fluidity, rigidity, and rewires adhesion mechanics to drive supracellular active wetting as a new mode of tumor expansion. Spheroid fluidification enhances the selective expression of integrin subunits and increases focal adhesion dynamics, inducing a fluid-like spreading behavior on specific matrix ligands. Notably, nanoscale regulation of integrin clustering can select for distinct phase transitions at the collective scale upon wetting. In this framework, fluidized spheroids polarize into cohesive “supracells”, and maintain a stiff peripheral actin bundle as measured by nanomechanical mapping. Furthermore, a combination of Brillouin microscopy and 2.5D traction force analysis reveals a mechanical switch within the spheroid core, characterized by significant cell softening and a reduction in compressive forces exerted on the substrate, thereby mimicking the wetting of a liquid droplet. These findings establish unjamming-driven active wetting as a key mechanism to comprehend the molecular and biophysical underpinnings of solid tumor invasion.},

  abstract     = {Osteosarcoma, the most prevalent malignant bone tumour in children and adolescents, exhibits aggressive pulmonary metastasis and poor prognosis. This study identifies LncDARS-AS1 as a key regulator of metastasis via modulation of ATP1A1, the catalytic subunit of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase (NKA). Transcriptomic analyses, validated by qPCR in 217 osteosarcoma RNA samples, reveal that LncDARS-AS1 is significantly upregulated in metastatic lesions and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Functional assays confirm that silencing LncDARS-AS1 suppresses osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LncDARS-AS1 directly binds ATP1A1, preventing its interaction with the UBQLN4 and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby enhancing NKA activity. Protein-RNA interactions were validated using ChIRP, mass spectrometry, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Functional NKA activity was assessed using ion-sensitive fluorescent indicators and enzymatic assays. Additionally, digoxin, a cardiac glycoside targeting NKA, effectively inhibited tumour growth and metastasis at clinically safe concentrations. These findings uncover a novel LncDARS-AS1/ATP1A1 axis that promotes osteosarcoma metastasis through inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated degradation and provide a rationale for repurposing digoxin in osteosarcoma therapy. ATP1A1 emerges as a promising target for anti-metastatic intervention.},

  abstract     = {No effective treatments are currently available for central nervous system neurotrauma although recent advances in electrical stimulation suggest some promise in neural tissue repair. It is hypothesized that structured integration of an electroconductive biomaterial into a tissue engineering scaffold can enhance electroactive signaling for neural regeneration. Electroconductive 2D Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets are synthesized from MAX-phase powder, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility with neurons, astrocytes and microglia. To achieve spatially-controlled distribution of these MXenes, melt-electrowriting is used to 3D-print highly-organized PCL micro-meshes with varying fiber spacings (low-, medium-, and high-density), which are functionalized with MXenes to provide highly-tunable electroconductive properties (0.081 ± 0.053-18.87 ± 2.94 S/m). Embedding these electroconductive micro-meshes within a neurotrophic, immunomodulatory hyaluronic acid-based extracellular matrix (ECM) produced a soft, growth-supportive MXene-ECM composite scaffold. Electrical stimulation of neurons seeded on these scaffolds promoted neurite outgrowth, influenced by fiber spacing in the micro-mesh. In a multicellular model of cell behavior, neurospheres stimulated for 7 days on high-density MXene-ECM scaffolds exhibited significantly increased axonal extension and neuronal differentiation, compared to low-density scaffolds and MXene-free controls. The results demonstrate that spatial-organization of electroconductive materials in a neurotrophic scaffold can enhance repair-critical responses to electrical stimulation and that these biomimetic MXene-ECM scaffolds offer a promising new approach to neurotrauma repair.},

  abstract     = {Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by accelerated platelet destruction and defective platelet production. The thrombopoietin (TPO)-activated c-Mpl signaling pathway has been proven to promote megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production and thus has significant value in the clinical treatment of ITP. However, individual differences and unsustainable responses limit the clinical application of c-Mpl agonists. The cell membrane distribution of c-Mpl is crucial for the cell response to c-Mpl agonists. In the present study, this is observed that the distribution of c-Mpl on the megakaryocyte membrane is significantly reduced in ITP patients. The reduction is more severe in refractory patients. Then, this is verified that the membrane trafficking of c-Mpl is mediated by the Myosin-9/Rab6A complex, and demonstrates that the stability of this complex depends on Rab6A-GTPase. Furthermore, this is found that adiponectin promotes the membrane localization of c-Mpl by increasing the expression of Rab6A GEFs. Finally, this is revealed that adiponectin can assist thrombopoietic agents in the treatment of ITP mice. The results clarify the c-Mpl distribution defects in the cell membrane and the corresponding c-Mpl membrane transport mechanisms in megakaryocytes of ITP, providing new insights to improve the clinical efficacy of thrombopoietic agents for ITP patients.},

The model learns biological representations at local and global levels, to design natural-like species with enhanced diversity, or optimize protein properties and functions. Its modular nature also enables the integration with alternative pre-trained encoders for enhanced generalization capability. Outlier design can be implemented by adjusting the classifier-free guidance that enables PRO-LDM to sample vastly different regions in the latent space. The approach is demonstrated in generating a novel green-fluorescence-protein variant with notably enhanced fluorescence in multiple working scenarios along with increased solubility and stability. The model provides a versatile tool to effectively extract physicochemical and evolutionary information in sequences for designing new proteins with optimized performances.},

This study reports the synthesis of a microflower-like Fe@WO 3 / ZnCo 2 O 4 heterostructure for effective tetradecane sensing. The Fe@WO 3 / ZnCo 2 O 4 n-p junctions demonstrated significant alterations in electrical conductivity upon exposure to tetradecane at room temperature. The sensor achieved a reasonable detection limit of 78.4 ppb and a rapid recovery time of 36 s. The remarkable sensing performance is attributed to the synergistic interactions among multiple heterojunction interfaces, doping-induced active sites, the presence of oxygen vacancies, high-energy crystallographic facets, reduced grain size, and enhanced crystallinity, as supported by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. This work identifies a promising candidate for the detection of distinct volatile organic compounds, warranting further exploration in agricultural and emission monitoring applications while addressing a critical gap in metal oxide semiconductor sensors for the detection of large-molecule gases.},

Scanning transmission electron microscopy offers powerful capabilities for materials analysis and modification, but sample damage, drift, and scan distortions hinder single atom analysis and deterministic manipulation. Materials analysis and modification via electron–solid interactions can be transformed by precise delivery of electrons to a specified atomic location, maintaining the beam position despite drift, and minimizing collateral dose. Here a fast, low-dose, sub-20-pm precision electron beam positioning technique is developed, “atomic lock-on,” (ALO), which offers the ability to position the beam on a specific atomic column without previously irradiating that column. This technique is used to lock onto a single selected atomic location to repeatedly measure its weak electron energy loss signal despite sample drift. Moreover, electron beam-matter interactions in single atomic events are measured with time resolution. This enables observation of single-atom dynamics, such as atomic bistability, revealing partially bonded atomic configurations and recapture phenomena. This opens prospects for using electron microscopy for high-precision measurements and deterministic control of matter for quantum technologies.},

Waste alkaline water generated from various industries can be directly used in the AEMWE system, due to its appropriate pH range of 13–14. While various nickel-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts have demonstrated adequate performance, their long-term stability remains a concern. To ensure long-term stability of AEMWE, it is crucial to address the potential poisoning effects of impurities present in waste alkaline water on nickel-based HER electrocatalysts. In this study, the Ni-CeO₂/Carbon (NCC) catalyst is employed for HER in waste alkaline water containing Li, Mo, and W ions. NCC exhibited an overpotential of 31 mV, showing ≈3 times less overpotential compared to the Ni/C. The XPS results and DFT calculations demonstrated the electrons transferring from CeO 2 to Ni, inducing the Electronic Metal-Support Interactions (EMSI) effects. The NCC shows 1 A cm −2 at 2.03 V in AEMWE while Ni/C needed 2.33 V to achieve the same current densities. The NCC maintaines long-term stability over 2000 h, with a degradation rate of 4.95%.},

  abstract     = {In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, how bacteria strategically navigate these factors is revealed. It is observed that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (≈0.25). Furthermore, it is found that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this 2D environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.},

In a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is found that impaired Kir4.1 channels in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) hindered myelin repair in the spinal cord. Using a thermal shift assay (TSA), the small molecule 2-D08 is identified, which effectively activated Kir4.1 channels and reduced demyelination in both EAE mice and marmosets. The neuroprotective effects are mainly due to enhanced phosphorylation of FYN tyrosine kinase, promoting OPCs differentiation.

UTX has been reported to participate in genome-wide histone modifications and gene expression in tumorigenesis and its mutations are identified in human cancers. Here, UTX is demonstrated to localize both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, notably, cytoplasmic UTX forms puncta and co-localizes in stress granules (SGs) upon different stresses in vitro. Mechanistically, the TPR domain of UTX plays a critical role in regulating SG disassembly by interacting with G3BP1, the central hub of SG, to disrupt the scaffold network of SG under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Importantly, a clinical UTX mutation, D336G in TPR domain, increases cytoplasmic location of UTX, and stabilizes SG. While UTX D336G promotes, WT UTX or UTX TPR inhibits, cell growth and tumorigenesis by regulating SGs both in vitro and in nude mice, and such regulation is G3BP1 dependent.

  abstract     = {Radiation therapy (RT) is essential for treating thoracic malignancies but often causes significant lung damage. FLASH-RT, an ultra-high dose rate irradiation technique, shows potential in reducing radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) while maintaining tumor control. However, the underlying immune mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the immune and cellular responses to FLASH-RT versus conventional dose rate (CONV) RT during the early phase of RILI. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a dynamic landscape of the lung microenvironment is pictured during RILI within one-week post-irradiation. The analysis reveals that FLASH-RT induces a more immediate but transient cellular response, while CONV-RT causes sustained inflammation. FLASH irradiation significantly reduces neutrophil infiltration compared to CONV irradiation, particularly within the pro-inflammatory Ccrl2 + subset. FLASH irradiation also triggers stronger activation of CD4 + CD40L + Th cells, which are critical for regulating immune responses and balancing inflammation. Moreover, FLASH irradiation attenuates pro-inflammatory activation and intercellular signaling of Mefv⁺ monocytes, thereby restraining excessive macrophage-driven inflammation. Additionally, FLASH irradiation enhances TGF-β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, promoting tissue repair. These findings highlight FLASH-RT's superior immune modulation and reparative potential, providing valuable insights into its clinical application for minimizing radiation damage and enhancing lung recovery.},

The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases involves the interaction among genetic factors, environmental factors, and immune disorders. The post-translational modified neoantigens are the key nodal of these three factors. Under the intervention of the external environment, changes in metabolic status in vivo induce metabolite-related post-translational modifications (PTMs). These PTM proteins and peptides, after being presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules of specific genotypes, can trigger autoreactive T cell expansions which are antigen-specific and then develop into autoimmunity. Such biological processes are a great challenge to the immune tolerance status and can be an important cause of autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract     = {Allergic asthma is a significant global health issue characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Current treatments only alleviate symptoms but fail to cure the disease due to its complex pathology. Lipid mediators from arachidonate metabolism are pivotal in immune regulation in asthma. Previously, coactosin-like protein (CLP) is identified as a regulator of leukotriene production in vitro. However, its role in asthma is unclear. In this study, it is found that CLP-deficient ( Cotl1 −/− ) mice challenged with house dust mite (HDM) exhibits exacerbated airway inflammation, macrophage polarization, and type 2 immune responses. CLP deficiency increased prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2 ) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and alveolar macrophages (AMs), activating the PGD 2 receptor chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) on immune cells. Notably, HDM exposure reduced pulmonary CLP levels in wild-type (WT) mice, and overexpression of CLP in Cotl1 −/− macrophages decreased HDM-induced PGD 2 in BAL and alleviated inflammation. Cotl1 −/− AMs exacerbated HDM-induced airway inflammation compared to WT AMs, and this effect is dependent on CRTH2 signaling. These findings reveal that CLP modulates macrophage polarization and suppresses the PGD 2 -CRTH2 pathway to alleviate airway inflammation, highlighting CLP as a promising therapeutic target for asthma.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac fibrosis, a key pathological feature of cardiac remodeling, is a major contributor to mortality in older patients with heart failure. The underlying mechanisms are complex, involving alterations in intercellular communication and chronic inflammation. This study investigates the role of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in aging-related myocardial fibrosis and its regulatory effects on autophagy through palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Here, plasma levels of IPA, a tryptophan-derived metabolite, are found to be reduced in older patients with heart failure, and this reduction is associated with deteriorating cardiac function. Notably, IPA supplementation significantly attenuated aging-related myocardial fibrosis. PPT1, a lysosomal enzyme involved in autophagy, is upregulated in macrophages during aging. IPA reversed aging-induced increase in PPT1 expression. Using PPT1 flox/flox Lyz2-cre mice, it is demonstrated that macrophage-specific deletion of PPT1 significantly reduced cardiac inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in aged mice. Furthermore, PPT1 silencing in macrophages reduced the expression of myocardial fibrosis markers in vitro. Mechanistically, IPA regulated PPT1 expression to modulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, thereby restoring autophagic activity in senescent macrophages and suppressing both inflammation and aging-related myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, IPA influenced the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to regulate PPT1 expression. These findings demonstrate that IPA inhibits PPT1, activates autophagy in macrophages, and mitigates aging-related myocardial fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Increasing evidence has clarified that atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with enhanced glycolysis, leading to lactate accumulation. However, whether glycolysis promotes AF remains unknown, as does whether histone lactylation plays a role in its pathogenesis. In the study, spontaneous AF mice are established to monitor AF susceptibility and atrial substrates at different ages (3, 5, 7 months), indicating that enhanced glycolysis acts as a promoter during AF development by inducing atrial fibrosis. The promoting effect of glycolysis on AF and the pivotal enzyme in driving glycolysis are confirmed by treatment with glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and adeno-associated virus-mediated atrial PFKM expression. Furthermore, lactate stimulates primary mouse cardiac fibroblast (CF) activation. Mechanistically, the observations indicated that atrial lactate accumulation promotes global lactylation and H3K18 lactylation in atrial fibroblasts. P300-mediated H3K18 lactylation up-regulates TGF-β1 transcription, leading to activation of CF, and thereby contributing to atrial fibrosis. The results reveal a novel role of the metabolic-epigenetic axis in AF pathogenesis, which raises the possibility of potential therapeutic strategies targeting AF.},

  abstract     = {Rhizosheath formation is facilitated by root hair length, root exudates, the soil microbes, which collectively enhance plant resistance to drought. This process partly results from the complex interaction between root exudates and microbes, a relationship that remains poorly understood. The roles of root exudates and microbes in rhizosheath formation in rice under soil drying (SD) conditions are investigated. In tetraploid rice, rhizosheath formation under SD is approximately 70% greater than in diploid rice. Inoculation of diploid rice with the rhizosheath soil microbiota from tetraploid rice significantly enhanced rhizosheath formation under SD. The bacterial genus Pseudomonas is identified as the key taxon promoting rhizosheath formation in tetraploid rice under SD. Tetraploid rice exhibits significantly higher root flavonoid concentration than diploid rice under SD. Overexpression of the chalcone synthase gene ( OsCHS1 ), a key gene involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, led to a significant increase in the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae in diploid rice. Pseudomonas nitroreducens , isolated from the rhizosheath of tetraploid rice, demonstrates chemotactic attraction to flavonoids, but this behavior is not observed in histidine kinase mutant Δ cheA . Diploid and tetraploid rice inoculated with P. nitroreducens and IAA biosynthesis complemented strain Δ iaaM -c formed larger rhizosheath under SD than those inoculated with its IAA biosynthesis mutant Δ iaaM . These results suggest that auxin-producing Pseudomonas , recruited by root flavonoids, enhances rice rhizosheath formation through the bacterial histidine kinase under SD. This finding may facilitate the improvement of environmental adaptation in polyploidy crops by regulating their interactions with beneficial soil microorganisms.},

  abstract     = {Inflammation is a hallmark of intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) characterized by immune cell infiltration and cytokine secretion. Stage-specific transcriptomic analyses of IVDD via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have primarily focused on nucleus pulposus cell phenotypes but not immune subpopulations. In other disease contexts, integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with scRNA-seq data has provided insights on pathomechanisms in relation to specific cellular subpopulations via single-cell disease relevance scores (scDRS). However, such an approach remains to be applied to IVDD. Here, the stage- specific analysis of IVDD in relation to Pfirrmann grading revealed a key transition in immune cells from a preponderance of LCN2 high myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during early degeneration to a surge of proinflammatory IL1B+ macrophages in advanced IVDD. scDRS implicated IL1B+ M1-like macrophages as a GWAS risk-enriched subpopulation associated with disease, while functional validation indicated an immunomodulatory effect of LCN2 high MDSCs via ANXA1-mediated inflammation suppression. Accordingly, LCN2 knockout mice exhibit accelerated IVDD, whereas recombinant LCN2 promoted macrophage polarization in vitro to the reparative phenotype by enhancing ANXA1 / Arginase-1 expression and countering LPS/IFN-γ-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype. This work identifies LCN2 high MDSCs as an immunoprotective subpopulation in early IVDD and highlights a potential role of LCN2 as a novel therapeutic agent.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer due to its aggressive clinical features and the lack of effective targeted therapeutics. Mitochondrial metabolism is intimately linked to TNBC progression and therapeutic resistance and is an attractive therapeutic target for TNBC. Here, it is first reported that human transmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65), a poorly characterized mitochondrial inner-membrane protein-encoding gene in human cancer, acts as a novel oncogene in TNBC to promote tumor growth, metastasis, and cisplatin resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Transcription factor MYC and DNA demethylase ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) coordinately upregulate TMEM65 in TNBC, and its upregulation is associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of MYC and TET3 attenuates TMEM65-driven TNBC progression. Mechanistic investigations reveal that TMEM65 enhances mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and its byproduct reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Increased ROS induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which in turn transcriptionally activates serpin family B member 3 (SERPINB3) to enhance TNBC stemness, thus leading to TNBC progression and cisplatin resistance. Collectively, these findings identify TMEM65 as a vital oncogene of TNBC, unveil its regulatory mechanisms, and shed light on its potential role in TNBC therapy.},

  abstract     = {High-brilliance circularly polarized γ-photon beams are of great significance for a wide range of applications. However, their generation through nonlinear Compton scattering must require a high-density longitudinally-spin-polarized electron beam and consequently is still a great challenge. Here, a novel method is proposed to generate such γ-photon beams via the vacuum dichroism (VD)-assisted vacuum birefringence (VB) effect, only utilizing a well-established unpolarized electron beam. A linearly polarized laser pulse is splitted into two subpulses with the first one colliding with a dense unpolarized electron beam to generate a linearly polarized γ-photon beam (via nonlinear Compton scattering), which then further collides with the second subpulse and is transformed into a circularly polarized one via the VB effect. It is found that by manipulating the relative polarization of two subpulses, one can “purify” the polarization of the γ-photon beam via the VD effect, thereby significantly enhancing the circular polarization of the γ-photon beam. Due to the VD assistance, the VB effect reaches optimal when the relative polarization is nearly 30°, not the widely used 45° in the common VB detection methods. The numerical results show that one can obtain a circularly polarized γ-photon beam with average degree of about 30% (43%) for energies above 500 (1000) MeV and brilliance of about 10 24 (10 23 ) photons/(s · mm 2 · mrad 2 · 0.1%BW) at 500 (1000) MeV by using a currently feasible laser with a peak intensity of about 10 22 Wcm − 2. And, it can be further improved to above 60% (75%) by increasing the laser pulse duration. Moreover, our method is shown to be robust with respect to the laser and electron beam parameters, and can also be used to efficiently confirm the well-known VB effect itself, which has been predicted a very long time ago but has not been directly observed in experiments yet.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with hypertension being a major contributor to both kidney damage and increased cardiovascular risk. Despite the established link between CKD and cardiovascular disease, the role of uremic toxins in monocyte-endothelial interactions under hypertensive conditions remains underexplored. Here, a 3D microfluidic model is developed to examine the effects of indoxyl sulfate on monocyte adhesion and extravasation across engineered microvessels embedded in hydrogels with different densities under controlled luminal pressure. Elevated pressure alone in absence of indoxyl sulfate significantly enhanced monocyte adhesion and extravasation, regardless of matrix density, while matrix density regulated adhesion and transmigration in the uremic environment. ICAM-1 is identified as a key driver of THP-1 monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Additionally, denser hydrogels primed monocytes toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with reduced phagocytic capacity, while softer hydrogels induced an anti-inflammatory-like phenotype with enhanced phagocytosis. However, the uremic environment reduced phagocytosis and shifted cells toward a pro-inflammatory-like state, irrespective of matrix density. This approach has the potential to dissect multiple factors that contribute to elevated cardiovascular risks in CKD patients and improve the understanding of mechanisms involved in monocyte dynamics in CKD-related cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disorder, and its associated microvascular dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. However, the mechanism governing metabolic regulation and functional heterogeneity of endothelial dysfunction remains incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of metabolic stress-induced activation of choline kinase α (CHKA) in endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations, contributing to diabetes-induced microvascular dysfunction. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), three distinct EC subclusters are identified within retinal vessels. Among them, one subcluster characterized by elevated CHKA expression is associated with enhanced angiogenic activity. CHKA silencing in ECs inhibited angiogenic effects and reduced retinal vascular dysfunction in diabetic murine models. CHKA silencing also disrupted NAD + metabolism, causing reduced NAD + levels. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD + , partially reversed the anti-angiogenic effects induced by CHKA silencing. Mechanistically, CHKA regulated endothelial dysfunction through the NAD + -SIRT1-Notch signaling. Clinical sample analysis and Mendelian randomization studies provided strong evidence linking increased CHKA expression with diabetic microvascular complications. Collectively, this study advances the understanding of endothelial heterogeneity and identifies CHKA as a critical regulator of pathological angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diabetic vascular complications.},

Phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation and metastasis by regulating the cancer-related proteins. Identifying key phosphorylation sites is essential for inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and optimizing therapy strategy. Here, this study reveals the strong association of oncogene Collaborator of ARF (CARF), a cell-division regulator interacting with p53, with prognosis and survival of lymphoma patients through pan-cancer analysis. In addition, this study finds that mammalian CARF shares homology with Kip-Related Protein6 (KRP6), a cell cycle inhibitor from higher plant Arabidopsis . KRP6 is regulated by casein kinase1 via phosphorylation at serines 75 and 109, which are conservative in CARF at serines 316 and 356. Systemic assays conducted with various B-cell lymphoma cell lines and a mouse xenograft model demonstrate that the non-phosphorylation variant of CARF inhibited cell proliferation and lymphoma formation more effectively than wild-type CARF, highlighting the crucial regulatory role of phosphorylation at these conserved sites in controlling B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation. A similar suppressive effect is observed with plant KRP6, suggesting a cross-species bioengineering application. These findings enlighten the application of phosphorylation-modified proteins as therapeutic targets in precise lymphoma treatments.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, ultimately leading to irreversible vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the significant risk factors in glaucoma; however, neurodegeneration continues even after effective IOP management, underscoring the need for neuroprotective therapies. This study investigates the role of connexin43 (Cx43), which is extensively expressed in retinal macroglia, in regulating microglial activation and optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma. A high-fidelity CRISPR-Cas13 (hfCas13X) system is employed to selectively target and knock down Cx43 expression in macroglia. The findings reveal that Cx43-mediated ATP release through hemichannels exacerbates microglial activation and neuroinflammation, thereby contributing to RGC loss. Notably, in a mouse model of chronic ocular hypertension (COH) glaucoma, knocking down Cx43 in macroglia using the hfCas13X system significantly promoted the survival of RGCs and the integrity of the optic nerve, and improved visual function. The hfCas13X system, which offers high-fidelity RNA editing with minimal off-target effects, represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for glaucoma, highlighting the potential of gene editing technologies in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Fusarium root rot threatens its entire growth, harvest, and storage period, thereby reducing yield and quality. Therefore, a deeper understanding of Fusarium pathogenicity and sweet potato defense is urgently required. Here, two single nucleotide polymorphisms are identified within the promoter region of the I. batatas CHY zinc-finger and ring protein1 ( IbCHYR1 ) gene that encode an E3 ubiquitin ligase linked to root rot resistance. In susceptible varieties, the high dosage allele Pro :: IbCHYR1 Hap1 leads to increased expression of IbCHYR1 . Overexpression of IbCHYR1 increases susceptibility to root rot and Fusarium wilt. IbCHYR1 interacts with the I. batatas CCCH-type zinc-finger protein ( IbZnFR ) to promote its degradation. IbZnFR confers resistance to root rot and Fusarium wilt and improves yield by more than 10%. The high dosage Pro :: IbZnFR Hap2 allele is associated with resistance to root rot disease. Moreover, FfRlpA2 , a conserved Fusarium effector, is identified as a protease inhibitor that stabilizes and hijacks IbCHYR1 to degrade IbZnFR , thereby inhibiting multiple defense pathways. These findings provide insights into Fusarium pathogenicity and a genetic basis for root rot research and improvement of disease-resistant sweet potato varieties.},

Antiangiogenic therapies are approved to treat different kinds of cancer. However, the success of these treatments is so far limited as some patients do not respond at all and others develop resistances. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving tumor angiogenesis and the variations in tumor vessels is crucial. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a fast volumetric imaging technique that provides detailed insights into tumor vascularization and perfusion of vessels in a label-free and non-invasive manner. An ultra-high resolution OCTA and confocal fluorescence imaging pipeline are developed to analyze tumor vascularization and blood perfusion in vivo, using a zebrafish cancer model. OCTA imaging operating at 800 nm is optimized to show slow blood flow allowing to compare the functionality of blood vessels in healthy and tumor-bearing zebrafish. Furthermore, effects of small compounds on tumor vascularization can be investigated with our setup. The key outcomes include a qualitative assessment of vascularization and blood vessel perfusion, along with a quantitative analysis of vessel structure, to evaluate how effective the drugs were at different concentrations.},

The attainment of ultralow CMC while sustaining the constant micelle presents a significant challenge. Here, by an ingenious pressurizing strategy, the ultralow CMC is obtained for the immobilized micelle. The ultralow CMC of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) is performed under pressure by the detection of encapsulated coumarin 35 (C35) attractively. At 0.80 GPa, the CMC of CTAB is decreased ≈111-fold to 8.3 ± 0.1 µ m compared to 917.2 ± 8.7 µ m at 0.10 MPa. The ultralow CMC under pressure is probed relying on the quenched fluorescence background of C35. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra confer a clear picture that the pressure-induced fluorescence quenching is ascribed to the reinforced competition for the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process of the C35. This study provides a robust strategy for achieving ultralow CMC, laying the groundwork for the efficient application of DSSCs.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies and epigenetic modifiers play a key role in HCC progression. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine-36 (H3K36me3) determines deposition of mRNA de novo N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification. However, it remains largely elusive how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are selected for proper m 6 A methylation. The current study provides evidence for L1CAM-AS1 as a novel H3K36me3-guided, m 6 A-modified lncRNA through integration of genome-wide H3K36me3 profiles and transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiles of HCC cells. The crucial m 6 A-modification site in L1CAM-AS1 exon 3 is recognized by IGF2BP1, leading to increased lncRNA stability. Oncogenic L1CAM-AS1 shows higher expression in HCC tissues than in normal specimens, and its elevated expression is associated with shorten patient survival. Mechanistically, L1CAM-AS1 interrupts binding of RAN to the E3 ligase OSTM1, suppresses RAN ubiquitination at Lys152 and Lys167, stabilizes RAN protein, enhances nuclear import of RELA (p65), and activates the NF-κB signaling, leading to up-regulated CCL2 expression. L1CAM-AS1-induced CCL2 secretion from HCC cells enhances M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Meanwhile, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages-released CCL5 augments RELA nuclear import in HCC cells, which in turn activates the NF-κB signaling. Given the critical role of macrophages in anti-tumor immunity, inhibition of the L1CAM-AS1-RAN axis promotes the efficacy of PD-1 blockade via TAM reprogramming in HCC mouse models. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into how epigenetic alternations are involved in antitumor immunity modulation and illustrates promising potentials of L1CAM-AS1 in immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatments for HCC.},

  abstract     = {Accurate decoding of peripheral nerve signals is essential for advancing neuroscience research, developing therapeutics for neurological disorders, and creating reliable human–machine interfaces. However, the poor mechanical compliance of conventional metal electrodes and limited generalization of existing decoding models have significantly hindered progress in understanding peripheral nerve function. This study introduces low-impedance, soft-conducting polymer electrodes capable of forming stable, intimate contacts with peripheral nerve tissues, allowing for continuous and reliable recording of neural activity in awake animals. Using this unique dataset of neurophysiological signals, a neural network model that integrates both handcrafted and deep learning-derived features, while incorporating parameter-sharing and adaptation training strategies, is developed. This approach significantly improves the generalizability of the decoding model across subjects, reducing the reliance on extensive training data. The findings not only deepen the understanding of peripheral nerve function but also open avenues for developing advanced interventions to augment and restore neurological functions.},

The novel design leverages numerous conductive nanosheets, randomly arranged in a series-parallel configuration, embedded within a highly compliant dielectric hydrogel. For the nanosheets, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is deposited on the surface of sulfonated cellulose nanosheets (SCNS) to function as microelectrodes (PEDOT@SCNS). The resulting nanosheet-based hydrogel (NSH) demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1356%), excellent adaptability (storage modulus of 102 Pa), and self-adhesiveness (21.7 kPa on pigskin). The nanosheet microelectrodes enable the formation of both microcapacitor arrays and conductive paths within the ultrasoft hydrogel, facilitating the construction of high-fidelity capacitive sensors and bioelectrodes for the real-time monitoring and classification of human activities and physiological states, respectively. This NSH, which significantly reduces skin-interfacial impedance, has demonstrated strong potential as candidate sensors for advanced applications in EMG, facial nerve monitoring, ECG, and brain activity monitoring, achieving reduced RMS noise (9.7 µV) and minimal motion artifacts.},

  abstract     = {Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV + ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibits a poorer prognosis with limited treatment options. Although recent evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system is associated with tumor progression, its role in EBV + DLBCL remains poorly understood. In the cohort, patients with EBV⁺DLBCL exhibit significantly shorter overall survival (OS). Two EBV + DLBCL cell lines are established and characterized. Although cell proliferation does not differ significantly in vitro, tumors derived from EBV + DLBCL cells demonstrate accelerated growth compared to their parental counterparts in mouse models. Mechanistically, transcriptome analysis reveals the upregulation of axonogenesis-related genes and pathways in EBV + DLBCL tumors. Immunostaining confirms increased nerve fiber infiltration in SUDHL6-EBV xenografts and enhance neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia co-cultured with EBV + DLBCL cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that sympathetic nerves promote tumor growth via β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), which are attenuated by selective β2AR blockers. Clinically, EBV⁺DLBCL patient samples show more sympathetic nerve fibers and higher β2AR expression, both of which are associated with poorer survival. Furthermore, a meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is linked to a reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality. Together, these findings suggest that sympathetic nerve innervation drives the progression of EBV + DLBCL via β2ARs, highlighting a potential therapeutic target.},

A stacked multimodal machine learning model is constructed and validated for early identification and prognosis stratification of NAFLD by integrating genetic and clinical data sourced from 36 490 UK Biobank and 9 007 Nanfang Hospital participants and extracted its probabilities as in-silico scores for NAFLD (ISNLD). The efficacy of ISNLD is evaluated for the early prediction of severe liver disease (SeLD) and analyzed its association with metabolism-related outcomes. The multimodal model performs satisfactorily in classifying individuals into low- and high-risk groups for NAFLD, achieving area under curves (AUCs) of 0.843, 0.840, and 0.872 within training, internal, and external test sets, respectively. Among high-risk group, ISNLD is significantly associated with intrahepatic and metabolism-related complications after lifestyle factors adjustment. Further, ISNLD demonstrates notable capability for early prediction of SeLD and further stratifies high-risk subjects into three risk subgroups of elevated risk for adverse outcomes. The findings emphasize the model's ability to integrate multimodal features to generate ISNLD, enabling early detection and prognostic prediction of NAFLD. This facilitates personalized stratification for NAFLD and metabolism-related outcomes based on digital non-invasive markers, enabling preventive interventions.},

Conventional epoxy-crosslinked networks are inherently brittle, leading to a lack of these traits.

Through hierarchical assembly, the network integrates side-chain quadruple hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), dynamic disulfide bonds, and interfacial H-bonds, facilitating rapid energy dissipation. This epoxy demonstrates exceptional performance through meticulous engineering, exhibiting impressive toughness (210.75 MJ m −3 ), exceeding that of spider silk by 30%. It also shows remarkable stretchability (864.72%) and rapid self-healing capabilities (90.0% recovery within 2 h at 25 °C). This combination of these properties is consistently maintained under various environmental conditions due to the protection of the dynamic bonds by the hydrophobic chains. Furthermore, the bionic network enhanced the composites with superior gas impermeability and high interfacial adhesive strength (9.58 MPa). This study offers novel insights into the development of high-performance, durable protective coatings, and flexible devices designed for enhanced tolerance to harsh marine environments.},

The optimization of lyophilization formulations and operations is a slow process that could be accelerated by on-line analytics.

As a non-invasive, rapid, non-destructive, accurate, and automated tool that combines advantages from both spectroscopy and imaging techniques, HSI holds significant potential for analyzing and optimizing lyophilization processes and products. However, the huge and information-rich datasets generated from HSI are difficult to be modeled and interpreted properly. This article reviews and discusses the literature on the application of HSI on lyophilization, and the strategies that use the resulting data to build models. Such strategies include preprocessing, spectral unmixing, classification and regression, and data fusion. From the data modeling and application perspectives, the current challenges and future prospects regarding HSI techniques for lyophilization are addressed. This article is intended to provide guidance and insights for non-specialist researchers and engineers into leveraging HSI and the data-driven modeling strategies for addressing a wide range of lyophilization-related challenges.},

Albeit a few advances along c-MOF platforms in enhancing their EMW absorption performances, reticular modulation-led inter/intra-layer conduction and polarization loss remains an unmet challenge. To address this, a ligand substitution-guided bottom-up structural control strategy is introduced to study the depth of reticular modulation-led inter/intra-layer conduction and polarization loss in c-MOFs under an electromagnetic (EM) field. A family of triphenylene-X ligands (X = −NH 2 , −OH, and −SH) is harnessed to afford an isoreticular family of three Cu-based c-MOFs. Thanks to the distinct Cu─X bonds, such a platform allowed to systematically study the synergistic features of conduction and polarization loss in EMW absorption enhancement. One of the trio, Cu 3 (HITP) 2 (X = −NH 2 ; HITP, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) is identified with an optimal EM loss capacity under the EM field, achieving a record-high reflection loss of −63.03 dB in the effective absorption range of 3–18 GHz band. Setting up a new benchmark for EM loss among c-MOFs, this study introduces a way to leverage control in the charge mobility characteristics of Cu─X bonds relative to the dielectric losses at both molecular and atomic scales.},

  abstract     = {Zinc plays a crucial role in the gut barrier function and are widely used for the prevention of bowel disease. However, the mechanism via which zinc supplementation exerts this regulatory effect is unclear. The present study identifies and characterizes the zinc-responsive activation of AKT and demonstrates its function in alleviating gut barrier dysfunction. Mechanistically, zinc increased intracellular SAM production, a methyl donor, by promoting the activation of the metallochaperone ZNG1-METAP1 complex. Subsequently, zinc facilitates methylation (symmetrical dimethylarginine, SDMA) of AKT at residues R391 and R15, which is facilitated by PRMT5. The AKT SDMA modification promotes AKT translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and its interaction with mTORC2, ultimately promoting AKT activation and cell proliferation. Notably, histidine has an antagonistic effect on zinc-induced the AKT activation, cell proliferation, and gut barrier improvement by chelating zinc. These results demonstrate that zinc activates AKT and alleviates gut barrier dysfunction by inducing activation of the ZNG1-METAP1-PRMT5-AKT SDMA pathway, and highlight that limiting histidine intake may have effective therapeutic potential for bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.},

  abstract     = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, offering significant benefits across various cancers. However, challenges remain, particularly in solid tumors where immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and T cell exhaustion limit effectiveness. Combining ICB with CAR T cell therapy has shown potential but requires further optimization for effective synergy. Here, the bioinformatic analysis identified that CXCL13 expression is highly elevated in T cells from patients who respond to ICB, indicating its possible role in enhancing T cell antitumor responses. Mouse CAR T cells are engineered to overexpress CXCL13 and observed that these cells displayed reduced exhaustion, increased central memory phenotype, and improved mitochondrial function and proliferation in an AKT-mTOR dependent manner. CXCL13-overexpressing CAR T cells show significantly increased antitumor activity in vivo, particularly when combined with PD-1 inhibition, promoting the expansion and persistence of early exhausted CD8 + CAR T cells. CXCL13 also conferred similar in vitro phenotypic enhancements in human CAR T cells as observed in murine cells. These results indicate that CXCL13 expression improves CAR T cell function and responsiveness to ICB, offering a promising and translationally relevant strategy to optimize CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors in clinical settings.},

However, such a solar-to-chemical conversion still suffers from limited light utilization, confined surface adsorption, and restricted reduction/oxidation reaction pathway. At this juncture, this bottleneck has been overcome through diverse modifications over carbon nitride, such as defect engineering graphitic carbon nitride with modulated physical and chemical properties, which performs satisfactory visible-light absorption, sufficient active sites, and promotes charge transfer kinetics for artificial solar-to-chemical conversion. In this review, the recent advances for H 2 O 2 photosynthesis over defective graphitic carbon nitride are described, including the existing principles for H 2 O 2 formation, the factors affecting photosynthesis, the fabrication strategies toward novel materials, and the detailed pathways for H 2 O 2 formation.

  abstract     = {Zero-dimensinoal (0D) manganese-based metal halides (MHs) demonstrate excellent structural tunable through organic cation design, enabling precise control of Mn─Mn distances to modulate critical photoelectric physical properties. Here, two novel 0D PTA 2 MnBr 4 (PTA = phenyltrimethylammonium) are synthesized and DMA 2 MnBr 4 (DMA = dimethylammonium) wafer with a manipulation of octahedra are synthesized by a precise molecular design. Structural analysis reveals that the PTA-functional group with extended π -conjugation lengths increases the Mn─Mn distance, results in a lower energy transfer and reduced exciton binding energy compared to DMA⁺ (linear carbon chain). Consequently, PTA 2 MnBr 4 demonstrates an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and prolonged exciton lifetime. The engineered X-ray detector based on PTA 2 MnBr 4 wafer exhibits a higher sensitivity of 1122 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 and a lower detection limit of 95 nGy air s −1 , while DMA 2 MnBr 4 device are 708.2 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 and 180 nGy air s −1 , respectively, which paves the way for high-efficiency photoelectronic applications. This suggests that molecular engineering is a robust approach for designing high-performance 0D manganese halides for radiation detection.},

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in LUAD progression, yet the biological role of lncRNA TMEM99 remains unexplored. In this study, its function in inhibiting autophagy in LUAD is explored. Using RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), TMEM99 is found upregulated in LUAD tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor patient outcomes. In vivo and in vitro assays confirmed that TMEM99 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibits autophagy. Mechanistically, the 3′ end of TMEM99 binds to the K‑homology domain 1 (KH1) and KH4 domains of far upstream element‑binding protein 3 (FUBP3), stabilizing its protein. The TMEM99-FUBP3 complex binds to p21 mRNA and recruits IGF2BP2 in an N⁶‑methyladenosine (m⁶A)-dependent manner, which enhances mRNA stability and translation efficiency. This study reveals that TMEM99 plays a crucial regulatory role in LUAD autophagy and presents a novel cytoplasmic regulatory mechanism contributing to LUAD progression.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment of mastitis. Anthocyanins (ACN) have excellent anti-inflammatory properties. However, the key pathways of mastitis disease progression and the therapeutic effects of ACN on mastitis remain poorly understood. In this study, using cows, goats, and mice as animal models, the efficacy of ACN extracts from crabapple fruit is investigated in alleviating the severity of mastitis and blood milk barrier (BMB) damage. A monomeric component, cyanidin 3- O -galactoside (C3Gal) is identified, that exhibited considerable effect on mastitis. Mechanistically, C3Gal regulated mastitis progression by inhibiting PANoptosis activation, and suppressing gasdermin D N-terminal activity to regulate BMB damage during mastitis. These findings establish PANoptosis as a critical pathway in the rapid progression of mastitis and highlight the potential of ACN extracts as effective alternatives to antibiotic for mastitis treatment. This study provides a promising strategy for the discovery and application of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, expands the application of ACN in inflammatory diseases, and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory effect.},

However, rather than solely addressing these disadvantages, hydrogen's inevitable role in sustainable metallurgy should be leveraged to create new and potentially superior materials. Here, it is shown that using hydrogen in the form of metal hydrides introduces a barrier to mechanical alloying, stabilizing otherwise unattainable microstructures. Severe plastic deformation of a composite of the equiatomic high entropy alloy (HEA) TiVZrNbHf and Cu leads to amorphization, while substituting the HEA with its hydride preserves the two-phase structure. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the significantly different hydrogen affinities, together with the restricted dislocation motion in the hydride, create a barrier to mechanical alloying. This hydride route could enable new microstructure states, even in well-studied material systems. It opens an additional dimension in designing materials containing phases with diverging hydrogen affinities, offering tighter control over mechanical alloying.},

By modulating the humidity level between the glass layers, the smart window enables the dynamic and coordinated modulation of solar and thermal radiation via the reversible adsorption and desorption of water vapor by the PTFE/PVA composite. The results indicate that the humidity-controlled smart window demonstrates superior capabilities in solar modulation (54.4%) and thermal radiation modulation (51.4%). Statistical analysis reveals that compared to ordinary windows and low emissivity (Low-E) windows, PTFE/PVA windows reduce total annual energy consumption by ≈25% and 40%, respectively. This broadband dynamic continuous regulation mechanism may offer groundbreaking insights into the advancement of smart window technologies.},

Herein, a soft materials-based multimodal sensor probe is introduced, as well as the mechanical and thermal influences to monitor intra-compartmental pressure, tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ), and blood flow simultaneously at a common location within an affected compartment. The system integrates three sensors into a thin, flexible probe capable of real-time, wireless data transmission. The device allows for continuous monitoring with high reproducibility and sensitivity, to enhance diagnostic accuracy relative to current clinical practice, with the potential to early diagnosis of an acute compartment syndrome that requires fasciotomies. Large animal model studies, including short- and intermediate-term reliability assessments, highlight the key engineering features. The results reveal expected inverse relationships between pressure, StO 2 , and flow rate under simulated compartment syndrome conditions. This multimodal approach enhances diagnostic precision, offers real-time insights, and promises to yield improved outcomes through a comprehensive, quantitative diagnosis of compartment syndrome.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive malignancy marked by high morbidity, recurrence, and metastasis, with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. The challenge of early diagnosis and the inefficacy of current therapeutic strategies underscore the urgent need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as critical regulators of post-transcriptional processes and are implicated in cancer progression. Here, the study identifies Staufen Double-Stranded RNA Binding Protein 2 (STAU2) as an oncogenic RBP with high expression in PDAC, which is significantly associated with metastasis. It is demonstrated that STAU2 directly binds and regulates cytoskeletal associated protein Palladin (PALLD) and mediates IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), thereby promoting metastasis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Moreover, a 2′-methoxyethoxy (2′-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting STAU2 is developed, which effectively inhibited downstream targets in vitro and in vivo. STAU2-ASO treatment significantly suppressed PDAC progression and metastasis, with a demonstrated safety profile in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Targeting Nampt to modulate NAD + metabolism and exert antitumor effects has become a research hotspot in the field of cancer metabolism. But early clinical trials have only achieved modest results, primarily due to the need for improved efficacy and the occurrence of severe systemic adverse effects. Therefore, enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing the adverse effects of Nampt inhibitors are urgent challenges. The research reveals that the Nampt inhibitor FK866 can induce ferroptosis in colorectal cancer cells via the NAD + /Stat3/Gpx4 signaling axis. Furthermore, the combination of FK866 and the Stat3 inhibitor C188-9 demonstrates a strong synergistic antitumor effect. Importantly, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hydrogel that encapsulates FK866 and C188-9 for in situ drug delivery, effectively reducing systemic side effects, is developed. Intriguingly, mass cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) analysis indicates that the combined treatment with FK866 and C188-9 exerts antitumor effects by increasing the infiltration of CD8 + T cells and neutrophils into the tumor, as well as enhancing the expression of immune-regulatory molecules, including IFN-γ, IL-10, and perforin. Thus, this localized treatment not only minimizes systemic adverse effects, but also markedly amplifies antitumor efficacy through the modulation of both tumor cells and the tumor immune microenvironment, representing a promising antitumor treatment strategy.},

  abstract     = {MXenes have demonstrated exceptional performance in energy applications, yet their potential in photovoltaic systems, particularly in lead-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs), remains underexplored, with no strategic studies addressing how MXene composition influences critical photovoltaic performance. Here, we present the first strategic screening of M 2 X-type MXenes (including Hf 2 CT x , Zr 2 CT x , Ta 2 CT x , Nb 2 CT x , Mo 2 CT x , and V 2 CT x ) for rational heterojunction design with Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , focusing on the interplay between properties of MXenes and photovoltaic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MXenes can induce substantial electronic states near the Fermi level, creating superior charge transfer paths in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , with V 2 CT x exhibiting the lowest interfacial contact barrier and the highest carrier transfer efficiency. Complementary ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses further demonstrate that the functional termination groups like ─F in MXenes effectively passivate Br vacancies in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , thereby enhancing crystallization and suppressing defect densities. Consequently, the experimental results yielded a trend in line with the calculations, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with V 2 CT x represented a 36% improvement, accompanied by exceptional stability. By establishing quantitative structure-property relationships between MXenes and Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , this work provides a universal materials selection paradigm for developing high-performance, environmentally-friendly photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common digestive tract malignant cancer with high incidence and mortality rate. Many studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs are involved in the progression of various types of tumors. The lncRNA protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P1) promotes the progression of ESCC, but the molecular mechanism behind this is still unclear. In this study, PDIA3P1 is highly expressed in ESCC, produces more lactate by regulating glycolysis, and the increased lactate upregulates lactylation levels to drive tumor progression. Mechanistically, PDIA3P1 competes with miR-152-3p to prevent degradation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, and disrupts the binding between membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) to reduce ubiquitination degradation of HK2, thereby promoting glycolysis. High activity glycolysis produces more lactate, which upregulates the level of histone H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la) and promotes the transcription of target bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7). Functionally, BMP7 is involved in the regulation of ESCC progression by PDIA3P1 both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) mediated m6A modification enhances the stability of PDIA3P1 through Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) dependent recognition. Taken together, these findings reveal the key role of PDIA3P1 regulates glycolysis-H4K8la-BMP7 axis in the progression of ESCC and provides new insights into the interplay between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic regulation.},

Owing to their neighboring position and the diagonal relationship in the periodic table to lithium, Mg 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Li + ions feature commonalities in terms of ionic radius, carried charge, and charge density. The present study aims to shed light on the similarities but also differences of Ca electrolytes and metal anodes in comparison to their Mg and Li counterparts in terms of transport properties and processes at the anode/electrolyte interface, respectively. To ensure comparability, an electrolyte comprising B(hfip) 4 − anions in monoglyme is applied in either case. By executing galvanostatic polarization and pulsing with different separator materials, the separator tortuosity, diffusion coefficient, and transference number are determined. Further, the charge transfer characteristics as well as the adsorption layer and solid electrolyte interphase formation are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The cation charge density was found to be crucial for diffusion and desolvation processes, yet surprisingly, also a cation-dependent separator tortuosity was observed. The study concludes with a recommendation on suitable separators for each metal battery system.},

While crystallographic features of Li influence deposition morphology, the orientation of Li crystals during electrodeposition and their temporal evolution under varying kinetic and interphasial conditions remain unclear. This study investigates Li microstructures during electrodeposition at ultra-high capacities (up to 12 mAh cm⁻ 2 ) and over repeated cycling, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the microstructural evolution of Li depends on the interplay between interphasial properties and deposition kinetics. A layer-by-layer epitaxial Li growth with a coherent lattice orientation is achievable under homogeneous interphase and slow deposition kinetics. However, at higher capacities or extended cycling, deterioration of interphase homogeneity disrupts crystal matching, resulting in island-like deposits with randomly oriented single-crystalline grains. In contrast, an inhomogeneous interphase and faster kinetics lead to whisker-like Li deposits. These results demonstrate that while cohesive interactions between depositing Li crystals can result in isolated single-crystalline grains, maintaining interphase homogeneity and stability is essential to enable coherent lattice matching for layer-by-layer epitaxial growth. This study reveals Li microstructural evolution and offers insights for designing stable interphases and optimizing conditions for durable, high-capacity LMBs.},

In this study, MgO-based composites with high thermal conductivities are fabricated to achieve excellent thermal performances by optimizing the heat-transfer path. These composites are produced using a protein foaming method, which effectively forms interconnected ceramic-filler networks. Additionally, the liquid phase formed during the sintering of MgO enhances the bonding with the epoxy matrix, thereby improving the thermal conductivity of the composites. As a result, the composites with 54.64 vol% MgO achieve a high thermal conductivity of 17.19 W m −1 K −1 , which is 101 times higher than that of pure epoxy, 3.7 times higher than that of randomly dispersed composites, and even superior to that of nitride-based composites. Moreover, the composites also exhibited a low thermal-expansion coefficient (27.76 ppm °C −1 ) and high electrical-insulation strength (51.51 kV mm −1 ), ensuring good thermal and electrical performance for electronic-packaging applications.

  abstract     = {Developing high damping alloys (HDAs) with large elastic strain has attracted growing attention due to the increasing demand for energy absorption with overload reliability and reusability. However, damping capacity inherently conflicts with elasticity, because the former requires a liable movement of crystal defects while the latter opposite. To deal with the damping-elasticity paradox, the advantage of pseudobinary eutectic reaction and rapid cooling of laser powder bed fusion is taken to fabricate a bulk NiTiSn nanocomposite with a two-level hierarchical structure. The first-level architecture is composed of martensitic NiTi nanolamellae and reinforced Ti 3 Sn nanolamellae. In addition to lattice strain matching and lamellar boundary strengthening, a novel mechanism of martensite reorientation mediated by reversible stress-induced detwinning-twinning is activated to generate large elastic strain. A high density of nanotwins and nanodomains within NiTi nanolamellae constitute the second-level architecture, which provides pronounced internal friction for high damping capacity. As a result, our NiTiSn nanocomposite exhibits a record-high integration of damping capacity (tanδ > 0.10) and elastic strain (exceeding 4.5%), as well as superb stability under cyclic overload. This research not only represents a major breakthrough in achieving HDAs with outstanding damping and elastic strain but also offers a novel paradigm for high-performance functional and structural materials.},

A representative immunosuppressive mechanism is the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells with the help of exosomal PD-L1. Another common mechanism is to promote tumor metastasis by promoting the seeding and growth of metastatic cancer cells in distant organs. Therefore, the removal of TExo can provide many benefits for the treatment of cancer patients. Here, a bio orthogonal r eaction- d riven e xosome e limination (Biordee) strategy that promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis by using IgG Fc to engineer endogenous TExo (TExo-Fc) was developed. The Biordee strategy effectively reduced the levels of TExo in the circulatory system by leveraging the interaction of IgG Fc with FcγRII/III receptors of macrophage, which further broke down the body's immunosuppression and enhanced the immune response after chemotherapy. Moreover, the Biordee strategy inhibited breast cancer liver metastases, which were enhanced by promoting chemotherapy-induced TExo release.

However, their applicability to animals has remained a challenge. Herein, the first case of engineering polyploid genomes with desirable traits via unisexual–sexual reproduction transition is provided. First, a group of genome-reconstructed amphitriploids (GR-A3n) is generated involving unisexual gynogenetic Carassius gibelio , sexual C. auratus , and sexual C. cuvieri . Then, we found that the gynogenesis ability have transferred from C. gibelio to some of the GR-A3n females. This study subsequently established three GR-A3n clones with distinct herpesvirus resistance and in which differential transcriptome profiles are characterized in two main hematopoietic organs. Most genes of the hemoglobin metabolism pathway is found to exhibit high expression levels, as in C. cuvieri , which led to efficient hemoglobin biosynthesis and blood oxygen homeostasis during infection, thereby resulting in strong herpesvirus resistance. Furthermore, this study determined the resistant and susceptible haplotypes derived from chromosome 12B of C. cuvieri , which should be responsible for resistance differences between GR-A3n clones. Overall, this study establishes an approach for genetic improvement through polyploid genome design in animals.},

  abstract     = {Infiltrating monocytes can exert both protective and pathogenic effects during central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. However, the metabolic mechanisms that govern these divergent roles remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and metabolic flow analysis of brain and bone marrow (BM) is used to map the metabolic signatures of monocyte-derived cells (MCs) during lethal West Nile virus encephalitis. Trajectory analysis shows that BM monocytes progress through three metabolic profiles before migrating to the brain and differentiating into a pro-inflammatory HIF1-α⁺ MC population. This population further diverges into an inflammatory, iNOS⁺ MC subset with high glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, and a protective, glycolytically quiescent, antigen-presenting MC subset. Daily in vivo glycolysis inhibition reduces neuroinflammation and disease signs without increasing viral load. This effect does not reflect a broad reduction in myelopoiesis but rather a selective decrease in iNOS⁺ MC migration, revealing distinct glycolytic dependencies among MC subsets. HIF1-α activity remains independent of glycolysis, enabling functional differentiation of antigen-presenting MCs without impairing antiviral responses by cervical lymph node T cells. This study identifies key metabolic drivers of MC function in viral CNS disease, in which selective metabolic reprogramming reduces severe neuroinflammation, demonstrating a promising therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic H 2 O 2 synthesis from water and oxygen by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted much attention currently. However, conventional COFs often suffer from insufficient stability and activity due to the unclear structure-activity relationship mechanisms. Herein, a series of quinoline-linked COFs-R (-R = -OH, -OMe, -H, -Br, -CN) synthesized via multi-component reactions (MCRs) is reported to systematically modulate their pore microenvironments and enhance photocatalytic performance. Experimental results reveal that the electron-donating capacity of substituents significantly enhances charge separation efficiency, with H 2 O 2 production activity exhibiting a negative correlation to the Hammett parameters ( σ p ) of the -R groups. Notably, the COF-OH and COF-OMe, bearing the strong electron-donating group, achieve a remarkable H 2 O 2 generation rate of 4458 and 4138 µmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ in the pure water system. Theoretical calculations confirm that substituents optimize the collective donor structure within the π-conjugated triazine framework, boosting photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the universal Hammett relationship observed in benzylamine coupling reactions establishes a critical structure-activity model for rational COF design. This work provides fundamental insights into the microenvironment engineering of COFs for efficient H 2 O 2 production and advances the development of sustainable photocatalytic materials.},

  abstract     = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) dominate the tumor stroma in colorectal cancer (CRC), fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment that supports tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting CAF-derived cytokines and secreted proteins offers potential new avenues for CRC treatment. Here, vitronectin (VTN) is identified as a significantly up-regulated gene in CAFs, correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, through multi-dataset analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence. Comprehensive analyses, including cytometry by time -of- flight (CyTOF), in vitro co-culture assays, transgenic mouse models, and azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced CRC models, demonstrate that VTN enhances CRC proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. CyTOF analysis shows a reduced proportion of M2-type macrophages in fibroblast-specific VTN knockout mice ( Vtn fl/fl S100a4-Cre + ), with VTN promoting M2 macrophage polarization in vitro. Mechanistically, VTN upregulates SLC6A8 expression in CRC cells and macrophages by enhancing FAK phosphorylation, which increases creatine and ATP uptake, promoting cancer progression and macrophage polarization. Targeted VTN knockout in fibroblasts significantly improves the efficacy of immunotherapies and reduces CRC progression. These findings highlight the dual role of CAF-derived VTN in driving CRC malignancy and modulating immune responses, positioning VTN as a promising therapeutic target in CRC management.},

This study presents a hardware-implemented RC system utilizing multifunctional memristors fabricated using a single process. By leveraging a ferroelectric-based memristor (FM) as a volatile reservoir layer and a redox-based memristor (RM) as a non-volatile readout layer, seamless integration without additional fabrication steps is achieved. The dual-functional memristor structure enables electrical conversion from FM to RM, enhancing system scalability and versatility. Comprehensive electrical measurements, including low-frequency noise analysis and weight update linearity evaluation, validate the memristors’ performance. Potentiation and depression processes achieve a linearity factor improvement to ensure precise synaptic weight tuning, with cycle-to-cycle variation <2.3%. Additionally, the ferroelectric-based memristor exhibits a cycle-to-cycle variation of 3.52%, maintaining distinct reservoir states with minimal overlap. Offline training demonstrates a high classification accuracy of 93.3% on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, while online training achieves an accuracy of 88.2% with incremental pulse schemes, surpassing the accuracy of identical pulse schemes (65.1%).

BRD4 plays a pivotal role during embryogenesis and cancer development, but its function in modulating β-cell differentiation remains unknown. In this study, multiple models including calorie restriction db/db mouse, long-term and acute conditional knockout mouse, and human islet organoids are adopted to assess BRD4 function in β cells. Two hundred twenty-two young patients with diabetes are also recruited for whole exome sequencing (WES) to screen for BRD4 mutations. This study shows that BRD4 expression is significantly reduced in human diabetic β cells while significantly increased after calorie restriction in the diabetic mouse. β cell differentiation is impaired after long-term and acute Brd4 knockout. BRD4 knockdown in human islet organoids results in the loss of differentiation and reduction of insulin synthesis. It is found that p.R749C can significantly affect BRD4 signaling and might play roles in diabetes development in patients. This study also shows that ATF5 is a direct target of the BRD4 pathway in β cells. Targeting BRD4-mediated regulatory networks may hold promise for developing novel therapeutic strategies to maintain the differentiated state of β cells.},

The separation of orbital and spin components is proposed as the most current idea. However, it remains extremely difficult to develop studies sensitive to both types of AM using direct wave field measurements. Here, theoretical explanation and experimental proof of the acoustic spin-orbit AM conversion are reported. A formulaic description of spin-orbit AM conversion in coupled fields of two nonparaxial Bessel acoustic vortices is given by a thorough theoretical derivation. Experimental results of wave field measurements provide compelling evidence for spin-orbit AM conversion via passive artificial structures. Based on this conversion, contactless high-resolution manipulation of micro-objects is further achieved, as demonstrated by the controlled rotation of Rayleigh particles and their translation along a circular trajectory. This work provides deeper insights into the AM physics of classical waves and has significant implications for acoustic sensing, acoustic imaging, and particle manipulation based on acoustic radiation force or torque.},

  abstract     = {Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) present considerable potential as next-generation logic switches owing to their ultra-thin structure and exceptional electrical properties. Although recent advancements have achieved impressive direct current (DC) performance in individual devices, research on the architectural design of CNT-based transistors remains limited. This gap is critical, as device architecture directly influences power consumption and switching speed at the circuit level. In particular, the balance between parasitic capacitance and resistance, key factors determining resistive-capacitive (RC) delay, has not been thoroughly addressed. In this study, top-gate CNT metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) that employ a novel low-κ extension doping technique are presented. This approach utilizes a stacked SiO x /AlF x layer (κ = 3.9 and 2.5) to enhance device performance while minimizing parasitic capacitance between the top gate and contact metal. The proposed approach improves the driving current by 8.4 times and reduces the total resistance by 85% when compared with CNT MOSFETs with undoped extensions. The doping level is tunable from 0.5 nm −1 to 0.59 nm −1 , with electrostatic doping driven by negative charges at the SiO x ​/AlF x interface. The benchmarking results demonstrate the record-low κ-value and physical thickness presented by the proposed approach, highlighting its potential for high-performance, high-speed applications.},

  abstract     = {High energy-density Li metal batteries with improved safety and cyclic performance can be achieved by adopting solid polymer electrolytes. However, current solid polymer electrolytes show inferior room-temperature ionic conductivity and Li-ion transference number (t Li+ ), impeding their practical applications. Herein, a 3-(pyridinium)propane-1-sulfonate zwitterionic covalent organic framework (PSZ-COF) incorporating a eutectic-like ion-conductive phase is prepared by making a complex with N -methyl- N -propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Pyrrol-FSI) and Li salts in its channels as a solid electrolyte (eutectic PSZ-COF). The eutectic PSZ-COF possesses a zwitterionic Li-salt-dissociating mode, a Pyrrol-FSI Li-cation-transporting carrier, and a pyridinium anion-holding trap in the ordered channels, providing a high ionic conductivity (0.127 mS cm −1 ) and t Li+ (0.62) at room temperature. Moreover, the eutectic PSZ-COF can suppress Li dendrites and drive a LiF/Li 3 N-rich solid electrolyte interface layer on a Li anode. Computational simulations reveal that the time-evolved average distance and hoping distance of Li + ions are significantly reduced in the eutectic PSZ-COF, allowing their facile migration. The all-solid-state Li metal batteries bearing eutectic PSZ-COF with a lithium iron phosphate(LFP) cathode (2.0 mg cm − 2 ) exhibit an initial capacity of 153.3 mAh g −1 , 99.9% Coulombic efficiency, and 100% capacity retention over 150 cycles at room temperature.

However, the limited penetration depth of conventional ultra violet (UV)-visible irradiation and the tumor hypoxia microenvironment significantly constrain the efficacy of immune-regulatory PDT. Here, a mitochondria-targeting enhanced nanoplatform (NZ @TG ) is reported, activated by near-infrared (NIR) light-driven PDT, to address these challenges and amplify systemic anti-tumor immunity. This nanoplatform employs an interfacial lanthanide-organic triplet photosensation mechanism to realize localized oxidative damage of oxygen-rich mitochondria under NIR irradiation. Simultaneously, the exacerbated hypoxia induced by PDT activates a TH302 prodrug, resulting in cell cycle arrest in highly proliferative tumor cells. These combined effects trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to activate immune responses. This approach demonstrates significantly enhanced tumor ablation in deep-seated lesions in orthotopic liver tumor models and induces long-term anti-tumor immune memory. Moreover, the NIR-PDT-induced immune activation markedly improves the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy efficacy. This strategy offers a robust modality for immune activation in cancer therapy, paving the way for effective treatment of deep-seated tumors and preventing recurrence.},

Under chemical pressure, Eu 2+ migrates from Ba 2+ to Na + lattice sites in NRBBO, leading to a gradual decrease in the FWHM, making it more competitive for display applications. The existence of chemical pressure in the lattice is demonstrated through a high-pressure spectrum. The migration of Eu 2+ lattice sites under chemical pressure is verified by XRD refinement, low-temperature spectrum and EXAFS. NRBBO: 0.11Eu 2+ can be effectively excited by NUV and blue light, with an emission peak at 512 nm and a FWHM of 54 nm.

  abstract     = {Understanding the initial weeks of human development remains challenging due to ethical concerns and the restricted availability of human embryos. Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived epiblast models mimicking gastrulation processes have sparked significant interest in bridging this gap. However, as a newly emerging field, bioengineered models show limited production throughput and complexity in recapitulating epiblasts’ disc-shaped morphogenesis. Here, a well-defined laminin/alginate bioink to create epiblast-like models from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using electro-assisted bioprinting is proposed. This approach enables the generation of large-scale hiPSC-laden microgels that not only facilitate mass transfer but also mimic the structural characteristics of early embryos, which allow hiPSCs to self-organize into disc-like epiblast models with consistent morphology and phenotype. With adaptability to human embryonic stem cells, this method demonstrates the versatility of engineering reproducible epiblast-like models using various PSC lineages. Importantly, the bioactive components and physical confinement provided by the bioink, and the endogenous regulation of the WNT signaling pathway, contribute to disc-like morphogenesis, recapitulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition critical in the gastrulation process, and generation of the posterior epiblast population, directing the mass production of manipulable embryonic models for studying the spatiotemporal events and possible defects in early human development.},

This study demonstrates that GSDMD-CT acts as a negative regulator that suppresses IFN-I signaling during viral infection. Mechanistically, GSDMD-CT, released upon virus infection, interacts separately with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and tank-binding kinase (TBK1), promoting the selective autophagic degradation of RIG-I via K48-linked polyubiquitination at Lys181 and TBK1 via K27-linked polyubiquitination at Lys487 by the E3 ligase TRIM28, which serves as a recognition signal for the cargo receptor NDP52 and TOLLIP, respectively. Moreover, the P414, Q416, and E459 amino sites are crucial for GSDMD-CT in counteracting antiviral responses. The findings highlight the role of GSDMD-CT in inhibiting antiviral immunity, providing insights into how viruses manipulate host defense mechanisms to enhance infection.},

  abstract     = {The core challenge in osteochondral tissue engineering is achieving the dual objectives of precise vascularization regulation and effective interface integration. Current tissue-engineering strategies have limitations in addressing these challenges. This study has regulated BMSC differentiation by optimizing the GT/PCL ratio and topological structure of nanofibrous materials, systematically comparing three different materials (r5G5P, a5G5P, and a7G3P), and employing a “rolling and folding” method in order to construct BMSC-NFMC composite structures. This approach achieves effective vascular isolation between the bone and cartilage layers. After implantation in nude mice, the a5G5P group exhibits distinct natural osteochondral tissue structural characteristics, which become more stable after 8 weeks of in vivo culture. Transcriptome sequencing analysis reveals that under ischemic conditions, the a5G5P group effectively regulates cartilage formation by inhibiting the Rap1 pathway and subsequently activating the ERK pathway. In rabbit articular osteochondral defect repair experiments, the a5G5P group successfully regenerates complete articular osteochondral structures similar to those of the adjacent natural tissues. The BMSC-NFMC structure can be used for both local and long-segment osteochondral defect repair, providing broader possibilities for clinical applications.},

Here, the proteome of bacteria evolved to overproduce cellulose is studied and its effect on the structure and mechanics of the resulting cellulose pellicles is investigated. Proteomic analysis reveals that the protein landscape of the evolved bacteria shows pronounced differences from that of native microorganisms.

Therefore, here, a novel molecular representation learning method is constructed, Q-GEM, incorporating quantum and geometric structural information enhancement, based on the quantum chemical property database QuanDB and SSL methods. Q-GEM comprises a GNN embedded with the molecular electronic and complete 3D geometrical structural information as well as several well-designed multiscale SSL tasks, achieving superior absolute molecular conformation prediction and conformational discrimination. The Q-GEM achieved state-of-the-art performance in 12 out of 13 prediction tasks on the MoleculeNet dataset, with an average performance improvement of 3.3% and 2.0% for classification and regression prediction tasks, respectively. Moreover, an average performance improvement of 5.2% is achieved in three localized quantum chemical properties, fully demonstrating the excellent performance of Q-GEM in distinguishing molecular electronic structures.

Due to their simple shape, flexibility, and conformability, HFDEAs are promising candidates for complex applications within soft robotics. This paper offers a comprehensive comparison between the actuation behavior of planar and HFDEAs using both analytical and numerical models. An electro-mechanical model establishes analytical correlations between the applied voltage and resulting strain. The results from the simplified model are subsequently compared with a numerical model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where simulations are run in more realistic conditions. Supporting experiments are conducted on HFDEAs with different geometries to validate the model. A geometric factor, β, is introduced to account for the influence of geometric parameters on actuator performance. The results show that HFDEAs exhibit higher strain compared to planar films. Among the different fiber geometries, those with smaller internal diameters and thinner walls exhibit higher axial strain and holding force while using the least amount of material. This study highlights the advantages of hollow fiber DEAs compared to their planar counterparts, especially in applications where lighter, more efficient structures with greater strain capabilities are essential.},

However, applying memristive computing in advanced network structures, such as deep neural networks and multimodal networks, is inefficient because the partial analog computing requires frequently exchanging data between analog and digital domains. Here, a perovskite memristive computing unit with flexible reconfigurability and desired nonlinearity through fully vapor deposition is reported. It enables performing all the mathematical operations necessary for Transformer ANNs completely in the analog domain. A prototypical attention module is implemented by combining cells configured in different operators of dynamic MAC, activation, and softmax functions. By cascading the modules in a multi-layer Transformer network, a neuromorphic engine is fabricated and tested RGB-T tracking and visual question answering tasks, fully considering device non-idealities. It is found that the network performance is close to that of operating on a graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated workstation, but it consumes only 1.7% energy and increases power efficiency by 58 times.

  abstract     = {Bacterial endophthalmitis is an ophthalmological emergency that can lead to permanent blindness, and high-efficiency therapeutic strategies that can completely eradicate pathogens within a short timeframe are needed. However, intrinsic limitations of this disease, such as low administration frequency and dosage, render most currently available nano-antibacterial strategies inapplicable. To address this challenge, a bio-targeted catalytic strategy that is based on a bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst (MoS 2 /Fe@mercaptophenylboronic acid@hyaluronic acid, MFBH) and suitable for treating bacterial endophthalmitis is proposed. The results show that MFBH exhibits high-efficiency peptidoglycan-targeted catalytic antibacterial capacity against both standard and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus . Notably, the in vivo results demonstrate that MFBH achieves effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis at an extremely low dose (≈4 µg kg −1 ) via a single intravitreal injection without causing retinal damage. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of MFBH is comparable to that of vancomycin. Mechanistic analysis reveals that MFBH induces enhanced ferroptosis-like bacterial killing by accelerating reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Further investigations show that the generation of abundant ROS is closely associated with the sulfur vacancies and exposed of reactive Mo 4+ on the surface of the prepared artificial biocatalyst. In summary, this bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst provides a promising strategy for treating endophthalmitis.},

  abstract     = {Liver fibrosis is a severe liver disease directly linked to chronic inflammation, in which hepatic macrophages play a key role. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is the receptor of nutrient-sensing hormone ghrelin that has essential functions in metabolism, inflammation, and wound-healing. However, the role of GHSR in liver fibrosis is unknown. This study uses a carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced liver fibrosis mouse model to investigate the role of macrophage GHSR in liver fibrosis. CCl 4 induces macrophage accumulation and inflammatory responses, noticeably increases GHSR expression in the liver. It is found that macrophage Ghsr deletion ( Ghsr-MϕKO ) attenuates CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis and inflammation, showing reduced hepatic monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and suppressed proinflammatory responses. In macrophages, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression is positively correlated with GHSR expression. GHSR-associated TGF-β1 in macrophages activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by promoting the crosstalk between macrophages and HSCs. Macrophage GHSR controls inflammation and TGF-β1 expression via protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated Forkhead box protein O 1 (Foxo1) phosphorylation at S273; Foxo1-S273D mutation, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of Foxo1 at S273, shows exacerbated CCl 4 -induced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, targeting the macrophage GHSR−Foxo1 signaling may provide a new strategy to treat liver fibrosis.},

This study demonstrates a breakthrough in overcoming the conventional fatigue limit ceiling in high-strength as-quenched martensitic steel by enhancing resistance to crack initiation. In the as-heat-treated state, high-angle boundaries with large elastic misfits and plastic incompatibility served as precursory sites for intrusions/extrusions (these are defined as “crack embryos”), eventually leading to fatigue crack initiation. Remarkably, after the pre-fatigue training, surface crack initiation is entirely suppressed, doubling the fatigue limit with minimal change in tensile strength. A novel concept of “crack embryo engineering” is introduced, which targets the prevention of crack embryo formation by extracting intrinsic microstructural self-optimization against fatigue deformation: macroscopic hardness homogenization and selective nano-hardening of the precursory sites. This self-optimization strategy offers a versatile approach to improving fatigue limit in general steels, providing an effective alternative to tempering heat treatment that inevitably sacrifices tensile strength.},

This study aims to develop and validate a Vision Transformer (ViT) model based on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to classify HER2-zero, -low, and -positive breast cancer patients and to explore its interpretability. The model is trained and validated on early enhancement MRI images from 708 patients in the FUSCC cohort and tested on 80 and 101 patients in the GFPH cohort and FHCMU cohort, respectively. The ViT model achieves AUCs of 0.80, 0.73, and 0.71 in distinguishing HER2-zero from HER2-low/positive tumors across the validation set of the FUSCC cohort and the two external cohorts. Furthermore, the model effectively classifies HER2-low and HER2-positive cases, with AUCs of 0.86, 0.80, and 0.79. Transcriptomics analysis identifies significant biological differences between HER2-low and HER2-positive patients, particularly in immune-related pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, Cox regression analysis demonstrates that the prediction score is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 2.52; p = 0.007). These findings provide a non-invasive approach for accurately predicting HER2 expression, enabling more precise patient stratification to guide personalized treatment strategies.

CDSP NPs can be utilized for near-infrared (NIR) afterglow imaging-guided precise removal of breast cancer, featuring a long lifetime (>2 h), deep tissue penetration (>13 mm), and a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, 103.9), thereby effectively preventing cancer recurrence. Additionally, the combined treatment of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy substantially enhances tumor regression, demonstrating the tremendous potential of CDSP NPs for synergistic cancer treatment. This study proposes a straightforward but efficient model to build a nanoplatform integrating diagnosis and treatment, which is utilized for image-guided surgical navigation and effective tumor treatment.},

  abstract     = {Icephobic surfaces offer a passive protection strategy against icing hazards in industrial applications. However, the improvement of surface icephobicity is normally accompanied by a compromise in mechanical properties and restrains the practical application of current icephobic surfaces/materials. Here, a generic strategy for icephobic material design is reported to address this conflict through interfacial elastic instability prompted by the synergistic integration of fibrous construction (FC) frameworks with icephobic polymers. The FC-based material structures could induce periodically localised/amplified stress at the ice/solid interface, leading to interfacial elastic instability and facilitating effective ice detachment. Low ice adhesion strength is achieved, while the tensile strength of the materials is enhanced by 19 times more than the polymer matrix due to the reinforcement from the FC frameworks. Based on the serrated features of the shear forces and numerically simulated interfacial stress distribution, a new theoretical model is established to interpret the nature of interfacial elastic instability and undulatory interfacial stress. This work provides fundamental insights for designing high-performance icephobic materials that transcend traditional performance trade-offs, advancing both surface science and materials for practical ice mitigation.},

  abstract     = {Brain organoid technology has revolutionized the ability to model human neurodevelopment in vitro. However, current techniques remain limited by their reliance on simplified endothelial cell populations. Multi-Region Brain Organoids (MRBOs) are engineered that integrate cerebral, mid/hindbrain, and complex endothelial organoids into one structure. Unlike earlier approaches based on isolated Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, the endothelial organoids contain diverse vascular cell types, including progenitors, mature endothelial cells, pericytes, proliferating angiogenic cells, and stromal cells. The strategy employs sequential modulation of key developmental pathways to generate individual organoids, followed by optimized fusion conditions that maintain regional identities while supporting cellular integration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals that MRBOs develop discrete neural populations specific to each brain region alongside specialized endothelial populations that establish paracrine signaling networks. Integration analysis with human fetal brain data shows that MRBOs contribute to 80% of cellular clusters found in human fetal brain tissue (Carnegie stages 12–16). CellChat analysis identifies 13 previously uncharacterized endothelial-neural signaling interactions. Endothelial-derived factors are uncovered that support intermediate progenitor populations during hindbrain development, but not cerebral development, revealing a role for endothelial populations in regional brain patterning. This platform enables matching of multiple developmental regions while incorporating endothelial components, providing opportunities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders with disrupted neural-endothelial interactions.},

  abstract     = {Nitric oxide (NO), a pivotal redox signaling molecule, coordinates plant development and immune responses through S -nitrosylation-mediated protein modification. While NO-dependent S -nitrosylation fine-tunes immune responses, whether pathogens hijack this process to subvert plant immunity remains unclear. Here it is shown that S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which maintains NO homeostasis by degrading S -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), positively regulates tomato resistance to Phytophthora capsici . Active-site mutations in GSNOR abolished its function in plant defense. Remarkably, GSNOR is manipulated by PcRD18, which is an RxLR effector of P. capsici that is involved in virulence of this oomycete pathogen. PcRD18 elevates the cellular NO content and S -nitrosylation levels by dually inhibiting GSNOR activity and promoting its autophagy-mediated degradation via enhanced ATG8c interaction. Structure analysis reveals critical PcRD18-GSNOR interaction interfaces and mutations in these sites of PcRD18 abolish its ability to interact with GSNOR, thereby blocking the effector's ability to elevate NO levels, suppress the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and enhance virulence. GSNOR mutations disrupting PcRD18 binding produced a mutant form of GSNOR enhancing Phytophthora resistance. These findings unveil a pathogen strategy to subvert NO homeostasis through effector-mediated hijacking of GSNOR and suggest that engineering the host-pathogen interface to disrupt the interaction between GSNOR and PcRD18 will enhance crop disease resistance.},

  abstract     = {Radiation-induced damage to normal tissue seriously disrupts the execution of radiotherapy (RT) and therefore attenuates its efficacy. Exploring new strategies to enhance the efficacy and reduce toxicity of RT has great clinical importance. Here, a PD-L1 affibody (Z PD-L1 ) grafted Janus Ag/Ag 2 S nanoarchitectures is developed as “reactive oxygen species lever” to enhance radiocatalysis and relieve radiation enteritis. The nanoplatform can achieve abundant energy deposition in the form of high-energy electrons within tumors upon X-ray exposure. Subsequently, the transfer of electrons from Ag 2 S to Ag moiety enables effective electron–hole pair separation, which greatly improves the radiocatalysis efficiency in generating highly toxic hydroxyl radical (•OH). Due to the specific binding to tumor PD-L1, Z PD-L1 endows this nanoplatform with efficient tumor targeting and meanwhile reduces immune suppression of T cells by achieving PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, intensifying RT-induced immunologic cell death. Notably, the presence of the Ag moiety allows the nanoplatform to act as an H 2 O 2 scavenger in intestinal tissues during metabolism, effectively relieving radiation enteritis. Moreover, systemic administration of the nanoplatform coupled with Mn-DOTA can guide RT timing selection by magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, this nanoplatform can substantially improve RT effectiveness with reduced radiation enteritis, demonstrating considerable potential in tumor RT.},

This integration enables the resulting TP photodetector to achieve a higher photocurrent and a more linear power dependence compared to the reference device with a nonresonant configuration. The enhancement is confined to the designed resonant energy, while photons with off-resonance energies are fully reflected, making the TP photodetector an ideal candidate for compact and efficient image sensors, eliminating the need for additional filters or bulky microlenses for color discrimination or photon collection. Furthermore, the photocurrent generated by the TP photodetector can be regulated by varying light pulse stimulations, enabling it to mimic the synaptic dynamics of the human brain. By integrating the functions of perception, processing, and memorization of visual images, its potential for facial recognition through simulation based on a 64 × 64 array of TP photodetectors under the artificial neural network-based weight-update expectation thresholding model is demonstrated. These findings mark a significant step forward in utilizing all-inorganic perovskite materials for compact, color-filter-free image sensors and open new avenues for photonic neural computations on a single platform.},

  abstract     = {While previous studies have primarily examined the impacts of singular interventions on GHG emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removals (CDR), few studies explore complementarities and antagonisms when multiple interventions are simultaneously operationalized. Here, the aim is to examine how stacking of two pathways for mitigation–CDR, via soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and GHG emissions avoidance via antimethanogenic feed additives–impacts net GHG emissions associated with sheep production. A nonlinear programing approach is invoked to elicit optimal combinations of grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives to maximize farm profit and/or minimize net GHG emissions. It is shown that stacking multiple interventions realizes that greater abatement and profit do any singular intervention. Adoption of 3-NOP feed supplement with 15- and 30-paddock high stocking rate systems is the most prospective stacked intervention for concurrent profit maximization and emissions minimization. It is contended that (1) increasing payments for farming of carbon and ecosystems services relative to that of wool and meat will stimulate participation in carbon markets, (2) economics of participation in carbon markets tend to be more favorable for larger farms than smaller farms due to economies of scale and (3) adoption of optimal grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives can realize more profit from sheep production and carbon farming than enterprises that only derive income from sheep production.},

The results demonstrated that podocyte-specific RIPK3-KO alleviated albuminuria, mesangial matrix proliferation, foot process fusion, and podocyte loss in DKD mice. Additionally, podocyte RIPK3 is upregulated in renal biopsies with DKD and expression is negatively correlated with albuminuria. In vitro, knockdown of RIPK3 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibition with GSK'872 prevented podocyte injury. RNA sequencing of mouse podocytes revealed that the knockdown of RIPK3 can alleviate HG-induced activation of the NF-κB-related inflammatory pathways. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 by GSK'872 alleviated podocyte damage, and reduced proteinuria in DKD mice. Overall, these results uncovered a novel role of podocyte RIPK3 in promoting podocyte injury and DKD progression by regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling independent of necroptosis, offering novel insights and potential therapeutic strategies for DKD management.},

  abstract     = {Dysregulated RNA splicing has emerged as a pervasive yet understudied feature of cancer. The small GTPase RAC1 undergoes splicing changes in multiple cancers. However, the in vivo functional disparities between the two major RAC1 isoforms, RAC1B and the canonical RAC1A, and their therapeutic implications in cancer remain largely unexplored. Here, RAC1B is found to be significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, particularly in those harboring EGFR mutations. Through isoform-specific overexpression and depletion assays in murine and cellular models of EGFR -mutant LUAD, it is revealed that RAC1B, but not RAC1A, promotes LUAD cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, RAC1B stabilizes EGFR by inhibiting its lysosome trafficking and degradation. This function is mediated by the specific binding of RAC1B to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GDS1, which activates RAC1B. The splicing factor RBM10 which is frequently mutated in LUAD is further identified as a negative regulator of RAC1B . Importantly, utilizing LUAD patient-derived organoid and xenograft models, it is demonstrated that targeting RAC1B potently suppresses tumor growth and enhances the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. Together, the findings delineate functional differences and underlying mechanisms of RAC1 isoforms in LUAD tumorigenesis, highlighting a promising therapeutic route via targeting RAC1B for lung cancer.},

Although promising, the lack of appropriate structural design strategy and limitation of sensing performance in the clinical samples remain challenging for the practical application of nanozymes. Herein, a novel copper silicate nanozyme (CSHSs-Ar) with enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity is synthesized through a facile in situ valence-engineered approach. After the optimization of synthesis, the resultant CSHSs-Ar nanozymes containing nearly 60% of Cu + hold a higher peroxidase-like catalytic activity and a better catalytic specificity than the other two derivatives (CSHSs and CSHSs-air). Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that CSHSs-Ar nanozymes are more beneficial toward the activation of H 2 O 2 compared with CSHSs and CSHSs-air. On this basis, the well-developed CSHSs-Ar nanozyme-involved system is employed as an efficient colorimetric sensor for the detection of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) and prediction for periodontitis. Moreover, several visual molecular logic gates are explored as a proof of concept to the application of CSHSs-Ar nanozymes with superior peroxidase-like catalytic activity.

  abstract     = {Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. During I/R, the accumulation and oxidation of succinate contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, worsening tissue damage. Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3 (HINT3) is identified as a regulator of mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte survival during I/R. In a mouse I/R model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model, it shows that HINT3 expression is downregulated after I/R. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of HINT3 exacerbates myocardial injury, impairs cardiac function, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, whereas HINT3 overexpression mitigates these effects. Mechanistically, HINT3 interacts with succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA), suppresses HDAC1 expression, and prevents SDHA deacetylation at K335, reducing SDH activity and mitochondrial ROS production. These findings highlight the HINT3-HDAC1-SDHA axis as a key pathway in mitochondrial regulation, offering new insights and therapeutic targets for myocardial reperfusion injury.},

  abstract     = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory lung injury for which effective therapeutic agents are lacking. Excessive endothelial cell (EC) activation is a critical trigger of inflammation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as prominent regulators of inflammatory responses. The previous study identified secretory autophagosomes (SAPs), a novel class of EVs, as a prognostic marker in ARDS, raising questions of whether and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Here, it is shown that inflamed macrophage-derived SAPs (MSAPs) exacerbate lung injury by weakening the role of ECs as gatekeepers of immune cell transport within the lung. Bioinformatics and functional studies reveal that tRF-5004b is a key molecule of MSAPs in mediating endothelial activation. Mechanically, tRF-5004b directly interacts with the nuclear transporter KPNA2, thereby facilitating the association between KPNA2 and the transcription factor p65. This interaction enhances p65 nuclear translocation, a process implicated in EC activation. Additionally, the level of tRF-5004b is positively correlated with the severity of ARDS, and patients with high tRF-5004b levels have a poor prognosis. Overall, it is found that tRF-5004b-enriched SAPs induce acute lung injury by promoting p65 nuclear translocation to activate ECs, suggesting that tRF-5004b may be a novel therapeutic target for ARDS.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in proteomics sequencing have significantly enhanced our ability to explore cell-type-specific signatures within complex tissues, providing critical insights into disease mechanisms. However, current proteomic technologies often suffer from low resolution, resulting in the mixing of multiple cell types during profiling. To address this limitation, cell-type deconvolution methods are developed to infer cellular composition from proteomic data. While most existing deconvolution methods are focused on transcriptomics, their application to proteomics is hindered by the weak correlation and divergent quantification between transcriptome and proteome data. Although a few proteomic-specific deconvolution methods are recently emerged, they still exhibit limited capability and performance, partly because they only extract shared information from individual samples while ignoring higher-order relationships between them. Here, GraphDEC is proposed, a novel graph neural network-based method for dec iphering cell type proportions in proteomic profiling data. GraphDEC begins by simulating bulk samples from single-cell proteomic data to create reference data, which is then used to infer cell types in target datasets. Specifically, GraphDEC employs an autoencoder to extract low-dimensional representations from both reference and target proteomic data, enabling the construction of similarity relationships among samples. These relationships, combined with proteomic data, are processed by a graph neural network that integrates a multi-channel mechanism and a hybrid neighborhood-aware approach to learn highly effective representations. To optimize the model, GraphDEC utilizes multiple loss functions, including triplet loss, domain adaptation loss, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, ensuring robust performance and mitigating batch effects. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that GraphDEC achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic proteomic datasets from different sequencing technologies and real-world spatial proteomic datasets. Furthermore, GraphDEC exhibits strong generalization capabilities, showing high efficiency when applied to cross-species proteomic data and even transcriptomics.},

  abstract     = {Plasma volume fluctuations limit the utility of circulating lipidomics in chronic heart failure (CHF). In contrast, red blood cell (RBC) membrane lipidomics may serve as stable biomarkers that are unaffected by plasma volume changes. Two cohorts are included to investigate the association between RBC indicators and CHF. RBC membrane lipidomics is first used to characterize CHF and its impact on plasma volume overload (PVO) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The first cohort (n = 507,638) shows that the erythrocyte stress index (ESI), better than traditional RBC indicators, is associated with the prevalence of CHF with odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 1.57 (95% CI,1.55-1.59). ESI is also linked with in-hospital death in CHF. Another cohort (n = 1,550) indicated RBC membrane lipidomics ceramide subtype Cer 18:0;O2/16:0 and lysophosphatidylethanolamine subtype LPE 18:0 has an AUC of PVO with 0.75 and 0.61. The above two lipids are risk factors of PVO with OR of 1.62 (95% CI, 1.47-1.80) and 1.11 (95% CI, 1.06-1.16). They also are risk factors for MACE, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.04 (95% CI, 1.01-1.07) and 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.10).

  abstract     = {Transition metal oxides (TMOs) simultaneously possessing strong spin-orbit coupling, near room-temperature ferromagnetism, and excellent conductivity are scarce while they show great potential applications in oxide spintronics. Here, a TMO with all these features is reported, existing as an interfacial phase in the 4 d Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 layer sandwiched by two LaMnO 3 layers. This phase is well conductive and ferromagnetic in a wide temperature range, with the highest Curie temperature of ≈275 K among the 4 d /5 d -TMOs. Particularly, this interfacial phase shows a considerably improved saturation magnetization (≈2 µ B /Ru, twice that of the bulk counterpart), and a greatly reduced coercive force. All these features are highly desired by the application of spin-orbit torque. Due to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, such a Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 interfacial phase exhibits a significantly larger anomalous Hall conductivity than the typical 3 d oxide ferromagnet La 2/3 Sr 1/3 MnO 3 near room temperature. Analyses based on the techniques of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized-neutron reflectometry, and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a magnetic exchange interaction between the interfacial phases of Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 and LaMnO 3 and an obvious expansion of the interfacial Mn─O─Mn bond angle, stabilizing the high-temperature ferromagnetic state of the CSRO/LMO interface.},

However, its low gene editing efficiency in mammalian cells limits its application in therapeutic gene editing. To address this limitation, structure-guided mutagenesis is employed to replace key negatively charged residues with arginine, strengthening DNA binding. The resulting quintuple mutant, engineered Cas12j-8 (enCas12j-8), demonstrates robust on-target editing efficiency comparable to LbCas12a while maintaining low off-target effects. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs) are developed using enCas12j-8, achieving up to 29.54-fold C-to-T and 36.57-fold A-to-G conversion efficiency compared with the wild-type at the dominated sites, respectively. Notably, enCas12j-8 enables multiplexed editing of three genomic loci simultaneously via a single crRNA array, achieving efficiencies comparable to single-guide approaches. Additionally, enCas12j-8-ABE facilitates the disruption of splice acceptor sites, effectively inducing exon skipping in the SOD1 gene. This strategy holds potential significance for therapeutic genome modulation. These findings establish enCas12j-8 as a versatile, high-precision tool for genome engineering, combining efficient delivery, multiplexing capability, and compatibility with diverse editing modalities.},

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of micrometer-to-millimeter components, referred to as “macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA),” offers an efficient approach for constructing cell-scale 3D bioactive structures with flexible modular designs. Compared with available 3D bio-printing or conventional modular assembly of cell-material units, MSA is advantageous in decoupling material preparation and cell loading processes by directing cell adhesion after the preparation of 3D structures, which minimizes the trade-off between cell viability and material selection. But the challenge lies in efficient self-sorting of different cells and spatially controlled cell distribution. Hence, MSA is combined with the surface chemistry of orthogonally specific peptides to different cells and magnetic manipulation, and fabricated 3D bioactive structures that direct cell sorting. Microscale polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) components are modified with 1) Arg-Glu-Asp-Val and Val-Ala-Pro-Gly peptides affinitive to endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), respectively, and 2) host/guest molecules as “supramolecular glues” for precise structuring and interfacial bonding. Self-sorting and spatially controlled adhesion of ECs and SMCs is achieved to mimic layered vascular structures. This “Lego-like” strategy is free of compromising cell viability with structure design, thus contributing to spatially intricate and bioactive 3D architectures, and promoting the development of MSA from fundamental advances to applications.},

  abstract     = {The nervous system plays a pivotal regulatory role in the maintenance of bone homeostasis, and the protective effects of dopamine and its receptors on bone metabolism are emerging. Despite these protective roles, the functional contribution of dopaminergic signaling, particularly through specific receptor subtypes, remains unexplored in glucocorticoid (GC)-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) pathogenesis. Here, the dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1), a G protein-coupled receptor with few identified bone-related functions, is identified as a positive regulator of GC-induced apoptosis. The dopamine levels in the serum of GC-associated ONFH patients are significantly lower than those in the normal population. The protein and gene expression levels of DRD1 and the number of DRD1-positive cells are abnormally elevated in the pathological state of GC-associated ONFH, and DRD1 is expressed in osteoblasts. Overexpression of DRD1 attenuates GC-induced osteogenic inhibition and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, overexpression of DRD1 elevates cAMP levels, activates downstream protein kinase A, and inhibits GC-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis through the ATF3/CHOP signaling pathway, thus improving bone homeostasis. Importantly, Madopar, an FDA-approved dopaminergic agent, inhibits GC-induced osteoblastic apoptosis and ONFH via DRD1. Collectively, this study not only deciphers a previously unrecognized DRD1-mediated neuro-osteogenic axis but also repurposes an FDA-approved drug (Madopar) for precision ONFH management.},

Herein, 1) based on metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of 44 CSCC and 18 normal tissues, glutamine-enriched and immunosuppressive microenvironment is identified in CSCC. 2) Integrative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed the glutamine metabolism transporter SLC25A22 as a key mediator in high glutamine metabolism, immune checkpoint activation and CD8+T-cell cytotoxicity. 3) Immunohistochemistry(IHC), multiplex IHC, and flow cytometry validation with clinical CSCC samples revealed not only increased SLC25A22, PD-1 expression and reduced CD8+T-cell cytotoxicity in CSCC but also increased SLC25A22 expression in high PD-L1 expressed CSCC patients, suggesting the potential of targeting SLC25A22 for enhancing CD8+T-cell cytotoxicity and improving anti-PD-1 efficacy, especially in high PD-L1 expressed patients. 4) Novelly, 3D-CSCC organoids are constructed, replicating parental tumor features, and 3D-T-cell-incorporated CSCC organoid models, replicating the interaction between tumor cells and CD8+T cells, for in vitro experiments. 5) Importantly, it is validated through in vitro 3D T-cell-incorporated CSCC organoid models and in vivo animal experiments that targeting the glutamine metabolism transporter SLC25A22, showed promise in enhancing CD8+T-cell cytotoxicity and sensitizing anti-PD-1 therapy. These findings provided insights for future clinical trials exploring metabolic modulation to improve immunotherapy responses in CSCC patients.},

  abstract     = {De novo design of binders capable of targeting arbitrarily selected epitopes remains a substantial challenge. Here, a generalizable computational strategy is presented to design site-specific protein binders, obviating steps of extensive empirical optimization or in vitro screening. The dock-and-design pipeline retrieves complementary scaffolds from a protein structure database to a given query epitope, where the scaffold is mutated to carve a binding site de novo . The docking step utilizes a novel fingerprint that greatly simplifies and accelerates the surface complementarity evaluation. As proof-of-concept, we designed protein binders to target three distinct epitopes on two different oncogenic targets; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-7 receptor-α (IL-7Rα). Experimental characterization of only 24 candidates identified nanomolar binders against each of the target epitopes, where the binders belonged to five different folds. Several designs were active in vitro. Moreover, anti-VEGF designs showed tumor-inhibiting activity in vivo, highlighting their therapeutic potential.},

  abstract     = {Disturbed blood flow and the resulting oscillatory low shear stress (OSS) are key contributors to vascular endothelial dysfunction and the initiation of atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mediators that translate abnormal hemodynamic signals into pathological vascular endothelial responses remain unclear. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are classical mechanosensors in the vascular endothelium. Here, using vascular endothelial-specific knockout mice, in vitro parallel plate flow chamber systems, and phosphoproteomic analysis, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is identified as a central mediator of OSS-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction. Mechanistically, OSS promotes GRK2 phosphorylation at serine 29, which subsequently activates the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), increasing the expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecules intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). In parallel, AP-1 promotes nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A 1 (NR4A1) transcription, which anchors liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to the nucleus and suppresses downstream AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, leading to metabolic dysregulation and impaired vascular endothelial homeostasis. These findings underscore the GRK2/AP-1 signaling axis as a crucial mechanotransduction cascade linking disturbed flow to vascular endothelial dysfunction. Given the important role of GPCRs in mechanotransduction, targeting GRK2 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis.},

This salt undergoes a paraelastic-ferroelastic phase transition at ≈233/224 K (on heating/cooling), driven by spin-lattice interactions. Importantly, the phase transition couples spontaneous strain, bistable magnetism with switchable dielectric properties. Another distinctive feature of 1 is its pronounced dielectric anisotropy and high dielectric permittivity, which arise due to a barrier layer capacitor effect due to cation displacement polarization and significant electron polarization of the highly conjugated anions. These findings provide a versatile molecular design strategy for developing magnetoelectric and mechanically multifunctional materials, with promising applications in next-generation electronic and smart devices that leverage coupled physical properties.},

The process of photosynthesis is exemplary for utilizing sunlight as a regenerative energy source. Enzymes like hydrogenases, which reduce protons to molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) under ambient conditions, are model biocatalysts for generating sustainable, clean fuels. In green algae, photosynthesis and hydrogenases are coupled through ferredoxin, a small electron transfer protein. Here, it is shown that several plant-type ferredoxins can interact with a chemically synthesized active site cofactor analog of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in a way that allows comparably high H 2 evolution rates. UV–vis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the natural [2Fe-2S] clusters of the ferredoxin hosts must be absent for a functional interaction of polypeptide and cofactor mimic and that the apo-ferredoxins shield the H 2 -producing cofactor from the solvent. The hybrid proteins exhibited higher O 2 tolerance than natural [FeFe]-hydrogenases and generated H 2 in light-dependent cascades based on photosystem I or the chemical photosensitizer proflavine. These features and the combination of natural hosts and cofactors might contribute to establishing sustainable light-dependent H 2 production systems.},

Thin films of three copolymers, upon doping, demonstrate appreciable conductivity under ambient conditions. EPL- g -O3HT-1 could be fully break down over 12 days by enzymatic degradation. EPL- g -O3HT-1 also displays excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, attributed to its high ɛ-poly-L-lysine content. It is further demonstrated the versatility of EPL- g -O3HTs in transient electronics for electromyography sensors for muscle signal acquisition and as the channel material in organic electrochemical transistors. Combining tunable conductivity, controlled biodegradability, and antimicrobial properties, EPL- g -O3HT copolymers hold significant potential for diverse transient electronic applications, including skin and implantable electronics, where degradable electronics with antimicrobial properties are highly desirable.},

  abstract     = {Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most common chronic diseases among children globally, affecting the health and quality of life of children. Despite various treatments, cariogenic bacteria persist, resulting in a pessimistic outlook for the prevention and treatment of ECC. A notable presence of persister cells is found within the cariogenic bacterial population, with their dormancy enabling them to evade antiseptics. Mechanistically, the downregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) leads to protein aggresome formation, converting active cariogenic bacteria into persisters, which confers dual defensive barriers through metabolic inertness and concomitant reduction of membrane permeability, rendering conventional antimicrobials ineffective. Given these findings, Ti 3 C 2 MXene, a 2D nanomaterial acting as a “nanothermal knife” to disrupt persister cell membranes is developed. Ti 3 C 2 -mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) upregulated HSPs, inhibited aggresome formation, and prevented persister dormancy, showing efficacy against planktonic and biofilm cariogenic persisters. This PTT strategy demonstrates remarkable efficacy against planktonic cariogenic persisters and multispecies biofilms. Furthermore, the in vivo establishment of aggressive caries models reveals a substantial reduction of cariogenic pathogens following combined Ti 3 C 2 -mediated PTT and antimicrobial treatment, effectively suppressing caries progression. This light-assisted antibacterial strategy may aid ECC prevention.},

  abstract     = {Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) playing a critical role in its progression. Metabolic reprogramming, particularly lactate accumulation, drives immune suppression within the TME. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 30 LUAD samples, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving 29,863 patients and 55,586 controls, and clinical data from 220 LUAD patients, we identified N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) as a key pathogenic gene in LUAD, strongly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that NDRG1 stabilizes lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby enhancing glycolysis and promoting lactate accumulation. This process fosters immune suppression by inducing M2 macrophage polarization, impairing CD8 + T cell function, and upregulating immunosuppressive genes. Furthermore, histone H3K18 lactylation in macrophages exacerbates this immunosuppressive state. Clinically, elevated NDRG1 expression correlates with increased PD-L1 levels, a higher abundance of immunosuppressive macrophages, and reduced CD8 + T cell infiltration, contributing to immunotherapy resistance. Conversely, low NDRG1 expression is associated with enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration and improved therapeutic outcomes. Preclinical studies demonstrated targeting NDRG1 suppresses tumor growth, alleviates immune suppression, and boosts anti-PD-L1 efficacy. These findings establish NDRG1 as a critical LUAD regulator and a promising immunotherapy target.},

The formation of Ag 40 @Ag 12 involves three stages, including initial crystallization of Ag 40 NCs, partial decomposition (self-sacrifice) of Ag 40 NCs enabling Ag 12 assembly, and epitaxial-growth crystallization of the Ag 12 NCs. The partially decomposed Ag 40 NCs provide starting materials for the formation and crystallization of Ag 12 NCs to encapsulate the Ag 40 seeds, while the residual Ag 40 loses its crystallinity in solution simultaneously.

  abstract     = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by persistent inflammation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis leading to end-stage renal disease. Transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channel inhibition mitigates tubular injury and renal fibrosis in murine models of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and 2-month chronic post–ischemia-reperfusion injury (2m post-I/R). Through integrated analysis of single-cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from UUO mice treated with the selective TRPC6 inhibitor SH045, here the renoprotective cell composition and cell type-specific transcriptional programs are defined. We explored translational aspects by conducting an in-depth scRNA-Seq analysis of kidney samples from patients with CKD. These results reveal global transcriptional shifts with a dramatic diversification of inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Notably, a distinct subpopulation of novel endothelial cells is delineated, which is termed ECRIN, that regulate inflammatory networks implicating VEGF and GAS signaling pathways. The data also indicates that inhibition of TRPC6 channels triggers a Prnp transcription factor regulatory network, which contributes to the alleviation of renal fibrosis. The key findings are supported at the protein level by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. We observed similar patterns in the chronic 2m postI/R injury model. These findings provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic benefits of TRPC6 inhibition in CKD.},

  abstract     = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal brain cancer with no effective treatment; understanding how GBM cells respond to tumor microenvironment remains challenging as conventional cell cultures lack proper cytoarchitecture while in vivo animal models present complexity all at once. Developing a culture system to bridge the gap is thus crucial. Here, a multicellular approach is employed using human glia and vascular cells to optimize a 3D brain vascular niche model that enabled not only long-term culture of patient derived GBM cells but also recapitulation of key features of GBM heterogeneity, in particular invasion behavior and vascular association. Comparative transcriptomics of identical patient derived GBM cells in 3D and in vivo xenotransplants models revealed that glia-vascular contact induced genes concerning neural/glia development, synaptic regulation, as well as immune suppression. This gene signature displayed region specific enrichment in the leading edge and microvascular proliferation zones in human GBM and predicted poor prognosis. Gene variance analysis also uncovered histone demethylation and xylosyltransferase activity as main themes for gene adaption of GBM cells in vivo. Furthermore, the 3D model also demonstrated the capacity to provide a quiescence and a protective niche against chemotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are dynamic macromolecular condensates that act as crucibles to modulate cellular processes. Since MLOs form in the absence of lipid membranes, it is important to understand how their effective regulation is achieved by the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) system. To address this question, a comprehensive mapping of the proteostasis network (PN) of MLOs, comprising over 220 000 protein–protein interactions is reported. This analysis reveals how regulatory proteins (PN proteins) occupy central roles in the overall protein–protein interaction network of MLOs. It is then investigated which branches of the PN are most important in the regulation of MLOs, finding that the anabolic component, which makes up ≈30% of the PN, is more closely involved than the catabolic component, which makes up the remaining ≈70% of the PN. It is also found that translation-related PN proteins and molecular chaperones play central roles in MLO regulation. Finally, how specificity may be achieved despite shared PN components is explored. These findings suggest that HSP70 chaperones function as generic MLO regulators, while client-specific HSP70 co-chaperones confer specificity to the chaperone action. These results identify the composition of the PN of MLOs, rationalize its organization, and reveal central roles of molecular chaperones in protein regulation within MLOs.},

  abstract     = {Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy without effective treatment due to limited knowledge of its development and tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics are employed to comprehensively investigate the development trajectories and the TME. The results revealed that PSCC cells mimicked the differentiation and tissue organization of normal penile epithelium, independent of the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status. Notably, a spatial subtype, Tum_1, appeared at early stage of tumor differentiation and in tumor–normal boundary regions. This subtype exhibited enhanced basal-like and stemness features and showed high LAMC2 expression, which activated laminin-integrin signaling via ITGA6/ITGB4, promoting tumor invasiveness. Furthermore, the results indicated that HPV-positive basal stem-like neoplasms dampened the immune function of T cells and macrophages, promoting an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor progression. Supporting this, the patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma who have high expression of HPV-positive Tum_1 signatures derived greater benefit from PD-1 blockade therapy. In summary, the findings provide a comprehensive spatial landscape of the PSCC TME and suggest potential treatment approaches targeting laminin-integrin interaction and immunotherapy, especially in HPV-positive patients.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is widely acknowledged as a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, facilitating plaque formation through various mechanisms. Although both conditions are linked to the aging process, the relationship among cellular senescence, diabetes, and atherosclerosis remains inadequately understood. This study presents evidence that elevated glucose levels expedite the progression of atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage senescence. Increased glucose levels are shown to induce senescence in macrophages, which enhances the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and facilitates the formation of foam cells. This mechanism is driven by lactate production via glycolysis, which activates the lactate receptor GPR132, thereby promoting macrophage senescence. The activation of GPR132 is implicated in mediating senescence and lipid uptake through Src phosphorylation. The deletion of GPR132 markedly reduces macrophage senescence and atherosclerosis in mouse models. Furthermore, saracatinib, a specific Src inhibitor, has been demonstrated to effectively alleviate diabetic atherosclerosis in experimental settings. In clinical samples, elevated plasma lactate levels and the activation of the GPR132-Src pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are positively associated with coronary stenosis. These findings propose a potential mechanism through which diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis via the lactate-GPR132-Src pathway, underscoring macrophage senescence as a pivotal target in the context of diabetic atherosclerosis.},

The Targeting Aging and Longevity with Exogenous Nucleotides (TALENTs) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05243108) aimed to explore whether nucleotides (NTs) supplementation can delay biological aging and improve health outcomes in the elderly. The trial is a 19-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Chengdu, China, with 121 participants (60–70 years). Participants are randomly assigned to either NTs (1.2 g day −1 ) or placebo group (1:1). The results of primary outcomes showed that NTs had significantly greater reduction in median DNA methylation age compared to placebo over 19 weeks (β = −3.08 years, 95% CI: −5.07 to −1.10, P = 0.0023), with a trend toward reduction observed over 11 weeks (β = −1.94 years, 95% CI: −4.32 to 0.45, P = 0.11); whereas no significant difference changes of leukocyte telomere length are showed between groups (week 11: β = 0.09, 95% CI: −0.10 to 0.29, P = 0.36; week 19: β = 0.12, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.28, P = 0.18). Insulin sensitivity improved in the NTs group, with a significant reduction in HOMA-IR over 19 weeks (β = −0.45, 95% CI: −0.86 to −0.04, P = 0.033). No severe adverse events or significant changes in safety indicators are reported. Together, our findings establish that NTs may delay biological aging and improve insulin sensitivity with a well-tolerated safety profile.},

  abstract     = {The DARPA Transfer from Imprecise and Abstract Models to Autonomous Technologies (TIAMAT) program aims to address rapid and robust transfer of autonomy technologies across dynamic and complex environments, goals, and platforms. Existing methods for simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer often rely on high-fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real-world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim-to-real gap—such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization—TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real-world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)-fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim-to-real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid real-world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real-world performance.},

Some even state that soon, AI will be smarter than us. We believe such statements are unhelpful when it comes to attracting talent to our field. We document several such statements. We believe that the future need for AI talent is tremendous and that we should take extreme efforts to attract students to our field. We present a sample of the expected opportunities and needs. Some of these opportunities may be attractive to students who in the past may not have considered AI as a career option. We argue that even with the anticipated automation of AI work, there nevertheless will be a prodigious need for talent to develop good AI. We summarize work that argues that AI is going to be a fundamental skill and as such should be introduced to learners across many age groups and many backgrounds. We suggest that a well-reasoned statement of the anticipated needs be developed by experts in our field and communicated to future talent. We suggest that, as part of this message, pathways forward toward developing AI talent across a wide range of backgrounds be developed and communicated.},

To ensure that our curriculum could meet the needs of all learners, we recruited a diverse set of districts that included rural districts serving mainly White students, urban districts that were majority African American, and suburban districts serving a mix of Hispanic and African American students. Now in its fourth year, our “AI for Georgia” project (AI4GA) has provided PD to 20 teachers and AI education to over 1600 students. The AI4GA curriculum does more than foster AI literacy: It empowers students to view themselves as creators of AI-powered technology and to think about future career options that involve the use of AI. The project is now expanding to schools in Texas and Florida. In this article, we review the history of the project, discuss our co-design process with our teachers, and present results from studies of teacher PD and student learning.},

This paper adopts a design science research (DSR) approach to develop the equity-aware design thinking for AI (EquiThink4AI) framework, a dual-component model that systematically embeds equity principles into AI education. EquiThink4AI's first component extends design thinking (DT) by incorporating principles from EquityXDesign (EXD) and liberatory design (LD), ensuring that equity concerns are proactively addressed throughout AI system development. The second component enhances the framework with pedagogical strategies, including problem-based learning (PBL), experiential learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering student engagement, real-world problem-solving, and ethical reasoning. EquityThink4AI provides educators and students with a structured methodology for teaching and applying equity-centered AI development.

These courses, however, should not replicate the technical focus typically found in introductory computer science (CS) courses like CS1 and CS2. In this paper, we use an adjustable, interdisciplinary socio-technical AI literacy framework to design and present an introductory AI literacy course. We present a refined version of this framework informed by the teaching of a 1-credit general education AI literacy course (primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors), a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels, and a summer camp for high school students. Drawing from these teaching experiences and the evolving research landscape, we propose an introductory AI literacy course design framework structured around four cross-cutting pillars. These pillars encompass (1) understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI technologies, (2) learning how to interact with (generative) AI technologies, (3) applying principles of critical, ethical, and responsible AI usage, and (4) analyzing implications of AI on society. We posit that achieving AI literacy is essential for all students, those pursuing AI-related careers, and those following other educational or professional paths. This introductory course, positioned at the beginning of a program, creates a foundation for ongoing and advanced AI education. The course design approach is presented as a series of modules and subtopics under each pillar. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful instructional design, including pedagogy, expected learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. This approach not only integrates social and technical learning but also democratizes AI education across diverse student populations and equips all learners with the socio-technical, multidisciplinary perspectives necessary to navigate and shape the ethical future of AI.},

Some label it a “crisis,” and research employing or building machine learning (ML) models is no exception. Issues including lack of transparency, data or code, poor adherence to standards, and the sensitivity of ML training conditions mean that many papers are not even reproducible in principle. Where they are, though, reproducibility experiments have found worryingly low degrees of similarity with original results. Despite previous appeals from ML researchers on this topic and various initiatives from conference reproducibility tracks to the ACM's new Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability, we contend that the general community continues to take this issue too lightly. Poor reproducibility threatens trust in and integrity of research results. Therefore, in this article, we lay out a new perspective on the key barriers and drivers (both procedural and technical) to increased reproducibility at various levels (methods, code, data, and experiments). We then map the drivers to the barriers to give concrete advice for strategies for researchers to mitigate reproducibility issues in their own work, to lay out key areas where further research is needed in specific areas, and to further ignite discussion on the threat presented by these urgent issues.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM) devices are a promising candidate for neuromorphic computing, as they mimic synaptic functions by modulating conductance through ion migration. However, the use of a thick electrolyte layer (>40 nm) in conventional ECRAMs leads to an unavoidable tradeoff between synaptic weight updates and operating speed. To address this problem, a Cu-based ultrathin ECRAM (UT-ECRAM) that uses a single 5 nm HfO x active layer and a ≈1.2 nm AlO x liner is designed. The highly efficient gate-tunable fast Cu-ion transport in the AlO x /HfO x UT-ECRAM enables 1) near-ideal linearity in weight updates (0.45) even achieved with a pulse width ( t w ) of 50 μs, 2) dynamic multilevel retention of 10 4 s, and 3) reliable cycling endurance of 10 4 cycles. A numerical analysis based on device scaling quantitatively reveals that a relatively high concentration of field-driven Cu ions (≈10 20 cm −3 ) contributes to each synaptic weight update per gate voltage ( V G ) pulse in the UT-ECRAM without becoming deactivated by traversing thicker layers. This improved gate sensitivity can ultimately overcome the linearity and the ratio/speed tradeoff relationships, paving the way for robust neuromorphic synaptic units.},

Recent achievements have integrated legged mobility with manipulation capabilities, yet the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking remains a challenge, which is crucial for practical applications. This study proposes an innovative approach that integrates coordinated trajectory generation with decoupled tracking control to enhance the accuracy of end-effector trajectory tracking. This approach also expands the end-effector's workspace and improves the smoothness of the robot's movements. The trajectory optimization-based coordinated trajectory generator leverages the active motion of the quadruped's body to produce smooth movements. Meanwhile, the decoupled tracking control models the robotic arm and quadrupedal robot as independent floating-base systems, incorporating interaction forces to enhance the overall system's tracking accuracy. Finally, a series of experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully perform a variety of trajectory-tracking tasks, reducing the root mean squared error by 82.7% compared to independent control in the stance mode, and cutting additional computational overhead by 53.4% compared to the unified control.},

  abstract     = {Heart failure (HF) is a major clinical and public health problem. Cardiac assist devices are crucial treatment modalities for end-stage HF, but they still face limitations, such as direct blood contact and high power consumption. We present a lightweight (<60 g), compact, electroactive polymer (EAP)-based cardiac assist device (E-CAD) as a nonblood-contacting, low-power alternative to address these limitations. E-CAD consists of EAP units paired with negative bias springs (NBSs), mounted on a flexible sleeve that wraps around the heart to assist in cardiac compression. The device is designed to be biomimetic to match the regionally varying mechanical stiffness of the heart. Benchtop silicone phantom and ex vivo porcine tests demonstrated E-CAD's ability to increase volume displacement by 1.21-fold in benchtop tests with a silicone phantom and 1.17-fold in ex vivo settings, along with an associated increase in ejection fraction, compared to cases without the device. Furthermore, it operates on low power (<0.3 W), enabling a compact design with a thin driveline (outer diameter = 0.3 mm), which reduces infection risk. In summary, we showed that EAP-based direct cardiac compression was feasible with low power demand. The improvement in cardiac output may translate into clinical benefits for advanced HF patients.},

  abstract     = {Collecting detailed information from trees via hovering with an aerial robot is both energetically inefficient and often infeasible in dense forest canopies. Perching on trees offers a promising solution by enabling prolonged observations with reduced energy consumption. To overcome perching location limitations, in this article, a bird-inspired passive perching mechanism specifically optimized for vertical tree trunks is proposed. Similar to the tail action of treecreepers ( Certhiidae family) when perching on vertical tree trunks, the proposed aerial robotic platform perches on tree surfaces using a main clawed gripping mechanism combined with a supporting “tail” mechanism featuring arrays of embedded microspines. To cope with the complex curvature of tree trunks, adaptive elastic joints that allow the mechanism to passively contact the tree's surface are introduced. By incorporating the region of attraction for the mechanism, the aerial platform is designed to be more reliable during perching maneuvers by adjusting angular movement, thereby defining suitable initial velocities and accelerations for achieving stable equilibrium. The proposed system is validated in a motion capture environment using vertical trunks with diameters ranging from 40 to 220 mm, and further demonstrates in outdoor perching tests. Results confirm the feasibility of dynamic perching on vertical tree trunks under realistic forest conditions.},

Although the application of liquid metals (LM) and their composites has improved the stretchability of various tactile sensors, there remains a considerable gap between the performance of current flexible tactile sensors and human skin, attributed to their limited sensitivity and narrow working range. In this work, a liquid metal droplet (LMD)-based flexible tactile sensor that achieves both high-pressure sensitivity of 3 × 10 −2 kPa −1 and a wide working range from 50 Pa to 1.2 MPa is proposed. The novel sensor consists of an LMD array in which each pair of droplets is connected by an electrolyte solution within the polydimethylsiloxane microchannel grid. It is demonstrated that the 2-LMD sensor is capable of detecting human motion and physiological signals, while the electrical impedance tomography-based 3.5 × 3.5 cm sensor can detect the shape and position of single-point, multipoint, and other complex contact using only eight evenly distributed electrodes along the sensor's edge. These findings highlight the promising potential of the sensors in future robotic and wearable electronic applications.},

In this combined theoretical and experimental study, the geometric parameters to realize the coupling synergy between the two structures in terms of kinematics are adapted. Then, diverse experiments are conducted to characterize the performance of this building block, indicating that this building block not only has all basic motion patterns (i.e., contraction Δ H max = 30.78 mm, bending = 59.96°, and twisting = 33.67°) but also exhibits high repeatable positioning accuracy and strong load-bearing capacity.

This article introduces a soft pneumatic pressure regulation system with self-rhythmic characteristics and simple structure. In this system, the hose generates self-excited oscillations due to jet force, which realizes the transformation of constant pressure to periodically varying pressure. This mechanism allows soft robots to perform rhythmic movements. A mathematical model is developed to describe the self-excited oscillations of the jet hose. Numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the impact of various parameters on system oscillations. The system operates under pressures from 90 to 150 kPa. By adjusting the pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the oscillation frequency of the pressure can be tuned between 5.9 and 11.1 Hz. The comparison between simulation results and experimental data verifies the correctness of the mathematical model. Finally, a soft robot capable of crawling based on anisotropic friction is designed and fabricated. Powered solely by the soft pneumatic pressure regulation system, the robot achieves self-rhythmic crawling. By adjusting the air source pressure, hose length, and jet hole diameter, the robot's crawling speed can be effectively controlled, ranging from 2.5 to 6.8 mm s −1 .},

  abstract     = {6D object pose estimation, a critical component in computer vision and robotics domains, involves determining the 3D location and orientation of an object relative to a canonical reference frame. Recently, the widespread proliferation of RGB-D sensors has precipitated a marked increase in interest towards 6D pose estimation leveraging RGB-D data. A deep bidirectional fusion network is developed, DBF-Net, achieving efficient yet accurate 6D object pose estimation. Specifically, a sparse linear Transformer (SLT) with linear computation complexity is introduced to effectively leverage cross-modal semantic resemblance during the feature extraction stage, such that it fully models semantic associations between various modalities and efficiently aggregates the globally enhanced features of each modality. Once acquiring two feature representations from two modalities, a feature balancer (FB) based on SLT is proposed to adaptively reconcile the importance of these feature representations. Leveraging the global receptive field of SLT, FB effectively eliminates the ambiguity induced by visual similarity in appearance representation or depth missing of reflective surfaces in geometry representations, thereby enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that DBF-Net surpasses current state-of-the-art works by nontrivial margins across multiple benchmarks.

It enables adaptation to large-range attitude variations using small-scale training data, thereby reducing computational costs for diverse missions. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach: A-TD3 improves training speed by 30.8% while mitigating issues such as excessive rudder motion, poor operability, and high energy consumption across different missions.

Experiments demonstrate that the soft hand, equipped with four servos, can perform 11 distinct mouse operations, including pressing and scrolling operations. By integrating a camera into the hand, the soft hand can automatically carry out computer mouse operations through vision-based control strategies. Furthermore, this system enables users to control the proposed soft hand on a robotic arm via speech commands. Experimental results show that this system can handle typical office and gaming tasks, holding the potential for applications in office scenes and gaming hardware plug-ins.},

Physician experience significantly influences the detection of spinal metastases and the evaluation of associated features. This study aims to develop a deep-learning system (DLS) for automatic detection of spinal metastasis and feature evaluation using computed tomography and to determine the impact of the DLS on physician performance in the detection and assessment of spinal metastasis. DLS assistance in a multireader, multicase test study results in higher sensitivity and specificity in spinal metastasis detection and feature evaluation (all p < 0.001). Additionally, resident physicians show a more significant improvement in sensitivity and specificity compared with attending or chief physicians in spinal metastasis detection and most feature evaluation ( p < 0.01). In a cohort test study, resident oncologists assisted by the DLS achieve significantly higher sensitivity and specificity compared with those without assistance (all p < 0.01), except for the sensitivity of vertebral body collapse evaluation ( p > 0.01). DLS assistance may improve physicians’ performance in the detection and evaluation of spinal metastases, particularly that of resident oncologists.},

  abstract     = {Energy efficiency is a critical concern in built environment. Identifying key features that drive energy consumption is essential for optimizing building performance. Traditionally, studies have focused on single-domain datasets. These approaches overlook the potential insights gained from integrating data across different domains. This research addresses this gap using a cross-domain dataset that includes building characteristics, energy usage, and environmental factors. Feature selection techniques, including filter methods (correlation, mutual information), wrapper methods (RFE), embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest, and gradient boosting), and dimensionality reduction are used to identify the most significant features contributing to the energy efficiency of residential properties. These techniques identify the most significant features influencing energy consumption. The findings show that cross-domain features like energy consumption, CO 2 emissions, and heating cost play a key role in predicting energy performance. By integrating data from multiple domains, the feature selection process reveals areas for energy optimization that are previously overlooked in single-domain studies. The results provide valuable insights for energy consultants, building managers, and policymakers aiming to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings. This research highlights the importance of cross-domain data integration and offers a robust framework for feature selection. Ultimately, it contributes to more effectiveenergy-saving strategies and sustainable building practices.},

Herein, an innovative diagnostic application of vibrating microrobots combined with laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) to minimally invasively estimate the elasticity of potential tumors and surrounding healthy tissue is proposed. By positioning a vibrating microrobot on tissue surfaces, the resonant frequencies of the resulting vibrations are analyzed to create detailed elasticity maps. These maps reveal tumor margins and provide critical information about the tumor's properties spatially. This approach leverages the high spatio-temporal resolution and noncontact nature of LSCI to offer a minimally invasive elastography method for potential use in colonoscopy, providing an alternative to complex and time-consuming biopsy analysis and advancing future cancer diagnostics.},

These accelerators require a large network of synaptic elements with high degree of plasticity, high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow programing energy. Although emerging nonvolatile memories exhibit promising potential as synaptic devices, their widespread application in training accelerators is limited due to their low endurance and immature fabrication technology. In contrast, capacitor-less 1 transistor-dynamic random-access memories (1T-DRAMs) have recently emerged as lucrative alternative to the conventional (1T/1C) DRAMs owing to their high scalability and low footprint. Considering the high endurance, large integration density, and ultralow write energy of the 1T-DRAMs, in this work, for the first time, their potential is explored as synaptic elements for online learning. The proposed 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element exhibits multi-level capability (up to 6 bits), a large dynamic range (3.91 × 10 3 ), an ultralow energy, and an appreciable linearity for potentiation/depression. The 1T-DRAM-based synaptic element also exhibits a paired pulse facilitation with an exponential decay similar to the biological synapses. Furthermore, a multilayer perceptron utilizing the proposed 1T-DRAM synapses achieves an accuracy of 87.10% on MNIST dataset.},

Herein, a novel large-area conformal Kirigami structure that can be customized for complex geometries and transform small-area planar sensor arrays into large-area curved conformal e-skin is proposed. This sensor network can effectively detect Lamb/guided wave responses generated by transient hard contact. Additionally, a convolutional neural network-based deep learning algorithm is implemented to decode the features of guided wave signals and predict the contact location and energy intensity on the robot surface. With the deep learning-based method, the accuracy of collision localization can reach 2.85 ± 1.90 mm and the prediction error of collision energy can reach 9.8 × 10 −4 ± 8.9 × 10 −4 J.

Additionally, simulation experiments are conducted on micrositing and time-varying wind conditions using real-world data from a wind farm in the Arua region.

Compared with radiomics and clinical feature-based machine learning methods, whether a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) based on radiomics and clinical features improve the performance in distinguishing benign and malignant pulmonary nodules is not well studied. We propose an approach based on multimodal GCNNs that integrates patients’ lung computed tomography images with clinical information to differentiate between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. Leveraging large-scale and multisource data from multiple hospitals (i.e., 6033/290/524 patients for three hospitals respectively) enhances the diversity of features. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) are used to evaluate the performance. We achieved the average accuracy/sensitivity/specificity/AUROC of 0.8612/0.9425/0.6786/0.9025 for the main dataset via the novel GCNN proposed, respectively, maintaining the robustness of the deep learning procedures. Especially for the external testing dataset (hospital 2/hospital 3), the specificity is much higher than comparison methods (0.6250–0.6731 vs. 0.2569–0.2788). The graph neural network-based deep learning method holds the potential to assist clinicians, aiding in treatment planning, patient management, follow-up strategies, resource optimization, and overall healthcare decision-making.},

The micromanipulator comprises a driving circuit, single-board computer, battery, manipulator, and small camera; it is lightweight (515 g), compact (90 × 116 × 104 mm), and untethered, capable of independently operating in confined and dangerous spaces for humans. The micromanipulator can autonomously position a single object with a positioning error of 0.18 ± 0.51 mm and an angular deviation of −0.4° ± 1.2°, utilizing image recognition, machine learning, and visual feedback. Moreover, the micromanipulator is verified to function in extreme conditions that simulate draft chambers and clean benches, where it successfully performs circuit mounting in confined space. The device can arrange droplets under microscopy for applications in chemical and biomedical fields, demonstrating its versatility and precise positioning capabilities. Additionally, its multi-scale applications are explored from centimeters to sub-micrometers and adjusted to the magnification capabilities of various microscopes.},

  abstract     = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is extensively applied to measure the nanomechanical properties of living cells. Despite its popularity, some applications on mechanobiology are limited by the low throughput of the technique. Currently, the analysis of AFM-nanoindentation data is performed by model fitting. Model fitting is slow, data intensive, and prone to error. Herein, a supervised machine-learning regressor is developed for transforming AFM force–distance curves into nanorheological behavior. The method reduces the computational time required to process a force volume of a cell made of 2.62 × 10 5 curves from several hours to minutes. In fact, the regressor increases the throughput by 50-fold. The training and the validation of the regressor are performed by using theoretical curves derived from a contact mechanics model that combined power–law rheology with bottom effect corrections and functional data analysis. The regressor predicts the modulus and the fluidity coefficient of mammalian cells with a relative error below 4%.},

  abstract     = {Medical ultrasound (US) has been widely used in clinical practices due to its merits of being low cost, real time, and radiation free. However, its capability to reveal the underlying tissue properties remains underexplored. A physics-constrained learning framework is studied to reversely approximate tissue property representations from multiple B-mode images acquired with varying dynamic ranges. First, an extractor network is used to generate property maps, that is, attenuation coefficient α , reflection coefficient β , border probability ρ b , scattering density ρ s , scattering amplitude ϕ , and one perturbation p map characterizing the variations caused by varying dynamic range. The α − ϕ maps are loosely regularized by rendering them forward to realistic US images using ray-tracing simulator. To further enforce the physics constraints, a ranking loss is introduced to align the disparity between two estimated p maps with the discrepancy between two distinct inputs. Due to the missing ground truth α − ϕ maps, alternatively, the method is validated by evaluating the consistency between the feature maps inferred from distinct images. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can robustly extract consistent intermediate maps from images. Furthermore, one potential downstream application is showcased to perform realistic US augmentation by introducing specific noise into the physics-inspired α − ϕ maps.},

The gripper consists of pneumatically driven hierarchical adhesive modules (bio-toe) with the capability of contact sensing, and rolling inward/outward module (rolling module). The bio-toe manufactured using soft materials can safely and flexibly cater to curved and flat surfaces. The rolling module developed using four-bar linkage mechanism allows the opposing bio-toes to roll inward to enhance adhesion (adhesion forces up to 6.3 N on a flat surface and 23 N on an 18 m −1 curved surface) and roll outward to decrease the force in releasing (less than 3 N and especially less than 0.8 N on the flat surface). Embedded resistive strain gauges provide real time signals for the controller to determine the status of the bio-toe, such as bending, adhesion/release, and even adhesive contact rates, thereby allowing the gripper to autonomously approach, envelop, adhere to, and release objects of various shapes, with the potential for dynamic adhesion control in the future. The adhesive gripper equipped with adhesive contact sensing and biomimetic inward adhesion/outward release capabilities exhibits a broader grasping range and applicability in smart adhesive grabbing across industrial, agricultural, and human–robot interaction contexts.},

  abstract     = {During endoscopic submucosal dissection, precise and intuitive sensing of target tissues enhances surgical accuracy. Augmented reality (AR) technology currently offers a solution to provide intuitive guidance. To enhance the AR user experience, an automated method for calibrating and dynamically registering deformable tissues is proposed. First, an automatic calibration method is proposed to help register the target tissue from the virtual to the real world. The calibration method is based on a 6D pose estimator, which is built on the feature-matching network, SuperGlue and the depth estimation network, Metric3D. Subsequently, a dynamic registration method is proposed to track the deformation of the target tissue in real-time. Moreover, a piece of cloth is utilized for four automatic calibration trials, resulting in a mean absolute error (MAE) of calibration accuracy at 3.79 ± 0.64 mm. The dynamic registration accuracy is also assessed by varying the deformation of the target, yielding an MAE of 6.03 ± 0.96 mm. Finally, an ex vivo experiment involving a piece of small intestine is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, with an MAE of 3.11 ± 0.56 mm for AR calibration and 3.20 ± 1.96 mm for dynamic registration error.},

To address these limitations, we propose MultiMedRes, a multimodal medical collaborative reasoning framework that simulates human physicians’ communication by incorporating a learner agent to proactively acquire information from domain-specific expert models. MultiMedRes addresses medical multimodal reasoning problems through three steps i) Inquire: The learner agent decomposes complex medical reasoning problems into multiple domain-specific sub-problems; ii) Interact: The agent engages in iterative “ask-answer” interactions with expert models to obtain domain-specific knowledge; and iii) Integrate: The agent integrates all the acquired domain-specific knowledge to address the medical reasoning problems (e.g., identifying the difference of disease levels and abnormality sizes between medical images). We validate the effectiveness of our method on the task of difference visual question answering for X-ray images. The experiments show that our zero-shot prediction achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing fully supervised methods, which demonstrates that MultiMedRes could offer trustworthy and interpretable assistance to physicians in monitoring the treatment progression of patients, paving the way for effective human–AI interaction and collaboration.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing need for precise, minimally invasive biopsy techniques that reduce patient discomfort, improve sampling accuracy in hard-to-reach areas, and minimize tissue damage. Vine robots, a type of continuum robot, offer a promising solution with their unique ability to evert, allowing them to navigate complex environments while reducing friction. This article presents a novel vine robot design powered by magnetic fluid. The fluid drives both vine growth through pressurization and enables precise steering and manipulation using external magnetic fields. Unlike previous designs, the robot's high magnetic volume ensures precise control even under pressure, while maintaining a fully soft structure. This allows for controlled needle movements during biopsies. Additionally, the robot achieves passive stabilization by pressing against surrounding walls. This stabilization, combined with magnetic forces, can exert up to 1.26 N of insertion force at the tip, enabling effective tissue penetration. Experiments are conducted with a 5 mm diameter, 145 mm long magnetic fluid-driven vine robot, demonstrating movement in free space, through narrow constrictions, and within phantoms modeled after human bronchial anatomy. These results pave the way for the robot's potential application in minimally invasive surgeries, particularly in difficult-to-access areas of the body.},

However, the cooling process of HRCs in the yard tends to be nonuniform because of complex thermal interactions between adjacent coils and varying environmental conditions, which affect the mechanical properties and steel quality. In this study, we used simplified heat transfer models based on the finite element method (FEM) to generate realistic simulation data. We developed a novel management system that integrates two trained artificial neural networks with deep and wide networks using hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction speed, a known limitation of FEM. The system predicts temperature variations at multiple points on the coil, enabling strategic placement that minimizes temperature deviations and enhances cooling uniformity. This real-time computational approach eliminates the necessity for additional cooling equipment and ensures high product quality. The system's efficacy was validated through case studies, revealing dynamic adjustments and optimized placements. The proposed system achieved a mean absolute error of 3.44 and a mean absolute percentage error of 0.24%, outperforming conventional regression techniques. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the system in simulating real-world cooling scenarios and its feasibility for real-time cooling optimization in steel manufacturing.},

However, in most cases, human intervention remains essential for the healing process.

To address this gap, in this article, first, the different phases of the healing process in soft robotics are discussed and then the technologies that are or can be integrated into self-healing soft robots to allow each individual phase to be performed autonomously with minimal human involvement are reviewed. Finally, in this article, the challenges of integrating all phases into self-healing soft robots are discussed and the perspectives on achieving fully autonomous self-healing in the future are offered. These phases are classified into five: damage detection, damage cleaning, damage closure, stimulus-triggered material healing, and recovery assessment. Achieving these attributes requires employing physical intelligence at the material level through the use of stimuli-responsive materials or utilizing embodied intelligence at the system level by integrating healing-assistive subsystems or a synergistic combination of both. Consequently, self-healing soft robots can achieve self-sufficiency in their healing capabilities, rendering them a sustainable solution for broader applications.},

Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper-catalyzed asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3-b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.},

Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric-hindrance-directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6-fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow-green solid-state fluorescence and high-contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli-responsive materials for interesting applications.},

Herein, we reported the design and in-situ synthesis of A′-site cations with oxygen–phosphorus–nitrogen–carbon (O─P─N─C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P─Cl and P═O functional groups. The P─Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA + ) and phenethylammonium (PEA + ) cations, yielding large A′-site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin-coating. Concurrently, P═O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual-functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non-radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low-defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi-2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A′-site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high-performance PeLEDs.},

Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt 4 ] 4 [Fe 6 C(CO) 15 ] ( 1 ) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa-iron carbide clusters [NEt 4 ] 3 [Fe 6 C(CO) 14 (SR)] (R = CH 3 , 2 ; C 6 H 5 , 3 ; p -C 6 H 4 CH 3 , 4 ; L -cysteine, L - 5 ; D -cysteine, D - 5 ). Compounds 2–5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2–4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). The chirality of the L -5 and D -5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the ν CO region of both L -5 and D -5 . This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH 2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.},

Here, we report coronene-derived ( CoDe ) luminophores exhibiting ultra-narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM = 11.2 nm) with a 1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low-frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high-power excitation, the CoDe -PhB further exhibits organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40 min (FWHM = 14.7 nm), governed by a two-photon ionization-induced charge-separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt-casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high-color-purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low-frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi-resonance-based designs.},

High-entropy composition and [Li─O─K] configuration coupled with Cu─O covalency and local CuO 6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic–cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid-solution mechanism benefited from high-entropy stabilization, and “cocktail” effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn–Teller (J–T) lattice distortion, O─O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K + /vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL 0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8 Wh kg −1 , superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.},

However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full-width at half-maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H with InCl 3 , leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near-unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48 nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III-V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Full-Stokes polarization detection, enabling the acquisition of complete polarization information, is crucial across various fields such as target identification, robotic perception, and 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, achieving efficient multiple polarization state detection simultaneously with high recognition accuracy in a compact device remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA 2 EA 2 Pb 3 Br 10 ( 1 , where OA is n-octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self-driven full-Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1 , simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in-plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full-Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%–5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self-driven, filterless full-Stokes polarization detection.},

In this work, incorporation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H 4 edta) into the main chain backbone of flexible, linear polymers results in substantial modulation of mechanical properties via conformational changes in the imbedded ligand within the polymer backbone induced by metal ion binding. Upon the addition of metal ions, these polymers transform from viscous liquids into solids with improved elastic characteristics. Polymer strength and toughness are significantly enhanced without the need for extensive polymer crosslinking.

Herein, we design conjugated polymer-based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu–N 4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7 Å) to optimize CO 2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0 Å-spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc-4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0 mmol h −1 g −1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at −1.3 V (versus RHE), outperforming wider-spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0 Å cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5 Å), thereby enhancing C–N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball-milling treatment increases single-atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%. This work demonstrates a multidimensional catalyst design integrating atomic precision and molecular confinement for sustainable electrosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Electro-Fenton treatment through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) offers an effective approach for degrading persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water; however, aeration is always required to overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water, ensuring adequate oxygen availability for the 2e − ORR to generate H 2 O 2 and facilitate its transport for activation into hydroxyl radicals. The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration-free dual-cathode system featuring a natural oxygen-harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode-generated oxygen for H 2 O 2 synthesis (957.1 mg g cat −1 ) without external aeration. By decoupling H 2 O 2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90 h continuous use. By eliminating energy-intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen-bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework, HOF-FJU-119 , constructed from an anthracene-core, that exhibits multimode guest-responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF-FJU-119a undergoes distinct gate-opening transformations in response to CO 2 at 196 K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene-loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C≡N⋯H─C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60 nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real-time visual tracking capabilities.},

Several quinary multicomponent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc) 2 ·2H 2 O with adenine and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC incorporates three distinct zinc-based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN 2 (O 2 C─) 2 ], a dinuclear [Zn 2 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 2 ], and a hexanuclear [Zn 6 N 3 ( μ -H 2 O) 3 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 6 ], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage-like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson─Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single-step ethylene purification from trinary C 2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost-effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-efficiency and low-cost multi resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters especially in the deep-blue region is critically limited due to intrinsic excimer quenching of planar π-extended frameworks. Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high-efficiency oxygen-bridged cyclized boron-based MR-TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D–A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited-state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin-flip, and thus achieving near-unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7 × 10 5 s −1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR-TADF OLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR-TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited-state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.},

  abstract     = {We report on the metal-free active template synthesis of crown ether–peptide rotaxanes. A 24-crown-8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether–tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N- and C-termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide–axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.},

Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis-boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2-metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation-borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo- and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors.

  abstract     = {Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette-shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen-bonding moieties. An all-atom molecular-dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various “conformations” due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real-time high-speed atomic-force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.},

  abstract     = {Organic spin-state photoswitches represent an emerging class of molecular systems capable of reversibly modulating electronic spin states using light. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin-polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox-active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light-induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations. By exploring design principles and technological implications, this review underscores the unique position of all-organic spin-state photoswitches at the intersection of photochemistry, magnetism, and quantum materials development.},

To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium-copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover-mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100 h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0 ± 119.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2 ± 1.6%) at record-low energy consumption (3.55 kWh kg ethylamine −1 ).

Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring-expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C─H sites with tunable site-selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

The In 3+ /In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO 2 two-electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl − anions restructure the In 3+ solvation, forming stable chloro-complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO 4 2− -rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO 2 crystallization and MnO 2 /Mn 2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl − /SO 4 2− ratios and an anion-decoupled dual-electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at ∼1.7 V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode-less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying-driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4 mA cm −2 (2 mAh cm −2 ), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5 Wh kg −1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm −2 .

Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C( sp 3 )─H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C( sp 3 )─H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane-associated copper-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four-helix coiled coil, and C-terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x) n HxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen-dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper-dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.},

However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl-bridged triphenylamine (TPA)-based chromophores via metal-free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.},

However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3–30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli-responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.},

Herein, we report an ultra-low Ir anode, consisting of Re-doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrO x during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high-surface-area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three-electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts.

Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN-MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN-PyPt and DPABN-PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN-PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605 nm with a small full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 35 nm/0.118 eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2 µs (compared to 7.6 µs for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield ( Φ PL ) of 75% in doped films–representing a 4.4-fold enhancement over PhPyPt ( Φ PL = 17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN-MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay ( k r = 3.3 × 10 5 s −1 versus 0.1 × 10 5 s −1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN-PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.},

  abstract     = {The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction presents an industrial promise for carbon dioxide valorization. In this work, a dual-site Ru-RuO 2 cocatalyst anchored on Si-supported GaN nanowires (NWs) is developed for solar-powered CO 2 -to-CO conversion. The assembled Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89 mmol·cm −2 ·h −1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5 W·cm −2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28 × 10 5 h −1 . The temperature-programmed desorption, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and DFT calculations collectively reveal that the Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 enables simultaneous activation of CO 2 and H 2 . Moreover, the synergy between Ru-RuO 2 and GaN substantially reduces the reaction energy barrier from 0.83 to 0.64 eV via the key *COOH intermediate, thereby establishing a new benchmark for light-driven RWGS efficiency. This work provides a strategic design for high-performance CO 2 -to-CO conversion and opens avenues for downstream synthetic applications.},

Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs ( RuSe , OsSe , RuIP , OsIP ) containing triadic electrophilic centers (─N(δ − )─X(δ + )─N(δ − )─). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7-transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the π-cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.},

However, the structure–performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination-mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional-group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn 2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H 2 O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight-chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)-facet-dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000 h and subzero-temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

However, due to the lack of two-electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of β -diketiminate-supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (L Nacnac - κ 2 N , N′ )RE(III)(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 1-RE , RE = Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; L Nacnac = {[(2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 )NCMe] 2 CH} − ) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N′ )RE(III)( η 2 - cis -PhNNPh −• ) 2 (THF) ( 2-RE ) and 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene ( I ) via a reductive elimination-powered pathway. The key intermediate (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N' )Lu(III)(PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C )(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) ( 3-Lu ), which is formed via ortho -H deprotonation in azobenzene by the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group in 1-Lu , was isolated and structurally identified. The computational studies indicate that the subsequent η 2 -coordination of a cis -azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C group, consequently enabling the C─C cross-coupling that affords product I . In this elementary process, the two N═N π *-orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e-reductions of RE centers.},

Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system-level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge-separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge-separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron-rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF 6 − ) on the electron-deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic-rich SEI containing fluorine- and phosphorus-based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li-ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li-ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast-charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra-stable cycling performance over 50 000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g −1 with negligible capacity decay.},

  abstract     = {Exploring the impact of different dimensions on the properties and functions of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has always been a key goal, as this can provide feedback to assist in the design of advanced COFs. However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion-torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion-torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non-planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion-torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D > 3D > 2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in-plane and out-of-plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.},

Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg-C 3 N 4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (>93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen-mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes. This study provides a green and sustainable technology for both petrochemical (ethylene purification) and coal-chemical (ethylene production) industries.},

We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time-efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.},

However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self-healing cationic high-entropy gel (CHEG) G-FeCN 4−/3− -K + -Na + -Li + -Gdm + -Cs + in a multi-ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41 mV K −1 with 2.3 mV K −1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3 mW m −2 K −2 and an energy density of 4.5 J m −2 K −2 . In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13 mW m −2 K −2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B.

Herein, we report the single-site metal-nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu 10 and Cu 11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy-filling elements. The quantum-size effects endow Cu 10 and Cu 11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non-radiative decay rate and weaker electron-phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu 11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu 11 -based film demonstrated effective X-ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster-based nanomaterials for X-ray imaging in the infrared region.

  abstract     = {P-type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd-vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl-based polymeric backbone and π−π stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation-driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox-active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long-term cycling stability but also enables high-capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10-diaryl-5,10-dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual-mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated π-electron redox activation.},

  abstract     = {The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro-conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single-atom Pt-doped Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high-valence Cu sites (CuO-MOF-Pt 1 ), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the –CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron-withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu 3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C─C bond scission over CuO-MOF-Pt 1 , and a stable Cu 3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO-MOF-Pt 1 delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587 mA mM −1 cm −2 , a low detection limit of 0.93 µM, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO-MOF-Pt 1 -based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.},

  abstract     = {We report a series of shape-persistent molecular nanotubes with top rim connectivity traversing from an all- meta - ( m 4 ) to an all- para -phenylene ( p 4 ) bridged species, including all possible members in between them. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta -phenylenes relative to para -phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m 4 (∼31 kcal mol −1 ) to p 4 (∼90 kcal mol −1 ). Structural transitions from m 4 to p 4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394 nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546 nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time-dependent (TD)-DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S 1’ ) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para -phenylenes are introduced into m 4 en route to p 4 , while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased π-conjugation within the nanotube's top-segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.},

Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out-of-equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non-covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.},

In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor-acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid-liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi-axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non-radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink-free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.},

In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF), composed of one-dimensional Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains interconnected by 1,4-ndc linker, into catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . This top-down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4-ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra-low-dimensional (thickness ∼ 1.5–2.6 nm), defect-rich β -Ni(OH) 2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm −2 , surpassing commercial IrO 2 . In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH- and potential-dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni─O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89 Å under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni 2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high-performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.},

However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth-abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited-state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr₃(O)(OH)₃ nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O─H and C─H bonds (70–100 kcal mol⁻ 1 ). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground-state, pre-association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedented ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.},

ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (-OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H 2 O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H-bonding between the -OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN-g-CN, generating proton-rich interfaces and local H-bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH 4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN-g-CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH 4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85 µmol g −1 h −1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN-g-CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re-crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton-supply sites while maintaining superior CH 4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.},

In this context, space-confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement-enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in-situ/ operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D-3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in-situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)-guided design and structure–property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in-situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.},

However, the formation of carbon–sulfur (C─S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C─S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur-induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single-atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C─S cross-coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-atom-sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C─S coupling and demonstrate the power of single-atom catalysts in addressing long-standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long-wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of -extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri -anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all-red and near-infrared addressability. The excited-state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady-state and time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the -system and peri -connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid-based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.},

Despite of these benefits, the exploration of new solid bases remains challenging and is an underdeveloped area of research. In this work, we report the discovery of the inherent basicity of hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid-base neutralization reaction through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity. This study enriches the solid-base family by introducing a type of materials featured with high porosity, high crystallinity, and modular structure.},

  abstract     = {Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi-field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one-pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4-difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4-difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 /(4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light -ultrasonic activation. Under dual-field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26 mmol g −1 h −1 , outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 and (4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy-level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high-efficiency piezo-photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next-generation solar-driven catalysts.},

We develop a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) nanogenerator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1 O 2 -cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1 O 2 -generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1 O 2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single-molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.},

The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.},

However, achieving stable and reversible high-voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high-voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t 2g state of V and the e g state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na 3.5 MnV 0.5 Ti 0.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high-voltage Mn 4+/3+ and V 5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh g −1 . This strategy opens new paths for developing high-energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.},

  abstract     = {While birefringence phase-matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (Δ n < 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) region ( λ < 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a π-conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite-based NLO crystals: (C 2 N 4 OH 7 )H 2 PO 3 (GUPO) and C(NH 2 ) 3 H 2 PO 3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of π-conjugated guanidinium cations and [H 2 PO 3 ]⁻ anions enables record-breaking optical anisotropy (Δ n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full-wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 × KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 × β -BBO at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented π–π interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes π-conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.},

Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li + within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC-based weakly-solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic-dominated cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4 V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li + -PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8–4.4 V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at −20 °C, surpassing conventional EC-based electrolytes.

  abstract     = {Alkyl organoboron compounds are versatile synthons in organic synthesis, enabling rapid access to a variety of carbon─carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. As such, strategies to efficiently access carbon-boron bonds from simple chemical feedstocks are highly desirable. The radical borylation of alkyl bromides presents an attractive approach. However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition-metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal-free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen-atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Mechanistic and computational studies support a radical-chain pathway involving a silyl radical-mediated halogen-atom transfer.},

Photochemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (photo-CIDNP) offers a versatile and mild method to overcome this limitation. Here, we report on structure-photo-CIDNP relationship studies in liquid-state NMR utilizing a holistic approach. We synthesized biomimetic tryptophan–flavin diads with varying linker lengths composed of conformationally rigid oligoproline units. The predominant polyproline II (PPII) helical structure ensures consistent donor–acceptor distances. Photo-CIDNP NMR experiments revealed significant hyperpolarization effects, particularly in diads with six proline units, mimicking the spatial arrangement found in natural photoactive proteins. Our findings highlight the potential of these biomimetic diads to enhance nuclear hyperpolarization in NMR spectroscopy.

  abstract     = {The synthesis of sub-nanoscale noble metal catalysts is pivotal for enhancing electrocatalytic performance, yet achieving precise control over particle size at this scale remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high-temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (∼1 nm) Ir-based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub-nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub-IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm - 2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO 2 . Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub-nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.},

Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature-responsive reversible polymerization-dissociation dynamics and remarkable long-wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl-functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity-triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer‒π dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near-infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted π dimer absorption band centered at 960 nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin-μ (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh-brightness fluorescence imaging-guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.},

Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a key bacterial secondary messenger involved in growth, biofilm formation, virulence gene expression and others. The activation mechanisms of c-di-AMP receptors like the trimeric P II -like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger-bound forms of the 44 kDa homotrimeric P II -like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural-biology understanding.},

The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc-XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended -systems. This -system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al─P coordination polymer. sc-XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state.

Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co-doped Fe 2 O 3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co-doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co-catalyst promotes the cleavage of C─C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)-NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of ∼1.9 mA cm −2 with continuously operation of 100 h. The bias-free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683 µmol cm −2 , representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high-value chemicals reported so far.

Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D–A dyads from U-shaped to V-shaped configurations yields 3 CT-RTP with both long τ Ph (150–220 ms) and high (13%–25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D–A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin-orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V-shaped D–A dyad can potentially reduce the non-radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons ( k nr,T ), thereby facilitating the attainment of long τ Ph and high .},

  abstract     = {As electronic devices miniaturize to the nanometer scale, molecular junctions, including single and monolayer molecules, are gaining attention for applications in logic, storage, and sensing. However, comparative studies of charge transport in these two junction types are limited. Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single-molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature-independent coherent tunneling to temperature-dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration-mediated transport, while vibration-suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple-reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl-phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using Cu I -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO-reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody-conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2-step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine-labeling with bicyclo-[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) or trans -cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO-rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2 + cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl-phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl-ditriazolyl-phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single-reagent peptide-cyclization-bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide-protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide-cyclization and peptide-protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.},

In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671 nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type-I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity-sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis-driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis-mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis-based cancer immunotherapy.},

Besides near-quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co-translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase-psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.},

However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA 3 SbCl 6 , PA 6 InCl 9 , PMA 4 InCl 7 , PEA 2 InCl 5 ·H 2 O and PPA 4 InCl 7 . Tunable self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678 nm originated from [SbCl n ] 3-n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb 3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb 3+ -doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red-shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non-radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi-emission centers are constructed in Sb 3+ /Bi 3+ -doped PMA 4 InCl 7 , achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi-color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi-color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi-color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns 2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low-dimensional OIMHs.},

Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self-assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left- and right-handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)-esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant – a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self-assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.},

By utilizing GPT-4o, molecular groups such as ─SiR 3 , ─PR 2 , ─SH, and ═NH that interact effectively with BP were identified and a high-throughput workflow employing graph neural networks (GNNs) models was developed to successfully predict and screen 662 promising candidates from over 117 million molecules. These candidates were validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments, with synthesis protocols guided by GPT-4o, achieving great interfacial stabilization of BP for up to 24 days under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a new synergistic molecular engineering strategy was proposed by incorporating functional head, linker, and tail groups of molecules to even enable the use of hydrophilic molecules to stabilize BP surface, overcoming traditional design limitations.

In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism-guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin-dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high-molecular-weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine-reactive warhead to a bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.},

  abstract     = {Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition-metal-based electrodes is crucial to designing high-performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co 4 N, CoO, and Co 4 N–CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH − and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co 4 N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH − species. The one-sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co 4 N and CoO. Constructing Co 4 N–CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one-sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH − and glycerol adsorptions on Co 4 N–CoO, the OH − was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high-valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co 4 N–CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co 4 N–CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178 mV dec −1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40 mmol cm −2 h −1 . Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120-h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co-adsorptions of OH − and organics on Co 4 N–CoO interfaces.},

Herein, we developed a series of V-shaped emitters comprising electron-deficient benzothiadiazole and electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet-triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long-wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single-molecule and aggregate states. The V-shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited-state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single-molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V-shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation-caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate-state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration-independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment.

Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE-incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo / exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE-CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo -TPE-CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo -TPE-CPPs do not, opposite to strain-free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo -TPE-CPPs and Exo -TPE-CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited-state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.},

  abstract     = {The increased adoption of renewable power necessitates the development of grid-scale storage solutions, with aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs) at the forefront. Despite their potential, performance limitations arising from high solution viscosity at high concentrations of active material and rapid degradation due to active material crossover continue to pose challenges. Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox-active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer-independent control over self-condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well-defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox-active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox-active HBCs exhibited long-term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer-based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high-precision electrolyte design.},

Existing strategies often require preformed organometallic reagents or separate catalytic systems to access different alkene geometries, limiting synthetic efficiency and versatility. Herein, we report a chromium-catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem -dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio-, enantio-, diastereo-, and Z/E -selectivity. This radical-polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z -alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E -alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium-mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway. This work establishes a versatile platform for constructing stereochemically defined homoallylic alcohols and expands the synthetic utility of allyl gem -dichlorides in asymmetric catalysis.},

Potassium hexacyanochromate (K 3 [Cr(CN) 6 ]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe-Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long-term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91 Wh L −1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%–77%.

The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration-damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption-controlled one-electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical-initiated polymerization process.

Under FCC conditions, we predict an ensemble of acid sites with diverse local structures and a spectrum of acid strengths, including zeolite-like bridging Brønsted acid sites (BAS) and pseudo-bridging silanol BAS. This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions. Experiments using a model Si-stabilized alumina catalyst confirm that Brønsted acidity increases with Si content, peaking at an optimal value before declining.

Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the ─CF 2 H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li─F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated ─CF 2 CF 2 H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li + ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual-layer interface featuring a LiF-rich inner phase and a Li 2 CO 3 -dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO 2 cells (2.5 mAh cm −2 ) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140-mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles.

With CO 2 levels at 427 ppm (50% above pre-industrial levels), deploying energy-efficient carbon capture technologies is crucial. Electrochemical carbon capture processes that have been touted to have the potential to meet these needs rely on the applied cell voltage, and electron utilization (CO 2 molecules separated per electron), which has generally been asserted to have a theoretical limit of one. Here, we introduce an electron-leveraging strategy to enhance electron utilization beyond this limit to 1.43 by employing Fe-EDDHA, a redox-active coordination complex having a ligand with multiple hemi-labile coordination sites. The reversibility and robustness of the system were enabled by the efficient prevention of CO 2 reduction upon the introduction of nicotinamide as a guardian of the iron(2+) center. The proof-of-concept cyclic system exhibits a minimum operational energy of 22.6 kJ e mol −1 and an average of 63.7 kJ e mol −1 over 29 cycles, using a simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 ). Our electron-leveraging strategy holds promise for advancing energy-efficient electrochemical carbon capture technologies, and offers an alternative to prevalent redox potential shifting methods proposed to mitigate undesired electron transfer reactions in redox-active materials across diverse operational conditions.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non-antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4′s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.},

  abstract     = {Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro-)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange-correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open- and closed-shell CO 2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.},

  abstract     = {Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its abundance, cost-effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging-donor-ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA − ), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal-ion battery electrolytes.},

The conventional Haber–Bosch process relies heavily on fossil fuels, making ammonia synthesis a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we show a carbon-negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces ammonia from the air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO 2 (DAC). This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80 °C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co-produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO 2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4 mmol CO 2 /g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high-purity gaseous CO 2 . This proof-of-concept of ammonia production from air coupled with DAC paves a new way for the development of sustainable and negative-emission technologies.},

The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self-sorting of L into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right-handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.},

The construction of pseudo-dimers often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Dearomatization reactions represent an ideal method to transform planar aromatics into 3D skeletons, which has attracted increasing interest in medicinal chemistry and total synthesis. Herein, we present a dearomative dimerization of N -heteroarenes under mild photochemical conditions. Through additive regulation, the catalytic dearomative cross-coupling of two distinct quinolines could also be achieved. With aromatic compounds as coupling partners, this strategy provides a straightforward avenue to pseudo-dimers of N -heteroarenes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal the intertwined EnT/SET nature and offered guidelines for synthesizing novel bridged polycycles. In addition, this strategy provides an effective approach for constructing functional polymers with high atom economy and environmental benefits via metal-free, one-pot polymerization. Furthermore, the synthetic transformations offer a complementary route to access formal crossed products that were previously inaccessible.},

Central to the solution was a recently-developed ligand type approach, rather than brute force screening, demonstrating the usefulness of this novel concept in complex target synthesis. Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late-stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high-yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross-couplings.},

  abstract     = {Tin-based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two-dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out-of-plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi-epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced π-conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)-dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI 2 to pre-form NEA 2 SnI 4 , which subsequently converts to NEA 2 FASn 2 I 7 and ultimately FASnI 3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long-term stability. Consequently, the NEAI-based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04 cm 2 ) and 12.44% (1 cm 2 ), representing the record performance for two-step deposited tin-based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin-based perovskite films, paving the way for high-performance lead-free perovskite photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Developing stable, efficient and easily scalably-synthesized adsorbents for removal of hydrofluoroethanes to obtain high purity hexafluoroethane (C 2 F 6 ) is of great importance to the electronics industry. Herein, we report a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-TDBB) which exhibits statically as well as dynamically preferential hydrofluoroethanes (CF 3 CH 2 F and CF 3 CHF 2 ) adsorption and achieves efficient one-step C 2 F 6 purification from CF 3 CH 2 F/CF 3 CHF 2 /C 2 F 6 mixture. At 298 K, 11.7 mol kg −1 of high-purity C 2 F 6 can be obtained by HOF-TDBB from 5/5/90 CF 3 CH 2 F/CF 3 CHF 2 /C 2 F 6 mixture. Additionally, excellent stability endows HOF-TDBB with good separation ability under various harsh conditions. For example, the separation performance can be well maintained within the dozens of consecutive separation experiments. Even at 338 K, 5.7 mol kg −1 of pure C 2 F 6 can also be collected. More importantly, this material can be rapidly synthesized with a large scale by simple rotary evaporation. Combined with excellent separation performance, high stability and scalable synthesis, HOF-TDBB has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.},

  abstract     = {CO 2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C 2+ ) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single-pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO 2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong-polarized layer-covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen ( sp 3 -N)-enriched azulene-based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO 2 -diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84% C 2 Faradaic efficiency at 200 mA cm −2 , and demonstrates long-term stability over 40 h, which is the record for CO 2 RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene-polarized sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment can increase the local CO 2 /H 2 O ratio at electric double-layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop-bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong-polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C–C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion-reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO 2 RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong-polarized polymers.},

Due to its rigid structure in combination with methoxy groups on both the upper and the lower rim, the nanocone was tested for the binding of alkaline ions in solution by NMR measurements. The nanocone shows a high selectivity for binding Na + in favor of Li + and K + in CDCl 3 .

  abstract     = {Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity ( λ ) of 0.1∼0.5 W/(m·K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high-power flexible electronic devices. This study proposes a molecular level design strategy for side-chain azobenzene-containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and recyclability. By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen-bond network along the polymer chain through controlled radical polymerization, a thermal conduction network featuring “high-efficiency conduction within crystal domains and low-resistance interfacial connections” was constructed. Azobenzene moieties self-assemble into highly oriented crystalline domains through π–π stacking, where their dense packing significantly enhances phonon coupling efficiency and increases phonon mean free paths. Concurrently, the dynamic reversibility of hydrogen bonds guides domain-boundary molecular chains to form gradual phase transitions, suppressing phonon scattering at amorphous-crystalline interfaces and improving phonon transport efficiency. The film of random copolymer with 35 azobenzene units achieves an outstanding highest intrinsic λ of 2.01 W/(m·K), representing a substantial improvement over its block copolymer counterpart (with a higher crystallinity) and traditional polymers. Additionally, the photoisomerization property of azobenzene endows the material with light-controlled dynamic deformation capabilities. Meanwhile, the noncrosslinked polymer films feature easy recyclability/reprocessability.},

Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here, we present a rotaxane-based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a β-lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.},

  abstract     = {The application of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly drives the enhancement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSC). However, the transition mechanism of SAM molecules from colloidal solutions to films remains unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the SAM precursor solutions and the crystallization quality of the resulting SAM and perovskite films. Fibrous micelles of about 460 nm are found in the pristine SAMs solution, leading to nonuniform and low coverage distribution of films. Strong dipole molecules are employed to establish supramolecular interactions with SAMs, enabling the formation of highly monodisperse cubic micelles in solution (160 nm) and uniform SAM films. The contact at buried interface is determined by the balance between dipole moment and steric hindrance. Consequently, the regulated SAMs based inverted PSCs (0.09 cm 2 ) and mini-module (aperture area of 14.40 cm 2 ) achieves efficiency of 26.58% (certificated 25.81%) and 22.95%, respectively. The optimized devices retain more than 96.30% of the initial efficiency for 5,100 h under the ISOS-D-1 condition with a linear fitting extrapolation to T 90 of 11,259 h and 98.30% efficiency for 2,660 h under the ISOS-L-2 condition.

Herein, we develop an electrochemical approach for late-stage trideuteromethyl incorporation of thioether by using stoichiometric methanol- d 4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source via a sulfide alkyl displacement. This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram-scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in-situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate. A series of control experiments reveals that alkanes as the departing moiety are the key to alkyl displacement and precise late-stage trideuteration.},

Here, we established a base-free SMC reaction via a conceptually different electrophilic substitution transmetalation (EST). This transformation is applicable to a wide range of base-sensitive and sterically hindered organoborons. Key to this advance is the formation of a stable cationic palladium(II) or nickel(II) intermediate via experimental and theoretical investigations.

Control of the energy level of the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open-shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron-poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of –5.7 to –3.9 eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one-electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO ≤ -4.5 eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X-ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled-cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open-shell species.},

Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low-cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced “quinoidal” thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended π-delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.},

  abstract     = {Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic ß -fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF 3 , HF as well as PF 5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer-sphere fluorination of the metal-bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF 3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.},

  abstract     = {While polymeric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) offer scalable solutions for gas separations, their performance is fundamentally limited by the permeance-selectivity tradeoff and imprecise microporosity regulation. Herein, we propose a surface fluorination strategy using carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4 ) plasma to engineer a sub-10 nm fluorinated and crosslinked layer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated Matrimid ® HFMs. Through precise modulation of plasma parameters, we achieved controlled substitution of PDMS methyl groups/methyl hydrogen atoms with fluorine species (up to 27.7 mol% F content), 5.3-fold enhanced chain rigidity via fluorine-induced interchain interactions and steric hindrance, as well as narrowed pore size distribution with preferential ultra-micropore filling. The optimized HFM-50W-65Pa-500s membrane exhibits record-breaking He/N 2 and He/CH 4 selectivities of 1202 ± 13 and 1790 ± 12 with 170 ± 2 GPU He permeance, surpassing perfluoropolymer upper bounds and outperforming previously reported polymeric HFMs. Remarkably, it demonstrates molecular discrimination precision (α(He/CO 2 ) = 56 ± 2.2, α(He/H 2 ) = 4.1 ± 0.2) for pure-gas and attractive ternary He/(CO 2 +CH 4 ) selectivity of 1005 ± 20 under 40-bar mixed-gas conditions while maintaining 720-h operational stability. This plasma-engineered fluorination paradigm combines nanoscale precision with industrial scalability, opening new avenues for advanced membrane design.},

Herein, a novel Zn-MOF {[Zn 5 (tz) 6 (HCOO) 4 ]·2H 2 O} n ( 1 , Htz = 1,2,3-triazole) was prepared, exhibiting excellent stability in 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte for 16 weeks. 1 could maintain crystalline structure even after exposure to 9 M HCl and 2 M NaOH solutions. 1 achieved high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO 2 to CO with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FE CO ) of 94.4% under −1.5 V in artificial seawater electrolyte and 91.1% FE CO in treated natural seawater under −0.8 V, maintaining performance over 20 h. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H 2 O in [Na(H 2 O) 5 ] + to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram-scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g −1 , showing promising industrial potential in CO 2 RR. This work addresses a critical challenge of the strongly competitive HER in Na-based electrolytes during electrochemical CO 2 RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and economical catalysts for sustainable energy applications.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage devices due to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they suffer from some issues in Zn anodes, including dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction, and byproducts. Herein, an organic-riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode by introducing sodium anthraquinone-1-sulfonate (AQS) into the aqueous electrolyte with ethylene glycol (EG). In such an electrolyte, the zincophilic -SO 3 − groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anodes, and stable chemical bonds are achieved between them. After that, the low-polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone group in the AQS layer tends to repel H 2 O molecules. Simultaneously, more AQS and EG molecules are attracted and migrate toward AQS layer due to polar compatibility, constructing the AQS/EG-riched layer on the Zn anode by the interlocking effect among them. When Zn 2+ solvated structures migrate through the ORP layer on Zn anode surface, AQS and EG molecules enter Zn 2+ solvated structures, and thus, the solvated H 2 O molecules are removed. As a result, hydrogen evolution and side reactions were significantly suppressed, and the Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes during plating/stripping process reached 99.56%. To illustrate the feasibility of the ORP layer, Zn||V 2 O 5 full cells were assembled and exhibited superior cycling performance.},

  abstract     = {Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non-standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In 2 Bi 11 ) 2 Bi 2 ] 6− and the complex [La(C 5 Me 4 H) 3 ] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)─Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron-rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X-ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe–Salpeter-equation ( GW -BSE) calculations.},

The new design strategy focuses on constructing excited states with multipathway charge transfer characteristics—including multiresonance, through-bond, and through-space charge transfer—by precisely tuning the relative electron-donating strengths of the D 1 and D 2 units. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the optimized emitter, BO-BTC, achieves a well-balanced trade-off among emission efficiency, color purity, singlet–triplet energy gap, and horizontal dipole orientation ratio. Consequently, OLEDs using BO-BTC as the terminal emitter or as the sensitizer for ν -DABNA achieve high-efficiency deep-blue electroluminescence, with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage-y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid-state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion-transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X═Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL-100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF-HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5–1 nm) of MIL-100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size-selective sieving but also enable continuous Li⁺ transport through tunable host–guest interactions between the Lewis-acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI-embedded composite (E-LiI) exhibits a high Li⁺ transference number (0.88 at 25 °C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li⁺ plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen-dependent desolvation energetics and Li + transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E-LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention ∼100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high-voltage cathodes and wide-temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi-scale ion-conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high-energy-density solid-state battery systems.},

However, the absence of molecular-level insights into ion transport behavior in sub-nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit-for-purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross-linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom-scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual-coagulation bath-induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion–pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub-nanometer channels. Based on “dehydration–diffusion” mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion–pore wall interactions facilitate low-energy-barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc–iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8 mW cm −2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 . Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub-nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next-generation ion-selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.},

The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 in pure water holds great potential for sustainable industry. However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H 2 O 2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5 µmol g −1 h −1 , surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent-reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron-rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O 2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, its Ag single-atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H 2 O 2 into ·OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.},

We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)–O 2 CCF 2 X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)-mediated electrophotocatalytic CF 2 X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes.

Herein, we report an electrochemical deuterated thiol–yne reaction that delivers D-containing vinyl sulfides with up to 98% alkene selectivity and 99% D incorporation, employing disulfides (RSSR) and D₂O over an in situ sulfur-modified nickel foam (NF) electrode. Mechanistic studies reveal a reductive cleavage of RSSR to RS⁻ intermediates, which subsequently form surface nickel sulfide (NiS x ) species through R─S bond cleavage. In situ and ex situ characterizations confirm the NiS x formation and its role in reducing alkene adsorption, thereby suppressing its overreduction. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability across terminal and internal alkynes, as well as aromatic and aliphatic disulfides, furnishing 30 diverse examples of D-labeled vinyl sulfides.},

  abstract     = {Chiral metal clusters have garnered significant research interest in recent years due to their unique photophysical and chiroptical properties. Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)–silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster-assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology-dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (±)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited-state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light-emitting materials.},

Combining spectroscopic and crystallographic studies with computational bonding analysis, key insights into its constitution and stability have been gained. Expanding its synthetic potential, supporting neopentyl sodium with Lewis donor PMDETA ( N,N,N′,N″,N″ -pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) allows for the direct metalation of challenging non-activated arenes and alkenes, including the regioselective meta -functionalisation of selected 1,3-disubstituted alkyl arenes.

Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400 mA cm −2 and >60% across 100–800 mA cm −2 .

In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO 2 , as well as balanced proton supply via self-regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO 2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH) 2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO 2 RR products. This work demonstrates a strategy to construct ordered multiatomic sites for highly selective CO 2 RR at industrial-grade current density and highlights the extraordinary financial potential of electrocatalytic CO 2 RR to produce high-value deuterated chemicals.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO 2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high-value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial-engineered CoS/Co─N─C n─n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built-in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record-low onset potential of 1.12 V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO 2 ─to─CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO 2 RR, which outperform the previously reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO 2 RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50 h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co─N 4 electron-deficient and Co─S electron-rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi-electron CO 2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi-functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.},

We report the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides I 3 H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C-terminal histidine-based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self-assemble into β-sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH-dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in β-sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel β-sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong π-π stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel β-sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of β-strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH-dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I 3 GH assembly maintaining this effect while I 3 GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual β-sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side-chain interactions.},

Transition metal hydroxide (TMOH), utilized in various electrocatalysis, yet is clumsy in SOR due to overstrong adsorption toward S-containing intermediates from unsuitable electronic structure. Herein we report, for the first time, that the SOR performance of TMOH can be awakened by intercalation chemistry. Take Co(OH) 2 as a proof-of-concept demonstration, MoO 4 2− intercalated Co(OH) 2 2D nanosheet array is engineered, and presents remarkably enhanced SOR behavior with an ultralow potential of 0.29 V versus RHE to attain 100 mA cm −2 , a record Tafel slope of 27.7 mV dec −1 , and stable operation for 192 h without appreciable deterioration. The experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO 4 2− -intercalated nanoarray is advantageous for active site exposure, and boosting mass transport with enhanced sulfion enrichment and superhydrophilicity. Impressively, MoO 4 2− intercalation can manipulate electronic structure of Co(OH) 2 with downshift of d-band center, thereby weakening binding strength with HS − and S 8 , and decreasing the |ΔG s* |, eventually enhancing both activity and stability. Notably, such intercalation wake-up strategy for the SOR is general and can be extended to other oxometallate intercalated TMOH systems. This contribution provides a new paradigm to evoke TMOH for SOR electrocatalysis via elegant intercalation tactic.},

Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.},

  abstract     = {Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has garnered considerable interest in plastic recycling efforts. However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase-catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid-liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade-off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET-binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid-liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic-degrading enzymes.},

At low electric fields, p -phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules exhibit a high-conductance state, which transitions successively to two distinct low-conductance states as the external electric field strength increases. This precise control of supramolecular junctions through electric field manipulation achieved an on/off ratio G H /G L of ∼1.25×10 3 , which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the intrinsic mechanism for the observation, i.e ., electric field promoting the formation of trimer supramolecular junctions leads to the striking on/off ratio. These findings provide new insights into the design of molecular circuits with tunable conductance, paving a way for the design of molecular computation, memory devices, and sensors.},

  abstract     = {Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4-membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro-[2 + 2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and β-lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.},

Solar-driven photocatalytic technology depending on photocatalysts with matched energy band structure for simultaneously driving both O 2 reduction and water oxidation half-reactions, without necessary use of any sacrificial agent, enables green H 2 O 2 synthesis from O 2 and/or H 2 O, offering a low-energy and simple-operation process without secondary pollution while avoiding safety and environmental risk of conventional methods. Herein, a novel acylhydrazone-linked 2D COF, COF-S-OH , was prepared from benzo[1,2- b :3,4- b ':5,6- b '']trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde and 2,3-dihydroxysuccinohydrazide. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that introduction of benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups enhances the electron donor-acceptor effect in COF-S-OH , optimizes the light-harvesting and adsorption capacities to O 2 and H 2 O, and particularly enables efficient proton transfer, thereby synergistically improving photogenerated charge carrier separation and surface reaction efficiency. Consequently, COF-S-OH achieves an exceptional H 2 O 2 production rate of 10.2 mmol g −1 h −1 with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 2.1%, superior to all the thus far reported photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 synthesis. This work underscores the critical importance of carrier separation, active site, and proton supply in photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation, providing guidance for designing and fabricating next-generation photocatalysts.},

However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in-depth understanding of structural insights into P′2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn-valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P′2–P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ∼40 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ∼93 mAh g −1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%.

  abstract     = {Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid–base neutralization (e.g., ─SO₃H and ─NH₂) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water-lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra-substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single-crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation–anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water-lean conditions is confirmed by X-ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C–F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites. The approach developed herein further pushes the boundary of POS materials to withstand both aqueous and water-lean conditions.},

Here, we report for the first time a low-cost, high-performance Ni-based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C 5+ OH) in the cross-condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three-coordinated Ni─Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross-condensation to C 5+ OH.},

The biohybrid algae-based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all-synthetic equivalents. These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.},

  abstract     = {1,4-Dihydropyridines (DHPs) are valuable compounds in medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. The most straightforward pathway for preparing 1,4-DHPs is the direct 1,4-reduction of pyridines and quinolines. However, existing strategies are not effective for pyridines with electron-withdrawing substituents at the C2 position. To address this long-standing issue, a new strategy has been developed that utilizes underexplored carbodications as the Lewis acids to activate pyridines. For the first time, pyridines with -CN and -ester substituents at the C2 position have been successfully converted to 1,4-DHPs through direct reductive dearomatization in exclusive C4 selectivity. The potential utility of this 1,4-DHP synthetic protocol is demonstrated with C5-bromination, C5-trifluoromethylation, C5-deuteration, and C4-deuteration of pyridines using the in situ generated 1,4-DHPs as key intermediates.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides serve as efficient aqueous cathode materials but suffer from the challenge of structure degradation during long-term cycling applications. Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100 000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium-entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium-entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p-band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual-cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As-incorporated Co vacancies favor the β-to-γ phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (∼1.9 nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485 C g −1 was achieved after 150 000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state-of-the-art NiCo-based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.},

  abstract     = {To prevent a global water shortage crisis, we must innovate to desalinate seawater. Hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI), an energy-efficient desalination method, depends on electrode materials. Removing chloride ions (Cl − ), a key salinity factor, is vital for balanced electrode capacity. Yet, efforts focus mainly on cathode materials for Na + capture, limiting the progress of electrochemical desalination. Herein, we have developed a covalent organic framework (COF)-based redox-active anode material with excellent chemical stability and unique pseudocapacitive behavior. In the HCDI cell, the rationally designed material showed a remarkable chloride ion removal capacity (Cl-RC) of 71.5 mg g −1 in 1300 ppm saline solution with a noteworthy removal capacity rate (Cl − RCR) of 1.85 mg g −1 min −1 , while maintaining 98.7% capacity retention over 30 cycles. Under optimized conditions, the COF electrode displayed a high selectivity toward Cl − over other anions present in real-seawater samples with Cl-RC of 89 mg g −1 , implying its practical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a purposefully functionalized COF serving as an anode in HCDI, highlighting the promising role of COFs in advancing capacitive deionization technologies.},

Herein, we report a modulated, room-temperature, and fast synthesis of a highly fluorinated COF where the reaction conditions were systematically analyzed to yield single-crystalline rods of around three microns. The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF.

By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration-functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theoretical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep-level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT-modified n-i-p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS-L-2 protocol.

  abstract     = {Accelerating the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics through electrocatalysis has been regarded as one of the key factors to achieve Li–S batteries of cell-level energy densities exceeding 600 Wh kg −1 . Though single-atom catalysts (SACs), typically with symmetric M-N 4 coordination structures have demonstrated attractive electrocatalytic performance in Li–S batteries, herein we discovered that an asymmetric-coordinated metal center distinctly shifts sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics—from first-order (concentration-dependent) behavior in the symmetric-coordinated SACs—to zero-order (surface-saturated) kinetics, highlighting fundamentally altered reaction pathways, leading to a concurrent polysulfide conversion. Experimental and theoretical studies on the Ni atom-based SACs showed that symmetry breaking raises the Ni d-band center, enabling a monodentate-to-bidentate Li 2 S 4 adsorption transition, which strengthens polysulfide adsorption and shifts the rate-limiting step from sluggish solid-solid transformation (Li 2 S 2 → Li 2 S) to a more favorable liquid–solid conversion (Li 2 S 4 → Li 2 S 2 ), effectively lowering the overall energy barrier of the SRR process. Consequently, Li–S cells employing Ni-NPG, a SACs with asymmetric Ni-N 3 P 1 coordination, achieved a specific capacity of 877 mAh g −1 at 4 C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm −2 , the cell retained 92% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, outperforming conventional SACs with symmetric coordination structures.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic alkyne semi-hydrogenation (EASH) powered by renewable electricity using water as a hydrogen donor provides a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalysis. However, the current EASH systems predominantly follow hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways, which are prone to over-hydrogenation and at the same time compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we report a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism enabled on Cu(111) surface for highly efficient and selective EASH. Well-defined two-dimensional Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) facets achieve > 98% selectivity for electrochemical semi-hydrogenation of 4-aminophenylacetylene to 4-vinylphenylamine in a membrane electrode assembly reactor. The Cu nanosheets can also efficiently remove 1%–8% alkyne impurities in alkene and exhibit broad substrate scope, stereoselectivity, as well as operational stability. In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, during the PCET-mediated EASH, the covalent adsorption of alkynes and their conversion to weakly bound planar intermediates facilitate the EASH process and suppress over-hydrogenation. Interfacial K + -structured and linearly hydrogen-bonded water species further enhance EASH selectivity via proton supply and steric modulation. Radical scavenging and kinetic isotope effect studies, along with theoretical calculations, corroborate a PCET-dominated mechanism on Cu(111) surface. This work establishes a PCET-driven paradigm for selective hydrogenation beyond the conventional HAT pathways.},

Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue–green monomer-dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress–strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge-like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.},

Our findings indicate that the MS exhibits high proton transport activity (EC 50 of 0.31 mol%, relative to lipids) and significant selectivity for protons, with selectivity values of 160.3 for K + , 90.5 for Na + , and 3.5 for Cl ⁻ .

  abstract     = {The imperative to minimize iridium usage in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) process presents a pivotal challenge for hydrogen economy deployment, while inherent destabilization of iridium (Ir) active sites under corrosive operational conditions, originating from insufficient Ir bonding strength, remains a fundamental barrier. Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface-engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb-TiO 2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic-scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir─O support bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity-stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrO x /m-Nb-TiO 2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mg Ir cm −2 ), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72 V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm −2 , coupled with unprecedented durability with <1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Developing high specific energy seawater electrolyte-based zinc–air batteries (SZABs) is crucial for marine energy supply systems. However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl − in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon-supported Fe single-atom catalyst [Fe-SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe-SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential ( E onset ) and halfwave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 1.174 and 0.907 V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (E onset : 0.972 V, E 1/2 : 0.848 V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 800 mAh g −1 , surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl − adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.},

This study introduces an efficient synthesis of amidine-containing peptides by a copper-catalyzed, solid-phase-compatible multicomponent reaction (MCR), leveraging ketenimine intermediates that are generated in situ. Through the reaction of sulfonyl azides with terminal alkynes and a wide variety of amines, we establish the robust on-resin synthesis of δ/ε-amidine amino acids, arginine isologues, fluorescently labeled peptides, drug-peptide hybrids, and PEGylated derivatives. This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform. Our results underscore the synthetic versatility and functional applicability of ketenimine-based MCRs for advanced peptide modification, expanding the chemical space of peptide medicinal chemistry and therapeutics.},

Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR-free SDM method that uses DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double-stranded DNA, we employed single-stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single-stranded DNA-assisted double-stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double-stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target-specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR-incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost-effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA-cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.},

Herein, we present a novel strategy for constructing hydrogen-bonding traps in a small-pore RHO zeolite by embedding carbon dots (CDs), thereby to regulate pore microenvironment and enhance the separation ability of CO 2 /N 2 . The incorporation of CDs into the RHO zeolite is realized via a straightforward calcination process, which endows the zeolite with the defect sites rich in hydroxyl groups that easily form hydrogen bonds with CDs. Along with 1 H- 1 H DQ-SQ experiments, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations, the unique hydrogen-bonding traps are unraveled, which can selectively capture and concentrate CO 2 . As a result, the CDs-containing zeolite (R-500) showcases exceptional performance in terms of both CO 2 adsorption (90.40 cm 3 g −1 at 298K and 1 bar) and CO 2 /N 2 (15/85) separation (IAST selectivity of 1063.6). Strikingly, a superior CO 2 adsorption with a capacity of 42.9 cm 3 g −1 is achieved in the dynamic separation process (CO 2 /N 2 15/85). The facile synthesis and impressive separation performance of R-500 provides a promising solution for industrial scale CO 2 /N 2 separation in flue gas.},

Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self-sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8 mg L −1 . Additionally, we established a dual-cell factory co-expressing engineered hMAT2A-TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7 mg L −1 . Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant Escherichia coli system's scalability, producing 430 mg indolactam V, 170 mg teleocidin A1, and 300 mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.},

Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (Z F ) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al-rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (Z P ). Remarkably, ∼60% of the framework channels’ Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections’ Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Brønsted acid sites (BAS), Z F exhibits a 1.8-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Z P during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site-specific 31 P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h −1 , which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h −1 ). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to Z P . These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high-performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite-based catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The preparation of peptidic molecules is a mainstay of synthesis, creating new tools that advance chemical biology, catalysis, and drug discovery. Despite the wide adoption of methods for amide synthesis based on electrophilic acyl transfer reactions, significant limitations remain that restrict access to chemical space and plague accessible peptides with imperfect conservation of stereochemical information. These problems persist in key applications (i.e., solid phase peptide synthesis) where reagent excess can be used to drive maximal yield. As a general tactic, however, use of excess coupling agents that are often hazardous is unsustainable. Here we report the synthesis of the antiviral tridecapeptide feglymycin where half of the amides are formed using umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS) to replace conventional amide synthesis. Reliance on UmAS further allowed the enantioselective synthesis of each noncanonical residue from an inexpensive aldehyde. As a result, the most process-intensive components were simplified to a chiral Brønsted acid organocatalyst and potassium iodide/urea·hydrogen peroxide (KI/UHP). This solution-phase total synthesis illustrates the harmonious, strategic application of complementary amide synthesis methods, and it serves as a touchstone for the green synthesis of peptides composed of noncanonical amino amides.},

  abstract     = {Metal–organic cages with polyoxometalate (POM) clusters as nodes are an emerging frontier of coordination-driven self-assembly, but they have been limited to homoleptic cages, which are composed of only one type of organic ligands. We show here that, in the construction of POM–organic cages with Keggin-type {SiW 9 Ni 4 } cluster nodes, introducing a secondary ligand may change the self-assembly processes in two distinct ways: by coordination or as supramolecular templates. The use of a tetracarboxylate panel L C , in complementary to a bent dicarboxylate linker (L A or L B ), allows the integrative self-sorting to give heteroleptic coordination cages POM 8 L A/B 4 L C 4 ( 3 or 4 ) that are otherwise not accessible through either ligand alone. The aromatic L C can also alter the outcome of the self-assembly process by acting as a non-coordinating template, transforming a coordinatively frustrated, homoleptic cage POM 8 L D 6 ( 5 ) to POM 8 L D 5 ( 6 ). These octa-Keggin cages were all shown to be efficient molecular catalysts for visible-light-driven hydrogen production; for 4 , in particular, an apparent turnover number of 4910 was achieved in 5 h under minimally optimized conditions. Mechanistic studies confirmed the existence of both reductive and oxidative quenching processes, with the former being dominant.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of high-performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light-driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light-driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible-light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light-driven nanomotors. Among them, the m -aminophenol-formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine-quinoid structure with a low HOMO–LUMO gap (1.90 eV). These nanomotors feature broad-spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H 2 O 2 concentration, enabling precise control over in-plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO 2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light-driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Defect structures within the carbon matrix play a crucial role in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe single atom and nitrogen-doped catalysts (Fe-N-C SACs). However, overlooking the O 2 pre-adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe-N-C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe-N v -C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O 2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe-N v -C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe-N-C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules results in the d-band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules on Fe single-atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.},

Here we present the synthesis, electronic structure analysis, photophysical characterization, and initial demonstration of water-soluble amphiphilic molecular wires, consisting of a rosamine, as a fluorescent PET acceptor, and a PET donor consisting of a conjugated bridge terminated by dimethylaniline (DMA). The rosamine moiety is extended by several carboxylates or polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, which render the probes highly water-soluble and facilitate labeling of phospholipid membranes, positioning molecules in proper orientation. The probes produced functional responses in electrically stimulated mouse cardiomyocytes and as well as in intact neurohypophysis, and in glucose-stimulated murine islets of Langerhans.

Here we report atomically dispersed manganese‒sulfur (Mn─S) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively drive enzymatic catalysis, in which the S atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn site to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also functions as the secondary catalytic site for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption. Consequently, this metal‒nonmetal dual-site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity. As a potential application, the Mn─S catalytic pairs with coupled catalase-, peroxidase-, and oxidase-mimicking activities are successfully demonstrated for synergistic tumor catalytic therapy.

And now, the host–guest-doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host–guest-doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the “strong assisting weak” effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79 s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5 s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long-lived RTP materials.},

By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH 3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first-principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity.

However, the investigation of solid-state LOBs is limited with little understanding of their discharge and charge processes. In this work, a polymer-based solid-state LOB is used to investigate the effect of discharge rate on lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ) formation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and cycle performance. Notably, we observe a counterintuitive trend: Li 2 O 2 particle size increases with increasing discharge current density, in contrast to liquid systems. This behavior arises from inherent space charge layers that restrict Li⁺ transport under high current, and spatially heterogeneous active sites at the solid electrolyte–cathode interface, directly evidenced by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which govern nucleation accessibility and promote site-selective Li 2 O 2 growth. Furthermore, higher current densities improve ORR and OER efficiency but accelerate anode degradation, while lower currents promote side reactions. These opposing effects result in a trade-off that defines an optimal discharge rate (0.1 mA cm⁻ 2 ) for maximizing cycle life. This study provides a new mechanistic perspective on discharge-driven processes in solid-state LOBs and offers practical guidelines for performance optimization in future high-energy battery systems.},

However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic-based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 (4Br2FBZ = 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine-π, which achieves a stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection.

This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48 µC cm −2 and a high Curie temperature of 408 K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self-powered X-ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 ), and exceptional detection stability.

  abstract     = {In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple-phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well-defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple-phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen-enriched transport channels. Under low-platinum loading conditions (−0.05 mg Pt cm −2 ) in a H 2 ─O 2 PEMFC, the COF-modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55 W cm −2 , 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high-performance low-platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.},

  abstract     = {In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual-functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni–DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn 2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn 2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni–DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g −1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g −1 , respectively after 10 000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni–DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni–DAPTO cathodes and Ni–DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g −1 . These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high-performance and long-lasting aqueous secondary batteries.},

  abstract     = {Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single-structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm-eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV-induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6 (MC)⊂CB[8], a self-assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day–night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 µg mL −1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%). This work establishes a paradigm for developing light-responsive supramolecular agrochemicals that combine structural dynamism with enhanced functionality, offering sustainable solutions against plant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro- and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid-state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three-armed diazo crosslinker ( 3G ) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C─H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18 mJ cm −2 , in stark contrast to 200–500 mJ cm −2 for diazirine-based crosslinkers) required for sufficient crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G , and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G -based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi-layer structures for dual-mode anti-counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system-level devices.},

  abstract     = {Structural, chemical, and extrinsic modifications of graphene-based nanostructures enable bandgap tuning, optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum materials design. A well-known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp 2 -hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone-Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene-based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional SW-based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible-light-induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW-based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8 eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene-bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon-based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next-generation optoelectronic devices.},

While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process-specific phase diagrams to model A-element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti 3 AlC 2 , V 2 AlC, and Ti 2 AlN in ZnCl 2 molten salt, we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials—defined here by the Al-to-Zn exchange—of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.},

Although selective and iterative substitutions at silicon have achieved notable achievements, methods for fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes are still lacking. Herein, we established the key dephenylative etherification reaction coupling phenylsilanes and alcohols to alkoxysilanes and then developed triphenylchlorosilane (Ph 3 SiCl) as the surrogate to tetrachlorosilane for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center as fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes.

Recently a promising family of photoswitches based on the rhodanine motif was described. Here, the photophysics of a typical example are investigated by ultrafast UV and IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, the photophysics are very different to and more complex than those of closely related monomethine photoswitches, which relax by ultrafast internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the rhodanine photoswitch, the allowed Franck–Condon excited state also relaxes on a sub-picosecond timescale, but the ground state is repopulated only after several hundred picoseconds. Instead, the Franck–Condon state relaxes through (at least) two intermediate states. These states are characterized by transient spectroscopy, and the reaction pathway is modeled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggests that a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is rapidly populated via coupling of a nearly degenerate nπ * state populated by ultrafast internal conversion from the bright ππ * state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has important implications for the synthesis, analysis, and application of rhodanine photoswitches.},

Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high-entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B-site elements (Pb 2+ , Sr 2 ⁺, Ca 2 ⁺, Cd 2 ⁺, and Mg 2 ⁺). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr 3 NCs (∼7 nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band-edge shallow states. We show that these HEA-induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.},

However, simultaneously increasing the electron density, improving the electron transfer, CO 2 capture, and catalytic efficiency within nanopores remains a challenge for optimizing the performance of such nanoreactors. Here, micro- and mesoporous triazine-COFs were in situ grown on amino-modified BiVO 4 nanosheets (BVO), respectively, obtaining two-dimensional heterojunctions. A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf 2 ]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL-confined COF mesopore-nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38-fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH 4 in pure water under UV-vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z-scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi-hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM] + cations, ii) promoted CO 2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO 2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM] + cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.},

Herein, we report the directional depolymerization of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) to ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) under solution conditions through innovative design of catalyst structure. The (BisSalen)Al catalysts, featuring a confined cavity, demonstrated exceptional performance, enabling highly selective depolymerization of PCL with excellent monomer selectivity (>99%) and yield (93%). The mechanism of selective depolymerization was further investigated in detail through controlled NMR experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work reveals the correlation between catalyst structure and depolymerization selectivity, providing theoretical guidance for the design of directional depolymerization catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH * desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH * desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn 3 O 4 , in which Ru clusters are decorated on Mn 3 O 4 via Ru─O─Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn 3 O 4 facilitates the water dissociation, whereas the formed heterointerface can efficiently desorb OH * via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec −1 , surpassing recently reported Ru-based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 increase about 11- and 8-fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high-performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.},

Genetic manipulation of the lipid metabolic network or supplementation of a high-fat diet/oleic acid (OA) are the traditional routes for voluntarily triggering LD formation in cells and animals to study the role of LDs in disease biology. We developed a new screening platform for identifying small molecule-based LD inducers, which identified linoleic acid (LOA, diunsaturated fatty acid) as a better tool than OA (monounsaturated fatty acid) in promoting LD formation in cells. Subsequent screening and validation discovered a novel heterocyclic compound and respective iron complex for promoting a rapid organization of endogenous lipids into droplets by mimicking desaturase function and modulating oxidative lipid metabolism. Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H 2 S from CO 2 , another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H 2 S from CH 4 , the selective removal of H 2 S from CO 2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H 2 S, departing from conventional acid-base interaction-based liquid-phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H 2 S. Dispersion-corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H 2 S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H 2 S into [HS]⁻ species. The unique cascade H 2 S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H 2 S, endowing the [6ca]-derived ILs with unprecedented high H 2 S capacities and record-breaking H 2 S/CO 2 selectivities (67–89 at 1.0 bar and 229–319 at 0.1 bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy-efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H 2 S/CO 2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.},

Particularly, the β-turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability. Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-decorated poly(L-cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic-aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from β-sheet to β-turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual-modal approach to real-time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors. Such conformation-mediated structural and functional transformations hold significant potential for specific drug delivery and theragnosis of diseases such as cancer.},

Here, we report a facile yet effective biomineralization strategy to construct nanovaccine (OVA-ATV@MnO₂) that co-delivers ovalbumin (OVA) and atorvastatin (ATV) within MnO₂ matrix. The ATV-mediated nanovaccine reprograms endosomal trafficking by inhibiting the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thereby delaying endosomal maturation and preventing antigen diversion to degradative lysosomes. This intervention significantly enhances antigen preservation and MHC-I presentation in DCs. Simultaneously, the MnO₂ framework not only stabilizes the vaccine nanostructure but also releases Mn 2 ⁺ ions as an adjuvant to potently activate the cGAS-STING pathway, amplifying DC maturation and antitumor T-cell priming. In vivo studies demonstrate that the nanovaccine induces robust tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable prophylactic immunity. By synergistically rewiring intracellular antigen trafficking and amplifying STING-mediated immune activation, this mineralized vaccine platform provides a transformative strategy for precise cancer immunotherapy.},

Here, we found that a highly conserved G-rich region surrounding transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of Sox2 gene can form G-quadruplex (Sox2G4) both in vitro and in cells. More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) rather than Λ-f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that Δ-f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that targeting G-quadruplexes of pluripotency genes can regulate the fates of CSCs.

Their counteranions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Brønsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis-acidic anion, BBcat , based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis-acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition-metal catalysis to recognize Lewis-basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu 4 N – BBcat , 31 P NMR chemical shift of O═PEt 3 significantly lower-shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX-BBcat exhibited an 8.2-fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX-BArF consisting of the non-coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis-basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis-basic sites, located at remote positions to the C─H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis-basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition-metal center and the counteranion.},

  abstract     = {Protein-based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and the ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood–brain-barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled-coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of the targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7-fold increase in doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulation compared to TRAP and demonstrates a 1.3-fold improvement in uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near-infrared (NIR) dye-labelled TMPA (NIR-TMPA) is intravenously administered to mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and to control mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model reveals a significantly prolonged distribution-phase (short-phase) half-life in tumor-bearing mice compared to control, while the elimination-phase (slow-phase) half-life remains comparable between groups. This suggests altered early-phase kinetics likely due to tumor-associated sequestration or retention. The resulting increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in tumor-bearing mice supports enhanced accumulation or slower clearance. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs and 3D reconstructions of whole mouse heads further corroboratesa preferential localization of NIR-TMPA in tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of TMPA and its future derivatives for targeted GBM therapy.},

This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500–800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1–100 copies per well. A PEGNAB-based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost-effectiveness, and ultra-high sensitivity. In a double-blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Ethanol and methanol on Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC are electro-oxidized to acetate ion and CO 2 as the final product, respectively. Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC exhibits long-term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate.

  abstract     = {Transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well-established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom-substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here, we disclose a cobalt-catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac) 2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2-, 4,1-, 1,4-, and 4,3-hydroboration products in good yields and high regio- and enantioselectivities (up to >99%). Mechanistic studies, including deuterium-labeling, kinetic, and UV–vis experiments, suggest the involvement of Co–H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late-stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.},

  abstract     = {The periphery surrounding oxide-supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal-oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO 2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface-to-surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15 nm. Operando modulation–excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface-bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO 2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal-specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal-oxide interfaces.},

This was used as a model reaction to investigate the mechanism of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) in our previously reported asymmetric [3+2] photocycloaddition. They proposed a new electron transfer pathway in which the electron from the excited state of the radical anion 4DPAPN* •− solvated in acetonitrile. This article replies to their Correspondence, including: the experimental and theoretical analysis on the driving force of electron transfer and a series of new experiments conducted with purer reagents under more stringent conditions, which suggest that the process of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) followed by ConPET cannot be excluded, as proposed in our previous publication. Yet, Ceroni et al.’s efforts to study organic photochemical reactions using time-resolved spectroscopy remain worthwhile, and their proposed mechanism also led us to consider other possible pathways for the reaction. This article concludes with a series of constructive suggestions for further studying the ConPET mechanism using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and other techniques.},

A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO) 4 ] – anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PN H P ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(–I) centers. Then, the PhSiH 2 group at the Co(–I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + cation, regenerating the [Co(CO) 4 ] – species. [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H 2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH-assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.},

  abstract     = {Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV-transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade-off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual-sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly-shaped UV organic–inorganic hybrid crystals—(C 6 H 4 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (PCSF) and (C 10 H 6 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (QCSF)—in which planar π-conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb 3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense π–π stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record-high birefringence of Δ n = 0.87 at 546 nm, surpassing all previously reported lone-pair-containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN 2 O 2 F] coordination geometry, near-planar molecular configuration, and extended π-electron delocalization. First-principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the π-conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next-generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.},

  abstract     = {Sub-Ångstrom pore engineering offers a new paradigm for molecular separations. Here, we report sucrose-derived carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) with precisely tailored sub-Ångstrom slit pores that enable diffusion-gated kinetic sieving for the challenging separation of alkenes from alkanes. The optimized materials, C-Suc-650 and C-Suc-750, set new industry-leading standards for the kinetic separation of C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 and C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 , respectively. Through a combination of breakthrough experiments, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) modeling, we demonstrate that these sieves consistently achieve >99.9% alkene purity, with outstanding selectivity, rapid uptake kinetics, and remarkably low energy consumption. Mechanistic studies reveal that slit pore architecture uniquely enhances alkene diffusion while hindering alkane movement, establishing a clear design principle for next-generation, energy-efficient gas separations. These results provide a blueprint for exploiting diffusion-gated kinetic sieving at the sub-Ångstrom scale to address longstanding challenges in industrial gas purification.},

  abstract     = {Privileged chiral catalysts have transformed asymmetric synthesis, conferring generality to processes that are routinely leveraged in the construction of societally important functional small molecules. Operating in the ground state, these catalysts are conspicuous in their ability to simultaneously regulate reactivity and translate chiral information, often with broad substrate tolerance: this technology continues to expedite chemical space exploration. In stark contrast to the specificity of many enzymatic transformations, this promiscuity affords remarkable latitude for creative endeavour in synthesis. Given the transformative impact that stereoselective photocatalysis has had over the last decade, identifying privileged chiral catalysts that permit reactivity and enantioselectivity to be regulated in excited-state scenarios has emerged as an attractive but challenging frontier. Providing solutions to address this paradox will require the reactivity/selectivity divide to be reconciled through the validation of chiral scaffolds that effectively operate in non-ground state environments. Inspired by the venerable treatment by Yoon and Jacobsen entitled “ Privileged chiral catalysts ” ( Science 2003 , 299 , 1691–1693), this mini-review is intended to survey the conception and evolution of privileged chiral photocatalyst scaffolds, and offer a perspective on emerging contenders.},

  abstract     = {Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymeric mixed ionic–electronic conductors (PMIECs) have been widely used in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their structural diversity and the tunability of their frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels. However, the slower development of n-type materials compared to p-type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene-based donor building block, 2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)fumaronitrile ( DTFMCN ), for D–A conjugated n-type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one-step process. The DTFMCN-based D–A conjugated polymers, S-DTFMCN and B-DTFMCN , exhibit extremely low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n-type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra-low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high µ C* values of 13.49 and 13.57 F cm −1 V −1 s −1 , respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n-type OECT devices reported to date. This study highlights the effectiveness of DTFMCN in improving the operational stability of n-type OECT devices, offering promising potential for applications in bioelectronics.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-performance elastomers for additive manufacturing requires overcoming complex property trade-offs that challenge conventional material discovery pipelines. Here, a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress–strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi-component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (>10 MPa) and high strain at break (>200%). Analysis of the high-performing materials revealed structure-property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine-guided, human-augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi-objective materials optimization.},

While combinations of Ni pre-catalysts and Al additives are known for site-selective C─H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD) 2 ] and [(BDI)AlH 2 ] ( 1 ; BDI = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl-β-methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni–Al heterometallic complex [( η 4 -COD)Ni{( μ -H) 2 Al(BDI)}] ( 2 ; COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp 2 )─H activation of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H 2 evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy 3 . The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1 st order in PCy 3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9–1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C─H oxidative addition and H 2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.},

  abstract     = {Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chain-based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors , namely, the ∠(O─Nb─O′) bond angle, χ [F,Nb,Nb′,F′] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO 2 F 4 ] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating π-conjugated biuret (C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 ) molecules with optimally aligned 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chains, we synthesized (H 3 O)(Biu) 2 (NbOF 4 ) (Biu = biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record-breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH 2 PO 4 , among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (Δ n = 0.062 @1064 nm) and wide band gap ( E g = 4.50 eV) further support its potential as a high-performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next-generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.},

We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically-controlled higher-order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase-separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.},

Extending the device durability is still very challengeable for these emitters. Deuteration of emitters to slow down their degradation and lengthen device lifespan is a promising strategy. However, how to access deuterated high-order MR-TADF emitters remains to be explored. Herein, a synthetic protocol of high-order B/N products is proposed using deuterated starting materials and sequential borylation. Combining with fine-tuning electronic effect through adjusting position of tert -butyl ( t Bu) substituents, we successfully obtained deuterated triboron MR-TADF material ω’-DABNA-D that delivers precisely tuned pure-green emission with close-to-unity quantum yield and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The resulting binary OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% at maximum and 30.7% at 1000 cd m −2 . Additionally, an Ir(ppy) 3 -sensitized device shows excellent operational stability, with an extrapolated lifetime (LT 80 ) of 6078 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 .

Here, we report the first-in-class mitochondria-targeting anion channels derived from a structurally simple tetrabenzylphosphonium framework, in stark contrast to its phenyl-based counterpart, which lacks anion transport activity. Structural and computational analyses underscore the critical role of the methylene (CH 2 ) linkers in the benzyl groups. These CH 2 units reduce positive charge delocalization to enhance σ-hole–anion interactions, while also enabling H-atoms from both the CH 2 linkers and aromatic rings to cooperatively form multiple C─H⋯anion H─bonds. In further conjunction with the rigid benzene rings, they help create sufficient spatial voids to accommodate anion translocation, collectively facilitating and energizing the anion transport process. Among the series studied, those bearing methyl and tert -butyl substituents exhibit the highest transport activity via a channel mechanism, with a conductance value as high as 26.5 ± 0.8 pS. Furthermore, leveraging the cationic nature of the quaternary phosphonium center, this family of anion channels readily achieves targeted mitochondrial localization, demonstrating potent anticancer activity, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.42 to 3.04 µM across three cancer cell lines.},

  abstract     = {Surface grafted organozirconium catalyzes C─H/Et─Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt 3 , to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(O t Bu) 3 @SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3–700 ( 1 ) catalyst contains monopodal ≡SiO─Zr(O t Bu) 3 and only a few residual silanols (<5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille's heel of 1 , providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si─O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with ─SiMe 3 . Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid-state 13 C and 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(O t Bu) 3 /SiMe 3 @SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3–700 ( 2 ), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt 3 . C─H alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1-dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1 , and in >95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2 -catalyzed C─H alumination, providing a route to AlMe 3 .},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE-5d, TPE-10d, and TPE-20d), combined with steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter-mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE-20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure–property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.},

However, most conventional systems suffered poor thermal stability of chiral configurations and low luminescent dissymmetry factors. Herein, we reported a pair of triptycene-bridged enantiomers with a point chirality and a donor–acceptor architecture. Robust point chirality, originating from quaternary bridgehead-carbons, prevented the common racemization during thermal sublimation. Thanks to the reduced electric transition dipole moment (µ e ) in donor–acceptor architecture, tuned parallel alignment between the further reduced µ e and magnetic transition dipole moment (µ m ) in the exciplex emitter, and the utilized chiral exciplex host for energy transfer to phosphor, the corresponding dissymmetry factors of emitters were sequentially amplified from 3.3 × 10 −4 to 4.5 × 10 −3 , and to 8.1 × 10 −3 . Remarkably, the CP-OLED device simultaneously achieved outstanding electroluminescence performance with a high external quantum efficiency of 31.8% and a large dissymmetry factor of 2.2 × 10 −2 . This work provided a viable pathway for developing high-performance CP-OLED materials through synergistic structural, material, and device engineering.},

Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H-dependent C═N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H-dependent cellular functions.

Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene-protected Cu(I)-alkynide cluster, {NaCu 35 (TC4A) 4 (Ph-C≡C) 20 } ( Cu 35 ), which exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. This metastable cluster can grow into a Cu 36 species via ion substitution or undergo thermal-induced fragmentation to form a smaller Cu 14 cluster. Under thermal etching by Ag + ion, structural reconstruction is triggered, leading to the formation of the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 and Cu 40 Ag 16 clusters. The structural reorganization significantly alters the catalytic outcomes in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Although the monometallic Cu 35 and Cu 14 favor gaseous CH 4 /C 2 H 4 production, the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 demonstrates remarkable selectivity for ethanol synthesis. Notably, Cu 14 Ag 6 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 49.27% for ethanol production, alongside a high partial current density of −67.94 mA cm −2 . This marks the highest ethanol selectivity reported to date for atomically precise cluster catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, compared to homometallic Cu⋯Cu dual sites (which typically favor C 2 H 4 ), the unique Ag⋯Cu⋯Cu trimetallic microstructure in Cu 14 Ag 6 is more thermodynamically favorable for asymmetric C─C coupling between *CHO and *OCH 2 , facilitating the formation of the key *CHO−*OCH 2 intermediate, which drives the ethanol-selective pathway.},

  abstract     = {The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer–Nørskov d-band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold-twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high j k,m value of 106.6 mA mg Ni −1 , which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold-twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW cm −2 with H 2 /O 2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent long-term cycling performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)-free HEMFCs.},

Traditional heavy-metal-based and crystalline systems are often toxic and environmentally sensitive, while strategies involving host–guest doping and encapsulation frequently suffer from phase separation and limited controllability—ultimately resulting in poor repeatability and restricted applications. Here, we developed a novel polyphenol-mediated molecular splicing and ring-locking strategy to incorporate benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BZT) into polyphenol molecules, yielding a range of eco-friendly and processable amorphous single-component systems with a lifetime of up to 124 ms. Experimental and calculational analyses confirm that phosphorescence arises from synergistic interactions between polyphenol and BZT. Furthermore, phosphorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via nanoprecipitation in tetrahydrofuran with 30% water content. These well-dispersed, metal-free NPs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, facilitating time-resolved luminescence imaging with minimal background fluorescence interference both in vitro and in vivo. This research establishes a versatile and sustainable design strategy for developing high-performance amorphous RTP materials using plant polyphenols, offering promising prospects for advanced biomedical applications.},

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1α-target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PS B -BCB-04 stabilized HIF1α under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC ( k i =  7.9 ± 1.3 nM) and preventing VHL-mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a sevenfold difference in its EloBC-binding capacity. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1α degradation enabled isomer-specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1α and provided a new toolbox for on-demand photocontrol over the HIF-signaling pathway as well as VHL-mediated degradation.},

Although Li 2 MnO 3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox-active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural-engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel-layered heterostructures (designated as LMO-SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O 2− ) and molecular oxygen (O 2 ) – the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese-based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li + diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO-based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high-capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single-atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high-activity candidates. High-throughput screening of 261 transition metal single-atom-doped metal oxides (M SA -MO x ) identified nine top-performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential < 0.5 V), including Mn SA -RuO 2 and Fe SA -TiO 2 (theoretical overpotential < 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant-potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of Mn SA -RuO 2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, ML prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO 2 cathode in high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO 2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high-efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr 2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO 4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO 4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de-solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self-optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr-MnO 2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), better rate capability (115 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g −1 , when compared with pure δ-MnO 2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries and beyond.},

The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding α-chloro-β-keto esters, showing high D- syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar = 2-furyl) and simotaxel (Ar = 2-thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross-coupling chemistries performed on the p -bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti- conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an ( S )-configured C─Cl bond, in addition to the D-facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short-chain dehydrogenase enzyme.},

The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late-stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram-scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number >850.

Herein, a 2D c- MOF single crystal (Cu-TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH-TBP) ligand. Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic-level crystal structure of Cu-TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer-stacking. Cu-TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 × 10 −3 S m −1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox-active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu-TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g −1 at 0.25 A g −1 , exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g −1 ).

This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe-cMOFs) that enable efficient NO 3 RR via an unconventional [6 + 2] electron-transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2 + 6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO 3− to *NH 2 OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO 2− and guarantees selective NH 3 production. The CoFe-cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH 3 -producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h −1 cm −2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn-NO 3 − battery prototype incorporating CoFe-cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm −2 peak power density with stable NH 3 production.

These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity but also exhibit excellent physicochemical stability and contain abundant redox-active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT-COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (<0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 .

In the bond rotation transition state, these electrophilic groups form close contact with an electronegative C═O oxygen. Thus, strong electrophilic groups significantly lowered the rotational barrier. As a result, the rotational barriers were inversely correlated with the strengths of the electrophiles. The rotational barriers were measured by dynamic NMR (EXSY), enabling the quantification across a wide range of types of electrophiles. Computational analysis confirmed that the observed variations arose from intramolecular interactions in the transition state, where the C═O oxygen served as a probe of both the electrophilic group's electrostatic potential and steric accessibility. By simultaneously capturing attractive and repulsive transition state interactions, E RB provides an effective means of predicting electrophilicity and reactivity trends across a broad range of electrophiles and reaction types. The utility of E RB was initially validated using a series of rotors containing Michael addition electrophiles, followed by broader application to a diverse array of reactions involving sp 3 and sp 2 electrophiles, including S N 2, S N Ar, Pd-oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions.},

Three new crystal structures are identified: a three-dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated Ca 2+ complexes for x = 1, a molecular structure of neutral complexes for x = 4, and a structure of cationic complexes for x = 6. The thermal stability generally decreases with increasing CH 3 NH 2 content, and samples with x > 2 slowly release CH 3 NH 2 in “open” atmosphere at room temperature, but are stabilized in “closed” environments, e.g. capillaries. The ionic conductivity increases with CH 3 NH 2 content and correlates with increased void space and structural flexibility, reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 5.0·10 −5 S cm −1 at 60 °C for x = 4. Moreover, the effect of nanocomposite formation provides mechanical stability and a doubling of the ionic conductivity for Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ·4CH 3 NH 2 − MgO (50 wt%), reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 1.3·10 −4 S cm −1 at 60 °C.

Conventional sequential treatments for their simultaneous removal face major issues of catalyst deactivation and byproduct generation. Here, we develop a subtle strategy using light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis with Fe(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-Feᴵᴵ) to achieve redox-coupled conversion of NO and SO 2 mixtures. LMCT excitation in EDTA-Fe II induces directional charge separation under irradiation, routing photogenerated electrons (e⁻) to Feᴵᴵ for driving selective NO-to-N 2 conversion (selectivity: 99.89%), while photogenerated holes (h + ) oxidize SO 2 to SO 4 2 ⁻ (selectivity: 96.34%). This spatial segregation of redox pathways suppresses N 2 O generation, enabling continuous operation with 90.3% NO and nearly 100% SO 2 removal efficiency. Mechanism studies reveal the LMCT-enhanced charge transfer from carboxyl/amino groups to Fe centers, while in situ EPR confirms the •SO 3 2 ⁻ radical-mediated h + scavenging that accelerates charge separation and utilization.

  abstract     = {Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL-mediated signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution-processable, n-doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n-PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, an efficient, scalable and cost-effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n-PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone-mediated or copper-catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO 2 -catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 )-catalyzed polymerization of n-PBDF. Remarkably, MoO 3 at parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations achieves near-quantitative monomer conversion (>99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain-growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high-quality n-PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO 3 mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This innovation not only provides a scalable, low-cost route to high-quality n-PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.},

These fungi are distinguished by a distinctive cell wall architecture further reinforced by two virulence-associated layers, melanin and capsule, rendering them insensitive to antifungal agents targeting the cell wall, such as echinocandins. The molecular interplay between these three biomolecular layers remains poorly understood. Here, we employ solid-state NMR spectroscopy to examine intact cells of both wild-type and capsule-deficient strains of C. neoformans , along with melanized cells. High-resolution 13 C and 1 H data revealed five distinct structural forms of α-1,3-glucans that play versatile roles in forming the rigid cell wall scaffold by interacting with chitin microfibrils and chitosan, and in stabilizing the mobile matrix by associating with β-1,6-glucan and a small fraction of β-1,3-glucan. Two primary forms of α-1,3-glucans were distributed throughout the wall, capable of hosting melanin deposition in the inner domain and capsule attachment on the cell surface. These findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding the cryptococcal cell wall and its interaction with two key virulence factors on opposite sides, raising critical biochemical questions that could inform the development of more effective antifungal treatments for cryptococcosis.},

However, their costly synthesis and the vague understanding of their mechanical property hinder extensive progress. Herein, the supramolecular complexation approach is developed for the feasible construction of MGMs with hierarchical structures, while in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is applied to monitor the mechanical deformation of MGMs for microscopic understanding. Amphiphilic oligomers are assembled from the ionic attraction of 1 nm molecular clusters and further pack into ordered hexagonal phases (HEX1) driven by hydrophobic interaction. Interestingly, stretching can induce structural orientation, and thus triggering the transformation of HEX1 to another hexagonal phase (HEX2) with denser packing, accounting for the tensile yield behavior of the MGMs. The supramolecular structure endows hierarchical structure relaxation dynamics, enabling their unique viscoelasticity with a resilient rubbery plateau even at high temperatures. Their flexibility renders the capability to facilely process the MGMs into highly oriented films and coatings with anisotropic properties for potential applications in optical device fabrications.},

  abstract     = {High-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial for advancing all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain-boundary-free nature, which facilitates intimate solid-to-solid contact and uniform lithium-ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen–chlorine dual-anion framework, formulated as Li 3 x +0.1 ZrN x Cl 4.1 , for high-voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li 2 ZrCl 6 with a triclinic structure, increased N 3− substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 ), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li + conductivity from 0.46 to 3.01 mS cm −1 , alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8 V. This dual-anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high-energy LiNi 0.83 Co 0.06 Mn 0.11 O 2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g −1 at 4.5 V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long-term cycling stability exceeding 3000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50  °C) and higher cut-off voltages (up to 4.8 V). These results highlight the promise of dual-anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next-generation SSEs beyond traditional single-anion systems.},

  abstract     = {n -type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ∼1.8 at 873 K in n -type PbSe doped with MoCl 5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl 5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4 d orbital hybridized with the Se 4 p -Pb 6 p . This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n -type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (σS 2 ) of ∼21 µW cm −1 K −2 at 873 K for PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 . When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano-heterostructures (5-30 nm) of PbSe-MoSe 2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano-heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κ lat ) of 0.20 W m −1 K −1 at ∼725 K in PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 sample.},

In this work, we report a generalizable solution for selective alkylation chemistry that combines the selectivity of enzyme catalysis with the reactivity of off-the-shelf alkylation reagents. We employ engineered transferases in a modular cyclic cascade and use functionalized N -heteroarenes as challenging proof-of-concept substrates. This catalytic alkylation approach is mild, highly chemo- and regioselective, proceeds on gram-scale, provides rapid access to important N -alkylated heterocyclic building blocks and enables challenging late-stage alkylations. This study demonstrates a generalizable strategy to streamline synthetic routes to many pharmaceutically important compounds by selective biocatalytic alkylation of polyfunctional molecules and ambident nucleophiles.},

Although Zn (100) exhibits faster Zn electroplating/stripping kinetics than Zn (002), its high chemical reactivity results in susceptibility to water-induced side reactions. Herein, a two-pronged electrolyte engineering strategy is proposed to enhance the reversibility of Zn anodes, that is, modulating vertically oriented Zn (100) plating while simultaneously constructing a water-poor electrical double layer (EDL). Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB − ) anions of sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) function as a Zn 2+ trapping agent at the inner Helmholtz layer, displacing active water molecules and inducing the preferential deposition of Zn on the Zn (100) crystal facets, thus effectively inhibiting both side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, a symmetrical cell with the ZnSO 4 /NaDFOB electrolyte exhibited a long lifetime of over 950 h under severe conditions of 10 mA cm −2 and 5 mAh cm −2 . Furthermore, a practical Zn||NH 4 V 4 O 10 pouch cell could achieves a high capacity of 156 mAh at industrial-level mass loading of 16.6 mg cm −2 .

The composite showcases outstanding CO 2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FE formate ) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of −0.5 V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long-term stability over 150 h.

  abstract     = {Integrating different polymer types into a unified system in a thoughtful manner leverages their complementary advantages, providing a promising strategy for developing high-performance materials. Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs), characterized by their unique spatial entanglement, exhibit distinctive performance advantages, yet their potential to expand material properties through rational integration with other polymer architectures presents substantial opportunities for continued investigation. Herein, we report a coherent integration of covalent polymers (CPs) and mechanically interlocked polymers through sequential orthogonal polymerizations, developing a novel synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP) featuring both structural stability and force-induced dynamics. Compared to its structurally similar but noninterlocked control sample, CMIP demonstrates markedly enhanced thermomechanical stability and performance recovery, achieving a 93.4% recovery efficiency at 100% strain after just 5 min of rest, in contrast to 59.7% for the control. This remarkable stability and recovery result from the synergistic interplay between the covalent polymer framework and the interlocked structure, which work in tandem to preserve network integrity and enable rapid host−guest reformation. Notably, despite this significant improvement, CMIP retains a comparable damping capacity (91% versus 87%) and material toughness (14.8 versus 15.1 MJ m −3 ), owing to the efficient energy dissipation mechanisms enabled by host−guest dissociation and subsequent sliding motion. This strategy imparts CMIP with unique characteristics, offering a prospective pathway for the development of a diverse array of advanced synergistic materials with enhanced, multifaceted properties.},

However, achieving both high sequence fidelity and structural diversity remains a significant challenge using conventional synthetic protocols. To address this issue, we introduce a versatile halide-pair-driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy that enables the library synthesis of sequence-controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs). By optimizing halide pairing in conjunction with a rationally designed Buchwald ligand–Pd system featuring catalyst-transfer capability, we achieved efficient sequential cascade aminations, thereby enabling the MCP. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated through the synthesis of a library of sequence-controlled PTAAs, including dendronized variants, underscoring its potential as a general platform for functional semiconducting material discovery.},

  abstract     = {The first stable heavy carbene homologues, the heavy tetrylenes, were reported in 1973 by Lappert and coworkers. These tetrylenes were extensively investigated with respect to ground state reactivity, such as small molecule activation, insertion into σ-bonds, coordination chemistry, materials chemistry, or catalysis. Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that the bright yellow-colored diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature-dependent time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time-dependent) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed, involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second-order Jahn–Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights toward a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long-lived emissive excited states, with Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 being the prototype.},

Chirality, a fundamental characteristic governing biological recognition and signal transduction, remains underexplored in stannate clusters compared to extensively studied precious metal clusters. Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin-oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C─H···π interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non-chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor ( g lum ) of 1.5 × 10 −2 . Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin-oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect. This supramolecular chirality induction paradigm offers new insights into the rational design of multifunctional optical materials.},

As a prominent class of reactions, transition-metal-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C─H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92%, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (>99%). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor, which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule-substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in-solution and on-surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.},

An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni–O 2 –Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof-of-concept strategy with S, Co co-doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron-withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co–O 2 –Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000-h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm −3 H 2 @ 4000 A m −2 .

Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self-supporting carbon cloth with N-doped carbon arrays (PdCo-NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3 d -4 d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz 2 -5 σ and dyz -2 π* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self-supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO 2 methanation while serving as a photo-to-heat converter to improve the temperature of the reaction system. As a result, PdCo-NC/CC exhibits unprecedented photothermal performance toward CO 2 methanation, delivering a CH 4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol g metal −1 h −1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100 h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo-NC/CC in CO 2 hydrogenation.},

Although post-treatment of InP cores with zinc compounds is a common approach to alleviate interface strain, conventional synthesis methods often fail to achieve effective doping, typically leaving zinc on the core surface rather than within the lattice. Herein, we present a dual-mode strain relief strategy using the small-molecule precursor Zn(Ac) 2 . Its ionic bonding character and low steric hindrance enable efficient Zn doping into the InP core and promote uniform epitaxial shell growth, leading to a 50% reduction in interfacial strain and a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield in InP QDs. This approach simultaneously addresses two major sources of strain: lattice mismatch between the core and shell and steric hindrance from bulky surface ligands. The fabricated green InP-based QLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 26.3% and a current efficiency of 108.3 cd A −1 . We believe this strategy provides a general and scalable strain engineering platform for QDs, with broad applicability across various material systems.},

Carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) have emerged as promising candidates; however, achieving precise sub-Angstrom micropore control and ensuring structural stability remain significant challenges. Here, we introduce a dual cross-linked strategy to engineer microporosity of the resulting CMSMs by utilizing a decarbonylated 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA)-induced rigid network ( Type A ) in conjunction with a sulfur bond-induced flexible network ( Type B ). The 6F-D-S-CMS membrane exhibits a record-high H 2 permeability of 3464 Barrer with H 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 3807, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. Upon pyrolysis at 850 °C, the 6F-D-S-CMS-850 membrane achieves exceptional selectivity values: H 2 /CH 4 at 6538, H 2 /N 2 at 1634, and H 2 /CO 2 at 149—outperforming most reported CMS membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Type B network suppressed CH 4 adsorption (3.6 cm 3 g −1 versus 6.2 cm 3 g −1 ) and significantly enhanced the small pore volume ratio ( V H2 / V CH4 : 10.3 versus 2.1) during carbonization, thereby eliminating non-selective pathways and reducing inter-skeletal spacing (4.09 Å versus 3.78 Å), which enables precise molecular sieving. This rigid-flexible cross-linked strategy for CMSMs establishes a scalable blueprint for next-generation hydrogen production.},

Enhancing the exciton diffusion length ( L D ) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [Δ G (r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium-MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended L D and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ-based all-polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in J SC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record-breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco-friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8-BO) with small-area devices (0.0621 cm 2 ), whereas large-area modules (23.60 cm 2 ) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.},

  abstract     = {In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter- and intra-ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light-driven charge separation in the well-studied “molecular lightswitch” [Ru(bpy) 2 dppz] 2+ (aqueous [Ruthenium II (2,2′-bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine)] 2+ [Cl − ] 2 ) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real-time using ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. Sub-70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra-ligand electron transfer following Ru-to-dppz metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time-resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter-ligand electron “hopping” between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru-to-bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well-studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light-driven electron transfer chemistry.},

Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed-width cavities and UV–vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C═C bond. In all cases, no substantial changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.},

Although “dual-locked” probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan-cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy-H-NTR , a cascaded-activation, doubly quenched NIR-II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity—universal tumor hallmarks—it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan-cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem-locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan-tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR-II emission and “activation–retention” mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9-fold higher tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan-cancer models, it enabled high-contrast imaging (T/N ∼7.8) and precise resection with sub-2 mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem-locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR-II imaging capabilities, and activation-retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan-cancer identification and surgical navigation.},

Herein, we propose the strategy aimed at adjusting electronic properties of Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs through constructing oxygen vacancies on Ce/WO x , thereby fostering SCR activity. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs not only provide more Ce 3+ sites for promoting the reactivity of adsorbed NO, but also accelerate the reaction between NH 3 and gaseous NO owing to the generation of W 5+ species with superior surface acidity, which enhance Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanisms, respectively. Consequently, the designed catalysts achieve over 90% NO x conversion above 250 °C and exhibit higher activity than normal Ce/WO 3 and V/W-TiO 2 commercial catalysts, with anti-poisoning of SO 2 and H 2 O under harsh working conditions, expecting to provide the guidance for promoting de-NO x industrial application.},

The strongly electron-withdrawing N-functional groups of Bpy •− radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na + from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF-rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g −1 , and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high-capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles.

However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors ( g lum ) in Cu(I)-based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared 1D chiral ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 (where MPZ is 2-methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular–tetrahedral configuration in the noncentrosymmetric cubic P 1 2 11 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH 2 PO 4 . Additionally, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and g THG-CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG-based CPL detection in Cu(I)-based metal halides. The self-powered CPL photodetectors based on ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0 V and further achieve self-powered X-ray detection with excellent low-dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure–performance relationship in chiral organic–inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) provides a promising strategy for producing high-value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high-performance photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen-coordinated metal-organic cages (MOCs) (Ni 8 L 12 X 4 , X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate-limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO 2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni 8 L 12 I 4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 µ mol g −1 h −1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl- and Br-coordinated Ni MOC by 200- and 5-fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) synthesis from NO x under ambient conditions presents a sustainable alternative to energy-intensive industrial methods, but its selectivity remains limited by unbalanced active hydrogen (H*) supply and intermediate adsorption. Herein, we develop boron-doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate-to-NH 2 OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B-induced p-sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential-determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH₂OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at −0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.},

We contribute here to this field with the development of a unique class of supramolecular polymers that are able to selectively encapsulate guest molecules within their lumen. This is achieved through a rational design of the monomer units, which self-assemble in amphiphilic cyclic entities that then stack into lipophilic tubular architectures that contain a polar pore. These tailored assemblies are able to host hydrophilic dye molecules that are complementary in size and chemical affinity for the pore coating. Dye extraction is characterized by: (1) the emergence of the dye absorption and emission features in solution, (2) a red shift of the absorption and emission maxima, caused by a confined environment of high viscosity, and (3) an energy transfer process from the monomer at the tube's walls to the included dye guest, which was characterized by photoluminescence (PL), excitation, and transient absorption measurements. When different dyes are co-encapsulated, the tubular supramolecular polymer provides a unidimensional confined chiral environment to promote sequential energy transfer processes between them.},

However, there are often a multitude of factors at play; hence, it can be unclear how operating conditions can be rationally tuned to optimize selectivity. Here, we demonstrate how the identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can control the selectivity of electrochemical C─H chlorination. Specifically, we obtained a 90.3% Faradaic efficiency with KCl as compared to 78.4% with LiCl for the conversion of cyclohexane to chlorocyclohexane at 1000 mA using an IrO x electrode. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments indicate a greater propensity for Cl − oxidation to generate Cl radicals in the order: K + > Na + > Li + . This leads to an increase in the selectivity toward the chlorination of cyclohexane and a concomitant decrease in competitive Cl 2 formation. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments indicate that this is likely due to a decrease in *Cl binding energy on IrO x in the presence of K + . These findings highlight the important role of alkali metal cations, which can be a key consideration for designing electrochemical organic synthesis systems.},

Although homocysteine (Hcy) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring amino acid, it was excluded from the universal genetic code. Hcy is very interesting, yet mostly unexplored, for probing protein active sites because of its subtle structural and electronic differences from cysteine and serine, which are widespread catalytic residues in enzymes. We report the genetic encoding of a new protected Hcy precursor, HcyX, that can be conveniently deprotected by chemical reductants or bioorthogonal reagents. We find varying and sometimes remarkable levels of activity for different purified enzymes with Hcy at catalytic positions. By exploiting partial intracellular deprotection to Hcy, we show that two proteins rendered Hcy-dependent, an intein and thymidylate synthase, can rescue growth of Escherichia coli by catalyzing a reaction essential for cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples in which cell growth is linked to a genetically incorporated ncAA directly involved in catalysis. We further demonstrate that Hcy-based disulfide bonds are chemically more stable than cysteine disulfides. Together, these findings open new paths for the experimental evolution of the genetic code.},

However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme-assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme-metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions. The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co-encapsulation and dual-optimization of both components. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2-fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA), and a 2.7-fold enhancement in racemization conversion, compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers 91% yield, >98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal-enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme-metal cascade systems.},

Herein, an ingenious design of a high-performance Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms (Ni SAs) and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin-like TiO 2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73 µmol g cat. −1 h −1 . Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and activation, generating *N 2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO 2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N 2 to form a “tower-like” urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual-active-site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high-value products.},

In this study, we used a solvothermal method to synthesize a sub-1 nm copper oxide-phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CuO-PMA) for ultrasound (US)-controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to induce pyroptosis. Owing to the narrow bandgap of CuO-PMA, the electron holes are rapidly separated under US irradiation, then quickly migrate through the sub-nanosheet structure to the surface to catalyze the formation of singlet oxygen (¹O₂) and superoxide anions (•O₂⁻), while simultaneously consuming glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, leveraging electron delocalization properties, US triggered the directional migration of electrons in CuO-PMA, facilitating the Cu(II)-to-Cu(I) transition to enhance hydroxyl radical (•OH) production. The ROS burst together with ions and h + -mediated GSH exhaustion synergistically provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating the caspase-1/GSDMD axis to induce pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CuO-PMA significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed excellent antitumor immunotherapeutic effects. This sub-nanosheet amplifies ROS generation in response to the electronic delocalization characteristics of the US, which provides a new strategy for the ultrasound-controlled pyroptosis activation (sonopyroptosis) and tumor immunotherapy.},

However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small-molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein-targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR-ABL, BRD4, EGFR L858R , and EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S . Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the “pan-kinase” inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK-3β, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide-containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.},

Here, we report that a rationally designed flexible metal–organic framework (FMOF), featuring a specifically engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality, can promote the efficient one-step separation of C 2 H 4 from a ternary mixture. Adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough tests provide experimental evidence confirming the selective adsorption of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 over C 2 H 4 on such a FMOF, as well as its ability to separate C 2 H 4 from a CO 2 /C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 ternary mixture. Theoretical calculations and simulations provide critical insights into the flexible adsorption process and the separation mechanism of the FMOF. The bifunctionality incorporated in FMOF provides exceptionally strong binding of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 but inhibition of C 2 H 4 , which, in turn, enables high adsorption selectivity for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 .

Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo-reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross-link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid-catalyzed step-growth reaction of a difunctional PEG-thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross-linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross−links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water-swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV ( λ = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm −1 ), and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.},

  abstract     = {Anion-π + type photosensitizers with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature have demonstrated promising potential in photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer. However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the π + core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion-π + type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion-π + type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF-Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE-PEG 2000 to obtain NPs (named DF-TB X or DF-FTB X , X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF-Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X = 8 in DF-TB 8 and DF-FTB 8 , resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF-FTB 8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion-π + type photosensitizers.},

Comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated their distinct configurational preferences: Q5H exclusively adopted the meso ( P , P , M , M ) configuration, while Q6H produced only the ( P , P , P , P )/( M , M , M , M ) enantiomeric pair. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction unambiguously confirmed the unique “four-bladed propeller” structure of ( P , P , M , M )- Q5H .

Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between nonzero and zero values in both second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ (2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second-harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 (BTA = 3-bromo-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432 F 2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362 K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between nonzero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both χ (2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG-CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432 F 2 phase transition enables ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG-CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG-CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG-CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase.

Although, their transformation into valuable products has attracted great attention, efficient and selective transformations remain challenging. In this work, we report a catalytic system composed of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) stabilized by poly(ionic liquids) (Ru@PIL), that enables the selective chemo-divergent hydrogenation of EC into either EtOH and CO 2 or EG and CH 4 , under solvent-free conditions. Those transformations relied on the multi-task ability of poly(ionic liquids) (PILs), which provides efficient electro-steric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates, and organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter-anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I − , triggers the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation-hydrogenation process. Conversely, in the presence of non-nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically a spectator, yielding to the “direct hydrogenation” of EC by the RuNPs.},

Here, based on the donor-acceptor molecular backbone, an oligoether chain is introduced with different chain lengths to endow two novel SAMs, namely, EPA and MEPA, with good capability of bottom-up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiO x with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain-containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization, and importantly well-matched energy level alignment at the top surface, especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiO x /MEPA-based PSCs along with good device stability, which can maintain 90% of the initial efficiency under ISOS-L-1 conditions over 1260 h.},

  abstract     = {Integrating solar-driven CO 2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic-ferroelectric heterojunction (WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 ), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO 3-x and ferroelectric polarization in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 , thereby not only promoting energetic hot-carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot-electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K 4 Nb 6 O 17 surface for CO 2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO 3-x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76 µmol g −1 h −1 ), which is 9.87 and 6.27-folds higher than that of K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C─C coupling for directed production of more value-added hydrobenzoin (313.15 µmol g −1 h −1 ). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar-to-fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.},

In this study, we investigate 9,9′,10,10′-tetraphenyl-2,2′-bianthracene ( TPBA ) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn - and anti -TPBA . To address the “Janus-type” photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation-wavelength-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn - and anti -TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge-transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment-dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in-depth study of the Janus-like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.},

  abstract     = {Cyclodextrin-based slide-ring gels (SRGs) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross-links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light-responsive SRGs based on azobenzene-containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) macrocycles. By using UV–Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that α-CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E to Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.},

  abstract     = {Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well-characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP-InsPs, such as 5-PP-InsP 5 (5-InsP 7 ) and 1,5-(PP) 2 -InsP 4 (1,5-InsP 8 ), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5-PP-InsP 4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31 P-NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18 O-labeled PP-InsP 4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), enabling the assignment of PP-InsP 4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation-induced root-specific PP-InsP 4 isomer does not match any 5-PP-InsP 4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6-OH]-InsP 5 and [3-OH]-InsP 5 at the 5-position, while other InsP 5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP-InsP 4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP-InsP 4 , providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.},

The development of nanofluidic devices necessitates the integrated solid-state nanochannels/nanopores with versatile surface modification strategies using precise nanofabrication techniques. This review systematically summarizes the development of the solid-state nanochannels and nanopores, nanofabrication methods, sensing principles, transport characteristics, and the strategies employed to perceive molecules and physical stimuli. The discussion also emphasizes promising research directions and explores how the interaction between interface chemistry influenced by molecular recognition and physical stimuli, in conjunction with the exceptional ion transport properties of nanofluidic devices, significantly impacts the sensing performance of the nanofluidics. Lastly, we present the vision for the future prospects of biomimetic nanofluidic devices in ionic sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi-domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication-mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co-occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis -COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis -COM domain within an E-COM-C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity-dependent photo-crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis - and trans -COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.},

Therefore, designing high-molecular-weight acceptors with well-defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene-tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g mol −1 and a well-defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8-IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8-BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state-of-the-art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature ( T g ), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high-performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Most record-efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin-coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent-bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent-antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in-situ crystallization monitoring via time-resolved UV–Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%–50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256 h storage in N 2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra-wide processing window (10 s–10 min bathing duration, >2 min post-bathing delay tolerance).},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage. However, their application is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low-temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with the desolvation kinetics of Zn 2+ . We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3-butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable glass-forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen-bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid–liquid transition temperature from −16.4 to −101 °C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn 2 ⁺ to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by-reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long-term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at −40 °C under 0.1 mA cm −2 /0.1 mAh cm −2 , and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (−40 °C to 60 °C).

However, their selective synthesis remains a considerable challenge in catalysis. Regioselective hydration of non-activated C─C double bonds is typically hindered by poor selectivity and low atom efficiency in conventional methods. In this study, we harness the underexplored potential of the acyclic carotenoid 1,2-hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus IL144, employing it as a whole-cell biocatalyst for cofactor-independent terminal hydration of a diverse range of terpenes. This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C 12 ─C 20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high-yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations. These findings highlight the biocatalytic potential of acyclic carotenoid hydratase, offering a green and efficient route to the production of valuable tertiary alcohols.},

  abstract     = {The direct conversion of methane-to-methanol remains a critical challenge in methane valorization. In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO 2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd 0.3 Au 0.7 /CeO 2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (∼80%) at 500 K with a 1:1 methane-to-water ratio. While Pd/CeO 2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over-reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO 2 composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine-tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO 2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.},

  abstract     = {High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug-protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging-based HCS and bio-orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof-of-concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide-alkyne (TL-alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe-labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio-orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.},

Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn-SAM) strategy through blending a non-planar molecule 3,3-(4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)-dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me-4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi-device compatibility. The single-junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn-SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm 2 ) for 1.56  and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively.

We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA-binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA-binding activity of a mtDNA-packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.},

Here, we leverage the “structural tolerance” of recently-developed polymeric metal halides to integrate two distinct coordination units of a single metal into a material, thereby achieving highly tunable optical properties in single-phase metal halides. By manipulating the steric hindrance of polycations, facilely adjustable green, red or bicolor emission can be realized in manganese bromides, which originates from controllable transformation from manganese-bromine tetrahedra into octahedra. This design principle is further extended to polymeric copper halides, wherein broad self-trapped exciton emissions derived from distinct copper-iodine polyhedrons allow the emission colors to be linearly tunable from blue to yellow, encompassing pure white light, by tailoring the composition, excitation wavelength, or temperature. This study opens avenues for facile and precise modulation of the optical properties of metal halides by exploiting the intrinsic coordinative diversity of metal elements.},

  abstract     = {The stress-responsive up-regulation process is a sophisticated biological response to maintain cellular homeostasis. In intracellular anti-oxidant systems, the expression level of oxidoreductases is up-regulated under oxidative stress, mitigating oxidative damage on biomolecules and enhancing protein folding capacity. Herein, inspired by the biological system, we developed a synthetic folding promotor whose reactivity is up-regulated under stress conditions. We conjugated two metal-binding 1,4,7,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligands and a redox-active disulfide to obtain cyclam-SS, whose reactivity can be enhanced under metal-induced stress. Metal coordination increased the redox potential of cyclam-SS, activating it as an oxidant. While Cu II ions severely hampered the oxidative folding of substrate polypeptides, cyclam-SS exhibited bifunctional folding-promoting properties, i) suppressing Cu II -mediated misfolding and aggregation, and ii) harnessing Cu II to enhance oxidative folding. Cyclam-SS was also useful for disulfide-bond formation to promote oxidative folding of pharmaceutical and pathological proteins, as demonstrated with proinsulin and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, cyclam-SS protected cultured cells from copper-induced stress. Thus, we demonstrated the induction of the stress-responsive up-regulation process by a bifunctional folding promotor controlling the folding status of biologically important proteins under metal-induced stress. The strategy of “stress-responsive up-regulation” could aid the development of novel synthetic materials for treating intracellular stress and related disorders.},

Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current collector as in lithium-ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando charge and mass transport. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on simplified models. Herein, we build digital-twin electrodes with digital-space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital model-driven simulation, we find an “lithium trapping” effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next-generation energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Accelerated failure time (AFT) models offer an attractive alternative to Cox proportional hazards models. AFT models are collapsible and, unlike hazard ratios in proportional hazards models, the acceleration factor—a key effect measure in AFT models—is collapsible, meaning its value remains unchanged when adjusting for additional covariates. In addition, AFT models provide an intuitive interpretation directly on the survival time scale. From the recent development of smooth parametric AFT models, we identify potential issues with their applications and note several desired extensions that have not yet been implemented. To enrich this tool and its application in clinical research, we improve the AFT models within a flexible parametric framework in several ways: we adopt monotone natural splines to constrain the log cumulative hazard to be a monotonic function across its support; allow for time-varying acceleration factors, possibly include cure and accommodating more than one time-varying effect; and implement both mixture and nonmixture cure models. We implement all of these extensions in the rstpm2 package, which is publicly available on CRAN. Simulations highlight a varying success in estimating cure fractions. However, in terms of covariate-effect estimation, flexible AFT models appear to be more robust than the Cox model even when there is a high proportion of cured individuals in the data, regardless of whether cure is reached within the observed data. We also apply some of our extensions of AFT models to real-world survival data.},

  abstract     = {Phase I dose escalation trials in oncology generally aim to find the maximum tolerated dose. However, with the advent of molecular-targeted therapies and antibody drug conjugates, dose-limiting toxicities are less frequently observed, giving rise to the concept of optimal biological dose (OBD), which considers both efficacy and toxicity. The estimand framework presented in the addendum of the ICH E9(R1) guidelines strengthens the dialogue between different stakeholders by bringing in greater clarity in the clinical trial objectives and by providing alignment between the targeted estimand under consideration and the statistical analysis methods. However, there is a lack of clarity in implementing this framework in early-phase dose optimization studies. This paper aims to discuss the estimand framework for dose optimization trials in oncology, considering efficacy and toxicity through utility functions. Such trials should include pharmacokinetics data, toxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods used to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on optimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level summary measure should reflect only the properties used for estimating this utility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events has been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations regarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless phase I/II dose optimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject receives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional clarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding of the drug under consideration, which would enable the correct dose to move to phase II of clinical development.},

It proposes using partially linear working models to improve the estimation efficiency of the standard complete case method. It can be shown that the new estimator is consistent, which does not depend on the correctness of the working models. In addition, we recommend bootstrap estimates for the asymptotic variances and semiparametric models for the missing data probabilities.

Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification.

Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks.

  abstract     = {The Bat algorithm, a metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by the foraging behaviour of bats, has been employed to tackle optimization problems. Known for its ease of implementation, parameter tunability, and strong global search capabilities, this algorithm finds application across diverse optimization problem domains. However, in the face of increasingly complex optimization challenges, the Bat algorithm encounters certain limitations, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to initial solutions. In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllable–word–sentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllable–word–sentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

  abstract     = {Modern automated generation control (AGC) is increasingly complex, requiring precise frequency control for stability and operational accuracy. Traditional PID controller optimisation methods often struggle to handle nonlinearities and meet robustness requirements across diverse operational scenarios. This paper introduces an enhanced strategy using a multi-objective optimisation framework and a modified non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (SNSGA). The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61 years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43 years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE).

Advanced large language NMT models, including ChatGLM and LLaMA, are fine-tuned and implemented for their superior contextual understanding and cross-lingual capabilities. The refined CD algorithm evaluates multiple candidate translations using BLEU score, semantic similarity, and Named Entity Recognition accuracy. Extensive experimental results show substantial improvements in translation quality and a significant reduction in hallucination rates. Fine-tuned models achieve higher evaluation metrics compared to baseline models and state-of-the-art models. An ablation study confirms the contributions of each methodological component and highlights the effectiveness of the refined CD algorithm and advanced models in mitigating hallucinations.

CD-GAD classifies anomalies as unique or common based on their presence in both the source and target graphs. However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Selecting appropriate tourist attractions to visit in real time is an important problem for travellers. Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARs—concatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024 × 1024 images in just 0.045 s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17× across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

  abstract     = {The goal of point cloud completion is to reconstruct raw scanned point clouds acquired from incomplete observations due to occlusion and restricted viewpoints. Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The code for Point-PC can be accessed by https://github.com/bizbard/Point-PC.git .},

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to improve anomaly detection techniques, particularly in the context of high-dimensional, distributed clinical data. Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},

In this review, a four-layer research framework is established for the research of ensemble learning, which can offer a comprehensive and structured review of ensemble learning from bottom to top. Firstly, this survey commences by introducing fundamental ensemble learning techniques, including bagging, boosting, and stacking, while also exploring the ensemble's diversity. Then, deep ensemble learning and semi-supervised ensemble learning are studied in detail. Furthermore, the utilisation of ensemble learning techniques to navigate challenging datasets, such as imbalanced and high-dimensional data, is discussed. The application of ensemble learning techniques across various research domains, including healthcare, transportation, finance, manufacturing, and the Internet, is also examined. The survey concludes by discussing challenges intrinsic to ensemble learning.},

  abstract     = {There is a growing need for accurate and swift diagnostic tools for lung disease diagnosis in healthcare. This work presents a Stacking Ensemble-based Deep Learning Framework for Enhanced Lung Disease Diagnosis (SEDLF-LDD). The stacking is a widely used ensemble learning technique that enhances the model's performance by combining the predictions from multiple base-learners using a meta-learner. The proposed framework selects the five best-performing pre-trained models, namely, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet201, as the base-learners and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a meta-learner. To ensure broader applicability, we curated a dataset of chest X-ray images of Lung Disease. Initially, we choose the ten transfer learning models, fine-tune them to extract features relevant to respiratory diseases on the dataset, and select Top-5 best-performing models as base-learners. The effectiveness of the framework is determined by analysis of precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve. The experimental results show an effective result with 97.65% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Despite high predictive performance, machine learning models can be unfair towards specific demographic subgroups characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This paper presents a novel approach using Computational Profile Likelihood (CPL) to assess potential bias in neural network decisions with respect to sensitive attributes. CPL estimates the conditional probability of a network's internal neuron excitation levels during predictions. To assess the impact of sensitive attributes on predictions, the CPL distribution of individuals sharing a particular value of a sensitive attribute and a specific outcome (e.g., “women” and “high income”) is compared to a subgroup sharing another value of the sensitive attribute but with the same outcome (e.g., “men” and “high income”). The resulting disparities between distributions can be used to quantify the bias with respect to the sensitive attribute and the outcome class. We also assess the efficacy of bias reduction techniques through their influence on the resulting disparities. Experimental results on three widely used datasets indicate that the CPL of the trained models can be used to characterize significant differences between multiple protected groups, highlighting that these models display quantifiable biases. Furthermore, after applying bias mitigation methods, the gaps in CPL distributions are reduced, indicating a more similar internal representation for profiles of different protected groups.},

However, existing active DA methods often struggle in real-world scenarios where, due to data privacy concerns, only a pre-trained source model is available, rather than the source samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the structure-based uncertainty estimation model (SUEM) for source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA). To be specific, we introduce an innovative active sample selection strategy that combines both uncertainty and diversity sampling to identify the most informative samples. We assess the uncertainty in target samples using structure-wise probabilities and implement a diversity selection method to minimise redundancy. For the selected samples, we not only apply standard-supervised loss but also conduct interpolation consistency training to further explore the structural information of the target domain. Extensive experiments across four widely used datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable to or outperforms current UDA and active DA methods.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based action recognition using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has achieved remarkable performance, but recognising ambiguous actions, such as ‘waving’ and ‘saluting’, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasise local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, the authors propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronised and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronised Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details, enhancing the model's ability to classify ambiguous actions. Experimental results on NTU RGB + D 60, NTU RGB + D 120, NW-UCLA and PKU-MMD I datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.

  abstract     = {In the field of oncology, lung cancer is a leading contributor to cancer-related mortality, highlighting the need for early detection of lung nodules for effective intervention. However, accurate segmentation of lung nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains a significant challenge due to issues such as heterogeneous nodule dimensions, low contrast, and their visual similarity with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Edge-Enhanced Feature Pyramid SwinUNet (EE-FPS-UNet), an advanced segmentation model that integrates a modified Swin Transformer with a feature pyramid network (FPN). The research objective is to enhance boundary delineation and multi-scale feature aggregation for improved segmentation performance. The proposed model uses the Swin Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and integrates an FPN for robust multi-scale feature aggregation. Its window-based self-attention mechanism also reduces computational complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution CT images. Additionally, an edge detection module enhances segmentation by providing edge-related features to the decoder, improving boundary precision. A comparative analysis evaluates the EE-FPS-UNet against leading models, including PSPNet, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms these models, achieving a Dice Similarity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.89, establishing its efficacy for lung nodule segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate point correspondences is critical for rigid point cloud registration in correspondence-based methods. Many previous learning-based methods employ encoder-decoder backbone for point feature extraction, while applying attention mechanism for sparse superpoints to deal with the partial overlap situation. However, few of these methods focus on the intermediate layers yet mainly pay attention on the top-most patch features, thus neglecting multi-faceted feature perspectives leading to potential overlap areas estimation inaccuracy. Meanwhile, obtaining correct correspondences is usually interfered with the one-to-many case and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level features extraction network with integrating linear dual attention mechanism into skip-connection stage of encoder-decoder backbone, both efficiently suppressing irrelevant information and guiding residual features to learn the common regions on which the network should focus to tackle the overlap estimation inaccuracy issue, combined with a parallel-structured decoder forming distinguishable features and potential overlapping regions. Additionally, a two-stage correspondences pruning process is designed to tackle the mismatch issue, which mainly depends on the rigid geometric constraint. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate our method's accuracy and stability, by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on registration recall.},

Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarise the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, the residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and the transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.},

  abstract     = {The extensive coverage of satellite constellations has rendered the satellite–terrestrial integrated network (STIN) a pivotal solution for communication and computation services in internet of vehicles (IoVs) rescuing in remote or disaster areas with limited terrestrial networks. To optimise network resource utilisation and service quality, the integration of the service function chain (SFC) into STIN-enabled IoV rescuing systems has become essential. However, traditional SFC-based STIN systems encounter challenges in flow scheduling flexibility, stemming from the sequential execution of subtasks on satellites equipped with virtual network functions (VNFs). This leads to a trade-off between data volume reduction and the additional communication and computation energy costs incurred in the orbit. To address this issue, this paper introduces a space ground collaborative SFC (SGC-SFC) flow scheduling strategy. This strategy enables the execution of subtasks on either VNF-equipped satellites or the ground vehicle formation, contingent on network conditions. Firstly, we carry out a computation–space–time graph (CSTG) model specifically for the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system with SFC. This model integrates the computational layer into the space–time graph (STG), accurately capturing the data volume reduction characteristics and sequential execution constraints of SFC in the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system. Secondly, a SGC-SFC flow scheduling algorithm is designed to identify a set of feasible paths with minimal energy cost and maximum processable data volume. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SGC-SFC under diverse conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling complex thermo-mechanical fracture behavior. A high-order element formulation is established on the basis of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM) to perform spatial discretization of transient heat conduction problems. Due to the use of hierarchical, high-order shape functions, temperature gradients can be effectively captured even on relatively coarse meshes. The discretized transient heat conduction equation is subsequently solved using an implicit time integration scheme, specifically, the backward difference method. Numerical validation against the commercial software ABAQUS demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach in simulating heat transfer and predicting thermoelastic deformation fields under mixed thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, HQEM is integrated with the virtual crack closure method (VCCM) for the evaluation of fracture parameters in two-dimensional cracked structures subjected to coupled thermo-mechanical loadings. Within the VCCM framework, a unified explicit expression of the virtual crack closure integral is derived for HQEM with arbitrary nodal configurations. The integration of HQEM with VCCM significantly reduces mesh refinement requirements and preprocessing effort compared to conventional FEM. Case studies confirm that the integrated HQEM–VCCM approach yields accurate solutions for fracture parameters of cracked structures under coupled thermo-mechanical conditions.},

To address the issue of decreased computational accuracy of the material point method (MPM) near physical domain boundaries, a Gaussian kernel function with kernel correction is employed to establish the interpolation formulas between particles and the background grid. Furthermore, to mitigate volumetric locking caused by the nearly incompressible nature of soft materials, the F -bar method is further developed within the framework of TLMPM.

  abstract     = {The long-term performance of pavement structures is influenced by the combined effects of repeated traffic loads and environmental conditions, such as temperature variations. Traditional numerical approaches face significant challenges in simulating the decades-long lifespan of pavements due to the vast disparity between the time scales of individual loading events and the overall lifespan. This paper presents a novel framework for the thermo-mechanical analysis of pavement structures, based on a time homogenization technique to efficiently predict long-term performance. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is employed to simulate the mechanical response of pavements to consecutive tire overruns, while a thermo-mechanical material model accounts for the effects of temperature variations. A key innovation is the treatment of history variables (HVs). The framework incorporates both spatial and temporal mapping of HVs, enabling the extrapolation of material behavior when the evolution rate of HVs stabilizes. This allows for the skipping of computationally expensive tire overruns, significantly reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy.

Moreover, a method for calculating the remaining fatigue life of structures based on a combination of fracture mechanics and sequential methods has been proposed. Compared with the linear cumulative damage theory, the influence of structural crack size and external load sequence effects on structural fatigue life is considered.

  abstract     = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

Computational methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) typically face convergence problems for such microstructures unless specific discretizations are used, most prominently the discretization on the staggered grid. FFT-based methods were originally developed for periodic boundary conditions, and recent work provided extensions to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the unit cube faces by utilizing dedicated sine and cosine series. Unfortunately, such approaches were only developed for discretizations that fail to converge for complex porous microstructures. The article at hand closes this gap by constructing the appropriate Eshelby-Green operator for the displacement gradient associated with the staggered grid discretization and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eponymous staggering of the displacement variables infers certain challenges to be resolved, that is, the construction is significantly more difficult than for the cases discussed in the literature. However, our innovative techniques permit treating the class of microporous materials—which have a wide range of applicability—in a robust and efficient way.

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization is a popular and versatile approach that is well suited to solve challenging optimization problems. Their popularity comes from their effective minimization of expensive function evaluations, their capability to leverage gradients, and their efficient use of noisy data. Bayesian optimizers have commonly been applied to global unconstrained problems, with limited development for many other classes of problems. In this article, two alternative methods are developed that enable rapid and deep convergence of nonlinearly-constrained local optimization problems using a Bayesian optimizer. The first method uses an exact augmented Lagrangian and the second augments the minimization of the acquisition function to contain additional constraints. Both of these methods can be applied to nonlinear equality constraints, unlike most previous methods developed for constrained Bayesian optimizers. The new methods are applied with a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer and enable deeper convergence for three nonlinearly-constrained unimodal optimization problems than previously developed methods for constrained Bayesian optimization. In addition, both new methods enable the Bayesian optimizer to reach a desired tolerance with fewer function evaluations than popular quasi-Newton optimizers from SciPy and MATLAB for unimodal problems with 2 to 30 variables. The Bayesian optimizer had similar results using both methods. It is recommended that users first try using the second method, which adds constraints to the acquisition function minimization, since its parameters are more intuitive to tune for new problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a flexible multi-body dynamics approach for elastic smooth and non-smooth shells undergoing large deformations and large overall motions. The formulation is based on a co-rotational curved quadrilateral shell element employing vectorial rotational variables and a quasi energy and momentum conservation algorithm. Hamilton's principle is adopted to derive the system's dynamic differential equations. When differentiating the kinetic energy functional with respect to time, the part involving the first-order differentiation of vectorial rotational variables with respect to time is integrated into an equivalent load vector, yielding a symmetric equivalent mass matrix. Accelerations, velocities, displacements, body, and surface loads of the generalized midpoints are generated by convex functions. The Newmark scheme is applied to transform the dynamic differential equations of the system into a set of nonlinear equations. Instead of using strains and their first/second derivatives with respect to local nodal variables at the midpoint configuration, the formulation employs time-averaged assumed strains (computed via the MITC method) and their corresponding derivatives evaluated at both ends of the time step for calculating the internal force vector and element tangent stiffness matrix in the local coordinate system. The transformation matrix from local to global coordinates, however, remains computed at the midpoint configuration. This approach ensures near-exact conservation of total energy and exact conservation of linear and angular momenta once the external loads vanish, while also yielding symmetric tangent stiffness matrices in both local and global coordinate systems. Finally, four examples of three smooth shells and one non-smooth shell problems subjected to impulse loads are solved to verify the proposed formulation for flexible multi-body dynamics of shells. It is shown that the results exhibit excellent agreement with those from other references, demonstrating the reliability, accuracy, and long-term stability of the proposed quasi energy and momentum conserving algorithm.},

For systems with multiple outputs, traditional sensitivity analysis methods are typically carried out for each system response individually. However, obtaining the importance of variables from the system-level view still needs objective decision support. To address this issue, this study proposes a multi-output system sensitivity decision-making method based on evidence theory. The proposed method first conducts surrogate model-based Sobol sensitivity analysis for each output of the system. Subsequently, the global sensitivity information for each output is used as evidence to construct a basic probability assignment, according to a rule defined for determining basic probability assignment. Finally, a synthesis rule is applied to calculate comprehensive sensitivity information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through validation with three numerical examples and one engineering case. This method provides more objective and rational decision support for sensitivity analysis of multi-output systems, offering significant potential benefits in parametric studies of complex systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stabilized finite element method (FEM) for incompressible hyperelastic materials at finite strains, addressing the computational and implementational challenges of traditional inf-sup-stable mixed FEMs. By augmenting the weak formulation with Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) stabilization terms, the method enables equal-order Lagrange elements ( ), eliminating the need for complex element pairings like Taylor–Hood ( ). The stabilization parameter is defined as where denotes the finite-element mesh size and is the shear modulus; this choice, derived via eigenvalue analysis-ensures robustness against volumetric locking while preserving consistency. The nonlinear system of algebraic equations is solved via a Newton–Raphson scheme with a block-preconditioned GMRES solver, achieving optimal displacement convergence rates (comparable to Taylor–Hood elements). Validated on benchmarks including Cook's membrane and a pressurized neo-Hookean cylinder, the method demonstrates optimal displacement convergence and less than 2% error in reaction forces compared to Abaqus. It reduces degrees of freedom by 30%–40% and solve times by 35% relative to Taylor–Hood elements, as shown in weak scaling tests. An industrial case study on seal compression under 4 mm displacement highlights its capability to handle contact mechanics and geometric nonlinearities, with pressure oscillations suppressed below 5%. The framework's open-source implementation, combined with its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness under mesh distortion (aspect ratios up to 5:1) and near-incompressibility ( ), makes it a versatile tool for engineering applications. Key advancements include a theoretically grounded stabilization strategy, computational efficiency gains, and seamless integration into industrial workflows.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a unified variational framework for deriving the evolution equation of the level set function in topology optimization, departing from conventional Hamilton–Jacobi-based formulations. The key idea is the introduction of an auxiliary domain, geometrically identical to the physical design domain, occupied by fictitious matter which is dynamically excited by the conditions prevailing in the design domain. By assigning kinetic and potential energy to this matter and interpreting the level set function as the generalized coordinate to describe its deformation, the governing equation of motion is determined via Hamilton's principle, yielding a modified wave equation. Appropriate combinations of model parameters enable the recovery of classical physical behaviors, including the standard and biharmonic wave equations. The evolution problem is formulated in weak form using variational methods and implemented in the software environment FreeFEM++. The influence of the numerical parameters is analyzed on the example of minimum mean compliance. The results demonstrate that topological complexity and strut design can be effectively controlled by the respective parameters. Notably, the proposed formulation inherently supports the nucleation of new holes and maintains a well-defined level set function without requiring explicit re-initialization procedures, both of which emerge naturally from the physically motivated variational framework. The inclusion of a damping term further enhances numerical stability. To showcase the versatility and robustness of our method, we also apply it to compliant mechanism design and a bi-objective optimization problem involving self-weight and compliance minimization under local stress constraints.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional transport codes for the simulation of tokamak plasmas are simplified versions of full 3D fluid models, where plasma turbulence is averaged out. One of the main challenges in such reduced models is to accurately reconstruct transverse transport fluxes that arise from the averaging of stresses due to fluctuations. These transverse fluxes are typically approximated by ad-hoc diffusion coefficients (turbulent eddy viscosity), manually adjusted to align numerical solutions with experimental observations. They can vary significantly depending on the type of tokamak, the experimental conditions, and even the location within the device, severely limiting the predictive capability of these codes for new configurations. To address this issue, we recently proposed an innovative approach to fusion plasma simulations by introducing two additional transport equations for turbulence-related variables (specifically, the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate ) into the mean-flow system to estimate the turbulent eddy viscosity. This approach also introduces new free parameters, but they are primarily governed by the underlying transport physics and thus exhibit considerably less variation across devices and plasma regions. In this article, we continue an ongoing study of data assimilation techniques to determine the free parameters of the model for transverse turbulent plasma transport. Based on digital twin experiments within the framework of equations averaged over the magnetic surfaces of the tokamak, we provide an in-depth study of optimization strategies to improve the performance of the calibration algorithm in a complex configuration with considerable scale variation of the parameters.},

A regularization strategy based on Tikhonov regularization is discussed, and an automatic regularization parameter choice is introduced to deal with cases where the noise level is not known beforehand. The algorithm is tested on three examples, including artificial models where the exact solution is known and a case study from the Matilde donjon in Livorno, with experimental data measured by seismic stations during ambient vibration tests.

This paper proposes an adaptive mesh refinement strategy ( -adaptivity) in the SolEdge-HDG code for the resolution of 2D fluid-drift Braginskii equations using the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. The strategy is based on an oscillation indicator implemented to detect under-resolved regions and dynamically refine the mesh, associated with an a posteriori accuracy indicator built on the local difference between the solution at order and the post-processed one at order considered as reference. The method thus enables both refinement, where necessary, as well as coarsening in regions where the solution is smooth. Numerical results obtained with this method in realistic tokamak geometry and plasma conditions show significant reductions in computational resources and an improvement in code robustness while maintaining high accuracy, particularly in regions with steep gradients or near the sharp angles of the tokamak walls. This work highlights the potential of such -adaptivity technique to optimize transport simulations in realistic tokamak configurations, offering a fully automated, goal-oriented mesh refinement strategy. In addition to optimizing the numerical cost of simulation, this strategy offers all users a fully automated means of designing a mesh in any tokamak geometry.},

  abstract     = {The Total Lagrangian Material Point Method (TLMPM) is a relatively new variant of the now popular MPM, a method to solve partial differential equations appearing in solid and fluid mechanics problems. In TLMPM, each solid has its own grid, and all calculations are carried out in a configuration of reference, often the original configuration. Because of this, TLMPM is free of numerical fracture, cell crossing instability and is efficient. An unfortunate result of having individual grids is that TLMPM does not have a built-in contact algorithm. Recently, a contact algorithm based on particle-to-particle contact was published for TLMPM. However, it scales quadratically with the number of particles and is therefore slow for a large number of particles. This paper introduces a new contact algorithm for TLMPM using a flexible contact grid. The advantages of this algorithm are: (1) all the advantages of TLMPM are kept, such as the absence of numerical fracture and good convergence rates; (2) the core principle of using a background grid in the material point method for contacts is preserved; (3) different basis functions can be used for each grid, and (4) boundary conditions can be enforced with more flexibility. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through several two and three-dimensional numerical examples exhibiting large elastic and plastic deformation.},

  abstract     = {Inspired by the unconstrained pressure Poisson equation (PPE) formulation [Liu, Liu, & Pego, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 60 (2007): 1443–1487], we previously proposed the generic projection and unconstrained PPE (GePUP) formulation [Zhang, J. Sci. Comput. 67 (2016): 1134–1180] for numerically solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (INSE) with no-slip boundary conditions. In GePUP, the main evolutionary variable does not have to be solenoidal, with its divergence controlled by a heat equation. This work presents GePUP–FEM, high-order finite-element solvers for the INSE under the framework of the method-of-lines. Continuous Lagrange finite elements of equal order are utilized for the velocity and pressure finite element spaces to discretize the weak form of GePUP in space, while high-order implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta methods are then employed to treat the stiff diffusion term implicitly and the other terms explicitly. Due to the implicit treatment of the diffusion term, the time step size is only restricted by convection. The solver is efficient in that advancing the solution at each time step only involves solving a sequence of linear systems either on the velocity or on the pressure, with geometric multigrid methods. Furthermore, the solver is enhanced with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) so that the multiple length scales and time scales in flows at moderate or high Reynolds numbers can be efficiently resolved. Numerical tests with various Reynolds numbers are performed for the single-vortex test, the lid-driven cavity, and the flow past a cylinder/sphere, demonstrating the high-order accuracy of GePUP–FEM both in time and in space and its capability of accurately and efficiently resolving the right physics. Moreover, GePUP–FEM offers the flexibility in choosing velocity and pressure finite element spaces and is free of the standard inf-sup condition.},

  abstract     = {Plates are common flat structural elements that support loads through their flexural bending rigidity. Because plate thickness is much smaller than their surface dimensions, plate theories have emerged to simplify full three-dimensional behavior. Since analytical solutions for plate elements are not always available, especially for general loads and boundary conditions, numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), are often employed to solve these problems. Due to its general polynomial approximation of the solution field, FEM often requires a large number of degrees of freedom to achieve convergence, increasing the computational burden. In this study, we propose a new approach for the analysis of plates utilizing the eXtended finite element method (XFEM) within the Mindlin-Reissner thick plate theory. As opposed to the traditional XFEM, where the enrichment functions are applied locally, mainly targeting strong and weak discontinuities in the domain, in the proposed approach, the entire domain is globally enriched with functions inspired by analytical solutions available for simple cases of plates. The objective of the current formulation is to reduce the computational burden by reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the problem compared to the standard FE configuration. The deformation of rectangular plates is studied for different boundary and loading conditions. The enrichment functions added to the FE shape functions are based on the series expansion resulting from the analytical solution of a simply supported plate under uniform pressure. However, those functions may not necessarily match the actual problem studied. To this end, higher series terms are employed to improve the accuracy and response of the plates. A convergence study is conducted to investigate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. The results show an improved convergence rate of the XFEM compared to the standard FEM approach.},

This study builds upon the method proposed by Zhang et al., extending it to eigenfrequency topology optimization using bound formulations. By constructing symmetric functions of repeated eigenvalues—including cluster mean, -norm and Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) functions—the study confirms their differentiability when all repeated eigenvalues are included, that is, clusters are complete. Numerical sensitivity analyses indicate that, under some symmetry conditions, multiple eigenvalues may also be differentiable with respect to the symmetric design variables. Notably, regardless of enforced symmetry, the cluster mean approach guarantees the differentiability of multiple eigenvalues, offering a reliable solution strategy in eigenfrequency optimization. Optimization schemes are proposed to maximize eigenfrequencies and bandgaps by integrating cluster means with the bound formulations. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples of 2D and 3D solids and plate structures. All optimization results demonstrate smooth convergence under simple/multiple eigenvalues.},

However, a load-adaptable machine learning model that can predict such responses still needs to be explored. This study formulates the load-adaptable response prediction problem as a solution operator family regression task and develops a Load-Adaptable Physics-Informed DeepONet (LA-PIDON) to learn the solution operator family of mechanics. The proposed method utilizes the product space as the input space, composed of function spaces for force boundaries, displacement boundaries, material properties, and other mechanical factors. Distinct branch networks are established for each mechanical factor and distinct trunk networks for each corresponding response. The solution family learning task is accomplished by using shared branch networks across multiple trunk networks. The load adaptability for both concentrated and distributed forces is achieved through the integration of Gaussian Random Fields(GRFs) and Fourier polynomials to generate function spaces for the force boundary; the load adaptability for force and imposed displacement excitation is achieved by incorporating the product space of force and displacement boundaries into the input space. The numerical cases of (1) elastic plates subjected to benchmark force and imposed displacement excitations, (2) benchmark beams under pure and tensile bending, and (3) 3D elastic cubes undergoing axial tension demonstrate the method's adaptability to various load scenarios and its capacity to handle complex stress states. The proposed method has potential applications in fields that require numerous simulations for diverse load scenarios, such as reliability analysis and digital twins.},

The neural network-based model is able to reproduce the reference results with excellent precision. Also, the neural network-based model was implemented as a VUMAT in Abaqus together with one of the theoretical reference models. Deformation of a plate with a hole in it was simulated, and the outcome from the reference model and the trained neural network-based model was compared. The solutions, in terms of von Mises stress and accumulated equivalent plastic strain, were very similar. Hence, it seems like training the neural network model by use of uniaxial stress data is sufficient for being able to make accurate 3D predictions.},

The depth allows introducing rankings and orderings to data living in multivariate, or function spaces. Though widely applied and with much experimental success, little theoretical progress has been made in analysing functional depths. This article highlights how the common h -depth and related depths from functional data analysis can be viewed as a kernel mean embedding, widely used in statistical machine learning. This facilitates answers to several open questions regarding the statistical properties of functional depths. We show that (i) h -depth has the interpretation of a kernel-based method; (ii) several h -depths possess explicit expressions, without the need to estimate them using Monte Carlo procedures; (iii) under minimal assumptions, -depths and their maximisers are uniformly strongly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian (also in infinite-dimensional spaces and for imperfectly observed functional data); and (iv) several -depths uniquely characterise probability distributions in separable Hilbert spaces. In addition, we also provide a link between the depth and empirical characteristic function based procedures for functional data. Finally, the unveiled connections enable to design an extension of the -depth towards regression problems.},

It shows that the emerging best practice relies heavily on the approach and tools created by the original authors of the causal forest such as their grf package and the approaches given by them in examples. Generally, researchers use the causal forest on a relatively low-dimensional dataset relying on observed controls or in some cases experiments to identify effects. There are several common ways to then communicate results–by mapping out the univariate distribution of individual-level treatment effect estimates, displaying variable importance results for the forest and graphing the distribution of treatment effects across covariates that are important either for theoretical reasons or because they have high variable importance. Some deviations from this common practice are interesting and deserve further development and use. Others are unnecessary or even harmful. The paper concludes by reflecting on the emerging best practice for causal forest use and paths for future research.},

In theory, we establish the sure screening property under less restrictive assumptions on data types. The proposed procedure does not require model specification, gives a more effective geometric measure to compare the discrepancy between distributions and avoids introducing biases caused by the choice of slicing rules for continuous data. Numerical comparison indicates that the proposed Wasserstein-SIS method performs better than existing methods in various models.

To address this gap, we review a family of chance-corrected IRA statistics for two-rater dichotomous-response cases, a fundamental setting that not only serves as the theoretical foundation for categorical-response or multirater IRA methods but is also practically dominant in most empirical studies, and we propose a novel data-generating framework to simulate correlated decision processes between raters. Subsequently, a new estimand, which calibrates the ‘true’ chance-corrected IRA, is introduced while accounting for the potential ‘probabilistic certainty’. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the reviewed IRA methods under various practical scenarios and were summarised by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis.

  abstract     = {Ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to investigate LiH:nNH 3 ( n = 1–4) cluster complexes. The nature of the interactions is analyzed using molecular electrostatic potential maps, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, delocalization indices, and electron density difference maps. In the presence of LiH, NH 3 molecules engage in several types of noncovalent interactions, namely, hydrogen bonding (HB), lithium bonding (LB), and dihydrogen bonding (DHB). The LiH:NH 3 dimer is stabilized primarily through Li···N interactions. The role of these noncovalent interactions in complexes having more than one NH 3 molecule, for example, hetero-trimer, tetramer, and pentamer structures, is also examined. Increasing the number of NH 3 molecules enhances the number of HB sites. Additionally, the strengths of LB and DHB interactions associated with HB-bonded NH 3 molecules increase. Interaction energy estimates and many-body energy decomposition analysis suggest that increasing NH 3 molecules increases cooperativity, approaching ~10% of the total interaction's energy in the case of tetramers and pentamers.},

  abstract     = {Residue interaction networks determine various characteristics of proteins, such as the folding rate, thermostability, and allosteric process. The interactions between residues can be described by distances or energies. The former is simple but less rigorous. The latter is complicated but more precise, especially when considering the solvent effect. In this work, we apply an existing energy decomposition method based on the Poisson–Boltzmann equation solver. The calculation is especially accelerated on GPU for higher performance. In four formal applications, the constructed interaction energy (IE) network shows good results. First, it is found that the protein folding rate has a stronger correlation with the energy-based contact order than the distance-based contact order. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is 0.839 versus 0.784 on a dataset of non-two-state proteins. Second, we find that most thermophilic proteins have lower IEs than mesophilic proteins. The IE in solvent acts as an indicator to evaluate the thermostabilities of proteins. Third, we use the IE network to predict the key residues in the formation of the insulin dimer. Most key residues are in agreement with the findings in previous alanine-scanning experiments. Lastly, we propose a novel method (called APFN) to predict the allosteric pathway based on the IE network. The method gives the same allosteric pathway for CheY protein as in previous nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. On the whole, the IE network in the solvent has been demonstrated to be reliable in describing the characteristics embedded in protein structures.},

  abstract     = {The carbon and oxygen atoms of tetrahydropyran form the common substructure of pyranose monosaccharides in vertebrate glycans. This substructure can assume various ring puckering chair and skew-boat conformations, and can thereby impact glycan conformations relevant for biomolecular structure and signaling. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) provides a wealth of experimental glycan structural biology data that can be useful in the development and validation of molecular mechanics force fields for these molecules. However, these experimental data are typically from solvent-depleted crystalline environments at very low temperatures, in contrast to biological conditions that are aqueous and near ambient temperature, which is the regime targeted by biomolecular force fields. To determine if these PDB X-ray crystal data can be of utility as references for carbohydrate force fields, we compared ring puckering conformations from these experimental data to both vacuum and explicit aqueous solvent puckering free energy data from extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) molecular dynamics simulations using the previously validated CHARMM36 force field. We found that, for monosaccharides that are not charged (glucose, N -acetylglucosamine, galactose, N -acetylgalactosamine, mannose, xylose, and fucose), both the vacuum and aqueous simulation puckering preferences strongly correlate with PDB data, and therefore with each other. In contrast, all charged monosaccharides that were considered (the conjugate bases of N -acetylneuraminic acid, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid) had puckering preferences correlating with PDB data only in aqueous simulations and not in vacuum simulations. These results suggest that comparing puckering preferences from aqueous simulations to PDB X-ray crystal puckering conformation data can be a valid and useful component of carbohydrate force field development and validation.},

  abstract     = {Molecular properties in combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations have been shown to be dependent on the size of the quantum mechanical (QM) region and the amount of conformational sampling. Previous studies have largely focused on enzymatic systems, which have made it difficult to distinguish the effects of QM region size and conformational sampling from other factors including QM-MM boundary artifacts and the boundary effects. This study uses the difference-based adaptive solvation QM/MM method to investigate the tautomerization reactions of alanine and aspartate in explicit solvent. The choice of computationally tractable systems enables the decoupling of QM region size effects from other factors and a direct comparison of free energy surfaces with potential energy surfaces (PESs). The results show that (1) it is crucial to properly account for thermal fluctuations along the reaction pathways, and (2) free energy surfaces converge rapidly with increasing QM region size, whereas charge transfer requires a slightly larger QM region to achieve convergence. These findings are expected to guide future studies of enzymatic systems and other complex systems where QM/MM methods are applied.},

  abstract     = {Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane protein that uses acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) to catalyze the formation of triacylglycerides (TAGs). The acyl transfer reaction occurs between the activated carboxylate group of the fatty acid and the free hydroxyl group on the glycerol backbone of DAG. However, how the two substrates enter DGAT1's catalytic reaction chamber and interact with DGAT1 remains elusive. This study aims to explore the structural basis of DGAT1's substrate recognition by investigating each substrate's pathway to the reaction chamber. Using a human DGAT1 cryo-EM structure in complex with an oleoyl-CoA substrate, we designed two different all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation systems: DGAT1 away (both acyl-CoA and DAG away from the reaction chamber) and DGAT1 bound (acyl-CoA bound in and DAG away from the reaction chamber). Our DGAT1 away simulations reveal that acyl-CoA approaches the reaction chamber via interactions with positively charged residues in transmembrane helix 7. DGAT1 bound simulations show DAGs entering into the reaction chamber from the cytosol leaflet. The bound acyl-CoA's fatty acid lines up with the headgroup of DAG, which appears to be competent to TAG formation. We then converted them into TAG and coenzyme (CoA) and used adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations to explore the egress pathways of the products. We identify their escape routes, which are aligned with their respective entry pathways. Visualization of the substrate and product pathways and their interactions with DGAT1 is expected to guide future experimental design to better understand DGAT1 structure and function.},

Insight from the intra -organizational leadership literature suggests that an effective inter -organizational leadership model could help address project-level coordination challenges. Adopting an agency theory view complemented by role theory, this study examines the antecedents and outcomes of rotational leadership (i.e., shifting leadership roles in a process) in a buyer NPD project involving suppliers. The results indicate a U-shaped relationship between rotational leadership and project performance by analyzing a paired sample of quantitative and qualitative data for 279 NPD projects. In a post hoc qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), this study triangulates quantitative results using interview data, showing that buyers adopt boundary buffering to address potential rotational leadership risks while achieving high project performance. Both buyer risk-taking and supplier relationship-specific investments contribute to the emergence of rotational leadership. These results enrich supplier involvement in the NPD literature by demonstrating (1) when rotational leadership emerges and (2) how it affects project performance. The findings also provide managerial implications for leadership role arrangements and boundary-buffering decisions in the context of collaborative innovation in the supply chain.},

  abstract     = {This study addresses a critical gap in understanding the development of crossover products, particularly in the context of collaborative product development within the PC game market's supply chain. Traditionally, firms have focused on incorporating common product characteristics from a single market segment (e.g., genre) to minimize potential penalties associated with ambiguous product identities. However, recent trends show that “crossover” products, those that integrate distinctive features from multiple segments, have emerged due to their superior performance. Developing such innovative products requires profound expertise across multiple market segments, especially when supply chain partners collaborate. While prior research has explored the market performance of crossover products, it has offered limited understanding of the conditions required for their development. To address this gap, we propose a theoretical framework grounded in the input–output perspective of operations management, which examines how portfolio similarity between partners influences the ease of expertise reconfiguration and the breadth of segment-spanning expertise needed for crossover product development. Our findings reveal an inverted U-shaped relationship between portfolio similarity and the degree of crossover, suggesting that moderate similarity fosters the most effective reconfiguration of expertise. Further, we find that collaboration experience with the partner moderates the inverted U-shaped relationship.},

Leveraging 43 months of opioid prescribing data, our research reveals that the introduction of such a policy is associated with higher opioid prescribing intensity. Furthermore, our results reveal that the policy's unintended consequences were intensified under high levels of prescribing workload and market competition. These findings augment the understanding of the negative impacts of the former and unveil an unfavorable corollary to the positive impacts of the latter. We complemented these results with a qualitative study that revealed the presence of coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures and the influence of prescribing workload and market competition in the prescribing context, instilling confidence in our theorizing, results, and contributions.

  abstract     = {How does the development of Analytics Capability (AC) of a firm influence its supply chain performance? With increasing numbers of firms adopting data analytics to enhance their supply chains and overall performance, this question has become particularly important. To answer the question, this study proposes and tests three dominant supply chain capabilities (integration, flexibility, and resilience) as key mechanisms through which AC is linked with operational performance. We use 405 effect sizes reported in 174 prior empirical studies based on data gathered from 104,296 informants to draw insights using a meta-analytic structural equation modeling approach. The theory developed herein contributes to the literature by demonstrating that integration, flexibility, and resilience mediate the association between AC and operational performance, which in turn affects customer service performance. Specifically, a substantial degree of variance in the effects of AC on operational performance is mediated by integration, flexibility, and resilience, respectively. We also find that the effect size for the association between AC and operational performance is higher in developing economies, while the link between operational performance and customer service performance is higher in developed economies. Our analyses are robust to several empirical challenges, including (a) common method bias, (b) outliers, (c) endogeneity, and (d) journal quality, attesting to the stability of the findings. Overall, our results suggest that supply chain integration, flexibility, and resilience are key domains of managerial and theoretical focus for implementing firms' data analytics initiatives, reinforcing the role of the supply chain in leveraging data analytics capabilities.},

As organizational defenses and tactics of antagonistic actors (e.g., hackers) adapt to emerging conditions, certain actors of organizations become compromised as entry points into the targeted organizations. A disruption (i.e., COVID-19) induces operational changes (i.e., digital transformation), and we study the co-evolution of attacks and defenses as if the antagonistic actors, organizations, and their internal and external actors are engaged in a dance together. Building on routine activity theory, our study theorizes the adaptive target suitability where the properties of actors, the types of actors involved, and the consequential phases co-evolve following the disruption. We leverage the COVID-19 pandemic as the empirical context and use a novel dataset of 3497 publicly reported cyber breaches. Analyses reveal that cyberattacks initially focused on internal actors (i.e., deception-based attacks on employees) and then shifted to external actors (i.e., system vulnerability-based attacks on digital infrastructure providers and product suppliers). Semi-structured interviews with experts (e.g., hackers and cybersecurity managers) and subsequent econometric analyses elucidate how strategic interactions between dance partners lead to disruptions that dynamically reshape the landscape of chained vulnerability.},

We also consider two conditions that may strengthen the relationship between female board representation and workplace safety: (1) the power of the female directors on the board, which may cause them to speak out more, and cause others to heed their perspectives; (2) accountability pressures faced by the board, which may increase board member epistemological motivation (the willingness to invest effort to fully understand the board's tasks and decisions being made). Analyzing a unique dataset that covers 1442 firm-year observations across 266 firms, we show that female board representation improves workplace safety when women have more power and when boards face greater accountability pressures. In an empirical extension, we examine how the representation of racial/ethnic minority directors impacts workplace safety and the synergistic effect of female and minority board representation.

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of identifying financial asset price bubbles, particularly through the development of time-series unit-root tests featuring fractionally integrated errors and panel unit-root tests. This study introduces an innovative approach for assessing the sign of the persistence parameter ( α ) within a panel fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, based on the least squares estimator of α . This method incorporates three distinct test statistics based on the Hurst parameter ( H ), which can take values in the range of ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , be equal to 1 / 2 , or fall within the interval of ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . The null hypothesis corresponds to α = 0 . Based on a panel of continuous records of observations, the null asymptotic distributions are obtained when the time span ( T ) is fixed and the number of cross sections ( N ) goes to infinity. The power function of the tests is obtained under the local alternative where α is close to zero in the order of 1 / ( T ⁢ N ) . This alternative covers the departure from the unit root hypothesis from the explosive side, enabling the calculation of lower power in bubble tests. The hypothesis testing problem and the local power function are also considered when a panel of discrete-sampled observations is available under a sequential limit, that is, the sampling interval shrinks to zero followed by the N goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop two families of sequential monitoring procedure to (timely) detect changes in the parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model. Our statistics can be applied irrespective of whether the historical sample is stationary or not, and indeed without previous knowledge of the regime of the observations before and after the break. In particular, we construct our detectors as the CUSUM process of the quasi-Fisher scores of the log likelihood function. To ensure timely detection, we then construct our boundary function (exceeding which would indicate a break) by including a weighting sequence which is designed to shorten the detection delay in the presence of a changepoint. We consider two types of weights: a lighter set of weights, which ensures timely detection in the presence of changes occurring “early, but not too early” after the end of the historical sample; and a heavier set of weights, called “Rényi weights” which is designed to ensure timely detection in the presence of changepoints occurring very early in the monitoring horizon. In both cases, we derive the limiting distribution of the detection delays, indicating the expected delay for each set of weights. Our methodologies can be applied for a general analysis of changepoints in GARCH(1,1) sequences; however, they can also be applied to detect changes from stationarity to explosivity or vice versa, thus allowing to check for “volatility bubbles”, upon applying tests for stationarity before and after the identified break. Our theoretical results are validated via a comprehensive set of simulations, and an empirical application to daily returns of individual stocks.},

We propose a test for the presence of speculative bubbles in the context of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes. The test exploits the fact that bubbles are anticipative, that is, they are generated by an extreme shock in the forward-looking dynamics. In particular, the test uses both path-level deviations and growth rates to assess the presence of a bubble of a given duration and size, at any moment in time. We show that the distribution of the test statistic can be either analytically determined or numerically approximated, depending on the error distribution. Size and power properties of the test are analyzed in controlled Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical application is presented for a monthly oil price index. It demonstrates the ability of the test to detect bubbles and to provide valuable insights in terms of risk assessments in the spirit of Value-at-Risk.},

This article explores the usefulness of quantile regression (QR) technique in detecting and surveilling financial bubbles, encompassing both global testing and real-time monitoring. We demonstrate that the QR-based quantile unit root test, coupled with an optimal quantile selection technique, serves as an effective tool for a global bubble test without necessitating additional recursive techniques. Moreover, we propose two QR-based bubble monitoring techniques. We show that the monitoring statistics follow a random variate under the null hypothesis of no bubbles but diverge to positive infinity in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, and hence consistently date the origination of a bubble. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that compared with their LS counterparts, in the presence of skewed distributions, the QR-based global test delivers substantially greater power, while the QR-based monitoring procedures offer higher bubble detection rate and more accurate dating of the bubble origination. As an illustration, we conduct a pseudo real-time monitoring exercise with the S&P 500 composite index.},

In this article, I show that unit root quantile autoregressive models can approximate such dynamics by allowing the largest autoregressive root to take values below unity at low quantiles, which correspond to price crashes, and above unity at upper quantiles, that correspond to bubble expansions. On this basis, I employ two unit root tests based on quantile autoregressions to detect bubbles. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the two tests have good size and power properties, and can outperform recursive least-squares-based tests. The merits of the two tests are further illustrated in three empirical applications that examine Bitcoin, US equity and US housing markets. In the empirical applications, special attention is given to the issue of controlling for economic fundamentals. The estimation results indicate the presence of asymmetric dynamics that closely match those of the simulated bubble processes.},

We first consider a data generating process that entails a switch from a unit root regime to an explosive regime followed by a collapse and subsequent return to unit root behavior. We demonstrate analytically that the standard OLS estimates are inconsistent and date both the origination and implosion points with a delay in large samples. A simple modification that involves omitting the residual corresponding to the implosion date is shown to yield consistent estimates. We also develop an efficient dating algorithm that can accommodate a framework with multiple bubbles. The algorithm exploits the explicit form of the unit root restrictions to directly embed them into the recursive optimization problem which obviates the need to rely on an iterative scheme that requires initial values. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that our proposed procedure typically delivers estimates with lower bias and root mean squared error relative to competing alternatives.

This modification, based on the approach developed in Beare (2018) in the context of conventional unit root testing, is achieved by purging the impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity from the data using a kernel estimate of volatility before the application of the bubble detection methods proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) (PSY). The modified statistic is shown to achieve the same limiting null distribution as the corresponding (heteroskedasticity-uncorrected) statistic from PSY would obtain under homoskedasticity, such that the usual critical values provided in PSY may still be used. Versions of the test based on regressions including either no intercept or a (redundant) intercept are considered. Representations for asymptotic local power against a single bubble model are also derived. Monte Carlo simulation results highlight that neither one of these tests dominates the other across different bubble locations and magnitudes, and across different models of time-varying volatility. Accordingly, we also propose a test based on a union of rejections between the with- and without-intercept variants of the modified PSY test. The union procedure is shown to perform almost as well as the better of the constituent tests for a given DGP, and also performs very well compared to existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests across a large range of simulation DGPs.},

Further refinements, such as the point-optimal linear test, approach the power envelope remarkably closely.

These developments have fueled an unprecedented frenzy in the Nasdaq, with AI-focused companies experiencing soaring stock prices that raise concerns about speculative bubbles and real-economy consequences. Against this background, this study investigates the formation of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market with a specific focus on the so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag-7) individual stocks during the AI boom, spanning the period from January 2017 to January 2025. We apply the real-time PSY bubble detection methodology of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) while controlling for market and industry factors for individual stocks. Confidence intervals to assess the degree of speculative behavior in asset price dynamics are calculated using the near-unit root approach of Phillips (2023). The findings reveal the presence of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market and across all Mag-7 stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft experience the longest speculative periods over January 2017–December 2021, while Nvidia and Tesla show the fastest rates of explosive behavior. Speculative bubbles persist in the market and in six of the seven stocks (excluding Apple) from December 2022 to January 2025. Near-unit-root inference indicates mildly explosive dynamics for Nvidia and Tesla (2017–2021) and local-to-unity near explosive behavior for all assets in both periods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the Riemann solutions and their asymptotic limits for the macroscopic production model with modified Chaplygin gas are investigated. Due to this model belonging to the Temple class and the curve of this rarefaction wave lying between the one of shock and uncertain waves in the phase plane, the Riemann solutions we constructed differ from those of previous studies. More specifically, a special structure R J ‾ + J $$ R\overline{J}&amp;#x0002B;J $$ is found in the construction of the Riemann solution. R J ‾ $$ R\overline{J} $$ is formed by a rarefaction wave R $$ R $$ and a discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ attached to the wavefront of this rarefaction wave. It should be stressed that the rarefaction wave and the shock wave share the same wave velocity on this discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ . In the asymptotic limits of the Riemann solutions, not all solutions converge to those of the conservation law equations when the perturbation parameters tend to 0 with the same initial data. What is interesting is that the vacuum and delta shock wave solutions are obtained by the small Riemann solution S + J $$ S&amp;#x0002B;J $$ , which consists of a shock wave S $$ S $$ followed by a contact discontinuity J $$ J $$ , where the small Riemann solution means that the solution whose structure remains unchanged for the solution of the Riemann problem of the macroscopic production model with modified Chaplygin gas under the small enough perturbation parameters.},

  abstract     = {Predator-prey models, such as the Leslie-Gower model, are essential for understanding population dynamics and stability within ecosystems. These models help explain the balance between species under natural conditions, but the inclusion of factors like the Allee effect and intraspecific competition adds complexity and realism to these interactions, enhancing our ability to predict system behavior under stress. To detect early indicators of population collapse, this study investigates the intricate dynamics of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with both Allee effect and intraspecific competition. We analyze the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as bifurcation phenomena, including saddle-node bifurcations of codimension 2, Hopf bifurcations of codimension 2, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension at least 4. Detailed transitions between bifurcation curves–specifically saddle-node, Hopf, homoclinic, and limit cycle bifurcations–are also examined. We observe a novel transition phenomenon, where a system jumps from saddle-node bifurcation to homoclinic and limit cycle bifurcations. This suggests that burst oscillations may serve as an early warning of system collapse rather than simply a tipping point. Our findings indicate that moderate levels of intraspecific competition or Allee effect support coexistence of both populations, while excessive levels may destabilize the entire biological system, leading to collapse. These insights offer valuable implications for ecological management and the early detection of risks in population dynamics.},

In detail, nonlinear multisource disturbance encompasses the disturbances brought about by exogenous systems and norm-bounded disturbances. In this relation, two kinds of PDE-type disturbance observers are put forward for the purpose of estimating the disturbances produced by the exogenous systems. Subsequently, an output feedback-based secured control law is devised through the assistance of estimation information gathered from the constructed observer. In addition, hybrid cyber attacks are undertaken in the control channel with the goal of enhancing the security of the system. In this context, a Bernoulli distributed white sequence is utilized for the purpose of managing the randomness of cyber attacks. Also, the gain fluctuations in the control framework are considered within a structure of linear fractional form to improve the control design robustness. Apart from this, with the intent of addressing the norm-bounded disturbances, an extended dissipative technique is implemented. At the end, a numerical example accompanied by the simulation findings is provided to showcase the efficacy of the developed theoretical results and control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The equivalence problem in differential geometry investigates whether two geometric structures can be transformed into one another through an appropriate change of variables. This issue is central to understanding the invariants associated with dynamical systems, which remain unchanged under such transformations. The Cartan equivalence method provides a powerful and systematic framework for addressing these problems by reducing complex equivalence questions to more tractable ones involving coframes and structure equations. In this study, we apply Cartan's method to second-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offering insights into the intrinsic geometric structure of these systems under coordinate transformations. Specifically, we examine a class of second-order ODEs that model nonlinear dynamical behavior, employing the pseudogroup of web transformations to identify differential invariants and symmetry classes. The study introduces a step-by-step construction of an invariant coframe, elucidates the structure equations governing the system, and provides a classification of the equations based on their differential invariants. Two representative physical systems are investigated in detail: the motion of a damped spring-mass system and the van der Pol oscillator. In addition to these applications, the paper explores the interplay between equivalence, symmetry reduction, and integrability. By leveraging Cartan's method, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the equivalence problem in the context of higher order differential equations, highlighting both the theoretical elegance and practical utility of the approach in uncovering hidden geometric features, symmetries, and conserved quantities.},

Numerical results substantiate the outcomes of the control-induced system, and we have compared the results under various maximum control efforts.

The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ( T F $$ TF $$ ) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's T F $$ TF $$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined the stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional-order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to assess the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reducing the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vectors, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that policymakers should place importance on the fractional-order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underlying mechanisms of disease, along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of adult vector control.},

  abstract     = {A priori estimates and the nonexistence of nonconstant positive steady-state solutions of a charge transfer model are established. Steady-state and Hopf bifurcations are carried out in detail, especially under the degenerate conditions such as invalid simple eigenvalue condition or crossing condition. It is shown that the steady-state solutions under the violated simple eigenvalue are characterized by a coupling of two eigenfunctions, and the bifurcation direction from simple eigenvalue is supercritical or subcritical. Meanwhile, there is no nonconstant steady-state solution under the degenerate case of violated crossing condition. In addition, whether the transversality condition in Hopf bifurcation is true or not, instead of the center manifold theory, we apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and the singularity theory to illustrate the existence and stability of periodic solutions as well as the bifurcation diagrams. But it is proved that the usual pitchfork Hopf bifurcation is changed to the transcritical bifurcation through the invalid transversality condition. Finally, some numerical simulations allow us to identify the influence of external current on the predicted dynamics. The novel results on the effect of degeneracy obtained in this paper shall complement classical theories and enrich numerical examples in the existing work.},

By employing the vector fields obtained from the optimal system, we efficiently transform the governing model into a collection of ordinary differential equations.

According to the credit period provided by the supplier to retailer, three distinct scenarios may arise among which are discussed in detail. The corresponding optimization problems are solved with the help of three tournament-based hybrid algorithms (tournament differential evolution [TDE], tournament teaching learning-based optimization [TTLBO], and tournament RAO-3 algorithms).

The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ , stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for ℛ 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . For the situation of ℛ 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at ℛ 0 = 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior.

  abstract     = {Software has been increasingly important in many critical systems. To measure the growth of software reliability during testing phases, several software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been investigated. Different from hardwares, softwares' failure mechanisms follow the basic rules of logic, behavior, and psychology rather than physical laws. Consequently, software testing phase embodies lots of epistemic uncertainties, which are not suitable to be modeled by probability theory-based SRGMs. In addition, fuzzy theory-based SRGMs may give counterintuitive results. Confronted with these, we proposed a software belief reliability growth model (SBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory which is a new mathematics system to deal with epistemic uncertainties. However, testing coverage, a key factor in software testing, has not been considered in SBRGM. Therefore, a novel SBRGM considering testing coverage, named SBRGM with testing coverage (TCSBRGM), is proposed in this paper. Based on belief reliability theory, several essential belief reliability indexes for software such as belief reliability and belief reliable time are considered. Unknown parameters in the proposed TCSBRGM are estimated. Finally, real data analysis using two real-world software testing data is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed model with some representative SRGMs. The results exhibit that the proposed model gives a better fitting and predictive performance.},

Three SIR type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6, and 10 unknown parameters, respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The models are validated using the epidemic data found. Finally, it was confirmed that the basic reproductive ratio is consistent with those previously reported in the literature. We conclude that the proposed optimization method improves computation time with respect to a genetic algorithm or an exhaustive search in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {In nature, there is no ideal impulse response system. When the input is switched, the output cannot respond to this input instantaneously, which needs some time. This causes a transient oscillation process, which will inevitably affect the control accuracy, produce noise, and even cause fatigue damage. The usually adopted integer mathematical model is an ideal impulse response model and has no memory property. The fractional model has memory property, but the historical information before the switching time is usually lost. The transient oscillation process caused by intermittent control has rarely been reported in the obtained achievements with both the integer model and the fractional model. In this paper, based on the input-output property of a system, we have studied this transient oscillation. First, the impulsive response is approximated as a short memory model according to its decaying property. Second, the intermittent signal is treated as a piece-wise continuous signal to study. The study indicates that the transient oscillation is inevitable. This transient process is affected by the historical information within the memory length, and its duration is equal to the memory length. Different systems have different memory lengths. To optimize the transient oscillation process, we have to study the intermittent control approaches for different systems case by case. These do well with the engineering applications of intermittent control. Some numerical examples verify our theoretical analysis.},

Unlike the traditional approach, which replaces the Fourier kernel with the LCT kernel, this method employs convolution to capture the linear canonical spectrum over limited temporal intervals, constrained by a window function. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also holds significant potential for applications in various scientific and engineering fields. We begin our investigation by examining fundamental properties of the proposed transform, such as the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, and characterization of the range, using tools from LCT and convolution theory. Further, we explore the time-frequency resolution and the uncertainty principles associated with the proposed transform. Additionally, we present several potential applications, including the Poisson summation formula, Paley-Wiener criterion, and a sampling formula. To support our theoretical findings, clear examples are provided throughout the paper.},

Given the mapping between traversal trees and cuts in a graph, we propose to deal with the problem from a new perspective, namely, cut enumeration. The algorithm enumerates the cuts using the depth-first traversal tree, locates the optimal tree per node with the smallest local cut, and compacts them for acceleration. Any node pair can be separated by compacted trees containing only one of them. Its serial implementation is validated to be effective in obtaining the accurate solution for 99.9% or more pairs of vertices in a graph. Its calculation time per pair is as low as a thousandth of that of the most efficient existing method, that is, several microseconds in a graph with tens of millions of edges using an off-shelf computing node, thus serving as an effective heuristic for min-cut approximation.},

Currently, it poses a significant health challenge in various regions, and there is concern that it may evolve into a more severe global threat. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach to modeling an influenza outbreak. The study begins by formulating a mathematical representation that incorporates random fluctuations influencing the disease's progression. We demonstrate that the proposed model guarantees a positive global solution. By utilizing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate specific parametric conditions under which the disease may be eliminated from the population. Additionally, an ergodic stationary distribution is used to demonstrate conditions under which the infection may persist. A threshold quantity is identified, offering insight into key parameters that influence other dynamic aspects of the model. The stochastic model of influenza is further examined through graphical representation for better understanding.},

Furthermore, this model ignores depreciation, inflation, fluctuating market prices, and market saturation. With these assumptions, the question of when the company can afford to scale and purchase the next unit is directly related to the payback period and the harmonic number. This work describes a novel growth function called the harmonic growth function based on harmonic numbers. This function is related to the standard ROI. The harmonic growth function is explained and applied to a micro combined heat and power (mCHP) station, a biomass company expanding the number of biorefineries, and biochar retort kilns for biochar production.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major public health concern worldwide, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing co-infection between HIV and HBV presents additional challenges in clinical treatment and patient outcomes. In this article, we developed a comprehensive co-infection model to explore the complex transmission dynamics between HIV and HBV in the United States. Our model incorporates crucial factors such as infection through birth or migration, HBV vaccination, and the possibility of reinfection following HBV recovery. Our mathematical analysis started with the analysis of the two non-co-infection submodels, that is, for HIV-only and HBV-only models. We derived the basic reproduction number for each submodel and appliedthe Routh-Hurwitz criterion to assess the local stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium points. Our investigation revealed that the HIV-only submodel is globally asymptotically stable when its basic reproduction number remains below one. Conversely, the HBV-only submodel exhibits a backward bifurcation, meaning that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states can coexist even when the reproduction number falls below one. This phenomenon complicates HBV control strategies under such conditions. However, in the absence of reinfection, the HBV-only model reaches global stability at the disease-free equilibrium whenever its reproduction number is below one. Using center manifold theory, we further demonstrated that the full HIV-HBV co-infection model also undergoes backward bifurcation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and HBV to identify critical parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of both infections. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the spread of one infection and the prevalence of the other. Additionally, we validated the model by fitting it to annual cumulative data on new HIV cases and reported acute HBV infections in the United States. Numerical simulations suggest that increasing condom use adherence, enhancing treatment coverage for both infections, and boosting HBV vaccination rates can substantially reduce the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and their co-infection.},

While effectively identifying regularly shaped clusters (e.g., ellipsoidal or spherical) within regular domains, traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with irregular cluster shapes, heterogeneous densities, noisy inter-cluster boundaries, and datasets spread across complex spatial domains. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Density and Triangulation-based Clustering (DTC) framework, designed to excel in these complex scenarios through three key innovations: (1) density-based separation using an advanced density estimation method tailored for complex domains, (2) Delaunay triangulation-based spatial clustering, effectively managing nonlinear geometries and resolving adjacency issues, and (3) noise mitigation through proximity analysis leveraging nearest neighbors. The DTC framework uniquely integrates graph-based methods with robust density estimation methods, enabling it to handle cases where traditional algorithms fail. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its superior capability to identify nested and contiguous clusters with heterogeneous densities, even in the presence of noise and over complex domains. These findings underscore the practical applicability and versatility of DTC in extracting meaningful insights from challenging datasets.},

This method is neither as dependent on all data as cross-validation nor as computationally intensive as existing online selection methods.

  abstract     = {The study of compositional microbiome data is critical for exploring the functional roles of microbial communities in human health and disease. Recent advances have shifted from traditional log-ratio transformations of compositional covariates to zero constraint on the sum of the corresponding coefficients. Various approaches, including penalized regression and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, have been extended to enforce this sum-to-zero constraint. However, these methods exhibit limitations: penalized regression yields only point estimates, limiting uncertainty assessment, while MCMC methods, although reliable, are computationally intensive, particularly in high-dimensional data settings. To address the challenges posed by existing methods, we proposed Bayesian generalized linear models for analyzing compositional and sub-compositional microbiome data. Our model employs a spike-and-slab double-exponential prior on the microbiome coefficients, inducing weak shrinkage on large coefficients and strong shrinkage on irrelevant ones, making it ideal for high-dimensional microbiome data. The sum-to-zero constraint is handled through soft-centers by applying prior distribution on the sum of compositional or subcompositional coefficients. To alleviate computational intensity, we have developed a fast and stable algorithm incorporating expectation–maximization (EM) steps into the routine iteratively weighted least squares (IWLS) algorithm for fitting GLMs. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by extensive simulation studies. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing methods with higher accuracy of coefficient estimates and lower prediction error. We also applied the proposed method to one microbiome study to find microorganisms linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The methods have been implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM https://github.com/nyiuab/BhGLM .},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the elderly, and investigations on the impact of risk factors on neurocognitive performance are crucial in preventative treatment. While existing statistical regression models, such as single-index models, have proven effective tools for uncovering the relationship between the neurocognitive scores and covariates of interest such as demographic information, clinical variables, and neuroimaging features, limited research has explored scenarios where jump discontinuities exist in the regression patterns and the covariates are unobservable but measured with errors, which are common in real applications. To address these challenges, we propose a single-index measurement error jump regression model (SMEJRM) that can handle both jump discontinuities and measurement errors in image covariates introduced by different image processing software. This development is motivated by data from 168 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We establish both the estimation procedure and the corresponding asymptotic results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of our SMEJRM and the estimation procedure. The real application reveals that jump discontinuities do exist in the relationship between neurocognitive scores and some covariates of interest in this study.},

  abstract     = {Healthy foods are essential for a healthy life, but accessing healthy food can be more challenging for some people than others. This disparity in food access may lead to disparities in well-being, potentially with disproportionate rates of diseases in communities that face more challenges in accessing healthy food (i.e., low-access communities). Identifying low-access, high-risk communities for targeted interventions is a public health priority, but current methods to quantify food access rely on distance measures that are either computationally simple (like the length of the shortest straight-line route) or accurate (like the length of the shortest map-based driving route), but not both. We propose a multiple imputation approach to combine these distance measures, allowing researchers to harness the computational ease of one with the accuracy of the other. The approach incorporates straight-line distances for all neighborhoods and map-based distances for just a subset, offering comparable estimates to the “gold standard” model using map-based distances for all neighborhoods and improved efficiency over the “complete case” model using map-based distances for just the subset. Through the adoption of a measurement error framework, information from the straight-line distances can be leveraged to compute informative placeholders (i.e., impute) for any neighborhoods without map-based distances. Using simulations and data for the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina, we quantify and compare the associations between two health outcomes (diabetes and obesity) and neighborhood-level access to healthy foods. The imputation procedure also makes it possible to predict the full landscape of food access in an area without requiring map-based measurements for all neighborhoods.},

  abstract     = {We are interested in the relationship between the large values of a real random variable and its associated multidimensional covariate, in the context where the conditional distribution is heavy-tailed. Estimating the positive conditional tail index of a heavy-tailed conditional distribution is a crucial step for statistical inference, but the task becomes increasingly challenging as the covariate dimension increases. In this work, we assume the existence of a lower-dimensional linear subspace such that the conditional tail index depends on the covariate only through its projection onto this subspace. We propose a method to estimate this dimension reduction subspace and establish its consistency. Additionally, we introduce an estimator of the conditional tail index that leverages this dimension reduction and prove its consistency. We illustrate the benefits of this dimension reduction approach for estimating the conditional tail index through simulations and an application to real-world data.},

However, existing Fréchet regression literature focuses on the classical setting where the predictor dimension is fixed, and the sample size goes to infinity. This paper proposes sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction with graphical structure among high-dimensional Euclidean predictors. In particular, we propose a convex optimization problem that leverages the graphical information among predictors and avoids inverting the high-dimensional covariance matrix. We also provide the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Theoretically, the proposed method achieves subspace estimation and variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis are carried out to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Equality-constrained models naturally arise in problems in which the measurements are taken at different levels of resolution. The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampler does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, for example, to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.},

The proposed statistics enable testing of relevant hypotheses in one-sample, two-sample, and single or multiple change points problems, and exhibit oracle efficiency, meaning that developed procedures are asymptotically indistinguishable from those with true trajectories.

The adjustment minimizes the Wasserstein distance to a null-approximating continuous distribution, tackling some fundamental challenges inherent in combining statistical significances derived from discrete distributions. The related theory justifies Lancaster's mid-p and mean-value chi-squared statistics for Fisher's combination as special cases. To counter the conservative nature of Lancaster's testing procedures, we propose an updated null-approximating distribution. It is achieved by further minimizing the Wasserstein distance to the adjusted statistics within an appropriate distribution family. Specifically, in the context of Fisher's combination, we propose an optimal gamma distribution as a substitute for the traditionally used chi-squared distribution. This new approach yields an asymptotically consistent test that significantly improves Type I error control and enhances statistical power.},

These designs exhibit attractive low-dimensional stratification properties and perform well in terms of column correlation. Additionally, the size of each design can be flexibly chosen based on the trade-off between the experimental budget and estimation accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design method exhibits significant superiority in terms of design metrics and estimation accuracy.

  abstract     = {Factor models are indispensable tools in economics and finance, providing valuable insights into the latent structures underlying complex datasets. Nevertheless, the prevalence of heavy-tailed macroeconomic and financial data, often characterized by extreme values and greater skewness than that found in a normal distribution, presents significant analytical challenges. This article introduces mode-adaptive factor models (MAFM) for robust factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data, inspired by the equivalence between conventional principal component analysis and the constrained least squares method in factor models. Unlike traditional factor models that concentrate on mean estimation, MAFM leverage the mode to capture central tendencies more effectively, particularly in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions. To facilitate MAFM for factor analysis, we develop an iterative mode regression algorithm that integrates the expectation-maximization procedure, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. We establish the theoretical properties of the MAFM estimators without imposing moment constraints on idiosyncratic errors and propose a mode information criterion for consistent factor number selection. We also suggest a data-dependent bandwidth selection procedure to enhance the flexibility of MAFM. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFM across diverse distributional settings. An empirical application to macroeconomic forecasting further highlights the practical advantages of MAFM, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in real-world analyses.},

Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR( p ) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH( p ) to the INGARCH( p , q ) model. For inference, we consider maximum likelihood, Gaussian quasi-likelihood, and moment-based approaches, along with likelihood ratio tests to distinguish between selected instances of our class. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments.

The functional θ measures a location or stochastic tendency effect between two distributions. A limitation of is its inability to capture scale differences. If differences of this nature are to be detected, specific tests for scale or omnibus tests need to be employed. However, the latter often suffer from low power, and they do not yield interpretable effect measures. In this article, we extend by additionally incorporating the recently introduced distribution overlap index (nonparametric dispersion measure) that can be expressed in terms of the quantile process. We derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the respective estimators of and and construct confidence regions. Extending the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, we introduce a new test based on the joint use of these functionals. It results in much larger consistency regions while maintaining competitive power to the rank sum test for situations in which alone would suffice. Compared with classical omnibus tests, the simulated power is much improved. Additionally, the newly proposed inference method yields effect measures whose interpretation is surprisingly straightforward.},

Key to the accuracy of this estimate is the choice of bandwidth. Too large or small a bandwidth can lead to features in the intensity being lost or to the introduction of artefacts. There are many available methods of bandwidth selection for spatial point patterns, but no consensus on the best option. Popular methods and software default options lead to very different intensity estimates and contrasting conclusions about the data that can be difficult to reconcile. In response, we propose new bandwidth selectors with more stable and consistent performance. These are adapted from popular plug-in and cross-validation techniques developed for general multivariate density estimation. The theoretical and practical performance of these proposed methods is explored and compared with other available methods in both simulated and real-data scenarios. We find that our proposed methods perform consistently well across a range of different intensity patterns.

Breaking down silos between law, social sciences, and natural sciences is critical for all processes of disaster risk reduction. It is essential to explore how AI enhances understanding of legal frameworks and environmental management, while also examining how legal and environmental factors may limit AI's role in society. From a co-production review perspective, drawing on insights from lawyers, social scientists, and environmental scientists, principles for responsible data mining are proposed based on safety, transparency, fairness, accountability, and contestability. This discussion offers a blueprint for interdisciplinary collaboration to create adaptive law systems based on AI integration of knowledge from environmental and social sciences. When social networks are useful for mitigating disaster risks based on AI, the legal implications related to privacy and liability of the outcomes of disaster management must be considered. Fair and accountable principles emphasize environmental considerations and foster socioeconomic discussions related to public engagement. AI also has an important role to play in education, bringing together the next generations of law, social sciences, and natural sciences to work on interdisciplinary solutions in harmony. Although emerging AI approaches can be powerful tools for disaster management, they must be implemented with ethical considerations and safeguards to address concerns about bias, transparency, and privacy.
