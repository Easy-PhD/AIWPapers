  abstract     = {Cyber-attacks pose a security threat to military command and control networks, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, and civilian critical national infrastructure. The use of artificial intelligence and autonomous agents in these attacks increases the scale, range, and complexity of this threat and the subsequent disruption they cause. Autonomous Cyber Defence (ACD) agents aimto mitigate this threat by responding at machine speed and at the scale required to address the problem. Additionally, they reduce the burden on the limited number of human cyber experts available to respond to an attack. Sequential decision-making algorithms such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) provide a promising route to create ACD agents. These algorithms focus on a single objectivesuch as minimising the intrusion of red agents on the network, by using a handcrafted weighted sum of rewards. This approach removes the ability to adapt the model during inference, and fails to address the many competing objectivespresent when operating and protecting these networks. Conflicting objectives, such as restoring a machine from a back-up image, must be carefully balanced with the cost of associated down-time or the disruption to network traffic or services that might result. Instead of pursuing a Single-Objective RL (SORL) approach, here we present a simple example of a multi-objective network defense game that requires consideration of both defending the network against red-agents and maintaining the critical functionality of green-agents. Two Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms, namely Multi-Objective Proximal Policy Optimization (MOPPO) and Pareto-Conditioned Networks (PCN), are used to create two trained ACD agents whose performance is compared on our Multi-Objective Cyber Defense game. The benefits and limitations of MORL ACD agents in comparison to SORL ACD agents are discussed based on the investigations of this game.},

  abstract     = {This study proposes a hybrid methodology for evaluating leading retail companies based on customer perspectives, combining Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven sentiment analysis with fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM). The framework integrates large-scale customer review analysis with expert decision-making to provide a comprehensive assessment of retail performance. The process begins with AI-based text mining to collect and analyze customer reviews, extracting emotional tones and identifying frequently mentioned criteria. Expert judgment is then applied to refine, organize, and assign importance to these criteria. The q-rung orthopair fuzzy set MCDM methodology is employed to address uncertainty, conflicting objectives, and qualitative expert opinions by translating them into a structured quantitative evaluation. This hybrid approach offers a balanced assessment that combines subjective and objective dimensions. As a case study, 2000 customer reviews from each of four major U.S. retailers—Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and Target—were analyzed to derive key evaluation criteria based on user feedback. The proposed method distinguishes itself through its unique integration of sentiment analysis and decision-makers' expert evaluations, enabling a holistic and robust evaluation of alternatives. By bridging customer perceptions with expert analysis, this methodology provides a deeper, more nuanced understanding of retailer performance, contributing to improved supplier selection and business decision-making processes. A second analysis, enabled by this methodology, also highlighted key performance differences among the retailers in areas such as customer service, delivery experience, and return/refund processes. Among the findings, Target and Amazon showed the strongest overall sentiment performance, while Costco excelled in return policies and Walmart exhibited weaker results in customer service and delivery. As a result, this hybrid methodology offers valuable insights for both decision-makers aiming to optimize supplier selection and customers seeking better shopping experiences.},

  abstract     = {This review evaluates classical machine learning-based hypertension prediction models, emphasizing their role in addressing global health burdens , particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension affects over 1.28 billion people globally and contributes to cardiovascular disease and mortality. The review compares machine-learning techniques with traditional methods, focusing on key datasets, evaluation metrics, and model development to advance early detection and effective hypertension management. The review used the PRISMA framework, using databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, and IEEE explorer to identify studies published between 2020 and 2024 on machine learning techniques, predictive models, and early detection of hypertension based on relevance, methodological rigor, and inclusion criteria. The study analyzed hypertension prediction models across various countries, including the US, England, Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, Thailand, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and several African countries. The models' performance varied with AUC statistic values ranging from 0.6 to 0.9, indicating a wide range of predictive accuracy. Machine learning techniques generally reported higher performance metrics than traditional statistical methods. Risk factor heterogeneity was evident, with models like random forest, logistic regression, and gradient-boosted trees showing high predictive accuracy. Emerging techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) and ensemble methods improved unbalanced data set performance. The review explores the potential of machine learning-based hypertension prediction models in healthcare, highlighting their ability to accurately predict hypertension risk, tailor interventions to specific populations, and optimize healthcare resources in low- and middle-income countries. However, challenges include data quality, model explainability, and ethical considerations. Despite these, ML integration offers scalable and cost-effective solutions, especially in resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on diverse datasets, advanced feature integration, and longitudinal validations.},

  abstract     = {The sterile insect technique (SIT) represents a highly effective and promising method for combating tsetse fly-related infections, which involves the release of sterilized male tsetse flies in the assigned zones. However, tsetse fly rearing poses specific challenges, particularly in the tsetse sex separation, as this process is labor-intensive and incurs significant costs. Here, we report a simple model that classifies tsetse flies by sex using an object detection model based on the YOLO algorithm. This paper also conducted a comparative analysis of YOLOv8 and YOLO11 deep learning models, focusing on their efficacy in tsetse fly detection and classification using a range of performance metrics and statistical analysis. The findings reveal that the classification accuracy of YOLO11 stands at 97.6%, whereas YOLOv8 achieves 95.6%. The classification precision of YOLO11 in identifying tsetse flies is 88.6%, while that of YOLOv8 is 85.9%. Additionally, YOLO11 demonstrates an inference speed of 13.0 ms, slightly faster than YOLOv8's 13.4 ms in tsetse sex detection. Moreover, YOLO11 outperformed YOLOv8 in both F1 score and mAP@0.5–0.9, a success attributed to its enhanced architectural design. However, statistical tests indicate there is no significant difference between the two models, achieving p values ≥ 0.05 for all metrics. This study adds value to tsetse rearing and fly-based disease control by offering automated tsetse sex detection insights into its practical uses in real-world contexts. Furthermore, this research enriches the understanding of the two models with tsetse flies as the focal point and recommends a more effective and accurate detection approach. Finally, integrating the model with the mobile object detection Android app will reduce tsetse sex sorting dependency on experienced technical experts and enhance tsetse rearing productivity.},

Repetitiveness is a common characteristic of human behavior. Repetitiveness indicates which node is updated frequently and its importance. A chatbot needs to solve a situation regarding how quickly it will access its neural memory to retrieve information. Thus, the ranking of nodes in a neural network is necessary to allocate them to the chatbot's memory. The proposed ranking methodology takes affinity, number of edges, adjacency, average weight, and update time interval parameters into account to calculate the ranked value of each node. After that, a ranking tree is generated. This tree is finally considered the memory navigation path in that neural graph. If a node updates regularly with each clock pulse, which resembles a repetitive task, then its ranked value increases. This node should get preference over other low-ranked nodes. This study provides an approach to convert a neural graph into a ranking tree and a path to navigate through it. Thus, the chatbot can identify which node is more promising and has a shorter path than other nodes for information retrieval.},

It divides these numbers into nine groups based on their first digit, with the largest category comprising numbers beginning with 1, followed by those starting with 2, and so on. Each neuron within a neural network (NN) is associated with a numerical value called a weight, which is updated according to specific functions. This research examines the Degree of Benford's Law Existence (DBLE) across two language model methodologies: (1) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and (2) long short-term memory (LSTM). Additionally, this study investigates whether models with higher performance exhibit a stronger presence of DBLE. Two neural network language models, namely: (1) simple RNN and (2) LSTM, were selected as the subject models for the experiment. Each model is tested with five different optimizers and four different datasets (textual corpora selected from Wikipedia). This results in a total of 20 different configurations for each model. The neuron weights for each configuration were extracted at each epoch, and the following metrics were measured at each epoch: (1) DBLE, (2) training set accuracy, (3) training set error, (4) test set accuracy, and (5) test set error. The results show that the weights in both models, across all optimizers, follow Benford's Law. Additionally, the findings indicate a strong correlation between DBLE and the performance on the training set in both language models. This means that models with higher performance on the training set exhibit a stronger correlation of DBLE.},

In this paper, thematic analysis has been performed on unstructured opinions obtained from 11 experts about the integration of LLMs in the field of software development to understand their benefits and limitations using two natural language processing (NLP) techniques: sentiment analysis and keyword extraction and analysis. Sentiment analysis suggests that most experts were optimistic and pragmatic about the use of generative artificial intelligence in software development, although some experts engaged in critical reflection.

  abstract     = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to become an essential tool for defending against machine-speed attacks on increasingly connected cyber networks and systems. It will allow self-defending and self-recovering cyber-defence agents to be developed, which can respond to attacks in a timely manner. But how can these agents be trusted to perform as expected, and how can they be evaluated responsibly and thoroughly? To answer these questions, a Test and Evaluation (T&E) process has been developed to assess cyber-defence agents. The process evaluates the performance, effectiveness, resilience, and generalizability of agents in both low- and high-fidelity cyber environments. This paper demonstrates the low-fidelity part of the process by performing an example evaluation in the Cyber Operations Research Gym (CybORG) environment on Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents trained as part of Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE) Challenge 2. The process makes use of novel Measures of Effectiveness (MoE) metrics, which can be used in combination with performance metrics such as the RL reward. MoE are tailored for cyber defence, allowing a greater understanding of agents' defensive abilities within a cyber environment. Agents are evaluated against multiple conditions that perturb the environment to investigate their robustness to scenarios not seen during training. The results from this evaluation process will help inform decisions around the benefits and risks of integrating autonomous agents into existing or future cyber systems.},

  abstract     = {The brain tumor grows abnormally in the human brain, which causes brain cancer. Death rates have been rising annually for the past few decades due to negligence of early treatment of brain tumors. To reduce the death rate, early identification of tumors is crucial. Early brain tumor detection may potentially lower the risk of life. Manual tumor diagnosis is complex, challenging, and time-consuming for medical professionals. Therefore, automatic detection and segmentation methods simplify the diagnosing procedure. Thus, automatic segmentation and classification methods are taken up to make the diagnosis process easy. This research proposes a two-dimensional cumulative sum average filter (2D-CSAF) for preprocessing images and an improved deviation sparse fuzzy C-means (IDSFCM) with neighbor information for segmenting brain tumors from magnetic resonance images. The novel IDSFCM segmentation increases the noise reduction capability and enhances segmentation accuracies. The hybrid modified sine cosine algorithm-crow search algorithm (MSCA-CSA)–based WELM model is proposed to classify the brain tumor. The MSCA-CSA algorithm optimizes the weights of the WELM model to increase the classification capability. The gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) feature extraction technique is employed to extract the features from the segmented images, and extracted features are given as input to the MSCA-CSA-WELM model for classification. The brain tumor dataset from Harvard Medical School is considered for this research. The proposed IDSFCM segmentation achieved 99.53% segmentation accuracy. The accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity performance measures are considered for the classification. The classification performance was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics. The proposed MSCA-CSA–based WELM model outperformed feature extraction–based classifiers, achieving 99.37% accuracy, 99.87% sensitivity, and 99.44% specificity during training.},

  abstract     = {A neurodevelopmental illness called autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently associated with sensory problems including an excessive or insufficient sensitivity to noises, scents, or touch. Children with autism typically do not talk much and keep to themselves, but they can imitate certain actions from cartoons and movies. They may exhibit unsafe or unexpected behavior as a result. Early detection and therapy can assist in improving the diseases. In this study, we suggested a data-driven machine learning (ML) model for examining the autism dataset of diverse age groups (toddlers, children, and adults) to classify autism in the initial stage. The proposed ML model can efficiently analyze autism patients’ datasets and correctly classify and detect ASD features. We utilized a data preprocessing technique followed by feature selection methods using information gain and Pearson correlation. Then, we employed five different ML classifiers (KNN, RF, SVM, NB, and MLP) together with a hyperparameter optimization strategy. We assess their work using performance metrics such as prediction accuracy and the F1-measure. After comparing the accuracy between different classifiers, SVM produced the highest accuracies of 98%, 99%, and 100% for the toddler, child, and adult datasets while MLP produced an accuracy of 0.94 for the Pakistani child dataset, respectively. These thorough experimental assessments suggest that correct fine-tuning of the ML techniques can be crucial in the classification of autism in individuals of various ages. We believe that the thorough feature significance analysis presented in this study can guide medical professionals’ judgment when screening ASD individuals. In comparison with other methods currently used for the timely identification of ASD, the suggested framework has shown encouraging results.},

  abstract     = {With the advancement of the digital age, data have become insecure, which requires techniques to secure data. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has become an increasingly secure technology for storing next-generation digital data. DNA provides superior capabilities due to its high and efficient storage capacity and long lifespan. Protecting these data is of utmost importance, especially data with sensitive content. In this study, the proposed encryption algorithm is a new and novel contribution; a new cryptographic methodology is presented that leverages the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank to create cryptographic keys. This key dictionary is created by nucleotide sequences created from the GenBank database. The proposed methodology uses databases such as the National Center GenBank, which contains huge repositories of genetic information, to improve the effectiveness of data security. By converting traditional digital data into DNA sequences, this methodology provides new features of cryptographic protection. The security and reliability of the proposed methodology were thoroughly tested through simulation and data analysis. The results indicate that the proposed encryption methodology has a superior ability to withstand many types of cryptographic attacks, which confirms its effectiveness and strength in data protection. The paper also presented several findings, including a low encryption time of 250 ms and decryption time of 230 ms, as well as a memory usage of 50 MB for large datasets. Furthermore, the proposed method demonstrated exceptionally high stability. Across all these metrics, the proposed approach outperformed other existing methods. The proposed methodology is applicable to ensure the security and integrity of DNA-based digital storage systems. This methodology was developed independently and has not been previously studied. This modern methodology represents an advance in digital data security and protection, providing an advanced solution in the digital age of cybersecurity.},

Models explored for regression in this paper include linear regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest (RF), XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN).

This study developed a neural network classifier to determine the nutritional requirements for four types of Type 2 diabetic patients: those with chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, or all three conditions. The classifier was trained using Kenya Food Composition Tables data on food nutrients and processing techniques. The neural network had five layers, including three hidden layers with 10 neurons each, using tanh and sigmoid activation functions, gradient descent optimization, cross-entropy loss function, and 0.1 learning rate. Training used 40 hidden neurons per layer, 60,000 epochs and 0.2 learning rate. The neural network was evaluated against random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The neural network achieved high performance with 91.4% accuracy, 88% recall, 86.8% precision, and 87.3% F1-score.

  abstract     = {The prevailing method for grading oil palm fruit bunches in mills relies on human graders conducting visual inspections, resulting in frequent errors and inconsistent assessments. This is a significant open problem when developing a detector for oil palm fruit ripeness and oil content, which are related factors. Current trends focus on computer vision techniques based on image processing and machine learning to improve grading of oil palm fruit bunches at an individual factory, resulting in limited diversity of the data used for evaluation. Collecting data from all factories offers informational advantages but raises privacy concerns. Addressing these challenges, this study proposes federated learning (FL) to develop local and global prediction models for grading oil palm fruit ripeness while preserving data privacy. FL facilitates collaborative model training across factories, mitigating privacy risks and enhancing model development efficiency. The proposed model uses the color of palm husks to determine the ripeness stage, which is used as a factor in predicting the yield of oil from the crop. A predictive model was created using FL principles with a training dataset of 5209 images, which was divided into two subsets: single-palm (2571 images) and multipalm (2638 images). The classification accuracy of a global model was 90.0%, while the local models were expanded to include private data for each of 4 testing clients. The predictive global and local models from FL were used to implement the system in a web application form and to validate its performance in calling the oil palm ripeness stage.},

Proper garbage waste processing, management, and recycling are crucial for both ecological and economic reasons. Computer vision techniques have shown advanced capabilities in various applications, including object detection and classification. In this study, we conducted an extensive review of the use of artificial intelligence for garbage processing and management. However, a major limitation in this field is the lack of datasets containing top-view images of garbage. We introduce a new dataset named “KACHARA,” containing 4727 images categorized into seven classes: clothes, decomposable (organic waste), glass, metal, paper, plastic, and wood. Importantly, the dataset exhibits a moderate imbalance, mirroring the distribution of real-world garbage, which is crucial for training accurate classification models. For classification, we utilize transfer learning with the well-known deep learning model MobileNetV3-Large, where the top layers are fine-tuned to enhance performance. We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.37% and also evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. These results demonstrate the model’s strong generalization in aerial/top-view garbage classification.},

This study proposes an AutoGluon–Shapley additive explanations (AutoGluon-SHAP) approach, which automatically predicts concrete mechanical strength while providing insightful interpretations of the results. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) was developed to enhance global accessibility to the model. AutoGluon leverages powerful algorithms such as LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, random forest, ensembles, and neural networks within its TabularPredictor to automate model selection. The models were trained and tested using a comprehensive dataset of 1760 concrete samples sourced from the published literature, encompassing diverse concrete types, cement brands, additives, target compressive strengths, and curing periods. Results show that the WeightedEnsemble_L2 predictive model demonstrated robust performance in estimating flexural, tensile, and compressive strengths. All the predictive models achieved high performance with R 2 of more than 0.98 for all the strengths’ properties. SHAP offered both global insights into the influence of the predictors on mechanical strength and local explanations for individual predictions, ensuring transparency and reliability.

This study presents a comprehensive hybrid modeling approach to predict oil prices in the context of Russia and Ukraine across three distinct periods: before the war, during the war, and the immediate aftermath of the conflict. Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a hybrid system combining Random Forest, ElasticNet, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regressor models. These models were integrated through a Voting Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy. Our analysis revealed varying levels of predictive performance across the different periods. Prior to the war, the models showed strong predictive capabilities, evidenced by low mean-squared error (MSE) values and high coefficients of determination ( R 2 ). However, during the war, the models struggled to capture extreme volatility, resulting in significantly increased MSE and negative R 2 values. Predictions for the immediate aftermath of the conflict demonstrated improvements, with a reduction in MSE and positive R 2 values, indicating a return to relatively more stable market conditions. Notably, combining data from both before the war and war periods could further improve predictive accuracy, as it would reduce the impact of the conflict’s volatility on model performance. These results emphasize the challenges of forecasting oil prices in periods of geopolitical instability and underscore the importance of hybrid modeling approaches to adapt to rapidly changing market dynamics.},

In this study, we propose an efficient approach combining dynamic contrast stretching (DCS) method, advanced morphological operation–based segmentation, triangle thresholding, and a final postprocessing step. Our preprocessing step enhances the contrast of retinal images acquired under various lighting conditions, enabling reliable and accurate segmentation. This enhancement is achieved using the DCS method, which is compared to two widely used contrast enhancement techniques: adaptive histogram equalization (AHE) and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE). The second step combines morphological operations and triangle thresholding to enhance vessel structures, eliminate noise, and separate blood vessels effectively. Postprocessing addresses artifacts and ambiguous areas at image boundaries. Our approach is evaluated using widely recognized reference datasets, including Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE), Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE), and High-Resolution Fundus (HRF). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, we achieve average accuracy rates of 98.08%, 97.14%, and 98.94% for the DRIVE, STARE, and HRF datasets, respectively. In addition, our method is distinguished by exceptionally fast execution times, reaching 0.013 s for the DRIVE and STARE datasets.

  abstract     = {Since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the virus has posed a grave threat to human health. Automated segmentation of COVID-19 lung computed tomography (CT) scans is a crucial diagnostic tool that aids physicians in providing accurate and timely diagnoses, as it contains significant radiomics information. Given that the specificity for discriminating between the causes of conventional pulmonary features is lower than its sensitivity, the primary goal of this study is to develop and evaluate a CT-based radiomics model capable of distinguishing between COVID-19 and other lung diseases. To address this, we propose an efficient, modified radiomics feature processing method that integrates an optimal aerial perspective (OAP) parameter-based intensity dark channel prior (IDCP) with a 50-layer residual deep neural network (ResNet50 DNN) for autolesion segmentation (ALS-IOAP-DNN). To further enhance COVID-19 lesion estimation, novel optimization strategies, including a hybrid simulated annealing-cuckoo search (SA-CS) algorithm, are introduced alongside the original SA method. The SA-CS algorithm extends SA by preventing entrapment in local minimum and enhancing global exploration. Five benchmark functions are used to accelerate convergence and address the issue of local optima. As a result, the hybrid approach outperforms 10 recent studies on two publicly available datasets (COVID-CT-Dataset and HUST-19), achieving an average accuracy score of 100% across different epochs, along with perfect accuracy, 100% sensitivity, and 100% specificity. The proposed models significantly outperform the baseline model, with accuracy improvements of 13.6% on Data1 and 2.5% on Data2. While the baseline model achieves 88% accuracy on Data1 and 97.6% on Data2, the proposed ALS-IOAP-DNN4 model attains perfect accuracy (100%) on both datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ALS and advanced optimization techniques. Furthermore, the use of OAP with IDCP enhances the precision of COVID-19 lesion estimation, underscoring its significance in COVID-19 diagnosis and medical imaging management.},

Highly accurate and reliable T w forecasts are essential for the ecological management of rivers. This study evaluates the performance of machine learning-based predictive models in forecasting T w in the Catu River. The models were trained using climatic and hydrological data collected from 2009 to 2016 and validated with real data from 2023. The evaluated models include backpropagation neural network (BPNN), Random Forest, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Air2Stream, and NARX, employing nine input variables such as atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and water vapor concentration. The results show that the BiLSTM model achieved the best performance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12°C and R 2 = 0.98, followed by BPNN with an RMSE of 0.18°C and R 2 = 0.91, and the Random Forest model, which obtained an NSE of 0.95. These models demonstrated a strong ability to predict T w under both normal and extreme conditions, capturing the thermal dynamics of the Catu River with high precision during events involving minor thermal variations. Conversely, the NARX and Air2Stream models exhibited lower performance, proving more prone to errors under conditions of extreme variability. The findings of this study provide valuable scientific insights for river T w prediction and the protection of aquatic ecosystems, with practical applications in water resource management in tropical regions.},

  abstract     = {Biometric security systems must be able to detect phony fingerprints to provide reliable authentication. The findings of this study suggest a hybrid approach to the detection of fake fingerprints that uses information on the texture and shape of the fingerprint. The novelty of this approach lies in integrating both traditional fingerprint information and geometric features obtained through wavelet transformation, which has not been extensively explored in previous studies. The proposed procedure uses the traditional fingerprint information and the geometric features that may be collected by wavelet modification. This allows it to take advantage of the complementary capabilities that these two types of capabilities offer. In addition, the hybrid feature set improves the system’s robustness and accuracy by leveraging each feature type’s unique strengths. To achieve this goal, the standard fingerprint information and the geometric aspects of the fingerprint are combined. It is possible to efficiently identify authentic and forged fingerprints by using these hybrid features and training a gradient boosting classifier. The findings of the studies demonstrate that the suggested technique achieves an accuracy of 96% on medium spoofing photos from the SOCOFing dataset, 97% on hard spoofing images, and 98% on mixed spoofing images. This high level of accuracy, especially on mixed spoofing images, showcases the effectiveness of the novel hybrid approach in diverse and challenging scenarios. This places it in the position of being the most accurate way currently accessible among the existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method’s scalability and adaptability make it suitable for real-world applications, potentially setting a new standard in biometric security. There is a great deal of optimism that the technique that has been described can increase the reliability and safety of biometric systems when used in situations representative of the actual world.},

This study proposes an efficient spectrum-sharing technique for dual-hop CRNs using NOMA, optimized by an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm and guided by a single-input single-output fuzzy rule-based system (SISO-FRBS). In this setup, a distant primary transmitter communicates with the primary receiver via a secondary NOMA relay. The objective is to maximize the sum data rate of secondary users (SUs) while minimizing total transmission power. SISO-FRBS enhances the IABC search process by dynamically guiding the search agents, improving both optimization quality and convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves the primary data rate benchmark of 5 bit/s/Hz at a transmit power of 19 mW, compared with 23 mW with traditional ABC, achieving a 19.04% improvement in power efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Computer vision plays a crucial role in current day tasks due to its wide range of merits and applications in many fields like disease diagnosis, medical decisions, military, security, scientific applications, and business. Identifying plant species upon their leaf images is a very challenging and complex task. In this study, we introduced a model for classifying a variety set of plant leaves using different techniques such as factorization machine (FM), dimensionality reduction (DR), and ensemble learning (EL). In our study, FM is used as a classification algorithm, whereas DR is included in two stages, namely, feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS). FE has been used to extract the features from images in tabular form; on the other hand, FS is used to reduce the size of the data by getting rid of noisy (redundant and irrelevant) features. In addition, we utilized two methods for FS, filter-based and wrapper-based approaches. The used filter was the minimum redundancy maximum relevance, and the used wrapper was the improved binary cuckoo search algorithm that is based on Lévy flight and abandon nest functions. Regarding EL, it was used to declare different versions of FM by passing different subsets of features that are deduced from the original ones to improve its performance. We used the Swedish and Flavia leaf datasets for training and testing phases. The proposed model achieved a high performance in terms of accuracy that produced 95.67% on Swedish dataset and 99.6% on Flavia dataset. According to the results and in comparison to other methods, we proved that our proposed model ensures a favorable plant leaf classification approach. Finally, the proposed wrapper FS approach showed very good results without setting up the number of features to be selected by the user.

Recently, there has been an increase in the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models in hydrogeology to estimate GWL in monitoring wells. This study presents a novel technique for predicting GWL changes that uses three independent datasets: historical GWL and climatic variables (CVs) data such as rainfall and temperature influencing groundwater dynamics. In our experimental research, the models’ prediction output on real-world datasets ensures that the model’s significant patterns are recorded while taking into account the noise in the data, resulting in a perfect balance of bias and variance. The DL models’ results show a significant score of root mean square error (RMSE) between 2.20 and 12.40 and coefficient of determination ( R -squared between 0.84–0.99), showing a significant improvement in RMSE and mean absolute error (MAE) in the testing and validation categories, when compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. This study improves our understanding of GWL modeling and provides decision-makers with a reliable tool for controlling change. The study advances environmental modeling by exhibiting methodological complexity and emphasizes the importance of comprehensive data analysis in water resource management.},

  abstract     = {Stroke disease has been the leading cause of death globally for the last several decades. Thus, the death rate can be decreased by early recognition of disease and ongoing surveillance. However, the largest obstacle to perform advanced analytics using the conventional approach is the growth of massive amount of data from various sources, including patient histories, wearable sensor devices, and medical data. The current technology that could have a large impact on the healthcare sector is the integration of machine learning with big data analytics (scalable machine learning), particularly in the early diagnosis of this disease. To address this issue, a scalable stroke disease prediction model for a multinode distributed environment, which was developed by combining big data analytics concepts with machine learning to handle extensive healthcare datasets, an aspect not seen in the prior literature on stroke disease detection, is presented in this work. We have implemented four scalable algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient-boosting tree, and decision tree, using a dataset that was collected from a Medical Quality Improvement Consortium database. As a result, two worker nodes and one master node were used to analyze the dataset. The model’s performance was assessed using performance metrics including the area under the curve (AUC) and confusion matrix. With an accuracy of 94.3% and an AUC score of 99%, the random forest was determined to be better based on the experimental results. It was also shown that the main risk factor for stroke disease is diabetes, which is followed by hypertension. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of using Spark’s scalable machine learning techniques to forecast stroke disease and identify risk factors earlier. The findings of this study can be utilized by physicians as clinical decision aids to aid in the more accurate identification of stroke disease.},

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of subscriber traffic is a critical challenge in telecommunication networks, as it is essential for making informed decisions to maintain consistent service quality. Various artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been explored for this purpose, with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) being particularly popular. However, RNNs often suffer from the gradient vanishing problem, which reduces their effectiveness in processing long sequences of data. Long short–term memory (LSTM) networks partially address this issue by controlling the propagation of learning errors, but they still face challenges related to convergence speed and residual learning errors. To address these limitations, this study proposes a new hybrid RNN architecture that combines features of Jordan and Frasconi networks for improved subscriber traffic prediction. The proposed architecture integrates two sublayers, a sigmoid and a Gaussian function, within a hidden layer that forms a loop. This configuration enables the network to leverage incremental learning through restricted Coulomb energy (RCE) at the local level, while also benefiting from global learning through backpropagation. The architecture was tested on a dataset consisting of cellular traffic data collected from a telecommunication operator in Cameroon. The results demonstrated that the hybrid RNN model outperforms traditional Jordan and Frasconi networks, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.18 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.61 using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 64. In addition, the hybrid model showed superior performance in terms of RMSE, MAE, and convergence speed compared to the existing models. These findings suggest that the proposed model could support telecom operators in proactive congestion management and resource optimization.},

Unfortunately, traditional approaches to predicting readmissions frequently lack accuracy. This presents a critical challenge, as identifying patients at high risk for readmission is essential for implementing preventive measures. The study introduces a novel method that employs machine learning to automatically extract features from patient data, eliminating labor-intensive manual feature engineering. The primary goal is to develop predictive models for unplanned readmissions for UTI patients at Jordan University Hospital within 3 months postdischarge. This is executed through a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from January 2020 to June 2023. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study identifies high-risk patients by evaluating demographic, clinical, and outcome characteristics, ensuring model reliability through thorough optimization, validation, and performance assessment. Three predictive models were developed as follows: a gradient-boosting classifier (GBC), logistic regression (LR), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The GBC, SGD, and LR achieved impressive accuracy rates of 99%, 95%, and 89%, providing strong confidence in the methodology. The study’s findings reveal key risk factors associated with readmissions, enhancing our understanding of this process and offering a valuable framework for improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and supporting evidence-based decision-making in healthcare management.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is characterized by abnormal cell growth, which leads to tumor formation. Autonomous breast cancer detection has seen good progress. However, there are still several challenges to robust detection. This survey article explores the complexities inherent in multiclass classification for breast cancer diagnosis, aiming to improve patient care, efficiency, and timeliness. In our study, we focus on using histopathology slide images and assess the current state of breast cancer classification, particularly with artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning and convolutional neural networks. The histopathology images are key tools in the diagnosis process, allowing pathologists to visually assess tissue samples for signs of cancer. Our analysis reveals several challenges that hinder the effectiveness of current diagnostic methods. One significant issue is the need for more diversity in the existing datasets, which often fail to represent a wide range of patient populations. This limitation reduces the accuracy of diagnostic results, mainly when applied to different clinical environments. Furthermore, class imbalances within these datasets, where certain cancer types or stages are underrepresented, lead to biased diagnoses, with more common cases being easily identified while rarer cases are frequently missed. Another challenge is the limited generalizability of current diagnostic techniques, which perform well in controlled environments but often need to improve when applied to new, unseen data from different institutions or imaging systems. Additionally, the complexity of histopathological analysis means that it can be difficult for clinicians to interpret certain findings, leading to uncertainty in the diagnostic process. Our study reveals that addressing these issues requires collaborative efforts to improve the quality of datasets, reduce class imbalances, and develop optimal standardized diagnostic methods. By overcoming these challenges, we can enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and global healthcare. We believe that by examining several factors and variables and conducting an in-depth analysis of the state of the art, this study will contribute to the state of the art and benefit researchers in both computing and medical domains.},

  abstract     = {In today’s mobile communication society, the integration of mobile technology in education has revolutionised learning through m-Learning. This approach leverages wireless mobile technology and computing, enabling learners to access educational resources anytime and anywhere, thereby enhancing flexibility and freedom. Mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and PDAs, facilitate m-Learning by providing mobility and interactive learning environments. M-Learning is characterised by its personalised, collaborative, and ubiquitous nature, offering learners context-aware experiences tailored to their immediate surroundings and needs. Context awareness plays a pivotal role in m-Learning, distinguishing it from traditional education by dynamically adapting content delivery based on factors beyond just location, including time, network conditions and user preferences. This adaptability poses significant challenges in designing effective teaching strategies that meet diverse learner requirements. To address these challenges, this study explores the application of machine learning techniques—specifically “Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS)”—in developing a Context-Aware m-Learning platform. Performance comparisons based on RMSE, MAE and accuracy metrics reveal ANFIS as the optimal method for enhancing the proposed m-Learning system, aligning with the contextual demands and parameters defined for effective mobile education. ANFIS’s ability to minimise absolute prediction errors more effectively than the other methods. In terms of accuracy, ANFIS again leads the performance metrics, achieving an accuracy of 82.46% with 10 neurons. In comparison, ANN and KNN achieved accuracies of 81.17% and 80.74%, respectively. These accuracy values indicate that ANFIS not only reduces prediction errors but also consistently delivers higher predictive accuracy.

  abstract     = {As smart cities have evolved through the constant incorporation of advanced technologies such as Internet of Things, the importance of efficient data collection and robust security monitoring has increased massively. These smart cities, while monitoring and evaluating different activities, utilize a network of interconnected sensors and devices. This would not only enhance the provision of public services but also ensure increased safety measures. However, the extensive implementation of such systems has increased the concerns related to privacy and data protection. The growing dependence on surveillance technology in smart cities, though beneficial in terms of security, has also increased challenges associated with the protection of individual privacy. As such, different research has been conducted to develop advanced solutions that ensure the security of an individual while also safeguarding their personal privacy. This study examines the different aspects of privacy preservation in the context of security surveillance in smart cities. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of 100 research articles, it elucidates the current state of research and identifies emerging solutions aimed at safeguarding citizen privacy while simultaneously upholding the integrity of smart urban environments.},

This research investigates the application of deep feature extraction for classifying eight different ocular diseases. The VGG16, a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model, was employed for feature extraction, while the fine k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier was utilized for classification. Experimental results showed an initial classification accuracy of 89.2% using features from Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps and 83.1% using Multiscale Retinex (MSR) enhanced images. However, combining both feature sets led to an improved classification accuracy of 96.5%. Despite these promising results, several challenges remain, including the need for models that generalize across diverse patient imaging and demographics modalities, the accessibility of extensive annotated datasets, and the interpretability of models. Ethical issues and legal frameworks are also crucial for the safe and fair implementation of AI in medical services. The study suggests that future efforts in deep learning for ophthalmology should focus on creating large-scale, annotated datasets to enhance the detection of ocular diseases.},

The models were trained using historical price, weather, and rainfall data using time-series forecasting methods, specifically LSTM and CNN. The findings indicate that stepwise feature selection minimizes prediction errors and improves MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. Preliminary experiments revealed that the LSTM model with feature selection outperformed the other models, particularly in feature selection. Employing standard hyperparameters of 100 epochs, 32 batches, and five windows, the model demonstrated superior performance with a lower MSE (0.0010), RMSE (0.0274), MAPE (3.7803), and MAE (0.0158) than the CNN model. Statistical hypothesis testing revealed significant variations between the LSTM and CNN models, with feature selection p -values below 0.05. These results indicate that LSTM with feature selection models optimized through refined hyperparameters leads to more accurate Thai morning glory price forecasting, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in their decision-making processes. Additionally, this study can forecast prices for 5, 7, 14, and 21 days in advance based on different Window_len values, addressing various planning needs. The 5- and 7-day forecasts support short-term decision-making, such as scheduling harvest cycles and weekly market planning, whereas the 14-day forecast assists farmers in optimizing planting schedules and logistics. Furthermore, the 21-day forecast is beneficial for medium-term market planning, including negotiating forward contracts and adjusting distribution strategies to maximize profitability.},

  abstract     = {Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, ranking as the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis of this disease is of utmost importance to increase the survival rate and enhance the healthcare system. Many machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods have been proposed to facilitate automated early diagnosis of this cancer. However, label noise in medical images and the dependence on a single model can lead to suboptimal model performance, which could potentially hinder the development of a sophisticated automated solution. In this paper, we address label noise in training data and propose a stacking-ensemble model for classifying colorectal cancer along with a trustworthy computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Initially, a variety of filtering methods are extensively analyzed to determine the most suitable image representation, with subsequent data augmentation techniques. Second, a modified VGG-16 model was proposed with fine-tuning that was utilized as a feature extractor to extract meaningful features from the training samples. Third, a prediction uncertainty and probabilistic local outlier factor (pLOF) were applied to the extracted features to address the label noise issue in the training data. Fourth, we adopted a random forest–based recursive feature elimination (RF-RFE) feature selection method with various combinations of features to recursively select the most influential ones for accurate predictions. Fifth, four base ML classifiers and a metamodel were selected to build our final stacking-ensemble model, which integrates the prediction probabilities of multiple models into a meta-feature set to ensure trustworthy predictions. Finally, we integrated these strategies and deployed them into a web application to demonstrate a CAD system. This system not only predicts the disease but also generates the prediction probabilities of each class, which enhances both clarity and diagnostic insight. Our proposed model was compared with different state-of-the-art ML classifiers on a publicly available dataset and demonstrated the highest accuracy of 92.43%.},

In this study, we aimed to (1) determine the typical region of body thermograms and (2) propose a soft-vote fusion algorithm to develop a more accurate result in obesity detection. The typical regions of thermograms were selected by training and testing the pretrained CNN models with the thermogram dataset of all-region and single-region. All-region dataset includes thermograms from five regions, namely, supraclavicular (SCV), abdomen, forearm, palm, and shank, while each of single-region dataset consists of thermograms from an individual region. When tested on all-region dataset, the CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 90.00%. When tested with a single-region dataset, three regions, namely, SCV, abdomen, and forearm, achieved the highest accuracy of 94.23% (SCV) and 96.15% (abdomen and forearm), which indicated that these regions were more representative than palm and shank. Then, we proposed a soft-vote fusion algorithm in which different trained CNN models from the previous experiments were combined to improve the detection performance. We found that the combination of those three regions can achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest model size. One of those proposed combinations achieved an accuracy of 98.08% with a framework size of 19.4 MB by only using SCV and abdomen thermogram as the inputs.},

The input text alone often provides limited knowledge to generate contextually correct and meaningful translation. Relying solely on the input text could yield translations that lack accuracy. Side information related to either source or target side is helpful in the context of NMT. In this study, we empirically show that training an NMT model with target-side additional information used as knowledge can significantly improve the translation quality. The acquired knowledge is leveraged in the encoder-/decoder-based model utilizing multiencoder framework. The additional encoder converts knowledge into dense semantic representation called attention. These attentions from the input sentence and additional knowledge are then combined into a unified attention. The decoder generates the translation by conditioning on both the input text and acquired knowledge. Evaluation of translation from Urdu to English with a low-resource setting yields promising results in terms of both perplexity reduction and improved BLEU scores. The proposed models in the respective group outperform in LSTM and GRU with attention mechanism by +3.1 and +2.9 BLEU score, respectively. Extensive analysis confirms our claim that the translations influenced by additional information may occasionally contain rare low-frequency words and faithful translation. Experimental results on a different language pair DE-EN demonstrate that our suggested method is more efficient and general.},

  abstract     = {A traffic network exhibits inherent characteristics of networks while also possessing unique features that hold significant research value. In this study, the limitations of static graph structures and the challenges of accurately modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in traffic flow have been addressed through a hybrid GCN-gated recurrent unit (GRU)-transformer model. The proposed model integrates a dynamic topology module (DTM) with graph attention networks (GATs), GRUs, and transformer-based temporal modules to adaptively capture the evolving dynamics of traffic networks. The DTM dynamically updates graph structures based on real-time traffic conditions, while GATs focus on identifying critical spatial relationships. GRUs efficiently capture temporal dependencies, and the transformer model captures long-term sequential patterns, providing a comprehensive framework for real-time traffic forecasting. The proposed model was trained and evaluated using the METR-LA dataset, which comprises traffic data from 207 sensors at 5-minute intervals. The model demonstrated superior performance across various metrics, achieving RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of 4.125%, 2.985%, and 5.432%, respectively, for 15-minute predictions, with an R 2 value of 0.928. For longer prediction horizons (30, 45, and 60 min), the model consistently outperformed baseline methods, maintaining competitive RMSE and MAPE values. The experimental setup included normalization, graph construction using adjacency matrices, and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and robustness. The integration of spatial and temporal features through the GCN-GRU-transformer framework enhanced the model’s ability to generalize across varying traffic scenarios, including peak hours and disruptions. Compared to traditional methods, which often rely on static graphs and fail to adapt to real-time changes, the hybrid model effectively addresses both spatial heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. The results indicate its robustness in handling complex traffic dynamics, adaptability to real-world variations, and potential applications in intelligent transportation systems. Future work will focus on incorporating multimodal data sources and enhancing computational efficiency to achieve broader scalability and deployment in smart city infrastructures.},

Consequently, hate speech and offensive content have turned out to be a widespread issue that negatively affects both individuals and society and needs to be controlled through detection and removal. This paper aims to provide a further understanding of the meaning of hate speech and offensive language and to provide a comprehensive discussion of the various techniques to detect hate speech and offensive language. A systematic literature review (SLR) of 90 research papers published between 2018 and 2024 was conducted to discover gaps within the literature. This review revealed challenges and possibilities for further development and improvement of previous findings. The results show that most of these works classified hate speech and offensive language using techniques from machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), and the most common performance metrics were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure. The benchmark datasets are also described. Twitter was the most commonly utilized social network for obtaining datasets, while Facebook is sometimes used. Moreover, the findings of this review offer insight into research trends in Arabic hate speech and offensive language, as well as new research directions. The most interesting finding is that until now most Social Media Network Developers have not included autodetection of hate speech or offensive language plugins. Finally, this study presents a guideline for choosing the best strategies and techniques to detect and predict Arabic offensive language and hate speech.},

  abstract     = {This study presents ensemble machine learning (ML) models for predicting residential energy consumption in South Africa. By combining the best features of individual ML models, ensemble models reduce the drawbacks of each model and improve prediction accuracy. We present four ensemble models: ensemble by averaging (EA), ensemble by stacking each estimator (ESE), ensemble by boosting (EB), and ensemble by voting estimator (EVE). These models are built on top of Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT). These base predictor models leverage historical energy consumption patterns to capture temporal intricacies, including seasonal variations and rolling averages. In addition, we employed feature engineering methodologies to further enhance their predictive abilities. The accuracy of each ensemble model was evaluated by assessing various performance indicators, including the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination R 2 . Overall, the findings illustrate the efficiency of ensemble learning models in providing accurate predictions for residential energy consumption. This study provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in predicting energy consumption in residential buildings and the benefits of using ensemble learning models in the building and energy research domains.},

  abstract     = {A vast variety of neural network (NN)–based controllers use indirect adaptive control structures for their implementation, which primarily aims at estimating the nonlinear dynamics of the system and thereby generating a suitable control action. However, the most commonly used gradient descent weight update rule of the NN-based indirect adaptive controllers often fails to identify the system dynamics appropriately, and the control action becomes ineffective on the system under control. Further, a significant number of existing works in this domain employ randomized or suboptimal initial NN weights, which can potentially hamper the transient performance of the control loop. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative control scheme that utilizes the strength of indirect adaptive control of NN, along with the robustness of the PID controller. Since the PID control structure is often independent of plant dynamics and generates a control action to mitigate any error between the reference and the current plant output, it can be easily augmented with the control action generated by inverse neural network (INN) to mitigate any effects of unlearnt dynamics by INN. Further, we have used a bio-inspired optimization algorithm, that is, particle swarm optimization (PSO), to optimize the initial weights of the INN along with the PID controller’s parameters to get an optimal control performance. The proposed INN + PID controller scheme has been tested on a cart-mounted inverted pendulum system due to its challenging control requirement owing to its intricate nonlinear dynamics. Detailed simulation studies for the proposed INN + PID and PID controllers have been carried out for various control requirements, viz. set point tracking, disturbance rejection, and robustness testing. Further, an extensive comparative study has been devised based on the integral of absolute error (IAE) to test the efficacy of the proposed INN + PID controller against the conventional PID controller. Through extensive comparative studies, it was deduced that the proposed INN + PID controller is capable of handling the intricate nonlinear dynamics of the cart-mounted inverted pendulum system and provides a sturdy stabilization of the angular position of the pendulum with respect to the desired trajectory and superior transient control in comparison with the conventional PID controller. In terms of quantitative comparison, the improvement in IAE achieved by the proposed INN + PID controller was found to be 94.84%, 94.62%, and 69.86% better in comparison to the conventional PID controller for set point tracking, disturbance rejection for introduced impulsive force, and time-varying force variation, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer spreads quickly as the skin is the most vulnerable organ, and melanoma (MEL) is a fatal type of skin cancer. Detecting MEL in the early stage can hugely increase the chance of a cure. There are several methods based on machine learning to detect MEL from dermoscopic images. However, increasing the accuracy of detection is still challenging. This paper presents a new method for MEL detection that considers the combination of deep and handcrafted time–frequency local features. After short preprocessing, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) extract the deep features. To this end, feature maps at the output of the flatten layer are considered as deep features. The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors are handcrafted local features computed from the four subbands of one-level two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2D DWT). After the fusion of the mentioned features, semisupervised discriminant analysis (SDA) reduces the highly correlated and redundant features. The Bayesian optimizer finds the optimum parameters of the SDA and Gaussian kernel of the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to maximize the classification accuracy. The HAM10000 dataset with data augmentation is considered to assess the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method reaches the accuracy and sensitivity of 94.19% and 96.22%, respectively. The most challenging parts of the proposed method are extraction of deep features and tuning the parameters of SDA and Gaussian-SVM.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on developing an intelligent administrative chatbot for Roman Urdu to overcome the language barrier that hinders individuals who are not fluent in English from utilizing existing chatbot frameworks. While chatbot architectures can be rule based or artificial intelligence (AI) based, the core objective of a chatbot is to effectively address user queries across diverse domains. AI-based chatbots have demonstrated higher interactivity, scalability, adaptability to human interests, and evolving knowledge compared with rule-based architectures. However, the majority of existing chatbot frameworks is in English, which poses a challenge in regions like Pakistan where only a small percentage of the population is proficient in English. In response to this challenge, this research introduces an intelligent administrative chatbot specifically developed for Roman Urdu. Roman Urdu is the practice of writing Urdu, the native language of Pakistan, using the English alphabet. The proposed chatbot allows students to post their questions in either English or Roman Urdu, enabling them to obtain conclusive answers. The chatbot system utilizes a sentence analysis approach to generate relevant and productive responses to user queries. The core building block of the proposed chatbot is the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. To train the model, a dataset was meticulously collected from various administrative offices at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, initially in English and subsequently translated into Roman Urdu using different writing styles. The effectiveness of the proposed system was evaluated through a human judgment approach, assessing the contextual relevance and productivity of the chatbot’s responses to relevant questions. In conclusion, this research aims to bridge the language gap in chatbot frameworks, enhancing accessibility and usability.},

  abstract     = {Face recognition is a reliable biometric technology that utilizes artificial intelligence and computer vision to identify and verify an individual’s identity based on facial features. Its rapid development has enabled integration into diverse applications, including security systems, access control, forensics, and mobile devices. However, challenges such as recognizing faces across different ages persist, presenting opportunities for further research. Developing robust face recognition models requires substantial training datasets, but manually labeling large collections of facial images is both time-intensive and costly. Our previous study demonstrated that a ResNet-50 model trained on a dataset of 44,000 facial images, combining the original FaceScrub dataset with HyperStyle age and smile augmentations, achieved an F1-score of 79%, significantly outperforming the model trained solely on the authentic FaceScrub dataset (F1-score: 63%). Building upon these findings, this study explores a broader range of augmentation styles, including pose and domain adaptation, e.g., Pixar, Toonify, Sketch, and Disney, using the HyperStyle scheme. Models trained with domain adaptation showed reduced performance (F1-score: 64%) due to the domain gap introduced by cartoon-like styles. In contrast, models trained with pose augmentation achieved an F1-score of 75%, demonstrating the importance of augmentations resembling real-world variations. When training incorporated all augmentation styles, e.g., age, smile, pose, and domain adaptation, the F1-score reached 78%, slightly lower than the model trained with age and smile augmentations only (F1-score: 79%). To further evaluate the impact of age and smile augmentations, additional experiments were conducted using various CNN models, including VGGNet-16, MobileNetV3Small, SEResNet-18, and ResNet-50, under different hyperparameter configurations. Among these, ResNet-50 achieved the highest F1-score (82%), surpassing VGGNet-16 (60%), MobileNetV3Small (65%), and SEResNet-18 (81%). The study also introduced modifications to the HyperStyle scheme in both the preprocessing and postprocessing stages, which further enhanced model performance. The ResNet-50 model trained with the modified HyperStyle scheme, and the original FaceScrub dataset achieved the highest F1-score of 83%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these modifications in improving face recognition performance.},

The utilized dataset, combined with multiple open-source datasets, comprises 43,000 real, 31,000 fake, and 80,000 AI–generated news articles and is augmented with an ensemble large language model. We combined three open-source LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-NEO, and Distil-GPT-2) into an ensemble LLM to generate new news titles, selecting the best outputs through majority voting for further dataset expansion. Preprocessing involved data cleaning, lowercasing, stop word removal, tokenization, and lemmatization. We applied six machine learning and five natural language processing models to this dataset. The two top-performing natural language–based models (RoBERTa and DeBERTa) have been combined to develop an ensemble transformer model. Among the machine learning models, random forest achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 92.49% and an F1 score of 92.60%. Among the natural language processing models, the ensemble transformer model attained the highest results, with 96.65% accuracy and an F1 score of 96.66%. The proposed ensemble model is optimized by applying model pruning (reducing parameters from 265M to 210M, improving training time by 25%) and dynamic quantization (reducing model size by 50%, maintaining 95.68% accuracy), enhancing scalability and efficiency while minimizing computational overhead. The DistilBERT-Student model, trained using a balanced combination of feature- and logit-based distillation from the RoBERTa-base Teacher network, achieved strong classification performance with 96.17% accuracy. Visualize-based attention maps are constructed for different news categories to enhance the interpretability of the applied transformer–based ensemble news detection models. Finally, a website was developed to enable users to identify fake, real, or AI–generated news content.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of cold-deck, mean, and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) imputation techniques for predicting thyroid disease using a dataset of 9172 observations with 31 clinical features (5.2% missing values). Feature importance analysis identified thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine index (FTI) as consistently significant biomarkers across all imputation methods. Five classifiers—Naïve Bayes, linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), LightGBM, and recurrent neural networks (RNN)—were assessed on imputed datasets, with performance evaluated through accuracy, F1 score, and recall. The KNN imputation method enhanced LightGBM’s accuracy by 0.47% over mean imputation (99.06% vs. 98.99%) and by 1.47% over cold deck (99.06% vs. 98.59%), demonstrating its superiority in preserving feature relationships and enhancing predictive power. LightGBM achieved the highest performance with KNN imputation (accuracy: 99.06%, F1: 97.57%, and recall: 97.83%), outperforming other classifiers by 2.5%–4.0% in accuracy. These results underscore the necessity of robust imputation techniques for reliable thyroid disease prediction.

Traditional clustering methods, such as K-means, are limited by fixed cluster numbers and sensitivity to outliers, often missing small or irregular fraud patterns. This research introduces an adaptive clustering algorithm (AD-KMeans) that dynamically adjusts the number of clusters based on variance and density thresholds, enabling better identification of hidden fraudulent activity. Using the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, the proposed method is evaluated against standard K-means using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F 1-score, silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index (DBI), and the Calinski–Harabasz index (CHI). Experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed AD-KMeans achieves the highest fraud recall (91.2%) and F 1-score (87.6%), improving recall by 22.3 percentage points over the best hybrid model (hybrid DNN + clustering, 68.9%) and F 1-score by 11.5 points (from 76.1% to 87.6%). Moreover, it identifies distinct fraud-prone clusters and adapts effectively to data structure variations.

Therefore, early prediction and detection are critical, leading to timely and appropriate interventions at early stages. Four ensemble tree-based algorithms were used in this study: adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, random forest, and extremely randomized trees, investigating their ability to predict heart disease. Data related to heart disease clinical features was obtained from the open Kaggle Machine Learning Dataset repository. Adaptive Boosting stands out as the highest performer, achieving an average testing accuracy of 93.70%, precision of 93.71%, recall of 93.70%, and F1 score of 93.69%, along with the highest AUC score of 0.9708, across all competing models considered in the study. These metrics indicate a superior ability to distinguish between patients with and without heart disease, effectively making it particularly valuable for clinical applications where early detection can save lives. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework adopted to investigate the relative importance of the features in predicting heart disease revealed the most influential predictors (ST slope, chest pain type, old peak, and cholesterol), further aiding the understanding of heart disease mechanisms. Future work should explore the integration of ensemble learning algorithms with real-time patient monitoring systems. This integration could allow for continuous health status updates, equipping predictive models with the information necessary to facilitate dynamic, real-time interventions that are more closely aligned with patient needs.},

  abstract     = {Collaborative filtering (CF)-based personalized recommendation systems are among the most widely adopted strategies for addressing information overload in modern markets. However, a significant challenge that hinders the effectiveness of these systems is data sparsity. To address this limitation, advanced methodologies such as matrix factorization and deep learning models have been developed to improve CF system performance in sparse data scenarios. Despite their advancements, most existing models rely solely on either implicit or explicit user–item interactions to generate recommendations. Traditional CF approaches often struggle with sparsity, necessitating the development of hybrid methods that integrate both explicit and implicit feedback to enhance performance. To address this gap, this study introduces DeepBlendRec, an innovative deep learning-based framework that leverages both explicit user ratings and implicit user behaviour. By utilizing this dual-input methodology, the model captures richer information regarding user–item interactions, thereby significantly improving recommendation accuracy. DeepBlendRec employs an enhanced autoencoder with a constrained decoder to process implicit ratings, thereby improving reconstruction quality and facilitating the creation of robust latent space representations. Simultaneously, explicit ratings are processed through a multilayer perceptron. The reconstructed outputs are then fused to generate a Top-N recommendation list. Experimental evaluations conducted on the MovieLens datasets demonstrate that DeepBlendRec consistently outperforms existing models across several key performance metrics, including mean-squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), precision, recall, and F1-score. These results highlight the potential of DeepBlendRec to advance the capabilities of recommendation systems in handling data sparsity and improving predictive accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This study introduces a novel approach to engineering design optimization through the development of an improved mountain gazelle optimizer (iMGO) that incorporates variable neighborhood search (VNS) techniques. The enhanced algorithm effectively addresses engineering optimization challenges by identifying optimal design solutions within specified constraints. In particular, iMGO significantly improves solution diversity and mitigates the risk of premature convergence to local optima, thereby overcoming the limitations of the original MGO. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using 12 functions from the CEC 2022 benchmark suite, and the algorithm was applied to five engineering problems, including the design of an I-beam, pressure vessel, three-bar truss, cantilever beam, and tension spring. Comparative results indicate that iMGO outperforms established metaheuristic techniques, such as MFO, WOA, GOA, MPA, TSO, and SCSO, as well as the original MGO. The results validate iMGO’s effectiveness in navigating the complexities of constrained engineering optimization. For instance, in practical applications, the manufacturing cost of the pressure vessel design was reduced from 6014.4537 to 5915.3358, and the weight of the tension spring was decreased from 0.0149154 to 0.0130101 relative to the original MGO. These enhancements underscore the significant potential of iMGO in real-world applications across aerospace engineering, structural design optimization, energy system planning, and other fields, thereby contributing to more efficient and sustainable engineering solutions.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning–based segmentation models have gained significant focus in various computer vision applications, including remote sensing and medical imaging. There exist deep learning architectures for semantic and instance segmentation separately, with limitations prevailing such as imprecise boundary delineation, poor spatial consistency, improper fine-grained object separation, and inaccurate instance segmentation, particularly while handling intricate object structures in remote sensing images (RSI). To mitigate the aforementioned issues, in the present work, we propose a unified deep framework that integrates both semantic and instance segmentation within a single architecture tailored for high-resolution RSI. Our framework combines an improved attention residual U-Net (IARU-Net) for pixel-level semantic segmentation and a dynamic Mask R-CNN for instance-level segmentation. To further refine spatial coherence and boundary delineation, we incorporate the postprocessing technique such as conditional random fields (CRFs) on the output segmentation map of the enhanced U-Net to improve spatial consistency and edge sharpness. This refined semantic mask serves as input to the dynamic Mask R-CNN model for instance segmentation, where the graph-based refinement module (GRM) is employed to improve boundary accuracy by leveraging graph-based smoothing techniques. Our approach ensures improved object delineation, increases the segmentation accuracy, and decreases false positives compared to conventional deep learning architectures. Evaluation outcomes on standard datasets illustrate that the proposed approach attains superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in both semantic and instance segmentation tasks. The results validate the effectiveness of jointly modeling semantic and instance-level information, providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex remote sensing scenes.},

First, in order to enhance the efficiency of cooperative hunting, a novel task allocation method is proposed based on a leader–follower structure, where follower and leader MSVs perform the target encircling task and the target tracking task, respectively. Second, on the basis of task allocation, adaptive control design is employed for the follower MSVs to enhance the control performance of target encircling; optimal feedback control design combined with adaptive feedforward control design is considered using the RL algorithm for the leader MSVs to ensure the optimality of target tracking. Finally, the stability of the multi-MSV hunting control system is guaranteed and all signals are uniformly ultimately bounded based on the Lyapunov theory in the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through simulation results.},

  abstract     = {While analyzing health data is important for improving health outcomes, class imbalance in datasets poses major challenges to machine learning classification models. This work, therefore, considers the class imbalance problem in stroke prediction using models such as K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, and decision tree. This work balances the stroke dataset, thereby enhancing model performance, through various oversampling strategies: random oversampling (RO), ADASYN, SMOTE, and SMOTE–Tomek. Compared to the results of the imbalanced dataset, all applied oversampling techniques enhanced the correct classification of stroke events by the ML model. Among these, RO–SVM with RBF kernel was the best in terms of sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, F1-score, and accuracy values, offering the highest results with respective values of 89.87%, 94.91%, 92.36%, 89.64%, and 89.87%. After applying oversampling techniques, all the machine learning classifications were good enough to classify stroke status, especially for the minority class. This study has highlighted the importance of class imbalance issues in health datasets. Precise detection of instances of minority classes can be enhanced considerably by employing classification models with the implementation of hybrid strategies to effectively solve class imbalance issues, which, in turn, will help improve healthcare outcomes. Further research in integrating more advanced deep learning techniques into other health datasets with imbalances is encouraged to further validate or refine class imbalance approaches, as effective handling of imbalanced classes can substantially promote predictive model performance in the analysis of healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Behçet's uveitis (BU), characterized by recurrent bilateral panuveitis, is a severe manifestation of Behcet's disease (BD). However, disease-specific metabolic alterations in BU remain largely unknown. Here, untargeted metabolomics and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are performed in patients with BU and healthy controls (HC). scRNA-seq data of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice are also incorporated. The data showed an altered metabolic profile, characterized by upregulated glycolysis in BU. MYC is predicted to be a hub molecule regulating glycolysis and T cell response. Notably, it is discovered that the expression level of MYC is higher in BU compare to HC and may reflect the treatment response of BU disease. Correspondingly, the scRNA-seq data of EAU mice also reveal higher glycolysis levels and MYC expression. Further studies reveal that inhibition of MYC repressed glycolysis and exerted therapeutic effects similar to those of glycolysis inhibitors, including amelioration of EAU and repression of the abnormal response of effector T cells (T helper [Th]-1 and Th17 cells). Mechanically, inhibiting MYC disrupts the glycolysis-PI3K signaling circuit to curb the effector T cell response in uveitis. Collectively, the study indicated that MYC promoted glycolysis to fuel abnormal T-cell responses, thus therapeutically targeting MYC would provide an attractive approach for treating BU.},

Sheep are not only one of the most important livestock species in agriculture but also serve as an ideal preclinical model for studying human disease. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of sheep preimplantation embryos from embryonic day (E) 1 to E14 is performed to investigate the pluripotency changes of epiblast and elucidate the pluripotent regulation signaling. By combination of growth factors or inhibitors of JAK/STAT3, FGF, WNT, and TGF-β pathways in the culture medium, sheep formative and primed pluripotent stem cells (sfPSCs and spPSCs) are established respectively. The newly derived PSCs could maintain over 100 passages and differentiate into three germ layers. In addition, sfPSCs and spPSCs exhibit different molecular features, and sfPSCs have the ability of contribution to ICM and can be used as donor cells for producing cloned embryos efficiently. A cross-species comparison of early embryo development in mouse, pig and sheep illustrates the conservation of the epiblast naïve to primed state transition process and the divergence of the developmental events time points, the specific gene expression patterns and pluripotent regulation signaling. These studies are expected to improve our understanding of mammal early embryo development and present a reference for defining pluripotency.},

However, simultaneous delivery of copper and iron ions and the role of mitochondria-targeted copper in inducing cuproptosis remain underexplored. Here, a dual-functional nano-heterojunction platform, MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA, is reproted, integrating iron- and copper-based components for synergistic ferroptosis and cuproptosis induction. Mitochondria-targeted Cu 1.8 S nanodots demonstrated high biocompatibility and efficiently induced cuproptosis by disrupting mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins. Combined with MIL-88B, the iron-based metal-organic framework, the MIL-Cu 1.8 S heterojunction exhibited enhanced ROS catalytic activity, confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) analysis, with improved H 2 O 2 adsorption and lower energy barriers for peroxidase (POD)-like reactions. The dual-targeting MIL-Cu 1.8 S-TPP/FA nanoplatform effectively delivered copper ions to mitochondria and iron ions to tumor cells, modulating key ferroptosis- and cuproptosis-related markers, such as GPX4, GSH, FDX-1, and HSP70.

Herein, it is successfully synthesized a series of versatile transparent films (PUMW) that combine photothermal self-healing function and mechanical strength through integrating polyurethane (PU) self-healing polymers with plasmonic enhanced MXene and W 18 O 49 hybrids (MXene@W 18 O 49 ). The resulting comprehensive film (PUMW4) maintained a visible-light transmittance of over 79% in 0.2 mm thickness, and could rapidly reach 102 °C within 5 min under light irradiation of 0.45 W cm −2 . Furthermore, it demonstrated a favorable ability for photothermal self-healing, with surface scratches disappearing in 2 min. Besides, the tensile strength of PUMW4 significantly increased from 22.7 to 30.7 MPa, in comparison with PUMW0 (pure PU). The proof of concept for an indoor thermal insulation test demonstrates that the organic glass house model covered with the film exhibited a temperature reduction of 10 °C compared to the naked model, highlighting the potential of as-prepared PUMW films in energy-saving applications for large-scale out-door buildings.},

In this study, administration of ginseng neutral polysaccharide (GPN) is found to alleviate gut leak and low-grade inflammation, concomitantly with improving the physiological function aged mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation and fecal conditioned medium are used to assess the specific involvement of gut bacterial metabolites in the effects of GPNs. Comprehensive multi-omics analyses showed that GPN significantly enriched the abundance of Alistipes senegalensis , an indole-producing commensal bacterium. Increased expression of tight junction-associated proteins, as well as activation of gut stem cells, are found to be mediated by the AhR pathway, indicating the causal mechanism by which GPN reduced increases in gut permeability. The results are verified in Caco-2/THP-1 cells, Caenorhabditis elegans , and enteroids.

  abstract     = {Impairment of neuronal plasticity is involved in a spectrum of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, yet its regulatory mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, it is reported that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor DEC2 serves as a pivotal regulator of both neuronal plasticity and epileptogenesis through its repression of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 2 (SCN2A). Knockdown of DEC2 in hippocampal neurons elevates intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, exacerbating seizure susceptibility and severity. Conversely, overexpression of DEC2 in hippocampus reduces intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, ultimately decreasing seizure susceptibility. Mechanistically, DEC2 functions as a transcriptional repressor of Scn2a by directly binding class B E-boxes (CACGTG) in its promoter. Additionally, DEC2 forms complexes with myoblast determination protein 1 (MYOD1) and occupies the CAGCTG E-boxes within the Scn2a promoter; however, this interaction does not affect Scn2a transcription in vivo. These findings also reveal that cannabidiol (CBD) can modulate the DEC2-SCN2A axis. Notably, CBD predominantly enhances DEC2's direct transcriptional repression of SCN2A. In summary, this study identifies DEC2 as a critical regulator of neuronal plasticity in epilepsy progression, suggesting a novel therapeutic pathway for epilepsy treatment.},

  abstract     = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) share similar cellular features and various antigens profiles with cancer cells. Leveraging these characteristics, iPSCs hold great promise for developing wide-spectrum vaccines against cancers. In practice, iPSCs are typically combined with immune adjuvants to enhance antitumor immune responses; however, traditional adjuvants lack controllability and can induce systemic toxicity, which has limited their broad application. Here, a r ed/far-red light-controlled i PSC-based va ccine (RIVA) based on the chimeric photosensory protein FnBphP and its interaction partner LDB3 is developed; RIVA preserves the intrinsic tumor antigens of iPSCs and enables optogenetic control of an immune adjuvant's (IFN-β) expression under red light illumination. Experiments in multiple mouse tumor models demonstrate that RIVA inhibits tumor growth and improves animal survival in prophylactic and therapeutic settings, including against pulmonary metastatic 4T1 breast cancer. RIVA efficiently stimulates dendritic cell maturation, eliciting innate immune activation effects through NK cells and elicit adaptive immune anti-tumor responses through CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Moreover, RIVA protects animals against tumor re-challenge by inducing strong immunological memory, with minimal systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates RIVA as an effective optogenetic approach for developing safe multi-antigen vaccines for the prevention and treatment of cancer.},

Whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing identify DEE-induced mutational signatures (DBS3, ID1/ID2), associated with polymerase epsilon (POLE) exonuclease domain mutations and mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Besides, 52 exonic mutations, 734 copy number variations (CNVs), and 2519 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are discovered which are enriched in the suppressed DNA damage repair pathways and the activated lung cancer related signaling pathways including JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt, MAPK in the DEE-induced malignant transformed cells. Further assays confirm DEE-induced malignant transformed cells harbor both POLE and MMR defects, leading to high mutation burden and genomic instability. Additionally, POLE deficiency exacerbates DEE-induced DNA damage and genomic instability, promoting the cell malignant transformation.

Emphasis is placed on their role in regulating mitophagy and mitochondrial homeostasis via the Notch signaling pathway. The physicochemical properties of WSGC@FA@PEG/PEI-SPIONs are thoroughly characterized, demonstrating favorable biocompatibility, stable size distribution, and efficient peptide loading. In vitro experiments show that these nanoparticles significantly inhibit GA cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating mitophagy-associated proteins (LC3, PINK1, and Parkin), primarily through modulation of the Notch pathway. In vivo studies, using a GA nude mouse model, confirm the therapeutic potential of WSGC@FA@PEG/PEI-SPIONs, revealing marked tumor growth inhibition and increased apoptotic activity.

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive subtype, currently lacks potent targeted therapies. ARID1B, a key SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex subunit, is linked to high-grade malignancies and poor prognosis, making it a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. However, its function and regulation remain unclear. Here, it is found that uncontrolled accumulation of ARID1B and its dysregulated nuclear import promoted oncogenesis and drug resistance. ARID1B negatively regulates ARID1A, impairing SWI/SNF-mediated tumor suppression and enhancing tumor survival. Using protein complex purification and mass spectrometry, the KPNA2–KPNB1–RANBP2 protein cascade is identified as critical for facilitating ARID1B nuclear import. Replacing R1518, H1519, and D1522 residues on ARID1B with T1518, G1519, and G1522 attenuates the ARID1B–KPNA2/KPNB1 interaction, preventing recruitment of ARID1B to the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Pharmacologically inhibiting KPNB1 suppressed ARID1B translocation, limiting its nuclear levels. In TNBC mouse models, ARID1B knockout (KO) significantly reduces tumor growth and enhances PARP inhibitor efficacy. Collectively, these findings uncover an undocumented mechanism for ARID1B nuclear translocation and reveal that blockade of ARID1B nuclear translocation can be a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC.},

Furthermore, it is discovered that corticosterone and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) play an important role in mediating this phenomenon. Additionally, a new direct target gene of GR, Lama5 , is identified and confirmed in vivo and in vitro that the corticosterone-GR-LAMA5 axis is a significant pathway mediating chronic psychological stress-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.

Using high-throughput screening, the approved all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is identified that exhibit high selectivity in killing HMA-resistant AML cells compared to parental cells. Mechanistically, HMA-resistant cells are overloaded with DNA hypomethylation-associated endogenous viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) which, however, fails to trigger an anticancer interferon (IFN) immune response due to downregulation of dsRNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). ATRA compensates for RIG-I expression, thereby re-triggering IFN response and potently inhibiting HMA-resistant AML cell lines, xenograft mice, and patient-derived primary cells. A library of potential RIG-I-inducing compounds is rationally constructed and screened, in which the approved M3 AML treatment drug tamibarotene (TAM) exhibits strikingly 28036-fold selectivity and 779 p m IC 50 in killing HMA-resistant AML cells. ATRA and TAM do not selectively inhibit p53-mutant cancer cells. Together, this study uncovers a common resistance mechanism in HMA-treated AML patients and, in addition, provides highly potent and selective agents that can overcome resistance through re-triggering IFN anticancer immune response.},

Functionally, USP10 inhibits ferroptosis via transcriptionally upregulating the expression of SLC7A11 in HNSCC. Targeting USP10 via gene depletion and antagonist sensitizes HNSCC cells to ferroptosis inducers both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, USP10 directly interacts with the largest RNA Polymerase II Subunit A (POLR2A), removes the K48- and K63-linked ubiquitin chains of POLR2A through its deubiquitinase activity and prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Then, POLR2A transcriptionally activates SLC7A11 , eventually leading to the suppression of ferroptosis. Overall, the study indicates that a novel USP10-POLR2A-SLC7A11 axis regulates ferroptosis, positioning USP10 as a potential therapeutic target in patients with HNSCC.},

TDP-43 regulates RNA processing, including cryptic exon splicing. Here, we demonstrate that TDP-43 directly controls growth-associated protein (GAP43) expression by binding to its pre-mRNA. Loss or hyperphosphorylation of TDP-43 disrupts this binding, leading to the inclusion of cryptic exon 4a1 , which introduces premature stop codons and reduces GAP43 protein levels. RNA sequencing analysis of ALS and AD brains revealed GAP43 downregulation, while 4a1 is upregulated in AD cases with phosphorylated TDP-43. TDP-43 knockdown impaired axonal regeneration in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, whereas GAP43 restoration rescued this defect. These findings suggest that the loss of GAP43 contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS and AD.

Acod1 knockout led to a further increase in NETs levels in CLP mice, aggravated the inflammatory response, worsened organ damage, and reduced the survival rate. Further studies indicate that E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 interacts with PAD4 (one of the core proteins for NETs generation). Acod1/itaconate (ITA) enhanced the enzymatic activity of UBR5 through alkylation modification, promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PAD4, thereby inhibiting NETosis. In conclusion, this study combines transcriptomics, metabolomics, genetic engineering, and co-immunoprecipitation techniques to reveal the molecular mechanism of Acod1/ITA in regulating NETs, providing new potential targets and theoretical basis for the treatment of sepsis.},

High-performance Sb 2 Se 3 solar cell is closely tied to the quality of Sb 2 Se 3 active layer, which requires careful design of the interfacial and bulk defects, as well as crystallinity of the thin films. Postprocessing procedures show great potential to address defect issues and improve the conductivity of solar cells. Therefore, developing efficient and reliable post-treatment techniques is crucial for advancing Sb 2 Se 3 solar cell technology. In this review, recent post-treatment methodologies are summarized toward high-quality Sb 2 Se 3 thin films, categorizing the strategies into two main types: thermal annealing (TA)-related techniques and TA-free techniques. Furthermore, the effects of these strategies are discussed on Sb 2 Se 3 crystal characteristics, including defects, optoelectronic properties, and film morphology, all of which are closely related to device performance. Finally, the critical challenges and perspectives are proposed regarding this new solar cell materials, practical guidelines are also provided for fabricating high-quality Sb 2 Se 3 layers for highly efficient Sb 2 Se 3 solar cells.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies due to their exceptionally high theoretical energy density, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, their practical deployment is significantly constrained by several challenges, including the intrinsic low conductivity of sulfur, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), sluggish redox kinetics, and instability of the Li anode. To overcome these limitations, the integration of catalytic materials has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate sulfur redox reactions, promote LiPS conversion, and enhance cycling stability. Recently, high-entropy catalysts (HEC), comprising five or more metallic elements in near-equimolar ratios, have garnered increasing attention owing to their entropy-stabilized structures, abundant active sites, and tunable electronic properties. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the design principles, synthesis methods, and electrochemical applications of various HEC families, including high-entropy alloys, oxides, sulfides, nitrides, phosphides, MXenes, and Prussian blue analogues, in Li–S battery systems. The synergistic effects arising from multicomponent interactions, structural advantages, and underlying catalytic mechanisms are systematically discussed. Finally, key challenges such as scalable synthesis, in-depth mechanistic elucidation, and rational compositional design are addressed, along with future directions aimed at advancing high-performance HEC-based Li–S battery systems.},

In contrast, the ordered structure design in MEA provides well-defined arrangements of pores, channels, or pathways within catalysts, catalyst layers, porous transport layers, and ion exchange membranes (IEMs). These ordered configurations facilitate efficient pathways for charge and mass transport. Particularly, in comparison with first-order structure, hierarchical structure designs exhibit more obvious advantages in reaction interface, charge, and mass transport. Recently, the diverse hierarchical structure in the MEA designs has demonstrated significant improvements in overall electrolysis efficiency in both proton exchange membrane (PEM) and anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers. This review will examine recent advancements in hierarchical structure designs in the MEAs for water electrolyzers, focusing on innovations in fabrication methods and enhancement mechanisms, as well as their electrolysis performance.

Their intrinsic advantages—such as superior interfacial contact with electrodes, tunable ionic conductivity, and compatibility with scalable manufacturing methods—as well as the key technical challenges they face, including limited thermal stability, narrow electrochemical windows, and interfacial degradation, are examined. This study highlights emerging solutions from recent research, including polymer molecular design, polymer–ceramic composites, and in situ polymerization strategies. In contrast to oxide and sulfide systems, which face significant barriers in cost, manufacturability, and integration, polymer-based electrolytes offer a realistic and economically viable path to large-scale deployment.

  abstract     = {Redox, a native modality in biology involving the flow of electrons, energy, and information, is used for energy-harvesting, biosynthesis, immune-defense, and signaling. Because electrons (in contrast to protons) are not soluble in the medium, electron-flow through the redox modality occurs through redox reactions that are sometimes organized into pathways and networks (e.g., redox interactomes). Redox is also accessible to electrochemistry, which enables electrodes to receive and transmit electrons to exchange energy and information with biology. In this Perspective, efforts to develop electrochemistry as a tool for redox-based bio-information processing: to interconvert redox-based molecular attributes into interpretable electronic signals, are described. Using a series of Case Studies, how the information-content of the measurements can be enriched using: diffusible mediators; tuned electrical input sequences; and cross-modal measurements (e.g., electrical plus spectral), is shown. Also, theory-guided feature engineering approaches to compress the information in the electronic signals into quantitative metrics (i.e., features) that can serve as correlating variables for pattern recognition by data-driven analysis are described. Finally, how redox provides a modality for electrogenetic actuation is illustrated. It is suggested that electrochemistry's capabilities to provide real-time, low-cost, and high-content data in an electronic format allow the feedback-control needed for autonomous learning and deployable sensing/actuation.},

  abstract     = {Organophosphinic acids, R 2 P(O)(OH), and their derivatives are versatile compounds with applications in catalysis, material chemistry, biomolecular bridging, metal extraction, and flame retardancy. Current synthetic methods primarily rely on white phosphorus (P 4 ) as a precursor, which is converted into nucleophilic or electrophilic P-synthons through acid-/base-induced disproportionation (e.g., PH 3 , [H 2 PO 2 ] – ) or chlorination (PCl 3 ). However, P 4 poses significant drawbacks due to its highly pyrophoric nature, environmental hazards, and the energy-intensive production process from phosphate ores. Previously, we introduced a method to bypass P 4 in the synthesis of P V compounds through the redox-neutral activation of phosphates using trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (Tf 2 O) and pyridine, yielding the electrophilic PO 2 + phosphorylation reagent [(pyridine) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1a [OTf]). While this reagent exhibits high selectivity for alcohols, amides, and (pseudo)halides, it failed to react efficiently with organometallic compounds to form organophosphinates. Here, we present mechanistic studies that rationalize this limitation and report an optimized strategy, which successfully facilitates reactions with Grignard reagents. By replacing the pyridine leaving group in 1a [OTf] with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), the reagent [(DMAP) 2 PO 2 ][OTf] ( 1b [OTf]) is obtained, which enables the selective synthesis of a broad range of diaryl- and dialkynylphosphinates, thereby expanding the scope of redox-neutral phosphate activation.},

In this study, a range of Trp metabolites are evaluated for their potential to modulate tumor immunogenicity using a co-culture assay with tumor cells and T cells. Indole-3-aldehyde (I3A) is identified as an indole derivative that significantly enhances tumor immunogenicity both in vitro and in vivo. This enhancement is attributed to the upregulation of antigen presentation and immunogenic molecules on tumor cells by I3A, thereby promoting their immunogenicity. Mechanistically, I3A induces the activation and degradation of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to increased expression of MHC-I molecules on tumor cell surfaces. Meantime, I3A induces rapid degradation of c-MYC in tumor cells and further enhances T cell activation. In mouse melanoma and lymphoma models, I3A demonstrates immune-dependent antitumor effects and enhances the efficacy of adoptive OT-I T cell therapy. Moreover, overexpression of the Trp metabolic enzyme interleukin-4-induced gene-1 (IL4I1) in tumor cells increases the intracellular level of I3A and enhances tumor immunogenicity. In summary, I3A is identified as a tumor immunogenicity inducer, which holds the potential to enhance antitumor immunotherapy efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The confinement of breast cancer cells at the interface of the mammary gland lumen and its surrounding extracellular matrix is thought to be a key physical driver of cellular plasticity. The relationship between confinement-induced solid stress and drug resistance is not well understood due to a scarcity of models that faithfully isolate the contribution of confinement on cancer cell behavior. Herein, drop-on-demand printing is used to uniquely replicate the spatial compartmentalization of the native cancer-host interface: MCF-7 breast cancer cells are dispensed within bioinert cup-shaped alginate-based hydrogels in high-throughput to yield “confined” spheroids. Hydrogel confinement affects the emergence of CD44+-CD133+ cells at the spheroid interface that drives a two-fold increase in doxorubicin/tamoxifen resistance compared to control “unconfined” spheroids. Whilst the peripheral drug-resistant phenotype is observed clinically, the model is unique in facilitating the emergence of this population in an in vitro setting. Pharmacological modulation of mechanotransduction proteins (YAP, myosin), abrogated the emergence of this peripheral phenotype, implicating mechanotransduction pathways as an effective way to target solid stress-induced drug resistance. Together, this supports an “interfacial stress—stemness—drug resistance” relationship that sheds new light on the existing paradigm of spatial emergence of drug resistance in breast cancer.},

In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing TME features associated with ICI responsiveness, highlighting key immune cell subsets involved in ICI therapy and emphasizing their phenotypic plasticity and functional adaptability following ICIs. Additionally, we outline the spatial architecture of the TME in terms of its effects on immune cell behavior and interactions, and discuss the critical role of stromal components and the microbiota in modulating the immune landscape and influencing ICI responsiveness.

  abstract     = {Observing the surface structure and charge dynamics of catalysts during catalytic reactions is crucial for elucidating reaction mechanisms. However, nanoscale characterization of the catalyst structure and charge states in the presence of reactive gases presents experimental challenges. Here, the structures and charge states of a gold nanoparticle (NP) are directly visualized on ceria during redox cycles using electron holography, a method related to transmission electron microscopy. The introduction of oxidizing O 2 gas to the microscope led to structural changes on the NP surface and decrease the intrinsic negative charge of the NP. Conversely, under reducing H 2 gas, the surface structure and charge state of the NP remained almost unchanged compared to those in vacuum. Systematic analysis revealed that the injection and removal of O 2 gas caused reversible changes in the charge state of the NP within the range of a few electrons. The effect of O 2 gas on charging of the NP is confirmed by first-principles calculations. These findings demonstrate the potential of electron holography in gas environments for advancing the understanding the reaction mechanisms on heterogeneous catalysts.},

However, a significant challenge in this field lies in the development of highly efficient photocatalysts capable of achieving high-concentration H 2 O 2 production. Here the rational design of two O 2 reduction cores into one polymer framework is showcased for synergistically facilitating H 2 O 2 production via the “self-marketing & cooperation” strategy. Photoactive units of pyrrolo[3,2- b ] pyrrole and porphyrin are successfully settled in covalent organic polymers (COPs) through polycyclizations of the relevant aldehydes, anilines, and butane-2,3-dione. Two orderly separated active sites not only involve each of them in the oxygen reduction reaction but also mutually promote the production of H 2 O 2 , which is demonstrated by electron spin resonance experiments, in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and a series of control experiments. Remarkably, PP-COP- 4 delivers an outstanding H 2 O 2 concentration of 16.2 m M in a continuous-flow system, demonstrating its strong potential for scalable, solar-driven production of commercial-grade H 2 O 2 .},

  abstract     = {Hormonal mechanisms of fatty liver formation require in-depth exploration, and corresponding therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Here, through serological testing of mice with fatty liver, it is found that the rhythms of prolactin secretion are disturbed and that the circulating prolactin level is reduced. Based on these findings, prolactin's biological effects on fatty liver are investigated, and biomimetic photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with periodically prolactin releasing are proposed to inhibit lipid accumulation in liver. The microneedles are comprised of poly(lactic- co -glycolic acid) shells and prolactin-loaded cores of photothermal black phosphorus, phase-change gelatin, and carrageenan. Under periodically stimulation of near infrared (NIR), the prolactin in the microneedles can be released in a rhythmic manner for inhibiting the lipid accumulation in liver cells. Based on these features, it is demonstrated in mice with fatty liver that the bioinspired-responsive microneedles can facilitate prolactin mitigating hepatic steatosis through its interaction with the hepatic prolactin receptor (PRLR) and by modulating the expression of fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36). Thus, these photothermal-responsive core–shell microneedles with prolactin pulse release hold significant promise for the treatment of fatty liver disease.},

Ultragentle, high-contrast switching of interfacial adhesion is the key to reliable small-scale object manipulation. Here, a novel approach is presented for surface adhesion control utilizing a liquid-permeable nanoporous surface, which can switch from off-state adhesion (< 0.002 kPa) to on-state attraction (0.8 kPa) without preload. The surface of the gripper is composed of vertically aligned composite nanowires with an average diameter of 79 nm. When a liquid is injected into the nanoporous membrane, capillary adhesion occurs, allowing the object to be picked up. As the liquid evaporates, the object can be released by extremely sparse contact. The off-state adhesion of a millimeter-scale gripper is even lower than the gravitational force of thin polymer films (0.18 mN cm −2 ), enabling the solid-contactless release of lightweight materials. We characterize and model the mechanism across length scales and provide pick-and-place demonstrations including LED chips, micro-architected materials, and thin-film electronics.},

This study pioneers a novel approach to fabricating Mg-Ta incompatible LMCs via crystal orientation regulation, achieving in situ formed serrated mechanically interlocked interfaces with exceptional bonding strength (80.5 MPa) through hot-rolling. It also exhibits exceptional tensile properties with an ultimate tensile strength of 340–395 MPa, a yield strength of 301–363 MPa, and an elongation of 5–10.2%. Systematic multiscale investigations combining molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a hierarchical interfacial architecture comprising dual heterointerfaces zone (hexagonal close-packed /face center cubic Mg/Cu and face centered cubic /body-centered cubic Cu/Ta), with strain-modulated micro-serrations (width: 1.6–5.5 µm; depth: 6–15 µm) morphology, along with atomic interdiffusion zones (1.1–3.1 µm). A quantifiable inverse correlation is identified between serration dimensions and interfacial strength, with reduced width and depth directly enhancing bond integrity. Furthermore, the heterointerface evolution mechanism is decoupled into three thermomechanical stages: 1) crystallographic orientation optimization via dissimilar atomic contact, 2) strain-driven micro-sawtooth generation through dislocation slip competition, and 3) geometric interlocking completion via interface self-assembly. This work establishes a universal paradigm for designing multifunctional structural materials through strain-engineered heterointerface manipulation, rather than just applying several specific deformations processes.},

The mechanical property of present RMPEA shows less strain-rate dependence and strong resistance to softening at high temperatures. Under high strain-rate loading, the formation of thin type-I twins is observed, which could lead to an increase in strain-hardening rates. However, this hardening mechanism competes with adiabatic heating effects, resulting in the deterrence of strain-hardening behaviors. In contrast, substantial strain-hardening occurs at cryogenic temperatures due to the formation of twins, which act as stronger barriers to dislocation motion and interact with each other. To further understand the different strain-hardening behaviors, density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict relatively low stacking fault energies and high twinning stress for the NbTaTiV RMPEA.},

Often soluble metal salts are precipitated as metal hydroxides or -carbonates, which subsequently are converted to the corresponding oxide(s) upon thermal treatment. The thermal treatment step is used to induce compositional homogeneity on the atomic level. In order to shed some more light on this effect, detailed analyses of a mixed Li-Ni-Mn-oxide with the target composition LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO), which is a promising cathode material for rechargeable Li-ion batteries are performed. The first synthesis step is the precipitation of a Ni-Mn-carbonate, which is subsequently thermally lithiated and transformed into an oxide. A combination of X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Raman microscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-Ray spectroscopy (EDX) in combination with elemental analysis, as well as electrochemical characterization, revealed that chemical inhomogeneities present already in the precursor particles have a direct influence on the electrochemical performance of the final product. The broader implications of these results in relation to co-precipitation-based syntheses of functional materials are discussed, with special focus on the importance of the particle size distribution of the secondary particles.},

However, the absence of alkali metal cations in the SSE-based CO 2 RR process at the cathode poses a challenge, constraining the performance and stability of CO 2 RR and exacerbating the hydrogen evolution side reaction. Herein, a novel strategy for the tunable production of both electrolyte-free HCOOH and sodium formate (HCOONa) solution through the regulation of anolyte composition in an SSE-based cell is reported. Employing this strategy, the continuous generation of a ≈0.27 m electrolyte-free HCOONa solution and ≈0.22 m electrolyte-free HCOOH solution with extended stabilities of 300 and 200 h, respectively is achieved. More importantly, the introduction of sodium ions resulted in a reduction of cell voltage by ≈1000 mV and further enhances the stability of the cell. In situ infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that GB-Bi requires a lower applied potential for formate production, owing to its stronger binding energy to the key intermediate OCHO* compared to Bi. Finally, a techno-economic analysis indicates that this strategy for HCOONa solution production possesses excellent economic viability.},

One U-finger resonating at 50 Hz serves as energy harvester (EH), while the other resonating at 185 Hz acts as current or magnetic sensor, enabling the resonator to simultaneously and wirelessly capture 50 Hz stray magnetic field ( H AC ,50 Hz ) energy and ground fault message of power lines by injecting an additional non-grid-frequency (185 Hz) current. The EH U-finger generates an output power of 1.53 mW RMS under a weak H AC ,50 Hz of only 0.5 Oe, achieving a normalized power density surpassing current standards. While the sensing U-finger shows a high sensitivity to H AC ,185 Hz with a detectability of 710 pT, even the EH U-finger is operating.

However, the exact photophysical behaviors at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure remain ambiguous, which makes it challenging to form the desired 3D/2D heterostructure. Herein, via combining the state-of-the-art ultrafast spectroscopies of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, transient absorption microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, charge transfer and recombination dynamics are unveiled at 3D/2D perovskite heterostructure, for comparison, where the 2D layers are fabricated through the two distinct approaches of organic ligand surface reaction (2D L ) and 2D crystal seed direct deposition (2D S ), respectively. 3D/2D S heterostructure exhibits superior hole transfer from 3D to 2D S , featuring a large spatial diffusion constant and high charge mobility compared to 3D/2D L , attributed to the higher phase purity and the lower defects in 2D S . Moreover, 3D/2D S heterostructure yields suppressed nonradiative recombination, reduced Langevin recombination, and increased quasi-Fermi level splitting, significantly aiding fast photoinduced charge transfer at such heterostructure. These advantages are further confirmed by a remarkably improved PSC efficiency using 3D/2D S , especially in terms of enhanced open-circuit voltage and diminished energy loss. This work sheds light on the dynamics at 3D/2D heterostructures, providing a promising guideline for designing 3D/2D high-performance PSCs.},

Herein, by incorporating both the µ -oxo bridged Fe III -porphyrins and NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) mimics into an allosteric coordination capsule, the regulation of O 2 activation and the upregulation of intracellular methionine depletion have been achieved, resulting in effective pH-activated tumor immunotherapy. Upon light irradiation, the transition from the tensed bridged Fe III -porphyrins to the relaxed unbridged Fe IV = O/Fe II porphyrin pair induces unique conformational switching. The relaxed state of the capsule facilitates the binding of substrates for the oxygen atom transfer reaction. The in situ formed Fe II -porphyrin pair, following the substrate oxygenation, activates O 2 with the intervention of NADH mimics to restore the tensed state of the capsule, thereby releasing the product for the next cycle. Regulated by the acid/base content in the system, this allostery-triggered metabolic behavior enhances the efficacy of intracellular methionine depletion therapy through the accumulation of local methionine sulfoxide, thereby improving safety. The allosteric switching strategy offers an improved approach for precise tumor treatment via dual light-and-guest stimuli-responsive regulation.},

  abstract     = {Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene have been widely studied for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R), primarily yielding CO. However, achieving selectivity for C1 hydrocarbons remains challenging. Here, 32 Janus DACs (J-M'M) are designed and investigated for CO 2 R using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, identifying 13 capable of producing methanol and methane. Notably, J-FeCo and J-CoNi exhibit favorable limiting potentials (−0.38 and −0.45 V vs. RHE) for CH 3 OH and CH 4 production, respectively, based on constant-potential calculations. Compared to normal DACs (N-M'M), Janus DACs demonstrate enhanced initial CO 2 hydrogenation and stronger CO adsorption. Oxygen coordination in J-FeCo and J-CoNi induces a downshift/upshift of majority-/minority-spin energy levels of d z2 , d yz , and d xz orbitals toward the Fermi level relative to N-FeCo and N-CoNi, strengthening the bonding state and weakening the antibonding state, thereby improving CO adsorption. Furthermore, an effective descriptor based on atomic features is identified to evaluate *CO binding strength. This work highlights the critical role of partial oxygen coordination in DACs for C1 hydrocarbons production and proposes a robust descriptor to guide the design of related catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Hydrazine-assisted hybrid alkaline seawater electrolysis offers a dual-functional platform for environmentally benign remediation of toxic hydrazine and energy-autonomous hydrogen generation. Addressing the critical need for simplified system integration, a single-metal bifunctional catalyst is developed by modulating electronic metal-support interactions (EMSI) to construct semi-crystalline Ru domains with metastable crystalline-amorphous interfaces. The optimized catalyst achieves ultralow overpotentials of 21.5 mV (hydrogen evolution) and 254 mV (hydrazine oxidation) at 10 mA cm⁻ 2 , alongside spontaneous hydrazine decomposition at open-circuit potential. This synergy enables near-zero energy input for electrolysis, evidenced by a steep polarization slope (1.235 A cm⁻ 2 V⁻¹), which surpasses conventional hybrid systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that amorphous Ru sites near the interface induce charge redistribution, which partially optimizes the free energy changes associated with adsorption * H and the dehydrogenation process from * N₂H₄ to * N₂H₃. This is accompanied by a transformation of the rate-determining step into the * N₂H → * N₂ pathway, thereby advancing the kinetics of the bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrazine oxidation reaction (HER/HzOR) reactions. The work redefines catalyst design paradigms by leveraging interfacial metastability, bridging pollutant elimination with high-efficiency hydrogen economies.},

In this study, the model dioecious spinach ( Spinacia oleracea ), a widely cultivated leafy vegetable, is investigated by analyzing spatial transcriptomes of the shoot apices at different developmental stages. The findings elucidate key regulatory pathways underlying both inflorescence development and sex differentiation. Through the characterization of dynamic transcriptional changes across four consecutive developmental phases, distinct cell types within the shoot apex and stage-specific marker genes are identified. Notably, pseudotime trajectory analysis reveals that spinach sex differentiation occurs at the four-leaf stage. Furthermore, the critical involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in this process is demonstrated. By integrating functional genetic validation, the epigenetic regulator MULTICOPY SUPPRESSOR OF IRA 1 (MSI1) together with histone deacetylase HDT2 is discovered to promote female differentiation. Collectively, this work provides comprehensive insights into the regulatory networks controlling inflorescence development and sexual differentiation in spinach and establishes a valuable resource for advancing sex differentiation research in dioecious plants.},

  abstract     = {Zr 2 Fe alloy is a promising candidate as a tritium-getter material for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), but its practical application is hindered by undesirable inverse disproportionation behavior and poor anti-disproportionation properties. In this study, theoretical computational screening is utilized to predict the effects of partially substituting Fe with Co, Cu, and Ni on regulating the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x (M = Co, Cu, Ni; x = 0.1–0.5) hydrogen storage systems. Experimentally, these modifications successfully correct the distorted inverse disproportionation reaction and achieve full reversibility in the Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems. Notably, Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 and Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 alloys retain excellent hydrogen storage properties, while their kinetic energy barriers of hydriding disproportionation reaction increase significantly from 87.88 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe) to 184.35 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.8 Cu 0.2 ) and 192.32 kJ mol −1 (Zr 2 Fe 0.7 Ni 0.3 ), respectively. The corresponding deceleration of hydriding disproportionation kinetics behaviors is clearly visualized by TEM observations. Combined density functional theory analyses reveal that the mechanism underlying enhanced anti-disproportionation properties in the optimized Zr 2 Fe 1-x M x- H systems involves the homogenization and stabilization of Zr─H bonds within the hydrogen storage interstices, along with the effective suppression of disproportionation-favorable chemical environments.},

These LNPs exhibit unique advantages of great biocompatibility, biodegradability, extended circulation, and tumor-targeting capabilities, which enable precise drug delivery, controlled release, and circumvention of drug resistance mechanisms.

Particularly, their distinctive structural characteristics offer promising prospects for suppressing ion migration, which is highly advantageous for X-ray detection. Herein, by gradually modifying the cyclohexylmethylamine cation into the 4-aminomethyltetrahydropyran cation, a layered heterostructure single crystal (PbCl 2 ) 2 (4-Aminomethyltetrahydropyran) 2 PbCl 4 is successfully obtained. It comprises two distinct inorganic frameworks, namely a perovskite layer built from PbCl₆ octahedra and an intergrowth layer consisting of PbCl₂ units, wherein the organic components are firmly anchored to the intergrowth layer via Pb─O bonds, thereby enhancing the crystal stability and effectively suppressing ion migration, as evidenced by high ion migration activation energy (1.64 eV) and extremely low dark current drift (2.86 × 10 −18 A cm −1 V −1 s −1 ). X-ray devices based on the ultra-stable heterostructure single crystal demonstrate an extraordinary sensitivity of 8453.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 (at 40 V), ultra-low detection limit of 5.2 nGy s −1 and superior air stability (≈1 year).

However, their stability in aqueous environments remains a challenge. This study investigates the stability and degradation mechanisms of the 2D Ruddlesden-Popper phase phenylethyl ammonium lead iodide (PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 ) thin films in aqueous electrolytes under dark and illuminated conditions. While PEA (+) 2 PbI 4 thin films appear to be thermodynamically stable in an aqueous electrolyte with phenylethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI), illumination causes significant photodegradation generating a deprotonated and dehalogenated 2D intercalation product: phenylethylamine-lead iodide, 2PEA (0) -PbI 2 . The degradation of the 2D semiconductor leads to substantial reduction in the photovoltage, adversely impacting the material performance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices. To intercept photo-excited charge carriers in the 2D semiconductor, the I 3 − /I − redox is added, which reduced photodegradation. The findings underscore that while catalytic reactions at halide perovskite electrodes in aqueous electrolytes are feasible, reversible and irreversible photodegradation remains a critical limitation that must be addressed in the design of PEC devices employing metal halide semiconductor layers for direct electrochemical energy conversion.},

In this work, the first experimental demonstration of topological QI-like effect is reported in a 1D on-chip system, where two different topological mechanisms are induced to provide robustness for slow light. Topological charges rooted in the parameter space can offer immunity to parameter deviations, such as coupling strengths, and topological edge states rooted in the momentum space can manifest robustness against structural disturbances, like width disorders and bending deformations. By incorporating bright and dark edge states into a composite waveguide, the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window is observed and switching between slow light and fast light is demonstrated by measuring the transmission and group delays.

Herein, by analyzing the bioengineered trachea, it is found that multiple tissue senescences occur, and poor endogenous cellular contact and exogenous immune microenvironment dysregulation are identified as two crucial factors during senescence. Therefore, a Hebe engineered trachea (Hebe-ET) with a ring–ring structure and dual anti-senescence designs is proposed for maintaining regenerative homeostasis after transplantation. First, in the cartilage rings, a fiber-film structural scaffold is designed to promote close-packed cellular contact, significantly reducing senescent P21+ chondrocytes. Furthermore, between the cartilage rings are distributed fibrous connective tissue rings, in which the loaded quercetin induces an immune cascade to restrain senescence in multiple cells, including chondrocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts via mitochondrion-targeted oxidative stress scavenging, promoting the development of the full tracheal components in vivo. Based on these designs, 12 weeks after orthotopic transplantation, the Hebe-ET achieves sustainable youth and develops a natural-like structure with mature cartilage phenotype, reconstructed vascular network, and epithelium coverage. The mechanical property exceeds that of the natural trachea, and 87.5% of animals survived. This study first reveals the necessity of anti-senescence design in the fabrication of complex organ substitutes and proposes an effective engineering strategy for segmental trachea reconstruction.},

In this study, a sequential drug delivery system is comprised of chitosan hydrogel (G-CS) loaded with Angiotensin (1-7) and mesoporous silica nanospheres (MSN) coating with α-mangostin to achieve synergistic effects of anti-inflammatory and regulation of metabolic disorders of the ECM in NPCs. The system first explosively releases outer G-CSloaded Angiotensin (1-7) by exploiting the different solubility characteristics of the two drugs, which improves the inflammatory environment by inhibiting the integrated stress response and regulating the macrophage phenotype. During the second stage, the inner layer of the MSN controlled-release loaded α-mangostin to regulate ECM metabolism and synthesis, slowing cell aging and apoptosis. Furthermore, α-mangostin promotes mitophagy in NPCs by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and activating the Pink1/Parkin pathway, promoting the clearance of damaged mitochondria.

  abstract     = {Superlattice structures, created by the periodic arrangement of two or more distinct materials, have attracted significant interest. This paper proposes a strategy for designing superlattice structures in soft materials with improved dielectric and mechanical properties. Two types of acid-functionalized block copolymers and a series of zwitterions with varying cationic and anionic structures are synthesized. When the zwitterion anion possesses a localized charge and the cation exhibits weak interactions with the acid groups in the polymers, the zwitterions preferentially localize at the interfacial layers between the ionic and ionophobic domains. As the zwitterion concentration increases and ion–dipole interactions strengthen within the confined subdomains, the interfacial curvature of the superlattice transitions from lamellae to cylindrical morphology and further evolves to Frank-Kasper phases. Notably, these morphological transitions occur despite the symmetrical volume fractions of the ionic phases. These superlattice structures and Frank-Kasper phases exhibit thermal stability up to 150 °C, a high static dielectric constant of 25, and excellent mechanical properties including a modulus of 360 MPa, hardness of 16 MPa, stiffness of 772 N m −1 , and energy dissipation index of 0.675 at 22 °C, making them highly promising candidates for advanced applications in soft electronics and memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Injectable hydrogels have been developed for transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of hepatic tumor owing to their flexibility in injection and embolization. However, the dual requirement for high mechanical robustness and good injectability poses a fundamental challenge, as improvements in one often compromise the other. Colloidal gels offer tunable mechanical properties and feasible injectability through the bottom-up assembly of building blocks. Here an interfacial reinforcement strategy is developed by enhancing specific surface area and roughness to fabricate nanosheet-mica (NM) magnetic colloidal gels (NMMG). The negatively charged NM, exfoliated from natural ground mica (GM), possessed increased binding sites, while in situ grown Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles enhanced building block roughness, reducing intergranular displacement and thereby maintaining mechanical strength while ensuring injectability. Compared with GM-based magnetic colloidal gels, NMMG can be injected through 2.6 F catheter with ≈20 N force (40% of manual limit), while storage modulus improved from ≈800 to ≈1800 Pa (2.25-fold higher than embolization minimum limit). Transcatheter embolization with NMMG significantly inhibited tumor growth. Furthermore, NMMG-mediated minimally invasive therapies, including TAE combined with magnetothermal therapy, achieved synergistic therapeutic effects in hepatic tumor-bearing rabbits. The rough-interface strengthening strategy facilitates the development of high-performance colloidal gels with mechanical integrity and tailored functions.},

  abstract     = {Topological zeroth-order Landau levels offer a promising avenue for steering acoustic and electromagnetic waves. However, the helical Landau levels in 2D acoustic systems remain an unresolved challenge. Moreover, previous studies on zeroth-order Landau levels have primarily focused on hexagonal lattices, leaving their counterparts in square lattices largely unexplored. In this study, the helical Landau levels rooted in acoustic quantum spin Hall systems are theoretically proposed and experimentally validated. By linearly increasing the local bandgap through the lifting of the double Dirac cone in acoustic crystals with both square and hexagonal lattices—achieved via topology optimization method—a position-dependent effective mass is introduced in the Dirac Hamiltonian, thereby synthesizing in-plane pseudomagnetic fields. This results in the emergence of spin-locked helical Landau levels, which has been experimentally validated. The large-area conveyance of acoustic energy facilitated by these helical Landau levels is demonstrated and the robustness of Landau-level-mediated propagation against defects is confirmed. A new pathway for exploring acoustic helical Landau levels based on spin Hall physics is opened.},

Beating dephasing in these systems by ultrafast energy transfer requires coupling single emitters to a plasmonic nanoresonator with ultrasmall mode volume and optimal spectral overlap. Typically, strong coupling is inferred from normal mode splittings in luminescence spectra, offering rough estimates of coupling strength. However, achieving a full anticrossing and characterizing uncoupled components in advance is challenging. Here, the oxygen-dependent blue-shift of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, recorded at 33 ms time resolution, is leveraged to deterministically tune their transition energy across a scanning plasmonic slit resonator to yield a complete anticrossing, after characterizing both uncoupled states beforehand. The findings provide clear evidence of strong coupling at room temperature, with a Rabi splitting at zero detuning of , consistent with theoretical modeling.

Under mild, energy-efficient conditions (−200 mA), this approach converts cinnamaldehyde to benzaldehyde with complete conversion (100%) and >99% selectivity, outperforming traditional harsh oxidants. Mechanistic analysis reveals that the tailored coordination environment of the catalyst enhances * OOH formation, enabling targeted oxidative activity. The method operates at ambient conditions, eliminates toxic reagents and high energy-consuming process, and aligns with sustainable chemistry principles.

To address this, the phase separation-assisted pre-enrichment (PSAP) technology is presented that exploits differential polymer-polymer partitioning to achieve 47-fold antigen and 44-fold RNA enrichment simultaneously. Through systematic optimization of interfacial chemistry, including pH modulation, polymer hydrophilicity, mass fraction, and molecular weights, the protocol is refined to enable direct integration with commercial diagnostics. PSAP-boosted rapid antigen ests (RATs) detected SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza viruses at tenfold and fivefold lower limits, respectively. In clinical validation, 53 clinical specimens (containing PCR undetectable samples as controls) are analyzed. The PSAP method significantly enhanced detection accuracy for both viral antigens and RNA, particularly improving positivity rates in low viral load specimens (27 < Ct < 31) compared to conventional approaches while maintaining specificity in high-Ct and negative controls. With its universality and tunability, PSAP demonstrates universal applicability across respiratory pathogens and lays the foundation for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics.},

However, reliable biomarkers for precision medicine treatment remain elusive due to cellular heterogeneity. Conventional Models based on bulk RNA sequencing and ex vivo assays often fail to capture the intricate molecular pathways and gene networks that underlie treatment response and resistance. Here, NetAML, a novel network-based precision medicine platform that systematically develops 87 drug sensitivity prediction models for 87 clinical drugs using ex vivo drug responses from 520 AML patients with RNA-Seq is presented. The approach leverages network-based analysis and machine learning to identify biologically interpretable gene signatures that capture the complex molecular interactions driving differential drug responses. Notably, the signature genes derived from the models reveal distinct cellular mechanisms. For instance, the co-expression of C19ORF59 and FLT3 is associated with resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. In summary, NetAML offers a powerful strategy for personalized AML treatment by constructing drug-specific models, identifying clinically actionable biomarkers, and supporting the development of optimized, patient-specific therapeutic regimens.},

In this review, it is aimed to examine the various pathomechanisms identified to date and synthesize them into a unified concept. Particular emphasis is placed on key drivers believed to be critical in the onset and progression of the disease—namely mechanical stress, inflammation, and vascular changes. By exploring molecular signaling pathways and conditions involved in tendinopathy, how these mechanisms interact and reinforce one another is illustrated, forming a complex and dynamic signaling network, referred to as the tendinopathic loop. In the future, this network is expected to become even more intricate with the inclusion of emerging concepts such as intratendinous pressure and the potential influence of metabolic factors.},

This holds in particular for magnesium-ion batteries, where the polymer displays reversible insertion of Mg 2+ ions with high cycling stability.

The morphologies of L-Glu:L-Phe proteinoid microspheres and their interactions with algae are studied using scanning electron microscopy, revealing complex structures with budding forms and traits of self-assembly. Electrical measurements demonstrate that both pure algae and algae-proteinoid mixtures generate spontaneous oscillations with unique amplitude and frequency patterns across different recording channels. The algae-proteinoid mixture exhibits a broad range of oscillatory dynamics with amplitudes varying from 25.49 to 191.42 mV and periods ranging from 251.92 to 5471.01 s. These oscillatory behaviors are utilized to perform Boolean logic operations, through post-processing of biological signals rather than autonomous computing, with pure algae systems showing superior performance for direct gates (AND, OR) while the mixture excels at inverse gates (NAND, NOR). Temperature and pH emerge as critical factors controlling oscillatory dynamics. The findings indicate that algae-proteinoid electrochemical systems represent a step toward biohybrid computing and offer a sustainable and biocompatible alternative for unconventional computing, providing enhanced signal stability, environmental resilience, and more effective information processing compared to traditional electronic systems while acknowledging current limitations in autonomous learning capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), a leading cause of chronic low back pain, arises from nucleus pulposus (NP) cell dysfunction due to oxidative stress-induced mitophagy impairment and ferroptosis, though regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. F-box only protein 2 (FBXO2), a Kruppel-like factor 10 (KLF10)-regulated F-box protein, is downregulated in degenerated human NP tissues and correlates with disease severity. Overexpression of FBXO2 restores extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis by promoting matrix component synthesis and inhibiting catabolic enzymes, while its knockdown exacerbates ECM degradation. Under oxidative stress, FBXO2 activates PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1)/Parkin-dependent mitophagy, restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Proteomics reveals that FBXO2 suppresses ferroptosis by attenuating lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, and iron overload. Mechanistically, FBXO2 binds lipocalin-2 (LCN2) via its FBA domain, promoting K27-linked polyubiquitination to drive proteasomal degradation of this ferroptosis inducer. FBXO2 co-expression reverses LCN2-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ferroptosis markers. In vivo, adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated overexpression of FBXO2 ameliorates IVDD in rats, whereas FBXO2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit exacerbated IVDD. LCN2 silencing in FBXO2-deficient mice partially restores disc integrity and matrix component expression. These findings identify FBXO2 as a dual regulator coordinating mitophagy activation and ferroptosis suppression, offering therapeutic potential for IVDD progression.},

This carbon-enriched catalyst demonstrates exceptional electrochemical behavior when transitioned into a battery context. Without any conductive additives, Fe@C900 delivers a reversible capacity of 380 mAh g⁻¹ with 98% retention over 1000 cycles at 1 C. Under a 5000 G magnetic field, spin alignment within the Fe cores triggers directional lithium-ion migration, enhancing rate performance by 150%. Multimodal characterization reveals accelerated lithium kinetics, stable SEI evolution, and deep lithiation behavior. DFT calculations further confirm strong lithium adsorption (−24.14 eV) and low insertion barriers (−22.85 eV), validating the spin-guided diffusion mechanism. This work introduces a new class of hydrogen-derived ferromagnetic anodes, where the byproduct of a clean hydrogen process is re-engineered into a high-rate, conductor-free lithium storage platform. By coupling hydrogen generation with energy storage through shared material intermediates, this strategy offers a scalable path to carbon-efficient, magnetically enhanced battery systems.},

  abstract     = {CRISPR-Cas is an adaptive immune system that protects prokaryotes from the invasion of foreign genetic elements. The components and immunity mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas have been extensively studied, but the regulation of this system in Staphylococci remains unclear. Here, it is shown that the cell-cell communication, known as quorum sensing (QS), inhibits the expression and activity of the type III-A CRISPR-Cas system in S. aureus . The QS regulator, AgrA, directly binds to the promoters of two transcriptional regulators encoding the genes sarA and arcR to inhibit their expression. However, both SarA and ArcR act as positive regulators that promote the transcription of cas genes by directly binding to a novel promoter P cas . Furthermore, the P cas of 300 bp located in cas1 displays as a critical regulatory node to initiate the transcription of cas10 and csm3 . Our data reveal a new regulatory mechanism for QS-mediated repression of the Type III-A CRISPR-Cas system, which may allow S. aureus to acquire foreign genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance or virulence factors specifically at high cell density.},

Here, structurally constrained cyclic (diacyloxyiodo)arenes are presented as a transformative platform to resolve the reactivity/selectivity-generality paradox, enabling one-pot synthesis of diverse hypervalent iodine(III) reagents. The synthetic utility and sustainability of the in situ controlled-release approach are demonstrated through catalytic reactions, asymmetric variations, and biocompatibility studies, including peptide modifications. Central to this success is the discovery of cyclic (diacyloxyiodo)arenes—a previously unexplored chemical entity.

  abstract     = {Bacterial biohybrid microrobots possess significant potential for targeted cargo delivery and minimally invasive therapy. However, many challenges, such as biocompatibility, stability, and effective cargo loading, remain. Bacterial membrane vesicles, also referred to as minicells, offer a promising alternative for creating sub-micron scale biohybrid swimmers (minicell biohybrids) due to their active metabolism, non-dividing nature, robust structure, and high cargo-carrying capacity. Here, a biohybrid system is reported that utilizes motile minicells, ≈400 nm in diameter, generated by aberrant cell division of engineered Escherichia coli ( E. coli ), for the first time. Achieving over 99% purification from their parental bacterial cells, minicells are functionalized with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to enable external magnetic control. Minicell biohybrids are capable of swimming at an average speed of up to 13.3 µm s −1 and being steered under a uniform magnetic field of 26 mT. Furthermore, they exhibit a significantly high drug loading capacity (2.8 µg mL −1 ) while maintaining their motility and show pH-sensitive release of anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) under acidic conditions. Additionally, drug-loaded minicell biohybrids notably reduce the viability of SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells in vitro. This study introduces minicell biohybrids and establishes their potential as magnetically guided, drug-loaded biohybrid systems for targeted therapies in future medical applications.},

Here, a soft, stretchable, thermally expandable system is introduced for precise, localized, on-demand deactivation or destruction of electronic systems. The incorporation of thermal expansion particles into a polymer matrix produces soft, resilient composites that generate substantial thermo-mechanical forces at a predefined temperature, enabling the direct collapse of electronic devices. Integration with multichannel microfluidics and wireless systems creates a vanishing, self-destructive optoelectronic system and bio-safe drug delivery vehicle for frequency-based selective release, demonstrating the broad potential of this approach in the fields of defense/security and biomedical devices as well as other envisioned areas.},

However, low hysteresis achieved through purely elastic mechanisms easily exhibits poor crack propagation resistance. By leveraging the significant gap between the strain rate during large-strain service conditions and the crack propagation rate in the fracture process, this study presents a facile strategy for constructing a highly competitive dynamic hydrogen bonding system to produce near-zero-hysteresis and highly crack-resistant D-gels. Through tuning the relaxation dynamics of strong hydrogen bonding interactions with polymer segments by insert deep eutectic solvent (DES) components, the highly dynamic hydrogen bonds are rendered mechanically “invisible” during service condition—an essential factor in achieving a low-hysteresis attribute (low hysteresis: <3%). Meanwhile, the relaxation time of those dynamic bonds is comparable to the inverse of crack propagation rate, effectively alleviating stress concentration at the crack tips, thereby enhancing the ultimate fracture strain (1500%) and crack propagation strain (550%) of the gels. This approach provides a general strategy for synthesizing gels that overcome the traditional trade-off between high crack propagation resistance and high elasticity.},

In the order Cypriniformes, additional lineage-specific WGDs have further contributed to species diversification. While polyploidy is well characterized in species like common carp and goldfish, other polyploid taxa—particularly loaches—remain understudied. Here, high-quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies are presented for two loach species: Sinibotia superciliaris (Golden Chinese Loach) and Parabotia fasciatus (Yichang Sand Loach). By integrating these genomes into a comparative framework with 20 other cypriniform species, key phylogenetic relationships are reconstructed, and introduce a novel subgenome partitioning method (M3). Unlike previous approaches, M3 uses differential sequence divergence to accurately and rapidly assign subgenomes, completing partitioning within minutes and outperforming existing tools. Applying M3, a markedly reduced subgenome is uncovered in the Golden Chinese Loach, with lineage-specific molecular changes in several candidate genes, suggesting potential adaptive significance. This study offers a comprehensive view of polyploidy and subgenome evolution in loaches, highlighting the genomic complexity shaped by repeated WGDs in Cypriniformes and providing valuable resources for future research on vertebrate genome evolution and adaptation.},

Here, a stiffness-tunable polyimide probe, termed Neurotentacle, is proposed for deep brain implantation. Its tunability is enabled by embedded microchannels with controllable liquid pressure. During insertion, the Neurotentacle becomes stiff under elevated internal pressure, allowing penetration of brain tissue without additional materials or tools. Once inserted, it regains flexibility by reducing the internal pressure. The novel ultra-thin microchannel fabrication technique enables the Neurotentacle to maintain dimensions similar to conventional flexible probes. This minimizes tissue damage during insertion while ensuring long-term biocompatibility and stability, confirmed by histological evaluations in both acute and chronic animal models. In long-term recordings, Neurotentacles outperform traditional shuttle-assisted implantation methods. The technique is straightforward, controllable, and does not require complex devices, making it ideal for minimally invasive implantation and long-term neural recordings.},

Key molecular descriptors are identified for each performance label, and the most accurate model is selected through rigorous benchmarking. The optimal region reveals a preference for medium-to-high salt concentrations; low C, O, and N content; and high F content in salts, along with high C and low O content in solvents.

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a typical degenerative disease characterized primarily by the degeneration of cartilage. However, current treatments for cartilage degeneration often lead to the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and fibrocartilage, making it challenging to achieve full-thickness cartilage. Here, dual-modular hydrogel microparticles (dmHMPs) are developed, which enable precise spatio-temporal modulation and dynamic equilibrium between immune responses and cartilage regeneration. dmHMPs can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment of the joint by promoting the polarization of synovial macrophages toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Consequently, as inflammation is mitigated, synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells recruited by dmHMPs can efficiently undergo chondrogenic differentiation to repair damaged cartilage in situ. In vivo experiments demonstrate that dmHMPs significantly suppress the expression of Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and collagen type X, thereby reducing the formation of hypertrophic cartilage and preserving the structural integrity and biological functions of articular cartilage. This therapeutic modulates the dynamic balance between inflammation and repair, providing a promising approach for full-thickness cartilage regeneration.},

  abstract     = {The gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a promising therapeutic target in cancer treatment. However, the specific mechanisms by which gut bacteria and their metabolites exert therapeutic effects in melanoma remain poorly understood. In this study, it is unexpectedly demonstrated that prophylactic supplementation with Limosilactobacillus reuteri exhibits significant tumor-suppressive properties, primarily mediated by its secreted metabolite, reuterin. This metabolite induces trained immunity through macrophage metabolic reprogramming, thereby enhancing antitumor immune responses. Mechanistically, this process involves stabilizing HIF-1α via the AHR-ROS signaling pathway, enhancing glycerophospholipid metabolism, and elevating arachidonic acid levels, thereby amplifying the trained immunity response. Similar to reuterin, arachidonic acid also induces trained immunity and facilitates macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing. To enhance its therapeutic efficacy, reuterin is encapsulated in covalent organic frameworks (COFs). COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior effects in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), remodulating intratumor bacteria and directly facilitating tumor cell killing. Notably, COF-Reuterin demonstrates superior therapeutic efficacy compared to cisplatin. Furthermore, COF-Reuterin reprogrammed TAMs from an M2 to an M1 phenotype, increasing CD8 + T cell infiltration and decreasing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), reshaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of probiotics and their metabolites in the metabolic reprogramming of TAMs, offering a promising cancer therapeutic approach.},

Key challenges include distinguishing between living and deceased individuals, differentiating human from animal remains, and estimating postmortem intervals. While specially trained dogs remain the gold standard in some contexts, there is growing demand for faster, scalable, and cost-effective alternatives. Here, a bio-inspired electronic nose comprising 32 metal-oxide sensors, integrated with machine learning, is presented as a non-invasive, real-time, and reliable tool for volatile organic compound profiling. The system accurately classifies postmortem versus antemortem human biosamples (98.1%), discriminates human from animal tissue (97.2%), and estimates postmortem intervals with high temporal resolution. This study introduces a robust AI-driven olfactory platform for forensic scent detection, highlighting its potential to complement or replace traditional methods. By coupling volatilome analysis with sensor miniaturization and algorithmic refinement, this approach lays the groundwork for next-generation forensic diagnostics and odor-based biomarker discovery.},

In the case of pure electric field swing adsorption (EFSA) of solid/gas mixtures, however, experimental knowledge concerning carbon materials is lacking so far. A new approach to the electrical field effect on gas adsorption and desorption is presented. Ar, N 2 and CO 2 interact with an all-solid composite material composed of activated porous carbon and silica characterized by a high amount of charged interfaces under isothermal conditions and ambient temperature. The intimate contact of both components in the composite allows for the formation of multiple resistor-conductor interfaces enabling the reversible physisorption of these gases using electric fields in the lower V and mA range. The adsorptive/desorptive swing effect depends on the polarizabilities of the gases in particular their dipoles and to an even larger extent on the field induced quadrupole moments of the probe gases Ar, N 2 and CO 2 .},

Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating general patterns associated with DSBs, the influence of 3D chromatin structure on DSB formation remains underexplored, particularly concerning its spatial configuration. Here, the ChromInSight framework is introduced. Using standardized datasets,Hi-DSB is developed and deployed in ChromInSight, a genome-wide DSB prediction model based on graph contrastive learning (GCL), and applied advanced interpretability techniques to identify DSB-associated genomic patterns. The findings reveal that the spatial cluster-scene between hub nodes and DSB sites is predominantly shaped by the 3D conformation of chromatin, rather than by linear genomic distance. This phenomenon is validated at both the Loop and topologically associating domain (TAD) levels and proposed a “spatial isolation – damage containment” hypothesis, which illustrates the genome strategy for managing damage. These findings support the role of 3D genome architecture in genomic instability. Consequently, the framework provides a powerful tool for investigating the intricate relationship between chromatin structure and genomic stability.},

However, its practical application is hindered by poor interfacial contact between Li and LLZO, as well as the persistent issue of lithium dendrite formation during cycling. In this study, a novel and efficient strategy is proposed to address these challenges by employing a room-temperature ultrasonic treatment combined with a LiMg alloy anode. The fabricated symmetrical UW-LiMg/LLZO/UW-LiMg cell exhibits a low interfacial resistance and achieves an unprecedented critical current density of 4.45 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, these cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability, maintaining stable lithium plating/stripping for over 1000 h at a high current density of 1 mA cm − 2 with a low overpotential of ≈30 mV. The superior performance is attributed to the enhanced anode ductility achieved through Mg alloying and the formation of an ultra-stable interface layer. The all-solid-state UW-LiMg/LLZO/LiFePO 4 battery, incorporating an ultrasonically treated alloy anode and a fluorinated cathode interface, delivers a specific capacity of 153 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C and retains an impressive capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles at room temperature.},

Emerging therapies using human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) show promise for IDD treatment. In this study, it is first demonstrated that senescent NP cells promote macrophage polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype in coculture systems. Reciprocally, conditioned medium from M1 macrophages exposed to senescent NP cells accelerates senescence in healthy NP cells. Notably, it is identified that iMSCs-derived exosomes break this pathogenic cycle by reprogramming M1 macrophages toward anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes. Mechanistically, these exosomes deliver miR-100-5p to suppress mTORC1 signaling and regulate glycolysis metabolic reprogramming in macrophages. These findings are corroborated in a rat IDD model, where iMSC-exosomes mitigate IDD progression in vivo. This work elucidates a novel iMSC-exosomes mediated mechanism regulating macrophage-NP cell interactions, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for IDD intervention.},

This nanosystem facilitates magnetic resonance imaging-guided chemodynamic therapy and radiosensitization, efficiently activating the cGAS-STING pathway by disrupting mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Notably, by integrating this nanosystem with an anti-IL-35 blockade, this work successfully mitigates the Breg cell-mediated suppression of NK cells, restores innate immune responses, and enhances antitumor efficacy.

Innovative methods for tailoring the KD, including the use of alternative formulations, ketone esters, and microbiome-focused interventions such as prebiotics and probiotics are examined. Strategies to maximize the diet's benefits while reducing potential side effects are considered.

Functionally, SF3A3 drives tumor progression by promoting cell proliferation, suppressing apoptosis, and enhancing cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SF3A3 regulates alternative splicing of fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (c-FOS), an oncogene linked to chemoresistance, resulting in a ≈2-fold increase in full-length c-FOS expression and activation of downstream anti-apoptotic pathways. Notably, phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) as a direct inhibitor of SF3A3 through database screening and biophysical validation via surface plasmon resonance and mass spectrometry is identified. PEITC reduces c-FOS expression and induces apoptosis in EC cells. Moreover, encapsulating PEITC in a hydrogel delivery system significantly enhances its therapeutic efficacy by enabling controlled release, reducing dosing frequency, and improving clinical applicability. The therapeutic potential of SF3A3 inhibition is further validated using patient-derived tumor-like cell clusters (PTCs), where PEITC and the c-FOS inhibitor T-5224 exhibit synergistic effects in suppressing EC. Collectively, our findings establish SF3A3 as a novel oncogenic regulator in EC and highlight PEITC, particularly in its hydrogel formulation, as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving clinical outcomes in EC patients.},

  abstract     = {Acute ischemic stroke is a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation following ischemia-reperfusion plays a critical role in the disease's pathogenesis. Neutrophil aggregation and clearance within the brain parenchyma influence neuroinflammatory damage during ischemic stroke. Microglia-mediated phagocytosis plays a pivotal role in mitigating neuroinflammation and promoting brain parenchyma recovery. However, the mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between neutrophils and microglia remain poorly understood. Here, this study demonstrates that neutrophils can trigger microglial functional change to inhibit microglial phagocytosis and promote pyroptosis, which is regulated by neutrophil-derived myeloid-related protein 14. Additionally, interleukin-1 β released by pyroptotic microglia further upregulates myeloid-related protein 14 expression and facilitates neutrophil mobilization from the bone marrow, establishing a self-sustaining inflammatory loop. Therefore, neutrophils accumulate in the brain parenchyma and further exacerbate microglial neuroinflammation in the ischemic brain. These findings reveal a previously unknown interaction between neutrophils and microglia after acute ischemic stroke and suggest that targeting myeloid-related protein 14 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke therapy.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in understanding the STING signaling pathway, mechanisms governing cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-induced STING trafficking out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unclear. This study reveals that STING localization is regulated by the balance between coat protein II (COPII)- and coat protein I (COPI)-mediated trafficking, maintaining ER residency in the inactive state or promoting transport to the cis -Golgi via enhanced COPII-mediated export upon activation. Two novel TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-regulated phosphorylated COPII sorting signals on STING—a conserved pSGME motif and a primate-specific pFS motif—are biochemically and structurally identified. These cGAMP-induced signals drive activated STING toward the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis -Golgi complex. Using a cell-free COPII vesicle reconstitution system, TBK1 activation is shown to occur on COPII vesicles, while IRF3 phosphorylation is confined to the ERGIC or the cis -Golgi complex post-uncoating, due to the competitive binding of COPII Sec24 and IRF3 to phosphorylated STING. A class of compounds is also identified that attenuates IRF3 phosphorylation by inhibiting phosphorylated STING packaging into COPII vesicles. These findings elucidate STING trafficking mechanisms and offer therapeutic potential for diseases linked to dysregulated STING activation.},

To tackle challenges in precise biomarker detection in complex blood samples, we propose a metal-organic framework (MOF)-enhanced anti-fouling immunoprobe (MAIP). This sensing platform integrates several key features, including an anti-fouling surface, fully oriented antibody immobilization, and an enhanced electron transfer layer. This platform demonstrates remarkable sensitivity and specificity, capable of detecting trace concentrations of cancer markers, ranging from pg/mL to ng/mL. Comprehensive analysis of clinical serum samples, combined with machine learning (ML) evaluations, underscores the platform's reliability and effectiveness in cancer biomarker detection. Using a combination of three biomarkers, the algorithm demonstrated satisfactory classification performance with an accuracy of 100% on the test set across 64 serum samples. Moreover, when evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, the optimized model maintained a robust accuracy of 0.955 ± 0.09, reinforcing its strong stability and good generalization ability across different data partitions. The MAIP-based platform developed here offers swift analysis, high accuracy, and a simplified testing process. This makes it a promising approach for directly profiling cancer markers from blood, thereby facilitating timely and effective patient care.},

A smart method is proposed for accurate battery health estimation using super-short charging segments. This method combines a degradation mechanism-guided Scale-Invariant Feature Transform for smart health feature identification with machine learning for health evaluation. Validation with 87 batteries with various chemistries, formats, and capacities from 6 manufacturers demonstrates its efficacy. Regardless of battery specifications, health features can be identified automatically from the charging data. The method promises high accuracy (estimation error as low as 1.97%) even with super-short charging covering 10% state of charge span, where all the existing health feature extraction approaches fail.

Factors such as insufficient vascularization, poor retention of therapeutic agents, and the lack of effective mechanical stimulation further hinder the success of current minimally invasive treatments, which often rely on the delivery of drugs or stem cells. Here, magnetic gelatin/hyaluronic acid composite hydrogels micromotors are developed, capable of promoting bone regeneration through localized micromovement stimulation, eliminating the need for therapeutic payloads. By harnessing the mechanical forces generated by the micromotors under an oscillating magnetic field, the approach directly enhances osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, providing a novel mechanism for bone repair. The efficacy of this strategy is further validated in vivo using animal models of bone defects, where moderate micromovement stimulation is shown to significantly increase the volume fraction of newly formed bone by approximately twofold, accompanied by well-aligned collagen and organized mineralization, thereby demonstrating substantial regenerative effects. This work presents a paradigm shift in bone repair with a payload-free, minimally invasive solution that overcomes conventional limitations and offers new insights into microrobotics in regenerative medicine.},

Here, a label-free, ultrasensitive, and rapid assay protocol is described for quantitative protein detections in serum samples, which integrates an ultrasmooth gold nanogroove arrays (UGNA) biosensor with an initial rate analysis (IRA) method. i) Compared with the existing plasmonic biosensors, miscellaneous-protein-mixed scheme substantially accelerates the binding kinetics of analytes by passivation of all channel inner surfaces. Combined with the IRA method, a wide linear range of AFP detection (1–10 4 ng mL −1 ) is obtained, and an enhancement factor of ≈160-fold in detection time (≈70 s) is achieved for an analyte with ultralow concentration. ii) UGNA can achieve an extremely high surface figure of merit (FOM surf ) under normal incidence, which is immensely useful for miniaturization and multiplexing. iii) UGNA are fabricated using a high-reproducibility template-stripping technique, which potentially enables low-cost mass production.

However, the mechanism by which they induce hepatic damage without passive diffusion into the hepatic circulatory system remains unclear. This study demonstrate that indirubin, the main component of indigo naturalis with poor aqueous solubility, predisposes mice with chronic colitis to hepatic injury. This closely mimics the hepatic damage commonly observed in ulcerative colitis patients treated with indigo naturalis. Upon administration, indirubin is detected in the plasma, Peyer's patches, and hepatic tissue, with its distribution linked to macrophage infiltration into the liver. Ablation of macrophages significantly reduces indirubin accumulation and attenuates elevated hepatic transaminases in mice with chronic colitis. Mechanistically, macrophages internalize and transport indirubin aggregates from Peyer's patches through the circulatory system to the livers. This internalization activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the formation of macrophage extracellular traps (METs), which contribute to oxidative stress-induced liver injury. The study identifies indirubin as a potentially toxic component of indigo naturalis that provokes METs-mediated oxidative damage. Additionally, the findings reveal a novel transport pathway for poorly soluble molecules to reach the liver via uptake by macrophages within Peyer's patches.},

Overexpression of TaPPR13 enhanced the antioxidative defense system, whereas knockdown of TaPPR13 led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caused abnormalities in chloroplast thylakoids under drought stress conditions. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpression of TaPPR13 significantly upregulated the expression of nuclear-encoded genes involved in ROS scavenging and the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway. Furthermore, TaPPR13 interacted with TaAOR1 and TaSIG5 to facilitate detoxification and regulate chloroplast gene expression, thereby enhancing drought tolerance. Overexpression of TaPPR13 and TaAOR1 mediated stomatal closure to reduce water loss, improving photosynthetic capacity and conferring a yield advantage under drought stress. These findings show that TaPPR13 promotes retrograde signaling to alter nuclear gene expression, with the TaBZR2-TaPPR13-TaAOR1/TaSIG5 module representing a novel signaling pathway that likely plays a pivotal role in drought stress response.},

  abstract     = {The color patterns of mammalian fur are determined by melanocytes' ability to respond to and adapt to microenvironmental cues. However, these patterns can be lost following injury or under pathological conditions, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, reconstituted hair-bearing skin is generated using skin organoids derived from dissociated epidermal cells, dermal cells, and melanocyte progenitors. The reconstituted skin exhibited pigmented hair patterns. By investigating the molecular cues involved in re-establishing pigment patterns, it is demonstrated that this process is regulated through a two-step mechanism. First, during skin organoid culture, signaling from dermal fibroblasts to melanocytes via the COL6A3-CD44 pathway promotes the early maintenance of organotypic melanocytes. Subsequently, during hair follicle morphogenesis after skin organoid transplantation, signaling from the bulge to melanocytes via the SEMA3C-NRP1 pathway regulates microtubule stability. This regulation guides melanocytes to migrate to their bulge stem cell niche, thereby enhancing hair pigmentation by promoting the adaptive patterning of melanocytes within the hair follicle. The study reveals two novel signaling mechanisms that shape melanocyte adaptive patterning and highlight the hair follicle as a regulatory hub for melanocyte physiological behaviors. These findings may inspire new clinical strategies for preventing hair greying.},

  abstract     = {High-salt (HS) diet is an established risk factor for cognitive impairment, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study reveals that HS diet reduces SHANK1, a key postsynaptic scaffolding protein, via downregulation of the PKA/CREB pathway, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in rats. RNA sequencing of HS-fed rat hippocampi showed downregulation of cAMP signaling and SHANK1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA/CREB reduced SHANK1 levels and impaired dendritic structure and synaptic function, while PKA activation restored CREB activity and SHANK1 expression, reversing HS-induced deficits. Notably, CREB activation is essential for SHANK1 regulation, as a CREB mutant (S133A) blocked the effects of PKA activation, and a constitutively active CREB (S133D) prevented SHANK1 downregulation. These findings highlight the PKA/CREB/SHANK1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target for HS-induced cognitive dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a complex inflammatory bowel disease characterized by multiple factors. Alleviating inflammation is the primary therapeutic approach. However, currently employed anti-inflammatory treatments have limited efficacy and cause side effects. Safer, more effective therapies are needed. Selenium nanosheets (SeNSs) are biocompatible, anti-inflammatory, and low-toxicity nanomaterials with high surface areas and abundant active sites, making them potential therapeutic agents for UC. This study indicates that SeNSs can interact with macrophages and adhere to their cell membranes, significantly increasing their internalization into cells. Proteomic analysis reveals that the main components of the SeNS protein corona are proteins involved in cell proliferation and migration, including those associated with the AKT/PI3K and NF-κB signaling pathways. SeNSs hydrophobically interact with GP130, inhibiting its expression. This interaction downregulates the proteins involved in the aforementioned pathways. In addition, a transcriptomic analysis confirms that SeNSs inhibit apoptosis, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, and the chemokine and TNF signaling pathways. In dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model mice, SeNSs significantly decrease IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, alleviate tissue damage, and lower the disease activity index. These findings suggest that SeNSs can be a safe and effective treatment strategy for UC, offering a novel approach for managing inflammatory diseases.},

  abstract     = {Sunbathing excessively heightens the risk of skin carcinogenesis due to ultraviolet (UV)-mediated immunosuppression. Keratinocytes, the primary cells in epidermis, play a pivotal role in orchestrating the UV-induced immunosuppressive response by releasing platelet-activating factor (PAF) upon UV exposure. Adopting a paradigm shift that transforms a known health hazard as a potential therapeutic asset, a novel therapeutic strategy is set out to investigate for inflammatory conditions by leveraging immunosuppressive properties of UV-irradiated keratinocytes. To safely exploit this mechanism, extracellular vesicles are isolated from UV-irradiated keratinocytes, designate UV KEV, and assess their potential as immunomodulatory agents in the mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis. Subcutaneous administration of UV KEV efficiently stimulates the secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) by keratinocytes and promotes the migration of mast cells to lymph nodes through the PAF/PAF receptor pathway. The as-prepared UV KEV effectively reshapes the immune landscape within the spleen by inhibiting dendritic cell maturation and increasing the population of regulatory T cells. Animal studies confirm that UV KEV can result in robust systemic immune tolerance and significantly alleviate the symptoms of both IBD and psoriasis. This study presents the possibility of UV KEV as natural immunoregulatory therapeutics for the managing inflammatory disorders with promising clinical potential.},

Here, m 6 A modification and its methyltransferase METTL3 are revealed to be upregulated in psoriatic macrophages, while the demethylase ALKBH5 is downregulated. Conditional knockout of Mettl3 in macrophages alleviated psoriasis-like symptoms in mice, whereas knockout of Alkbh5 exacerbated them. Both in vivo and in vitro, Mettl3 deficiency inhibited IMQ-induced M1 macrophage polarization, while Alkbh5 deficiency promoted M1 polarization. The regulation of macrophage polarization by m 6 A is likely mediated by targeting Slc15a3 . SLC15A3 enhances the recruitment of TASL, a recently identified endolysosomal IRF5 adaptor, which functions similarly to the IRF3 adaptors STING and MAVS at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, respectively, to augment IRF5 signaling via SLC15A4.

However, PROTACs are fraught with pharmacokinetic dangers due to poor water solubility and membrane permeability, further posing a huge challenge to the clinical potential. Herein, a nanodelivery system is developed that is elaborately decorated with prodrugs to improve the physicochemical properties and therapeutic efficacy of PROTAC. The nanodelivery, lipid nanodisk (LND), is readily assembled from three commercially available phospholipids, and shows high stability and long circulation time in vivo. The lipid-derived prodrug realizes prolonged retention and precise release of PROTACs at tumor sites under the endogenous stimulus. Collectively, the LND loaded with MZ1 prodrug (LND-MZ1) presents enhanced biocompatibility, improves intracellular accumulation, and superior tumor penetration capacity, enabling more potent and targeted PROTAC therapy with enhanced specificity in vivo. LND-MZ1 shows a more significant anti-tumor effect in the xenograft tumor model, even at a one-tenth dose of the parent PROTACs under the same therapeutic schedule. Overall, the LND-based nanomedicine paves the way for remodeling the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of various drugs to expand the therapeutic scope.},

Here, leveraging the epigenetic landscape of mouse gastrula, p-Enh is identified, an enhancer located within the first intron of Cdx2 and epigenetically pre-marked in the primitive streak region, as a pivotal regulator for posterior tissue development in mouse embryos. Morphological and single-cell transcriptomic analyses confirmed embryonic lethality phenotype with disrupted posterior tissue development trajectories in p-Enh-KO embryos. Molecularly, apart from regulating the neighboring coding-gene Cdx2 in cis , the findings suggest that p-Enh also modulates the global transcriptome and epigenomic landscape, which might through the transient production of eRNA in trans . Further investigation revealed p-Enh-derived eRNAs participate in the regulatory cascades of TGF-β signaling by directly interacting with SMAD4 protein. Combinatorial modulation of TGF-β signaling and p-Enh-eRNA abundance can largely rescue the posterior development deficiency in in vitro gastruloids through a Cdx2 -independent mechanism. Thus, a potential model is proposed in which the broadly distributed p-Enh transcripts within the nucleus can serve as essential cross-modular coordinators, priming the posterior development of mouse embryo.},

However, the immunoregulatory consequences of MET activation remain poorly understood. Herein, a significant positive correlation between phosphorylated MET (p-MET) and tumor-intrinsic PD-1 is verified, both of which are independently associated with adverse prognosis. Elevated p-MET levels correlated with diminished CD8 + T cell cytotoxicity and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed MET activation selectively drives the accumulation of intratumoral GITR⁺ Tregs—a distinct effector Treg subset with potent immunosuppressive function and high prognostic relevance. Compared to KLF2⁺ naïve Tregs, GITR⁺ Tregs exhibited an activated phenotype and enhanced expression of immunoregulatory markers. Subgroup analysis further demonstrated that elevated GITR⁺ Treg infiltration diminished the prognostic utility of serum CA19-9, underscoring the immunosuppressive dominance of this Treg subset. Mechanistically, MET–IL-23–STAT4 axis orchestrates GITR⁺ Treg-mediated immune evasion in PDAC. In vivo, MET inhibition and GITR agonism synergize to enhance antitumor immunity in an orthotopic PDAC model. Collectively, these findings highlight MET signaling and GITR⁺ Tregs as actionable targets to counteract immune evasion and improve the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.},

Interestingly, it is also determined that NSP7 expression impairs the host antiviral response by inhibiting the ISGylation of melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), a key sensor for viral RNA. Through an unbiased esiRNA screen, it is identified that NSP7 ubiquitination is coregulated by β-TrCP1 and the kinase TAF1. Additionally, this study uncovers a small molecule FBXO5 stabilizer that disrupts the β-TrCP1–FBXO5 interaction, thereby markedly enhancing NSP7 degradation and effectively mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Behavioral changes in patients are mirrored in Foxp1 ± mice. It is shown that decreased Foxp1 in the Foxp1 ± striatum results in a significant decrease in phosphodiesterase 10a (Pde10a). Predominantly expressed in medium spiny neurons (MSNs), Pde10a modulates basal ganglia circuitry. Furthermore, the Foxp1 ± striatum exhibits microglial activation, reduced synaptic pruning, and dysregulation of 111 inflammatory genes. These include the downregulated P2ry12 and Fcrls , markers of homeostatic microglia, and upregulated Cd74 , a marker of reactive microglia, suggesting that neuroinflammation contributes to the observed deficits. Interestingly, treatment of Foxp1 ± mice with the PDE10A antagonist MP-10 (PF-2545920) immediately after birth not only corrects behavioral abnormalities, including decreased ultrasonic vocalization, hyperactivity, and anxiety but also normalizes changes in microglia morphology and synaptic pruning. Transcriptomic analysis with a neuroinflammation-specific gene panel reveals nominal gene expression changes after MP-10 treatment, including Bdnf upregulation and enrichment of neurotrophin signaling. Since FOXP1 and its signaling pathway are highly conserved, administration of MP-10 or other Pde10a antagonists may also alleviate the neurological dysfunction seen in humans with FOXP1 syndrome.},

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) have functions of repairing skin wounds, while antimicrobial peptides/proteins (AMPs) can prevent the infections of skin. Therefore, if FGFs can act like AMPs, they will have better application potential in promoting skin wound healing. Here, it is found that grass carp fibroblast growth factor 8a (gcFGF8a) has broad-spectrum and potent antibacterial activity through disrupting the cell membrane, indicating that FGF8 is an uncovered AMP. Further study revealed that gcFGF8a can accelerate skin wound healing through dual functions: inhibiting bacterial and activating of glycolysis. Mechanistically, gcFGF8a/FGFR4 signaling induces epithelial cell glycolytic programs for barrier remodeling through the mTORC1/HIF1α pathway. Interestingly, it is found that mouse FGF8b (mFGF8b), the homolog of gcFGF8a, also has antibacterial and skin wound repair activities, indicating that FGF8 is a functionally conserved molecule in vertebrates. To the knowledge, FGF8 is the only member of the FGF family with both antibacterial and wound repair functions at present, greatly enriching the understanding of this pivotal molecule. Furthermore, these findings highlighted the potential application of FGF8 as a skin wound repair drug.},

  abstract     = {Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is one of the most complex temporomandibular disorders. Cartilage matrix degradation results in the infiltration of nerves, blood vessels, and inflammatory cells, which disrupts chondrocyte function. Therapeutic strategies for TMJOA designed to maintain cartilage homeostasis remain largely unknown. Here, it is reported that orosomucoid 1 (ORM1) attenuated TMJOA progression by maintaining cartilage homeostasis. It is demonstrated that ORM1 is down-regulated in the synovial fluid of patients with TMJOA and condylar cartilage of unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) rats. Administration of ORM1 protein significantly inhibited cartilage matrix degradation and alleviated TMJOA progression in UAC rats. At the mechanistic level, ORM1 binds to vimentin (VIM), a type III intermediate filament cytoskeletal protein, and inhibits the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, thereby significantly decreasing cartilage matrix degradation mediated through inhibiting the cartilage degradation markers matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and MMP3, and maintaining cartilage homeostasis. Notably, inhibition of VIM in vivo also markedly improved TMJOA progression, including cartilage degradation and subchondral bone destruction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the important functions of ORM1 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis via suppressing VIM/MAPK/MMP signaling and suggest that ORM1 is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in TMJOA.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis is a specific type of lipid peroxide-mediated cell death which is crucial in tumor suppression. While the mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) is implicated in lipid homeostasis and mitochondrial metabolism, its role in ferroptosis and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains uncharacterized. Here, MTCH2 is identified as a crucial regulator of ferroptosis in CRC progression. Clinically, high expression of MTCH2 in CRC tissues predicts poor prognosis. Functionally, loss of MTCH2 inhibits azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colorectal tumorigenesis in MTCH2 cKO mice and leads to accumulation of ferrous ion and enhances ferroptosis of CRC in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MTCH2 deficiency promotes the proteasome-dependent ubiquitination of E2F4 and attenuates transcriptional inhibition of transferrin receptor (TFRC) by E2F4, ultimately facilitating TFRC-mediated ferroptosis in CRC cells. Moreover, MTCH2 depletion combined with sorafenib treatment synergistically triggers ferroptosis, suppresses liver metastasis, and effectively eradicates tumors in liver metastasis foci. Taken together, This study reveals the mechanism of MTCH2 deficiency-induced ferroptosis to inhibit the progression of CRC and supports a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the MTCH2/E2F4/TFRC signaling axis in CRC patients with liver metastasis.},

  abstract     = {The elongation period of cotton fiber development is crucial for ensuring cotton quality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fiber elongation remain unclear. This study reveals that SER02 _ A11 , which is preferentially expressed during the fiber elongation period, encodes serine protease inhibitors (serpins). A previously uncharacterized SNP 517th is localized in the gene's coding region between Gossypium barbadense and G. hirsutum , leading to the premature translation termination and low expression of GhSER02 in G. hirsutum . However, in G. barbadense , normal protein translation and high expression of GbSER02 are observed. Ectopic GbSER02 expression or site-directed GhSER02' mutagenesis (but not GhSER02 ) promotes trichome and root cell elongation in Arabidopsis , indicating that SNP 517th causes the dysfunction of GhSER02 . Overexpressing GbSER02 in G. hirsutum increases fiber length. GbSER02 interacts with the transcription factor GhVOZ1 (vascular one-zinc-finger protein) in the cytoplasm, alleviating the inhibitory effect of GhVOZ1 on GhGA3ox1 expression, thereby promoting gibberellin synthesis. Subsequently, the cell wall loosening-related genes GhXTH2 and GhEXPA1 are significantly upregulated whereas the flavonoid metabolism-related gene GhCHS1 is significantly downregulated, ultimately improving fiber length. Collectively, this study reveals the essential role of the GbSER02-GhVOZ1-GhGA3ox1 module in regulating fiber quality and provides novel insights into the mechanism of fiber development in cotton.},

Cardiologists are encountering a growing number of cancer patients with CVDs, and an increasing number of cancer patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The mechanistic link between cancer and CVDs remains elusive. Here, the meta-analysis shows the increased incidence ratio of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing PCI with cancer compared with non-cancer. We experimentally demonstrated that cancer aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in two models of lung cancer in mice. Plasma extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from cancer mice exacerbated cardiac I/R injury in vivo and in vitro, while inhibition of tumor EVs secretion by lipid-coated polyacrylic acid/calcium phosphate nanoparticles delivered a neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor (GW4869) showed the opposite results. Lung-specific miR-485-3p sponges mediated by Adeno-associated virus 6 suppress cardiac damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in CC10-KRAS G12D mice post-I/R. Mechanistically, PPARGC1A/PGC-1α is post-transcriptionally repressed by miR-485-3p in cardiomyocytes, leading to the inhibition of mitochondrial complex I subunits and ATP synthesis. Taken together, our findings reveal for the first time that cancer can aggravate cardiac injury and mitochondrial dysfunction by releasing miR-485-3p-enriched extracellular vesicles derived from cancer cells.},

  abstract     = {Creation of well-curated databases tailored to specific structural motifs can underpin and drive materials discovery, as the properties of materials are governed by composition and structure. The role of such motifs in directing the intricate interplay between structure and properties is exemplified by intermetallic compounds with structures that contain kagome layers that exhibit a variety of exotic physical states. Two prevailing approaches have previously been applied to identify such materials: evaluation of structural topology or geometry assessment, however, both present limitations if deployed individually. We augment topological screening with geometrical filtering to allow versatile control over the identification of kagome layers. Applying this approach with minimal further constraints labels over 9000 kagome-containing intermetallics which are assigned to four structural classes, revealing connections between symmetry, composition, direct space structure, and flatband electronic structures in reciprocal space. A machine learning model is used to predict new element combinations that favour the formation of kagome layers. Several highly-ranked phase fields correspond to known kagome-containing materials that were absent from the training dataset, demonstrating that the workflow can identify chemistries affording kagome layers. This motivates the extension of the approach beyond kagome to other property-conferring motifs, such as honeycomb, square planar or triangular plane nets.},

In this study, the authors demonstrated the novel interaction between LEDGF and H3R17me2a. In detail, Asn38 and Asp57 of LEDGF Proline-Tryptophan-Tryptophan-Proline (PWWP) domain are the key binding sites validated by peptide pull-down assays. Subsequently, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that PPAT , PAICS , GART , ADSL , and ADSS2 are key target genes.

To maximize their efficacy, adjuvants and their combinations are investigated to prepare vaccines with whole tumor antigens. By comparing different nano/micro-vaccines, ≤ 400 nm and 2.5 µm, respectively, are identified as their optimal sizes. When used alone, the optimal cancer vaccine cures all or most tumor-bearing mice with melanoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and melanoma lung metastasis. The landscape of immune cells in the blood, splenocytes, and draining lymph nodes of vaccine-treated mice is systematically investigated using single-cell sequencing. The diversity of CD8 + T cell receptors (TCR), CD4 + TCR, and B cell receptors (BCR) in cured mice is higher than that in uncured mice. By comparing 21 samples, several biomarkers, including KLRG1, S100A4, S1PR5, IL2Ra, and IKZF2, were identified to distinguish responders and non-responders to immunotherapy. Moreover, S100A4, S1PR5 and KLRG1, are biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy in mouse cancer models and patients with cancer. Hence, this study presents an optimized cancer vaccine that cures most tumor-bearing mouse models and the landscape of immune cells in non-responders and responders to immunotherapy.

  abstract     = {Mounting evidence has indicated that immune signals originating from the brain's border tissues will exert a profound influence on brain parenchyma neural cells. However,  the structural component alterations and immune cell infiltration characteristics of choroid plexus (ChP) following traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain incompletely understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing and histological analysis, the accumulation of group 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) in the ChP stroma post-TBI is identified. Intracerebroventricular adoptive transfer of ILC2 is further indicated to exhibit a tendency to colonize the ChP and significantly alleviate pathogenic immune infiltration during the acute phase of TBI, as well as maintain hippocampal integrity during the chronic phase. Sensory-motor function and memory impairments in TBI mice are also improved under ILC2 treatment. Mechanistically, ILC2 is induced by ChP fibroblasts derived IL33 and anchored to stroma fibroblasts via the VCAM-1/Integrin α4β7 pathway. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the hippocampus reveals that ILC2-derived AREG promotes the initiation of neurogenesis by interacting with EGFR on early-stage neurogenic cells. Overall, these findings highlight that ChP-resident ILC2, through optimizing the immune microenvironment and promoting neurogenesis after TBI, may represent a potential therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {A primary objective of organic synthesis is to establish a catalytic methodology that is mild, straightforward, and economically efficient. Thioesters are widely employed in the realms of physiology, pharmacology, and agriculture. It is imperative to continuously expand the range of sulfur-containing precursors to keep pace with the cutting-edge advancements in the field of organic sulfur chemistry. This research has uncovered that polysulfide anions (K 2 S x ), which serve as reducing catalysts, can also effectively act as sulfur reagents, providing the formation of C( sp 3 )–S bonds through a photoredox catalysis with an oxidative photocatalyst tetrabutylammonium decatungstate (TBADT) and dual hydrogen atom transfer (DHAT) process. In a pioneering study, a combinatorial strategy of an oxidative photocatalyst TBADT is presented with a reductive photocatalyst K 2 S x , enabled a photo-induced three-component coupling reaction of simple aldehydes with alkanes containing C (sp 3 )─H and polysulfide anions. A numbers of thioester derivatives are successfully obtained in good yields, while a by-product H 2 S is captured and identified by gas chromatography analysis. Concurrently, density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided the theoretical support of the reaction mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Rotator cuff tears often require surgical reconstruction; however, outcomes remain suboptimal, primarily because of the challenges in fully restoring the tendon–bone interface (TBI). The normal fibrocartilaginous transition zone is often replaced by fibrous scar tissue, thereby increasing the risk of retears. A porous hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel is developed to encapsulate adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). Gelatin microspheres served as porogens to create micropores within the hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel (HMs), and hollow gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel microspheres are used to encapsulate BMP-2 (GMBs). In vitro experiments confirm substantial proliferation and homing of ADSCs within the porous hydrogel system. When the ADSCs-loaded composite hydrogel (HMs/MBs/ADSCs) is applied to a rat rotator cuff injury model, it effectively reconstructs the fibrocartilage transition zone and promotes TBI healing. Transcriptome sequencing is performed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying BMP-2-induced fibrocartilage reconstruction. Furthermore, integrated in vitro sequencing reveals that HMs/MBs/ADSCs modulated the tissue microenvironment to enhance tissue regeneration, primarily through BMP-2′s regulation of the paracrine effects of ADSCs. This study explores the comprehensive pathway through which HMs/MBs/ADSCs enhance tissue regeneration, emphasizing the synergistic effects of BMP-2 and ADSCs, and offers novel insights into the mechanisms underlying TBI healing.},

  abstract     = {Leaf senescence significantly impacts both the yield and quality of non-heading Chinese cabbage (NHCC). Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of leaf senescence in NHCC remain poorly understood. Here, transcriptome changes are first profiled, and found that ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathways are activated during leaf senescence. Further mining of ET, SA, and DNA methylation pathway genes identified that EIN3A and CMT2 are induced and repressed, respectively, during leaf senescence. A whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis revealed a global reduction of DNA methylation during leaf senescence, with the most dramatic decline occurring in the 1 kb regions upstream of transcription start sites (TSS) and downstream of transcription end sites (TES). Knocking down of EIN3A and CMT2 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) demonstrated that EIN3A is crucial for ET- and age-triggered leaf senescence, while CMT2 plays an inhibitory role. It further showed that EIN3A directly represses the expression of CMT2 to release its “braking” role on senescence-associated genes ( SAGs ) expression. Thus, the study uncovers a pivotal antagonistic interaction between ET signaling and DNA methylation, which may be involved in setting the pace for the progression of leaf senescence in NHCC.},

  abstract     = {Effective bone regeneration remains a significant challenge in surgical practice, particularly due to the limitations associated with autologous bone grafting, such as donor site morbidity and limited bone availability. This study investigated the potential of human bone-derived endothelial cells (b-ECs) in mediating bone regeneration, especially in conjunction with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (bm-MSCs). It is demonstrated that b-ECs retain unique osteoinductive properties post-isolation, crucial for promoting bone formation in vivo. Utilizing ectopic and orthotopic xenograft models in immunodeficient mice, these findings revealed that the synergistic interaction of b-ECs and bm-MSCs induced rapid and substantial bone formation, highlighting the therapeutic potential of b-ECs in bone repair strategies. The distinct expression of KIT ligand (KITLG) in b-ECs emerged as a key factor in these processes. KITLG expression by b-ECs facilitated the recruitment of c-Kit+/CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells to the osteovascular niche, leading to robust osteogenic differentiation of bm-MSCs, a process regulated by Notch signaling. Moreover, inducing KITLG expression in non-bone-derived endothelial cells conferred similar osteoinductive capabilities. These findings not only enhance the understanding of the intricate interplay between vascular and bone tissues but also open avenues for developing innovative cell-based approaches for bone regeneration therapy.},

In seeking sustainable alternative solutions, cultivated meat technology typically utilizes differentiation of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) into muscle cells for in vitro meat production. However, understanding the molecular determinants governing MPC differentiation into muscle cells, and the potential enhancement of this process through modulation of signaling pathways, remains limited. Herein, we characterized the molecular landscape associated with bovine MPC differentiation in vitro by employing multiomics, and explored its augmentation by small molecules, together leading to identification of media that enhanced myogenic differentiation compared with conventional methods in both 2D cultures and tissue-engineered 3D skeletal muscle constructs. Through bulk and single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics, we compared conventional and enhanced differentiation media, demonstrating that the enhanced media gave rise to unique progenitor-like cell populations, while simultaneously promoting differentiation into myocytes and contractile myotubes expressing a wide array of myogenic markers that more closely resemble bovine muscle cells in vivo. The improved method for promoting myogenic differentiation in 2D and 3D formats, together with the corresponding molecular roadmap, may prove valuable for cultivated meat applications.},

How cells facilitate such adhesion remains unclear. Here, it is investigated how mammalian cells exposed to compression initiate unspecific and integrin-mediated adhesion. It is observed that with increasing compression, cells increase adhesion to collagen I or fibronectin and strengthen adhesion faster. Under low and medium compression, cells minimally increase unspecific adhesion to substrates that lack specific binding sites for cell surface receptors, such as integrins. However, under high compression, mammalian cells switch to a strong unspecific adhesion state, which significantly contributes to cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion. Thereby cells use the glycocalyx to directly facilitate strong unspecific adhesion and to enhance early integrin-mediated adhesion. The mechanistic insight of how cells unspecifically adhere to substrates under confinement opens avenues to better understand cell adhesion in development, homeostasis, disease, and in a wide range of biotechnological and medical applications in which cells are exposed to mechanical confinement.},

Thus, more effective combination therapies are needed. This study finds that cystine and cysteine levels in tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are significantly higher than adjacent non-tumor tissues. Cystine deficiency polarizes macrophages toward an M1 phenotype, secreting more TNF-α, CXCL9, and CXCL10. However, using a cystine-free diet marginally reduces the development of lung cancer in vivo. A cystine-free diet slightly reduces lung cancer progression in vivo. Further studies show that cystine deprivation or erastin-mediated transport inhibition increased PD-L1 expression in macrophages both in vitro and in vivo. Combining a cystine-free diet or IKE injection with PD-L1 antibody treatment significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in mice. Mechanistic studies indicat that cystine deficiency-induced GSH depletion activates NF-κB in macrophages by reducing its glutathionylation. This effect can be reversed by replenishing GSH or using an NF-κB inhibitor. At the same time, lung cancer patients with better responses to immunotherapy are found to have lower serum GSH levels. These findings suggest that targeting cystine metabolism combined with PD-L1 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy.},

However, it remains a clinical challenge due to limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of I/R injury. This study aims to investigate the mechanism of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-mediated succinate oxidation in microglia extracellular traps (MiETs) formation and neuronal injury after cerebra I/R injury. The results show that microglia are the main cell type producing extracellular traps (ETs) at 24 h at cerebral parenchyma after cerebral I/R. Additionally, oxygen glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) could induce MiETs formation and increased level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Microglia switches toward glycolysis with enhanced SDH activity and upregulated expression of SDH subunit A (SDHA) during MiETosis. Dimethyl malonate (DMM), a competitive SDH inhibitor, could reduce MiETosis by inhibiting succinate oxidation and mtROS production during reperfusion. Furthermore, DMM is found to alleviate neuronal injury after OGD/R exposure and neurological behavior disorders after cerebral I/R, and the effect is similar to MiETosis inhibitor BB-Cl amidine. These findings reveal a novel functional state of microglia and the role of succinate oxidation in MiETosis after cerebral I/R and provide a novel potential target for the treatment of AIS.},

  abstract     = {Electromagnetic wave devices and components operating in the low-frequency band of 1–8 GHz (L, S, and C bands) are widely applied in wireless data communication systems, satellite radar, and other fields. However, traditional low-frequency microwave absorption materials (MAMs) suffer from issues such as large thickness, heavy weight, difficult impedance matching, insufficient low-frequency microwave loss, and poor environmental stability, severely limiting use and development. In recent years, researchers construct composite systems combining various types of loss, coupled with component adjustments and structural design strategies, significantly improving the impedance matching and multiple loss synergy effects for low-frequency MAMs. Based on the above, this review briefly introduces the basic principle of microwave absorption and the influence factors of low-frequency microwave absorption performance, and systematically reviews the recent research progress of carbon-based composites, magnetics-based composites, polymer-based composites, ceramic-based composites, and multiphase hybrid composites. Additionally, the intrinsic relationship and mechanisms are discussed in detail between the micro-structure and macro-performance of different composites. Furthermore, the key scientific and technical bottleneck problems that need to be addressed in the design and preparation of low-frequency MAMs are identified. It is expected to provide theoretical guidance for the controlled preparation and performance regulation of low-frequency microwave absorption composites.},

  abstract     = {Tumor cells reprogram their energy metabolism patterns to meet the needs of rapid growth and metastasis. The underlying mechanisms of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in glucose metabolism remodeling in breast cancer (BC) are still not well understood. Herein, the expression of a tumorigenic lncRNA, LINC01094 are demonstrated that, is significantly increased in BC tissues and is associated with poorer patient survival. METTL14-mediated m 6 A modification stabilized LINC01094 by recruiting the reader protein IGF2BP2, which contributed to the upregulation of LINC01094 expression in BC. Gain- and loss-of-function assays validated that LINC01094 triggered a switch in glucose metabolism from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis, promoting BC progression both in vitro and in vivo. LINC01094 promoted the dimeric assembly and nuclear translocation of PKM2 by acting as a “molecular scaffold” for the PKM2/JMJD5 complex. This, in turn, facilitated energy metabolic reprogramming and cell proliferation induced by HIF1-α/β-catenin. Furthermore, the therapeutic potential of LINC01094 is evaluated through the administration of the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 in mouse xenografts. These findings highlight the critical roles of LINC01094 in cellular glucose metabolism and tumorigenesis in BC, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target.},

  abstract     = {Potassium-ion batteries, which possess unique advantages such as lower K + /K redox potential compared to sodium and superior interfacial charge transfer dynamics, demonstrate considerable viability for grid-level energy storage deployment. However, the development of potassium electrodes remains constrained by sluggish solid-state diffusion of K + within electrodes and progressive structural failure by the large volume variation during (de)intercalation, which requires a thorough understanding ionic transport, size effects, and electro–chemo–mechanical properties of electrodes, to achieve rational design and controlled synthesis. This review initiated with a comprehensive evaluation of potassium-based batteries from five aspects: energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, and cost. Afterward, a systematical examination for key aspects of potassium electrodes from a unique perspective is provided, starting with the fundamental scientific issues of transport properties (key features, anomalous cases, regulation, measurement and prediction) and size effects (kinetics, thermodynamics, potassium storage and transport mechanisms), while further discussing the specific electro–chemo–mechanical properties (composition–structure regulation, nanostructure and interface engineering). Additionally, this review highlights the construction of high-entropy electrodes and the pivotal role of machine learning in developing potassium electrodes.

  abstract     = {Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is pivotal to sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies. Yet, its sluggish kinetics in acidic media and reliance on expensive noble metal catalysts limit its efficiency in these applications. Spinel cobalt(II, III) oxide (Co 3 O 4 )-based catalysts are cost-effective alternatives with high theoretical catalytic activity. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their poor stability in acidic electrolytes. This review critically examines recent advances in enhancing the stability of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER. The fundamental reaction mechanisms of acidic OER are first analyzed to illustrate how different catalyst design strategies can be used to improve their stability. Next, five key catalyst design strategies reported in recent studies are summarized: 1) constructing protective surface layers, 2) modulating reaction pathways, 3) controlling cobalt redox dynamics, 4) tuning cobalt-oxygen covalency, and 5) stabilizing lattice oxygen. Further, recent research progress in understanding the structure-activity-stability relationship of spinel Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts is summarized, with a focus on identifying their catalytically active sites, tracking surface reconstruction, and elucidating degradation mechanisms. This review ends with a discussion of future research directions for addressing key challenges in realizing durable, high-performance Co 3 O 4 -based catalysts for acidic OER applications.},

  abstract     = {Coordinating transcription and replication via transcription factors (TFs) is a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes. The role of TFs in regulating these processes in cancers remains unclear. Here, it is shown that oncogenetic ETS transcription factor ETV4 controls DNA replication through both transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ETV4 localizes to specific DNA replication origins and interacts with the origin recognition complex subunits ORC1 and ORC6 during the G1/S phase, facilitating origin formation. Using quantitative in situ analysis of protein interactions at DNA replication forks (SIRF) assays, it is shown that ETV4 transiently localizes to replication forks in the S phase. It interacts with replicative helicase MCM2 N-terminal, histone H3, and histone-chaperone FACT and is involved in histone processing during replication. Additionally, ETV4 transcriptionally regulates key replisome genes MCM2, MCM4, MCM5, MCM10, and ORC1, influencing their expression and recruitment to chromatin. Due to its binding at the origin-promoter locus like the MCM4 gene, ETV4 overexpression increases R-loop formation, DNA damage, and cell death under external replication stress induced by topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor. These findings highlight the dual role of ETV4 in replication and transcription and suggest that targeting TOP1 could be a synthetic-lethal approach in ETV4-overexpressed lung cancer.},

These mechanisms involve protein–protein interactions between receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and MLKL, MLKL phosphorylation, protein–protein interactions between MLKL and MLKL, and MLKL-lipid interactions. In this review, the specificity of MLKL activation mechanisms is discussed across different species and describe the processes by which MLKL transitions from an auto-inhibited to a membrane-embedded state.

Herein, this study focuses on the development of an innovative fluorescent probe that exhibits heightened spectral sensitivity to microenvironmental changes and its advanced HSFI application. First, the comprehensive investigation of various donor-π-acceptor molecules uncovers the critical role of π-spacer on the wavelength sensitivity to microenvironment polarity. Based on this insight, a new fluorescent probe Lipi-PS of whose wavelength sensitivity represents the highest level so far is rationally developed. Further combining with the features of lipid droplets (LDs) targeting and high photostability of Lipi-PS , as well as the newly established wavelength and polarity encoding method, HSFI is successfully realized in cells, tissues, and zebrafishes. Accordingly, the structural morphologies, fluorescence wavelengths, and polarities are intuitively visualized in the HSFI images. Notably, a special HSFI of single LD is achieved using Lipi-PS in a custom-built 3D-SpecDIM system, allowing 5D tracking ( xyzλt ) of individual LDs for the first time. This enables unprecedented correlation of polarity-dynamic behavior at the single-LD level.},

Transcription factor FOXM1 plays an essential role in cardiovascular development. The present study explores its role in mitochondrial bioenergetics in postmitotic cardiomyocytes (CMs). FOXM1 is significantly upregulated in ischemic heart tissues from humans, mice, and pigs. CM-specific Foxm1 -knockout mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy features associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of Foxm1 -knockout mice reveal robust, specific downregulation of gene programs important for mitochondrial energetics and homeostasis. Analysis of proteome and ubiquitinome data reveal that FOXM1 deficiency in CMs promotes LKB1 ubiquitination and impairs the AMPK signaling and energy metabolism pathways. Bioinformatics analysis identifies that E3 ligase MKRN1 promotes the K48-linked ubiquitination of LKB1 on Lys146, which in turn, inhibits the AMPK signaling pathway and impairs energy homeostasis in mice with HF. CM-specific Mkrn1 knockout ameliorates cardiac dysfunction by rejuvenating the impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics induced by FOXM1 deficiency. FOXM1 overexpression preserves mitochondrial bioenergetics and protects against myocardial I/R injury in both rodent and porcine models. In conclusion, FOXM1 is actively involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics during HF. FOXM1 may be a potential promising therapeutic target for myocardial I/R injury and HF.},

Herein, two corundum-type medium-entropy oxide ceramics (MEO-1 and MEO-2) are synthesized through solid-state reaction sintering under controlled oxygen partial pressures. MEO-1 is a single-phase corundum-type oxide (Al 0.41 Cr 0.26 Fe 0.31 Ti 0.02 ) 2 O 3 , while MEO-2 incorporates (Fe 4 Al 3 Cr) 0.25 TiO 5 whiskers to reinforce (Al 0.40 Cr 0.25 Fe 0.30 Ti 0.05 ) 2 O 3 . By regulating variable valence ions at different oxygen partial pressures, the whiskers achieved a maximum average length of 28.3 µm and a length-to-diameter ratio of 17.7 at 50.6 kPa, significantly enhancing the fracture toughness of the MEO-2, which possesses the optimal flexural strength, Vickers hardness, and fracture toughness of 321 ± 8 MPa, 22.4 ± 1.5 GPa, and 3.87 ± 0.12 MPa m 1/2 , respectively. Bravais–Friedel–Donnay–Harker law (BFDH) simulation elucidates that oxygen partial pressures can effectively regulate ionic diffusion behavior and whisker growth. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the whisker growth direction [0 4 0] aligns with the high shear modulus direction, contributing to the strengthening mechanism. This work provides new insights for designing high-performance medium/high-entropy ceramics, highlighting the critical role of oxygen partial pressure in regulating whisker growth and improving mechanical properties.},

The developments discussed herein signify substantial progress in material synthesis, characterization, and processing techniques, effectively addressing critical challenges associated with the integration of biodegradable devices into medical implants. Although biodegradable medical implants promise advanced patient care, widespread clinical translation is hindered by inconsistent degradation rates mismatched with healing timelines, insufficient load-bearing strength, and potential inflammatory or toxic by-products. Additionally, most studies exhibit application-material imbalances, inadequate in vivo validation, and poorly controlled degradation behavior. Future efforts must clarify degradation mechanisms and treat materials as therapeutic agents. By synthesizing recent findings and highlighting critical gaps, this review provides valuable insights to guide innovation in biodegradable implant technologies, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes and accelerating regenerative medicine's progress.

  abstract     = {Alkaline (ALK) electrolysis is an important means to generate green hydrogen from water splitting, and its technical advance hinges critically on the breakthrough of catalytic electrodes capable of high current densities at low overpotentials. Here, an efficient and robust hydrogen-evolving electrode is developed, composed of cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) nanosheet catalyst with a metal cobalt transition interface on the current-collecting nickel wire mesh substrate. This Co 3 O 4 electrode affords a unique charge avalanche effect at the metal–semiconductor interface to concentrate electron release and thus enables high-current-density hydrogen evolving at 1000 mA cm −2 with only 207 mV overpotential, far outperforming commercial Raney nickel electrode that commonly delivers current densities below 500 mA cm −2 at 300–500 mV overpotentials. An industrial cell-stack electrolyzer utilizing Co 3 O 4 electrodes achieves a consistent current density of 1000 mA cm −2 at a 2.0 V cell voltage, surpassing the operational current density of commercial ALK systems by two to five times (200–500 mA cm −2 ). A significant enhancement in current output and a minimal deactivation rate of only 0.056 mV h −1 demonstrate the potential of the Co 3 O 4 electrode to replace commercial Raney nickel electrode, thereby substantially improving the hydrogen production efficiency of ALK electrolyzers.},

  abstract     = {Valorizing CO 2 into chemical building blocks via efficient electrified processes could significantly decrease carbon emissions. In this work, a device that allows generation of tunable micro-plasma modes (arc, pulsed, pulsed arc) on a chip for efficient, low-power and renewable chemical production is presented. This concept is first demonstrated by using nanosecond repetitively pulsed (NRP) micro-plasma for pure CO 2 splitting and show that the pulse micro-plasma maintains a peak energy efficiency of 29% across 0.2%–21% CO 2 conversion at plasma powers below 1 W-nearly an order of magnitude lower power than other systems with comparable performance. The kinetic studies feature pulsed arc mode as a novel way to improve CO 2 conversion, where CO production tripled compared to pulsed mode with negligible energy efficiency losses. In addition, these devices are also capable of performing dry reforming of methane (DRM) with a maximum energy efficiency of 33% and a syngas ratio close 1. The fact that these devices are low-power, versatile and built as chips enables scalable, sustainable and decentralized CO 2 conversion.},

  abstract     = {Semitransparent organic modules (STOMs) are of particular interest due to potential applications in building-integrated photovoltaics though upscaling without significant performance losses while ensuring an aesthetic appearance for window applications remains a major research obstacle. This study presents two types of STOMs with an area of 11.4 cm 2 , exhibiting homogeneous appearance while retaining up to 92% of their respective small-area cell power conversion efficiency (PCE). Precise laser structuring minimized the area loss originating from the sub-cell series interconnection, allowing narrow cell stripes down to 1.25 mm. This enables a metal-less top electrode composed solely of PEDOT:PSS without compromising fill factor. For a module, an additional challenge is to ensure a low resistance series interconnection between sub-cells. This is realized with a novel approach based on a direct contact between PEDOT:PSS and a thin Ag layer within the back electrode. For the first design, the latter incorporates Al-doped ZnO and Ag attaining a PCE of 6.1% with an average visible transmission (AVT) of 47.5%. A more elaborate design features an extended back electrode using TiO 2 and SiO 2 for improved optical performance (PCE = 7.9%), reaching an unprecedented AVT of 50.8% and a light utilization efficiency (LUE = AVT x PCE) of 4.0%.},

  abstract     = {Copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) have emerged as a remarkable class of CO 2 reduction reaction catalysts that are distinguished by their unparalleled reactivity, but effectively modulating the transport pathway of charge carriers between Cu NCs by feasible chemical means is still challenging. Herein, a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy is proposed to modulate the fast electron transport pathway formed between clusters. A copper-sulfur–nitrogen cluster [Cu 4 (SN) 4 ] (denoted Cu 4 SN ) is first synthesized; subsequently, the SN ligands in Cu 4 SN are coupled covalently via a thermally induced covalent crosslinking strategy to yield CC –Cu 4 SN , which exhibits enhanced conductivity and photocarrier transport. As expected, CC –Cu 4 SN shows a high photocatalytic CO production rate of 29.98 µmol g −1 h −1 with ≈99.5% selectivity in CO 2 reduction with H 2 O as sacrificial agents, which is more than 10 times superior to that observed with Cu 4 SN . Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the covalent crosslinks between clusters accelerate the dynamic transfer of photoexcited charge carriers, increase the light utilization ability, favor CO 2 adsorption and * COOH generation, thereby accounting for the increased CO 2 photoreduction activity. This work presents a novel thermally induced internal covalent crosslinking strategy for synthesizing novel cluster-based covalent polymers with enhanced stability and catalytic activity.},

ALKBH5 induces ferroptosis in the HH/R model by mutating the 3′-UTR of G3BP1 mRNA and m 6 A sites at positions 142 and 173. Mutations of sites 142 and 173 only partially affect the levels of p53 N/T , SLC7A11 and ferroptosis. G3BP1, YBX1 and p53 protein can bind to each other, and p53 can inhibit the expression of SLC7A11 via nuclear binding to the promoter region of SLC7A11 mRNA. The p53 and YBX1 proteins can synergistically enter the nucleus to aggravate cell damage, while G3BP1 is expressed in the cytoplasm and inhibits p53 binding to SLC7A11 by blocking the entry of the p53 and YBX1 proteins into the nucleus. ALKBH5 promotes G3BP1 expression through m 6 A methylation at m 6 A sites 142 and 173. Subsequently, G3BP1, YBX1, and p53 interact with each other, the amount of synergistic nuclear translocation of YBX1 and p53 is reduced, and the level of p53 nuclear translocation that inhibiting SLC7A11 transcription is decreased, thereby inhibits cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and reducing myocardial tissue damage during myocardial IRI in diabetes.},

However, the limited stability of natural enzymes, along with interference from electro-oxidizable species, continues to pose significant challenges for their long-term application. Herein, an integrated wearable system is presented for nonenzymatic glucose monitoring in sweat at the point of care. This system integrates a flexible microfluidic glucose sensor patch for sweat sampling and measurement, using Pt nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) confined within phthalocyanine-based conductive metal–organic frameworks (Pc-MOFs) as electrode materials, and a flexible printed circuit board for signal/analysis and wireless communication. The microfluidic sensor patch based on Pc-MOFs confined Pt-NPs exhibits significantly improved nonenzymatic glucose sensing performances. This is attributed to the ultrasmall size of Pt-NPs and the confinement effect within the Pc-MOF channels, which regulates the glucose adsorption intensity and increases the electrocatalytic activity to glucose oxidation. During the continuous monitoring process, the glucose concentration is calibrated in sweat by accounting for fluctuations in pH and temperature, and evaluated the performance of the wearable device in monitoring sweat glucose levels in human subjects over a 12-h period, achieving data as accurate as that obtained using high-performance liquid chromatography.},

Here, it is demonstrated that localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on an Ir single-atom Au catalyst actively restructures the hydrogen-bond (HB) network, accelerating ammonia oxidation reaction kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that plasmonic excitation shifts the HB network toward a more flexible configuration, favoring the formation of three-coordinated hydrogen-bonded water (3HB·H 2 O) while suppressing cation-associated species (K + ·H 2 O). This transformation enhances the dehydrogenation process and stabilizes reaction intermediates, leading to a 28% increase in NH 3 oxidation kinetics. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy further confirms that LSPR-driven polarization at the Ir active site compresses the Ir─O bond from 1.73 to ≈1.58 Å by generating electron vacancies, thereby accelerating deprotonation with * OH during oxidative electrolysis. Extending this principle to an LED-driven plasmon-assisted symmetric wastewater electrolyzer, achieving a 40-fold current enhancement and 94% ammonia removal efficiency over 120 h at 1 V under landfill leachate-like conditions.},

The PGA-derived glycolic acid oxidation reaction (GAOR) achieves 100 mA cm −2 at 1.36 V versus RHE, benefiting from abundant hydroxyl species (OH*) that lower the required potential by over 190 mV compared to the oxygen evolution reaction.

Electrochemical analysis, quasi in situ electron paramagnetic resonance, and in situ Raman spectroscopy reveal continuous OH − oxidation enhancing GAOR activity, while density functional theory confirms that OH* lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining C─C bond cleavage and C─H bond activation.

  abstract     = {Low-temperature annealing is traditionally employed to relieve residual stresses in metallic materials, typically resulting in softening. However, a novel finding in the face-centered-cubic (fcc) CoNiV medium entropy alloy (MEA) is reported, where low-temperature annealing induces significant hardening without sacrificing ductility. Specifically, after annealing at 530 °C, the yield strength increases from 503 to 653 MPa, while maintaining plasticity of ≈60%. The comprehensive analysis reveals that this unexpected strengthening is attributed to the development of multi-scale chemical short-range orderings (SROs) during the annealing process. These SROs, particularly a newly formed L12-type ordered structure (SRO-2), enhance material strength by promoting dislocation slip planarity and reducing dislocation entanglement. This study demonstrates that low-temperature annealing can effectively optimize atomic-scale structures in complex alloys distinct from that in conventional alloys, thereby improving their mechanical properties. These findings extend the conventional understanding of annealing effects and highlight the potential for leveraging SROs to design high-performance materials.},

This structure imparts remarkable mechanical properties, including considerable adhesion (30.4 kPa on flame-retardant gloves), tensile strength (5.8 MPa), and high ionic conductivity. Notably, through the formation of a protective carbonized/B₂O₃ layer and chemical barrier gases during combustion, the ionogel exhibits excellent flame retardancy, with a weight loss of 41.8% at 800 °C. Additionally, GLI achieves real-time thermal sensing via its negative temperature coefficient (NTC) behavior (TCR = −0.58% °C −1 ).

  abstract     = {This work elucidates an important open question in the field of mechanically soft magnetorheological elastomers (MREs): how microstructural rearrangements during magnetic actuation modulate their viscoelastic behavior. Experimental assays are provided on mechanically confined and very soft MREs that, under magnetic actuation, show an order of magnitude increase in relaxation times compared to purely mechanical cases. It is demonstrated that such a modulation in the viscous response can be tuned by the amplitude and actuation rate of the magnetic stimuli, and is intrinsically linked to microstructural rearrangements of the magnetic particles. Motivated by these experimental observations, magnetic actuation protocols are conceived to enable mechanical responses in soft materials with force-memory. Specifically, due to the magnetically induced long-term viscous relaxation, one can induce magnetic-driven yielding by introducing material hardening during cycling loading. This mechanical memory of the MRE can be subsequently removed by releasing the magnetic stimuli for h, resetting the material performance and its microstructural state. These mechanisms are deeply understood by a combination of different experimental approaches and a new theoretical magneto-mechanical continuum model. The results reported herein respond to unraveled fundamental questions in soft MREs, and provide a game-changing concept for designing a new branch of soft sensor-actuator and reservoir computing systems.},

  abstract     = {Topological insulators have taken classical wave systems to the next level by their unique characteristics such as highly efficient, robust, and unidirectional wave propagation. As a step further, tunability in fundamental building blocks such as couplers is desired toward topological integrated circuits and communication systems. However, most of existing topologically protected couplers exhibit a constant transmission coefficient within the bandgap, and achieving continuously tunable transmission coefficients remains challenging. Here it is experimentally showed that a four-port coupler consisting of quantum valley Hall effect-based waveguides can exhibit continuously tunable transmission coefficients from one input port to each of the two output ports over the bandgap, while the rest port is consistently isolated by the topological protection. Further topologically protected digital signal transfer is demonstrated with frequency shift keying modulation in the coupler, revealing the data-transfer capability close to the theoretical limit established in the digital communication scheme. These results pave the way for topological data transfer and signal processing.},

  abstract     = {Kirigami mechanical metamaterials provide exceptional tunability in mechanical properties and morphing capabilities, exhibiting great potential for deployable and actuatable devices. However, most kirigami structures can only deform freely within a 2D plane, with limited out-of-plane deformability, making them inadequate for constructing periodic objects with arbitrary 3D shapes. Here, a novel class of 3D mechanical metamaterials with hyperbolic kirigami tessellations has been developed. By projecting hyperbolic kirigami templates onto three types of triply periodic minimal surfaces, candidate structures are developed with remarkable properties. An extreme negative Poisson's ratio of -1 and tunable mechanical multistability are uncovered through theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments thanks to the flexible kirigami geometry. Notably, the structure achieves a maximum volume expansion of up to 488% during auxetic morphing. Furthermore, programmable morphing behaviors are demonstrated through voxelated assemblies of kirigami unit cells with varying geometrical parameters. The novel design strategy presented in this work based on hyperbolic kirigami tessellations opens up new avenues toward auxetic and multistable mechanical metamaterials with broad applications spanning shape-morphing architectures, deployable space structures, and soft machines.},

Here, a base-mediated multicomponent polymerization strategy using readily available elemental sulfur, aromatic diamines, and aromatic dialdehydes is developed to synthesize unprecedented polybenzothiazoles with scalability. By efficient alkaline activation of substrates through nucleophilic sulfurization-cyclization cascades, this method enables economically viable kilogram-scale production in a one-pot process with high yields (73–98%) and monomer universality, including previously incompatible electron-deficient aromatic amines. The resulting polybenzothiazoles unlock their long-overlooked potential in precious metal recovery, demonstrating selective, rapid, and efficient extraction (>99%) of gold (Au), palladium (Pd), and platinum (Pt) from ultra-trace concentrations (1 ppb) to complex matrices including surface water, e-waste, and spent catalyst leachates. Mechanistic studies reveal that the synergistic nitrogen (N)/sulfur (S) participation and π-conjugation in their fused heterocycles govern metal coordination selectivity and redox stability. This work establishes a practical yet versatile platform to advance polybenzothiazoles from synthesis to resource utilization, highlighting their transformative role in addressing critical challenges through adaptive material design and precious metal recovery.},

However, techniques for flexible dual-modal sensors mainly rely on integrating multiple sensing units on a platform, thus inducing extra costs and complexities associated with the fabrication and data processing. In this paper, a flexible dual-modal sensor is presented, which contains only one sensing unit, i.e., single-crystalline silicon-based diode, for the real-time, independent, and continuous monitoring of light and temperature. Operation modes for photodetection and temperature sensing of the flexible dual-modal sensor are switchable by controlling the biased condition. In addition, both experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the crosstalk between light and temperature can be conveniently decoupled by short-circuit current and forward current of silicon-based diodes. Finally, the flexible dual-modal sensor is implemented as a platform to realize the continuous monitoring of photoplethysmography (PPG) and skin temperature of fingertips. These presented results offer paths to the construction of multifunctional, flexible bioelectronic devices or integrated platforms for biomedical uses.},

To explain the difference in attitudes toward AI agents, existing research has primarily focused on environmental factors. However, evolutionary psychology research suggests that the mechanism of outgroup rejection has a genetic basis, highlighting the need to explore the potential genetic underpinnings of negative attitudes toward AI agents as an outgroup in human society. This study examines the genetic basis of negative attitudes toward AI agents and their relationship with related personality traits, using a twin study design to assess negative attitudes toward AI agents, victim sensitivity, and moral preferences. Univariate genetic analyses revealed significant heritability of these negative attitudes. Bivariate analyses further identify shared genetic influences between victim sensitivity and personal-level fear and wariness toward robots. Similarly, a shared genetic basis is observed between the moral preferences concerning authority and sociotechnical blindness anxiety toward AI agents. These findings extend the understanding of social cognition in AI agents by emphasizing the role of genetic factors in shaping attitudes toward them. Moreover, they provide new insights for enhancing public acceptance of AI agents and optimizing human-machine interactions.},

While classical machine learning (CML) approaches have been successful in many domains, their performance degrades in small-sample, nonlinear scenarios. In this work, quantum machine learning (QML) is investigated as an alternative, exploiting quantum kernels to capture intricate correlations from compact datasets. Using only 159 experimental GaN HEMT samples, a quantum kernel-aligned regressor (QKAR) is developed combining a shallow Pauli-Z feature map with a trainable quantum kernel alignment (QKA) layer. All models, including seven baseline CML regressors, are evaluated under a unified PCA-based preprocessing pipeline to ensure a fair comparison. QKAR consistently outperforms classical baselines across multiple metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE), achieving a mean absolute error of 0.338 Ω·mm when validated on experimental data. Noise robustness and generalization are further assessed through cross-validation and new device fabrication. These findings suggest that carefully constructed QML models can provide predictive advantages in data-constrained semiconductor modeling, offering a foundation for practical deployment on near-term quantum hardware. While challenges remain for both QML and CML, this study demonstrates QML's potential as a complementary approach in complex process modeling tasks.},

In this work, a novel superhydrophobic HfO 2 -coated functionalized glass fiber separator is proposed. Characterized by its high dielectric constant, HfO 2 can autonomously generate an oriented electric field under external electric field stimulation, ensuring uniform distribution of the electric field and Zn 2+ flux at the interface. This strategy not only enhances Zn 2+ transport kinetics but also effectively suppresses the migration of SO 4 2− via electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, the HfO 2 @GF separator promotes the deposition of Zn 2+ along the Zn (100) and Zn (002) crystal planes, facilitating the preferential exposure of the unique Zn (101) crystal plane. Additionally, its superhydrophobic property effectively inhibits interfacial side reactions. Therefore, the symmetrical cell exhibits an ultra-long cycling life of 4660 h at 5 mA cm −2 and 1 mAh cm −2 , and maintains stable operation up to 5050 h at 10 mA cm −2 . The Zn||I 2 full battery maintains 87.75% of its initial capacity after 8000 cycles at 10C. Furthermore, the stacked Zn||I 2 pouch battery provides an Ah-level capacity (1.64 Ah).

Among the various proposed mechanisms, increasing attention has been given to a possible electrochemical pathway in recent studies. Here, experimental evidence is reported that CO oxidation at room temperature in electrolytes proceeds via coupled electrochemical CO oxidation and oxygen reduction half-reactions, i.e., the mixed-potential-driven mechanism. A model system is designed with deposited Au nanoparticles (NPs) and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) on carbon paper acting as spatially separated electrodes in a single electrolysis cell. After shorting the two electrodes, the reaction current and mixed potential of the overall CO oxidation are measured without any externally applied bias. Independent current–potential curves for each half-reaction are also obtained under identical experimental conditions. The intersection points of these curves, representing the predicted mixed potential and net current, showed good agreement with the values measured in the short-circuited system. These results provide clear evidence that CO oxidation in aqueous media proceeds via a mixed-potential-driven mechanism, analogous to corrosion. This finding provides strong support for the hypothesis that low-temperature CO oxidation over-supported Au catalysts in the presence of water vapor proceeds via a similar electrochemical pathway in gas-phase heterogeneous catalysis.},

However, their inherent vulnerability related to mechanical damage and electrical breakdown seriously limits their safe and long-term service.

Moreover, LiTFSI ionic liquids are introduced into the healable poly(dimethylsiloxane) to prepare a transparent healable compliant electrode (PHT-IL) that does not obscure the light emission of PHT-ZnS:Cu dielectric elastomer. Then, an integral healable DEA (ISDEA) with an excellent interfacial interaction is constructed by coating two sides of PHT-ZnS:Cu with PHT-IL. The optimized ISDEA displays an actuated strain of 17.0% at 15 kV mm −1 with a healing efficiency of 91.9%. The integrated ISDEAs are used as soft anti-counterfeiting labels and soft intelligent keyboards for information transmission, encryption, and human-machine interaction, showing prospective applications in the realm of data leakage prevention and personal privacy protection.},

  abstract     = {The bottom-up design of chemical structure affords 0D nanocrystals (NCs) with tunable band structures and unexpected optical properties. Herein, an example of alloyed quantum shell (QS) is demonstrated by tailoring the chemical compositions in its core/shell structure. In the CdZnSe/ZnSeS/CdSeS/CdS (C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 , in which C is the CdZnSe core and S represents the shells) structure, there is an intriguing metamorphosis from quantum dot (QD) to QS (that is, C and C/S 1 belong to QDs, meanwhile C/S 1 /S 2 and C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 are in the QS regime). Due to uniform morphology, perfect nanostructure, negligible defects, and unique energy level alignment, the C/S 1 /S 2 /S 3 QS exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 90.9%, an ultra-long fluorescence lifetime of 215.2 ns, and a slow radiative transition rate. It enables QS-based light–emitting diodes (QS-LEDs) with the state-of-the-art performance, such as high external quantum efficiency (EQE of 22.16%) and excellent stability. Meanwhile, the investigation of charge carrier dynamics reveals the difference between the QD- and QS-LEDs, showing that the charge carriers inside the QS-LEDs need more time to recombine with each other. Based on these findings, this study believes that the emerging QSs can be attractive and efficient light–emitting materials used in lighting and displays.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocytes play a crucial role in liver function, with their maturation occurring during postnatal development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this maturation are not yet fully understood. In this study, YTHDC1 is identified as a key positive regulator of hepatocyte maturation and an essential factor in maintaining liver homeostasis. YTHDC1 expression increases in the liver after birth, and hepatocyte-specific deletion of Ythdc1 impairs hepatocyte maturation, leading to reduced liver weight, liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. These defects contribute to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. YTHDC1 supports postnatal hepatocyte maturation and liver function by enhancing the expression of key transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2, at the posttranscriptional level through m 6 A recognition. Restoring FOXA1 or FOXA2 expression mitigates the phenotypic defects observed in Ythdc1 -HKO mice. Mechanistically, YTHDC1 binds to the m 6 A regions of Foxa1 and Foxa2 mRNAs, promoting their expression. These findings reveal a mechanism by which YTHDC1 regulates hepatocyte maturation.},

However, noninvasive monitoring of tau protein secretion, a key biomarker of AD, across developmental stages, age-related variations, and the interaction between apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) and the tau protein axis is not yet accomplished. Here, the label-free and non-invasive detection of multiple tau variants dynamics across developmental stages, age-related variants, and various APOE isogenic genotyes is presented to investigate the APOE –tau axis using human cerebral organoids (hCOs) combined with surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Principal component analysis (PCA) of SERS signals successfully identifies four developmental stages of hCOs: embryonic body, neuronal differentiation, maturation, and maintenance phases. Temporal dynamics of age-related tau protein secretion are observed, reflecting characteristics associated with AD, which are diminished by astrocyte expression. PCA-based dimensionality reduction of SERS signals further reveals distinct clustering for different APOE isogenic genotypes, with tau protein secretion increasing from APOE2/E2 to APOE4/E4 , providing direct insight into the APOE –tau axis in AD. This study introduces a novel method for the non-invasive clinical assessments of disease conditions, dynamics, and the relationship between APOE and tau in AD.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of white adipose tissue (WAT) to brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a promising strategy for obesity treatment. It is previously identified βFaar as a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulator of islet β-cell function in individuals with obesity, but its effect on WAT browning is not well understood. In this study, it is discovered that βFaar expression in adipose tissue markedly decreases with the progression of obesity in both mice and humans. βFaar in adipose tissue reduces lipid droplet (LD) size in WAT and promotes a browning phenotype in inguinal WAT (iWAT), leading to the amelioration of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. These effects can be attributed to crosstalk between βFaar and proteins within the master regulatory pathways of LD formation and WAT browning, including RAS oncogene family 18 (RAB18) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4). Specifically, βFaar inhibits LD swelling by binding to RAB18 and promoting IRF4 nuclear translocation, increases uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) transcription, and further induces iWAT browning by binding to karyopherin subunit alpha 6 (KPNA6). Together, these results demonstrate the critical roles of βFaar in regulating iWAT browning and preserving metabolic health; thus, βFaar may be a potential therapeutic target for management of obesity and related disorders.},

The generation of complex multicellular structures requires the integration of external geometric and mechanical cues with the ability to activate genetic programs that regulate and stimulate cellular self-organization. Here, it is demonstrated that gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels serve as effective matrices for 3D cell culture, supporting both in situ genetic manipulation and cell growth. HEK293T cells embedded in GelMA remained viable and proliferated over 16 days, forming clusters within the matrix. Efficient gene delivery is achieved in the 3D hydrogel environment using both plasmid DNA and mRNA as gene vectors. Furthermore, in situ prime editing is applied to induce permanent genetic modifications in embedded cells. To achieve spatially confined gene expression, gel-embedded channels are introduced that allowed localized stimulation via doxycycline perfusion through a Tet-On system. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating gene delivery, inducible expression, and spatial control within GelMA-based hydrogels, establishing a versatile framework for engineered 3D cell systems with programmable genetic activity.},

However, the precise regulation of H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas remains a challenge, especially through simple and feasible methodologies. In this work, a novel composite electrocatalyst, copper-indium/black phosphorus ( CuIn/BP ) is developed, using a simple one-step co-reduction method for efficient CO 2 RR. It is found for the first time that there is a linear relationship between BP content in CuIn/BP and the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas. Consequently, the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas can be precisely tailored by simply adjusting the BP content in CuIn/BP . A total faradaic efficiency (FE) of CO and H 2 reached ≈ 100% along with a current density of 135.2 mA cm −2 . Mechanistic studies suggest that the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species are in situ generated in CuIn/BP , where the CuIn phases mainly contribute to CO generation, while the Cu 3 P species promote H 2 formation. The variation in BP content modulates the proportion of the CuIn phase and Cu 3 P species, leading to the variations in H 2 /CO molar ratios. Thus, this study provides an efficient and simple strategy to tailor the H 2 /CO molar ratio in syngas for various industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Green hydrogen, produced via renewable-energy-driven water electrolysis, is among the most promising new energy carriers. Ru is a potential catalyst for this purpose; however, its strong hydrogen binding strength results in poor reaction kinetics, limiting its application potential. Creating a new Ru structure by introducing a second element is crucial for optimizing its catalytic performance. However, only a few studies have explored this approach, leaving the understanding of how chemical composition influences Ru's structure and catalytic activity elusive. Here, a systematic study is reported on Si decoration of Ru, achieving a tunable local environment around Ru and optimized reaction kinetics. By constructing a Ru-SiO x interleaved Turing-patterned structure, the ratio of Si coordinated to Ru is tuned by well-designed selective etching. With increasing Si content, the H-binding strength on the Ru center is progressively weakened, resulting in a V-shaped trend in hydrogen production activity. The optimized sample exhibits a low overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm −2 in alkaline solution, along with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec −1 , surpassing the performance of commercial Pt/C. This study establishes a valuable framework for optimizing the surface properties and catalytic activity of noble metals.},

Typically, the various rate constants are obtained by numerically fitting of the photoluminescence (PL) decay, but it is overlooked whether or not the solution of such a fit is unique. Using an analytical model, it is demonstrated that for typical TADF emitters only the sum of k S and k ISC , and the sum of k T and k rISC can be uniquely obtained from the transient PL decay and PL quantum yield (PLQY) experiments. Depending whether nonradiative losses stem from singlets or triplets, various combinations of k T and k rISC , k S and k ISC can be used to obtain the same transient PL decay, while keeping the PLQY constant. The only exception is the case of unity PLQY that allows for a direct determination of all relevant kinetic rates from just a single transient PL measurement. It is further shown that additional PL measurements in oxygen atmosphere with complete triplet quenching are redundant, since the results can be explicitly predicted from PL measurements in inert atmosphere. Using the TADF emitter CzDBA with a PLQY as high as 90% as a model system, it is demonstrated that by a combination of PL decay, PLQY, and OLED device modeling it is possible to quantify all the individual kinetic rates. For CzDBA neat film with PLQY as high as 90%, the majority of nonradiative losses stems from triplets, showing it is vital to conduct comprehensive studies on the molecular origin of nonradiative losses in the future.},

However, achieving uniform and stable coverage of the textured silicon substrate with hole-selective layer (HSL) remains a significant challenge. Herein, a HSL material, DPAICz ((indolo[2,3-a]carbazole-11,12-diylbis(ethane-2,1-diyl))bis(phosphonic acid)), is reported specifically designed for textured silicon substrate. Compared to the typical HSL material 2PACz, DPAICz features a π-expanded conjugated core and multiple anchoring groups, forming a split-standing configuration with anchoring groups positioned on opposite sides, resulting in superior anchoring stability on textured substrate under external stimuli. Moreover, DPAICz exhibited a larger molecular dipole moment and a more pronounced p-type characteristic, enhancing the interfacial hole extraction efficiency. Consequently, wide-bandgap (1.68 eV) perovskite solar cells employing DPAICz as the HSL achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.42%. Introducing the DPAICz into monolithic silicon/perovskite tandem solar cells greatly improved their performance, achieving a remarkable PCE of 32.55% in 1 cm 2 area. Importantly, the unencapsulated tandems based on DPAICz exhibited significantly enhanced long-term operational stability, retaining 96% of its initial PCE after 880 h of continuous 1-sun light soaking at 45 °C under open-circuit condition.},

Solid-state memristive devices, such as crossbar arrays and percolated nanoparticle (NP) networks, already demonstrate these properties. However, closer similarity to neural networks is expected from liquid-state systems, including polymer melts, which remain largely unexplored. Here, the resistive switching in silver/poly(ethylene glycol) (Ag/PEG) nanofluids, prepared by depositing gas-aggregated Ag NPs into PEGs of varying molecular mass, is investigated. These systems form long-range conductive NP bridges with reconfigurable resistance states in response to an electric field. The zeta-potential of Ag NPs and molecular mobility of PEG determine the prevalence of low resistance (ohmic) state, high resistance states (poor conductance) or intermediate transition states governed by space-charge-limited conduction or electron tunneling. The occurrence of these states is given by the interparticle gaps, which are determined by the conformation of PEG molecules adsorbed on the NPs. It is presented, for the first time, an equivalent circuit model for the Ag/PEG system. These findings pave the way to adopt polymer melts as matrices for neuromorphic engineering and bio-inspired electronics.},

Understanding the structure-property relationship is essential for the realization of their use in spintronic, valleytronic, and optoelectronic applications. Herein, after the high pressure-temperature synthesis of 3R-MoS 2 in a large volume cubic press, a concomitant experimental and theoretical high-pressure study of 3R-MoS 2 is reported, leading to the discovery of pressure-induced reversible isostructural phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Concurrent with the isostructural transitions, a semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed, owing to strong interlayer interaction and charge redistribution across the van der Waals gap under pressure. The pressure-induced enhancement of interlayer interactions together with the robust intrinsic layer stacking in 3R-MoS 2 prevent the layers from sliding under pressure and hinder a corresponding volume collapse.

  abstract     = {Integrating surface and bulk heterogeneity enables synergistic optimization of implantable biomaterials, harmonizing surface-tissue interactions with the mechanical integrity of the bulk. However, achieving this heterogeneity within a single material remains a significant challenge. Here, a strategy to engineer spontaneously generated heterogeneous surface and bulk structures within a material is introduced. The resulting material is termed phase-separation and underwater reconfiguration-enhanced (PURE) elastomers. PURE elastomers integrate the high elasticity of the bulk with superior immunocompatibility at the surface. By de novo designing the immunomodulatory and alkyl acrylate monomer structures, this is regulated that the copolymer's spatial configurations, ultimately influencing its condensed structure. Tuning the alkyl side chain length facilitates the formation of a distinctive phase-separation pattern in elastomers that accommodates large deformations, resulting in excellent toughness and low hysteresis. Moreover, this phase structure supports a water-induced surface phase reconfiguration, aligning with in vivo applications. This reconfiguration enriches immunomodulatory groups at the material surface, significantly enhancing immunocompatibility. Consequently, these elastomers exhibit extremely low fibrotic capsule formation for up to one year in mice and two months in non-human primates. This findings introduce a class of durable, fibrosis-resistant materials and establish a new strategy for designing heterogeneous polymeric elastomers with broad biomedical applicability.},

However, accurately classifying cells based on the parental origin of the inactivated X chromosome in single-cell samples remains challenging. Here we present FemXpress, a computational tool leveraging X-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to group cells based on the origin of the inactivated X chromosome in female single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data. FemXpress performs robustly on both simulated and real datasets, without requiring parental genomic information, and can also identify genes that escape XCI. Applying FemXpress to single-cell RNA-Seq data from multiple tissues of a cynomolgus monkey, we reveal heterogeneity in XCI origin across organs and cell types. In each organ, we identify candidate XCI-escaping genes, and within each cell type, we observe gene expression differences associated with XCI origin, potentially contributing to phenotypic variability. Furthermore, FemXpress demonstrated strong performance in phasing XCI in scRNA-Seq datasets from embryos and colon tumors. In summary, FemXpress provides a powerful approach for XCI status analysis, offering new insights into XCI dynamics at single-cell resolution.},

  abstract     = {Ceramic aerogels are acclaimed as ideal materials for extreme environments due to their ultrahigh porosity, low density, and exceptional thermal stability. However, the practical application of traditional ceramic aerogels is constrained by their inherent mechanical brittleness. Herein, a strategy is proposed to customize mechanically tunable aerogels by armoring ceramic nanounits with pyrolytic carbon (PyC). The PyC encapsulating layers with various thicknesses are transformed into ductile tights or rigid armors, facilitating the mechanical customization of BN@PyC aerogel from superelasticity to rigidity across scales. Interestingly, the PyC armor imparts unique versatility to the aerogel, including flame retardancy, elastic response conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, owing to the thermal stability of the PyC armor, the BN@PyC aerogel maintains its mechanical integrity even after high-temperature thermal treatment, and exhibits an unexpected resistance to butane torch ablation. Integrating mechanical stability, high-temperature resistance, and multifunctionality, BN@PyC aerogels offer new possibilities for scalable applications in extreme environments. This facile strategy of armoring brittle ceramic aerogels with PyC provides a novel reference for customizing the mechanical properties of multifunctional aerogels.},

This study presents an innovative ionogel-based rain energy harvester that overcomes these limitations. The key advancement lies in the stable polarized interface created by the ionogel, which enables rapid charging and high charge retention, leading to a significant instantaneous power within the first few raindrops and achieving an 8-fold increase in saturation performance over conventional design. The harvester only requires 25 droplets to reach saturation and maximum electrical output, achieving an impressive power density of 235.11 W m −2 and a conversion efficiency of 6.77%, being the highest recorded for ionogel and hydrogel-based droplet energy harvesters. Additionally, the adhesive nature of the ionogel enhances the device's stability and versatility in varying energy generation and steam leakage applications.

Here, it is reported that downregulation of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15B) significantly correlated with poor outcomes in patients with KRAS mut -PDAC. Mechanistically, KRAS mut /ERK1-elicited phosphorylation of ABHD17C promotes depalmitoylation and membrane-to–cytoplasm translocation of ALOX15B, facilitating proteasome-dependent degradation of ALOX15B via interaction with the E3 ligase complex CUL4/DDB1/DCAF10. Notably, treatment with methyl protodioscin (MPD), a steroid saponin primarily purified from polygonatum sibiricum rhizome, restored the S-palmitoylation and membrane location of ALOX15B via disruption of the ABHD17C/ALOX15B interaction, consequently resulting in significant inhibition of growth rate of patient-derived KRAS mut -PDAC organoids in vitro and KRAS mut -PDAC-formed tumor in vivo via induction of ferroptosis. Therefore, these findings unveil a prominent role of ferroptosis evasion in KRAS mut -PDAC progression and highlight the potential of targeting KRAS/ERK1/ABHD17C/ALOX15B axis in KRAS mut -PDAC treatment.},

Therefore, a transpiration-driven electrokinetic power generator (TEPG) based on silk yarn coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/divinyl sulfone (DVS) and designed as a wearable hydrovoltaic nanogenerator offering outstanding power generation efficiency and water stability is presented in this study.

Furthermore, the covalent crosslinking agent, DVS, is introduced to sustain the long-term, high-power production efficiency of PEDOT:PSS. The devised yarn-type TEPG system generates a maximum power of 112 µW cm −3 with artificial sweat. A system comprising 25 yarn-type TEPGs arranged in a series–parallel configuration is implemented utilizing the high spatial-efficiency of the sewable yarn-type TEPG.

While possessing monotonic resistance-strain behavior is a fundamental requirement for any material used for strain sensing, polymer nanocomposites frequently exhibit nonmonotonic resistance responses under strain, which limits their application prospects. In this study, physical experiments and molecular dynamics simulations are performed to determine a feasible solution to overcome this limitation. The corresponding results demonstrate that regulating the initial inter-nanofiller junction geometry imparts complete control over the monotonic piezoresistive behavior of polymer nanocomposites. Mechanistically, monotonically increasing resistance responses under tension can be achieved by promoting active diffusion that causes van der Waals force-driven barrier crossing of nanofillers (resulting in direct contact between nanofillers, e.g., at elevated curing temperatures) during curing; thus, during deformation, nanofillers primarily move away from one another. Conversely, suppressing diffusion during curing causes barrier crossing of nanofillers, which results in resistance reduction, under deformation owing to stress-driven local rearrangement of polymer molecules in heterogeneous shear transformation zones. The mechanistic insights provided by this study can guide the design of next-generation, advanced strain-sensing materials in the future.},

Notably, in the Arabidopsis genome, H2Aub and H3K27me3 marks do not always co-localize, and some regions are marked exclusively by H2Aub, but the contribution of these only-H2Aub regions to chromatin looping remains largely unexplored. By using Capture-High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (C-Hi-C) to specifically enrich interactions associated with H2Aub regions, it is find that H2Aub loops are preferentially established between two H2Aub enriched regions. Although pure only-H2Aub-loops can be detected, H2Aub regions tend to interact with regions marked by both H2Aub and H3K27me3, contributing to the formation of PcG hubs.

Without confirming the identifiability of these parameters, model predictions may be unreliable, limiting their usefulness for understanding biological mechanisms or informing experimental and clinical decisions. In this paper, a novel mathematical framework is proposed for practical identifiability analysis in dynamic models. Starting from a rigorous mathematical definition, it is proved that practical identifiability is equivalent to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability is further established, introducing an efficient metric that simplifies and accelerates identifiability assessment compared to traditional profile likelihood methods. To address non-identifiable parameters, new regularization terms are incorporated, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. Additionally, an optimal experimental design algorithm is developed to ensure all parameters are practically identifiable from collected data. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and biological models demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.},

This study introduces AntiBMPNN, an advanced deep-learning framework that leverages an antibody-specific 3D dataset, a fine-tuned message-passing neural network (MPNN), a frequency-based scoring function, and AlphaFold 3 to achieve highly accurate antibody sequence design. AntiBMPNN surpasses ProteinMPNN with a perplexity of 1.5 and over 80% sequence recovery. Its scoring function, combined with AlphaFold 3, effectively prioritizes sequences based on structural recovery, positional stability, and biochemical or complex properties. Experimental validation highlights a 75% success rate in single-point antibody design. AntiBMPNN consistently outperforms AbMPNN, AntiFold, and ProteinMPNN in designing complementarity determining regions (CDR) 1-3, yielding stronger binding affinities. For CDR1 of huJ3 (anti-HIV nanobody), it achieves a half maximal effective concentration (EC₅₀) of 9.2 nM (nanomolar), better than ProteinMPNN (135.2 nM) and AntiFold (59.3 nM), and comparable to AbMPNN (6.6 nM).

The creation and control of pore size and interconnectivity can be conveniently achieved with aqueous two-phase emulsions. The decomposition of these emulsions into two separate phases can be controlled by carefully choosing the polymer components and solution conditions. Spinodal decomposition, a mechanism of phase separation, can result in a highly interconnected pore morphology, though controlling this process is difficult in practice, limiting its application for in vitro models. Here, a straightforward method is introduced for dynamically halting the phase separation of a gelatin methacryloyl and poly(vinyl alcohol) (GelMA-PVA) polymer blend in the context of a biofabrication process based on dynamic interface printing (DIP). This is enabled by a novel approach based on the concerted application of acoustic mixing and photocuring to structure the pore size, orientation, and interconnectivity in hydrogels. This approach accordingly enables spatially addressable fabrication of 3D hydrogel architectures, with the potential to enhance the functionality of engineered tissues via tailored microenvironments.},

  abstract     = {Food-grade lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) have been widely used as functional carriers of various nutrients and clinical drugs; however, the potential for FLNs to induce substantial biological effects is often overlooked. Here, it is found that FLNs are first delivered to the early endosomes and then preferentially fused with lipid droplets (LDs) after entering the cells through endocytosis. This process leads to a notable LDs accumulation, which in turn triggers autophagy via the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. The cascade ultimately promotes tumor cell growth and invasion. However, autophagy inhibition while FLNs treatment counteracts these effects and further causes mitochondria damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and excessive LDs accumulation, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. This indicates a potential anti-tumor strategy. The animal tests further demonstrate that intratumoral injection of FLNs together with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis without harming normal cells in mice, confirming a promising and safe anti-tumor strategy of applying FLNs under autophagy inhibition conditions. The findings represent a substantial step forward in comprehending the biological effects of biomedical carriers.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic changes occurring in the lung microbiota can impact the initiation, progression, and prognosis of lung cancer (LC). Consequently, the development of suitable intratumoral microbiota analysis methods is crucial. Although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) involves straightforward operations and provides precise results, the “direct smear method” limits the identification of bacterial subspecies. Furthermore, the issue of inadequate quantification with MALDI MS renders it unsuitable for direct analysis of intratumoral bacteria. To address these challenges, a novel ionic liquid in this study is employed, called norharmane conjugated to 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Nor@DHB) for the direct detection of intratumoral bacteria using MALDI MS. Because gram-negative bacteria are dominant within cancer cells, lipid A is selected as the chemical fingerprint for bacterial identification. The results demonstrated that using Nor@DHB can enhance the lipid A signal by an order of magnitude and achieved a good linear relationship within a concentration range of 0.01–80 ng mL −1 . Here, this method is successfully applied to the direct analysis of lipid A in actual clinical samples. Subsequent machine learning and nomogram models further confirmed the correlation between characteristic lipid A ions and LC patient clinicopathological features, which are further validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments.},

Renal fibrosis represents the final pathological outcome of most chronic kidney disease, particularly DKD. This study demonstrates elevated levels of Galectin-3 (Gal3), a lectin associated with inflammatory and fibrotic conditions, in the plasma and kidneys of DKD mice. Positive correlations between Gal3 expression and renal fibrosis are observed in both DKD patients and mice. Macrophage-derived Gal3 is found to promote Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1) signaling activation and renal fibrogenesis. Genetic ablation of Gal3 globally or specifically in macrophages, as well as pharmacological inhibition of Gal3, significantly attenuated kidney fibrosis in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, macrophage-derived Gal3 interacted with TGFβ receptor2 (TGFBR2) and Pro-TGFβ1, preventing TGFBR2 proteasomal degradation in fibroblasts and increasing TGFβ1 levels in the diabetic kidney. These events enhances TGFβ1 signaling activation and ultimately facilitated kidney fibrosis. The findings of this study suggest Gal3 as a potential therapeutic target for renal fibrosis and DKD.},

  abstract     = {Protein kinases often rely on docking site motifs to enhance substrate interactions and facilitate phosphorylation. For example, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) utilize D- and F-motifs, which frequently act in concert to enable bipartite substrate binding. While these motifs are known to modulate phosphorylation efficiency, their quantitative impact on target site phosphorylation within long intrinsically disordered substrates remains largely unexplored. Using NMR spectroscopy, JNK1-dependent phosphorylation of JIP1, a 450-amino acid disordered substrate, is investigated, identifying eleven phosphosites with distinct phosphorylation efficiencies. By selectively disrupting JNK1 binding to the D- and F-motifs of JIP1, the determinants of phosphorylation efficiency are uncovered. Specifically, it is found that the D-motif selectively enhances phosphorylation in the C-terminal direction in a length-dependent manner, impressively increasing the phosphorylation efficiencies of sites located at sequence distances exceeding 120 amino acids, while the F-motif primarily promotes phosphorylation of a site located immediately N-terminal to the F-motif. Additionally, docking-site-independent phosphorylation is observed, whose efficiency is dictated by the intrinsic sequence preference of JNK1, as inferred from motif scores derived from positional scanning peptide arrays. The work highlights how docking site motifs and sequence context synergistically regulate phosphorylation efficiency, emphasizing the critical role of substrate architecture in determining MAPK-mediated signaling outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Despite significant advances in the synthesis of biomimetic materials, the scalable fabrication of high-performance bulk materials under ambient conditions remains a formidable challenge— particularly when it comes to achieving rapid processing while preserving superior mechanical properties. Herein, inspired by nacre's “brick-and-mortar” structure, this work develops an energy-efficient approach that utilizes ice-templating technology as the structure framework and carbon mineralization for rapid CaCO 3 production, resulting in a strong yet tough carbon mineralized material (CMM) while also fixing CO 2 . This material replicates both the hierarchical microstructure and chemical composition of nacre. By precisely controlling the freezing dynamics with dual temperature gradients, this work creates an ordered lamellar skeleton composed of γ-dicalcium silicate (γ-C 2 S). The rapid, in situ carbon mineralization under mild conditions generates interspersed CaCO 3 grains within this structure, which are then infiltrated with gelatin to form a nacre-like CMM with exceptional mechanical properties. The resulting material exhibits a flexural strength of 45 MPa (eight times that of a cement-hydrogel composite) and a fracture toughness of 2.03 MJ m −3 (a 20-fold improvement over unmodified CMM), while maintaining a density of only 1.2 g cm −3 . The enhanced performance stems from multiscale toughening mechanisms, including crack deflection, secondary crack formation, and strong interfacial bonding, all of which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing high-performance synthetic materials through the synergistic integration of biomimetic principles with carbon mineralization, offering promising applications in the development of sustainable infrastructure and carbon neutrality.},

  abstract     = {Effective management of postoperative pain and wound healing presents significant challenges in clinical settings, driving the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. The analgesic and wound healing effects of hydrogen (H 2 ) have gradually been recognized; however, the lack of efficient hydrogen delivery systems remains a major limitation. This study introduces a novel transdermal drug delivery system, which utilizes sustained-release photothermal microneedles (MNs) to ameliorate incisional pain and accelerate wound healing. Polydopamine (PDA)-modified ZIF-8@ammonia borane (AB) nanoparticles with photothermal conversion properties are designed, along with temperature-responsive QX-314-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) microspheres for controlled release, which are delivered in vivo by dissolvable MNs. In vitro results showed that PDA@ZIF-8@AB nanoparticles can release H 2 continuously for up to 5 days in an acidic microenvironment, while the photothermal properties of PDA facilitated controlled release of QX-314 through 6 cycles of near-infrared (NIR) exposure. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the MN system provided sustained analgesia for up to 5 days and promoted wound healing in the acidic microenvironment of postoperative incisions. Upon NIR exposure, the photothermal conversion of PDA activated membrane ion channels and induced thermally triggered deformation of PCL@QX-314 microspheres, allowing for on-demand release of QX-314 and targeted neuronal uptake, thus offering personalized analgesia. In vitro cell experiments and in vivo studies confirmed the biocompatibility of the system. This innovative approach not only highlights the dual role of H 2 in pain relief and wound healing but also provides a new personalized treatment strategy for postoperative pain management with promising clinical applications.},

  abstract     = {Radiotherapy-radiodynamic therapy (RT-RDT) has emerged as a promising approach due to its remarkable anticancer efficacy. However, hypoxic tumor microenvironment and insufficient energy deposition severely reduce the radiotherapy outcomes. Herein, lonidamine (LND)-loaded Fe(III) metal-Pt(II) porphyrin framework (FPTM-LP) is designed for radiosensitization through hypoxia alleviation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplification. Specifically, the high-Z element Pt effectively absorbs X-ray photons to generate •OH for RT while transferring X-ray energy to porphyrin (TCPP), which stimulates the generation of 1 O 2 for RDT. Moreover, by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, the weak acidity and glutathione (GSH)-responsive release of LND achieves O 2 economization, which promotes the generation of ROS and stabilizes DNA damage. Intriguingly, Pt(II)TCPP exhibits the capability of O 2 concentration-dependent near infrared luminescence imaging-guided RT-RDT. Moreover, the decomposition of FPTM-LP under high concentration of GSH generates large amounts of Fe 2+ , leading to the augmented production of •OH via Fenton reactions. In brief, this work presents a radiosensitizer with a unique and efficient mechanism of self-monitoring hypoxia alleviation and increasing ROS levels for enhanced cancer RT-RDT. The radiosensitization potency of FPTM-LP is confirmed in tumor-bearing mice in vivo, proclaiming a new strategy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.},

Optoelectronic property analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the enhanced photodynamic antimicrobial properties of CDs@ZIF-8 can be attributed to their narrow bandgap and higher binding affinity for O 2 , which facilitates the photo-generated e − –h + pairs separation and promotes the generation of 1 O 2 and •O 2 − . Furthermore, the CDs@ZIF-8/polycaprolactone/ethyl cellulose nanofibrous films are prepared by microfluidic-blow-spinning, which have prominent antimicrobial properties and extend the shelf life of strawberries from 6 to 12 d.

Although the precise etiology of this disease is still under debate, a Midichloria-like organism (MLO) is suspected as the triggering agent. RMS provokes characteristic skin lesions. Previous investigations pointed to a local immune response characterized by a B cell influx. To elaborate on these findings, here, this study extensively characterizes systemic and local B cell responses in RMS-affected fish. The local influx of IgM+ B cells to the skin lesions is confirmed, and a differentiation of these B cells to plasma-like cells is demonstrated. IgM repertoires suggested a polyclonal activation of local B cells and some trafficking between skin and head kidney. Finally, the fact that transcripts of the gene coding for MLO 16S rRNA are found in sorted skin IgM + B cells and non-IgM + skin leukocytes reveals the capacity of this intracellular bacterium to be internalized by B cells, where it may possibly directly interfere with intracellular pathways. The data significantly advances the knowledge on RMS and provides another example of a fish pathology in which fish B cells seem pivotal, possibly because of the specific ways in which teleost B cells intrinsically sense and respond to pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Obesity is increasingly recognized as a negative prognostic factor for cancers, including osteosarcoma. However, the mechanisms linking obesity to chemoresistance in osteosarcoma remain unclear. This study found obesity is significantly associated with poor responses to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients. In vitro, adipocyte-conditioned medium (Adi-CM) induced cisplatin resistance, while peritumoral adipocytes and diet-induced obesity (DIO) reduce the cisplatin efficacy in vivo. Mechanistically, Adi-CM enhanced DNA repair by the PARP1/ATM pathway activation. Proteomic analysis identified A1BG, a secreted protein upregulated in adipocytes from chemoresistant patients, as a key mediator of this effect. A1BG depletion in adipocytes restored cisplatin sensitivity, whereas recombinant A1BG enhanced resistance and promoted DNA repair. Further investigation revealed a direct interaction between A1BG and NAMPT, leading to the stabilization of NAMPT and an increased NAD + production. This enhanced PARP1 activity and subsequent DNA repair. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of NAMPT and PARP1 using FK886 and Olaparib, respectively, reversed Adi-CM-induced cisplatin resistance and restored cisplatin sensitivity in osteosarcoma cells, DIO mouse models, and patient-derived organoids. A novel link between obesity and cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma is established, highlighting the A1BG/NAMPT/PARP1 axis as a critical driver. Targeting this axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming obesity-associated chemoresistance in osteosarcoma.},

  abstract     = {Endothelial dysfunction and abnormal activation of the monocyte-macrophage system form a critical loop in atherosclerosis. The role of migrasomes in endothelial-immune interactions remains unclear. This study explores migrasome evolution in the atherosclerotic (AS) microenvironment, highlighting their function as amplifiers in the inflammatory cascade. Through analysis of ApoE −/- mouse models and single-cell multi-omics data, migrasome activity is mapped using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) algorithms. Co-culture systems and anti-Cluster of differentiation 74 (CD74) blocking experiments are employed to investigate immune-metabolic reprogramming triggered by migrasome cargo signaling. Advanced imaging and functional studies demonstrated that the interaction between amyloid protein precursor (APP) ligands on endothelial cells and CD74 receptors on macrophages triggers endothelial cells to produce more migrasomes. The clinical relevance of these findings is confirmed through CD74 blocking experiments, which effectively disrupted migrasome-mediated signaling and attenuated atherosclerotic progression. Importantly, migrasome content is positively correlated with the severity of atherosclerosis. These results fundamentally challenge existing paradigms of intercellular communication by establishing migrasomes as dual-functional entities – serving both as biomarkers of endothelial stress and molecular drivers of immune microenvironment deterioration. The discovery of the “migrasome-APP-CD74” signaling network opens new avenues for developing organelle-targeted therapies to interrupt the vicious cycle of vascular inflammation.},

BInD, a diffusion model with knowledge-based guidance, is introduced to address this limitation by co-generating molecules and their interactions with a target protein. This approach ensures balanced consideration of key objectives, including target-specific interactions, molecular properties, and local geometry. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that BInD achieves robust performance across all objectives, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) is a key transcriptional regulator involved in the development of various cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the mechanisms regulating ID1 ubiquitination in ESCC are not well understood. This study identifies TRIM21 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets ID1 for K11-linked ubiquitination at lysine 91. Unlike typical ubiquitination that marks proteins for degradation, TRIM21-mediated K11 ubiquitination does not affect ID1 stability. Instead, it disrupts the ID1-TCF12 interaction, releasing TCF12 to activate SLC31A1, a copper transporter. Elevated SLC31A1 expression increases intracellular copper, inducing cuproptosis and inhibiting ESCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Functional assays show that overexpressing TRIM21 suppresses ESCC progression, while TRIM21 knockdown promotes growth. Clinically, low TRIM21 expression correlates with advanced disease stage and poorer patient survival rate, underscoring its prognostic value. Additionally, Sorafenib treatment upregulates TRIM21, enhancing ID1 ubiquitination, increasing SLC31A1 expression, and inducing cuproptosis. These findings uncover the TRIM21-ID1-TCF12-SLC31A1 axis as a critical pathway in ESCC progression, suggesting that targeting this axis with Sorafenib can offer a promising therapeutic strategy for inhibiting tumor growth and improving patient outcomes.},

This study conducted a comprehensive prognostic meta-analysis involving 2,968 patients with diffuse glioma and established a comprehensive machine learning framework with nested resampling of 18 machine learning algorithms, and developed the Immune Glioma Survival Signature (IGLoS). This signature, comprising CCL19, ICOSLG, IL11, PTGES, TNFAIP3, and TRAF3IP3, has been demonstrated to predict survival outcomes across a range of cancers and to correlate with tumor progression at the level of multi-omics. It is noteworthy that the IGLoS score enables precise patient stratification for personalized cancer treatments and elucidates pivotal resistance mechanisms to immunotherapy. Furthermore, siRNA screening has underscored the critical role of TRAF3IP3 in modulating PDL1 expression and immune pathways, with implications on the ERK pathway and NFATC2 involvement. Through single-cell analysis of published and in-house datasets, TRAF3IP3 exhibited selective enrichment in NPC-like and MES-like tumor cells, and showed a dual functionality in mediating T-Cell Exhaustion. Targeting TRAF3IP3 emerges as a promising avenue to combat immunotherapy resistance, particularly in glioma, thus paving the way for precision medicine.},

  abstract     = {Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is one of the significant characteristics of poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), strongly associated with high mortality rates. Immunotherapy has emerged as a crucial treatment modality for OSCC LNM, yet its limited response rate severely restricts its clinical application. Cuproptosis, a newly discovered immunogenic cell death (ICD), is often hindered by lipid metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells, which also contributes significantly to the lack of response to immunotherapy. Herein, a metal-organic framework (MOF) nanodrug loaded with orlistat (ORL) is developed, designated as ORL@Cu-MOF. This nanodrug is designed to respond and release under the high glutathione (GSH) stimulus of the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby inducing cuproptosis and suppressing fatty acid metabolism in OSCC cells. In vivo, ORL@Cu-MOF effectively triggers cuproptosis and inhibits fatty acid metabolism, exerting antitumor effects in mouse models and remodeling the TME. Furthermore, the combination of ORL@Cu-MOF with programmed death receptor-1 (αPD-1) significantly enhances immunotherapy outcomes, transforming “cold tumors” into “hot tumors”. This study is the first to report the synergistic use of cuproptosis induction and fatty acid metabolism suppression in the treatment of metastatic cancer, offering novel insights for the care and management of LNM of OSCC.},

  abstract     = {Optimizing the morphology of the active layer is crucial for achieving high photovoltaic conversion efficiency in all-polymer solar cells (APSCs). Solvent vapor annealing (SVA) is an essential post-treatment strategy for controlling active layer morphology. However, most current SVA are conducted ex situ, limiting their ability to accurately reveal the morphological evolution of active layers of APSCs. In this study, in situ synchrotron radiation GIWAXS and in situ UV–vis spectroscopy combined with GISAXS is used to monitor the morphological evolution of PM6/PY-IT blends during the SVA process in real-time. Results showed that the PY-IT absorption peak exhibited a red shift under a nonpolar carbon disulfide vapor, while a blue shift is observed during the SVA process with a polar chloroform vapor. The SVA process can be divided into three stages: solvent swelling, recrystallization, and molecular rearrangement. For thermally pre-annealed samples subjected to chloroform SVA, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increased by 15.1%. The improved PCE stems from reduced crystal plane spacing (d-spacing), enhanced crystal coherence length, and optimal phase separation via SVA. Pre-annealing suppresses excessive swelling, emphasizing the reordering dynamical role in the morphology of APSCs. This study offers insights into balancing SVA conditions to maximize performance and minimize adverse effects.},

  abstract     = {Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) results from a breakdown in the symbiotic relationship between the intestinal commensal microflora and the mucosal immune system. Non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis , a common human colon symbiote, has been shown to alleviate colitis. However, the underlying mechanisms of this alleviation remain incompletely understood. Herein, it is demonstrated that promoting the secretion of B. fragilis outer membrane vesicles (Bf OMVs+ ) enhances its ability to alleviate dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, while inhibiting B. fragilis OMV secretion (Bf OMVs− ) reduces this effect. Bf OMVs+ alleviates colitis by inhibiting neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. Further, B. fragilis OMVs (Bf-OMVs) are isolated and extracted, then administered them intraperitoneally to DSS-induced colitis mice, observing that Bf-OMVs can target intestinal tissues, the spleen, and bone marrow, and they are internalized by neutrophils to inhibit NET formation, thereby alleviating colitis. The expression profile of miRNAs in Bf-OMVs is assessed, revealing that Bf-OMVs are enriched with mmu-miR-like sRNA, miR-5119, which targets and inhibits PD-L1, leading to the suppression of GSDMD-mediated NET release and promoting the proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), culminating in the alleviation of colitis. These findings provide new insights into the role of B. fragilis OMVs in the pathogenesis and treatment of IBD.},

Despite its potential relevance, the role of this interaction in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains unexplored due to the lack of effective molecular tools. To address this, we employed SRiApt, an aptamer generated through the recently established Blocker-SELEX pipeline. Its biological stability is improved by phosphorothioate modifications to form PT f -SRiApt. Using this aptamer, the critical role of the SCAF4-POLR2A interaction in driving TNBC tumor growth and immune regulation is uncovered. PT f -SRiApt effectively inhibits tumor growth and induces cell cycle arrest in TNBC cells with elevated SCAF4 and POLR2A expression. Additionally, PT f -SRiApt promotes premature mRNA termination, boosting antigen presentation and promoting T-cell infiltration. Analysis of patient samples further confirmed the negative correlation between SCAF4-POLR2A interaction and the effectiveness of immunotherapy, highlighting the potential of PT f -SRiApt in improving immune efficacy. Together, the work provides a powerful tool not only for dissecting previously “undruggable” protein-protein interactions but also for enhancing tumor immunogenicity and reshaping the tumor microenvironment.},

Activation of nociceptors in acute inflammatory pain (AIP) significantly reduced sleep by 45–50% in the first 6 h, with reduced sleep spindle density for 1–3 h post-AIP. Additionally, an “optogenetic pain (Opto-Pain)” model is implemented to produce acute peripheral pain-induced awakenings that reduced sleep comparable to AIP. Both pain models are used to test the role of wake-promoting neurons in the parabrachial nucleus that express Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (PBel CGRP ) in relaying nociceptive stimulus from the dorsal horn as part of the spine-ponto-amygdaloid tract. Blocking PBel CGRP neurons with genetic ablation or optogenetic inhibition attenuated sleep loss. To dissect the PBel CGRP pathways, the terminals are then optogenetically silenced post-AIP and found the reversal of sleep disturbances in the following descending order of effectiveness: substantia innominata of the basal forebrain (SI-BF) > central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) > bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) > the lateral hypothalamus (LH). In SI-BF and CeA, a similar reversal of AIP-induced sleep loss occurred with pharmacological blocking of either CGRP or NMDA receptors.

This study explores how TNTs facilitate the transfer of tumor-derived materials, particularly fatty acids, to TAMs, affecting macrophage polarization and function. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified heterogeneous macrophage subpopulations in the TME. Enrichment analysis pinpointed key substances transferred via TNTs. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyzed the fatty acids involved. In vitro and in vivo experiments validated TNTs-mediated material transfer, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the associated signaling pathways. TNTs are the primary route for transferring tumor-derived fatty acids, notably arachidonic acid (AA), to macrophages. This transfer reprogrammed TAMs from anti-tumor CD5L + to pro-tumor TREM2 + phenotypes, increasing CCL18 secretion, reducing phagocytic activity, and impairing CD8 + T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, AA activated the PI3K-AKT pathway, driving TAMs polarization. These findings are confirmed in xenograft models, where TNTs-induced TAMs exhibited enhanced pro-tumor properties. TNTs-mediated transfer of tumor-derived AA reprograms TAMs via PI3K-AKT activation, promoting immune suppression and tumor progression, highlighting TNTs and PI3K-AKT as potential therapeutic targets in iCCA.},

  abstract     = {Pulmonary vascular remodeling, which current therapeutic targets fail to alleviate disease severity, plays a key role in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Irisin is identified as a protective factor involved in regulating inflammation and oxidative stress, but its role in PAH remains unknown. To investigate, plasma irisin levels and its local pulmonary artery expression are measured in patients with PAH and mouse models. Irisin expression is significantly decreased in patients with PAH and PAH mouse models. Furthermore, overexpression and exogenous injection of irisin effectively alleviate hemodynamic and right-heart function in PAH mouse models, meanwhile, it also reverses proliferation and cell cycle progression of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). To illustrate the mechanism of irisin exerts on PAH, Enolase 1 is identified as a key irisin-interacting protein. Irisin suppresses proliferation of PDGF-induced PASMCs by promoting ubiquitination status of Enolase 1 via E3 ligase of down regulated protein 4 in neural precursor cell development. Co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking analyses verifies the interaction and binding sites between irisin and its interactive proteins. Overall, these findings suggest that, irisin is a novel protective factor downregulated in PAH. By ubiquitination, irisin promotes Enolase 1 degradation and suppresses cell proliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria in changing environments rely on motility and sensory mechanisms to locate optimal conditions. This process depends on specialized chemoreceptors to sense environmental stimuli. Exceptionally high numbers of chemoreceptor genes are present in magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), which combine magnetic alignment via intracellular magnetic nanoparticles (magnetosomes) and oxygen sensing for a unique navigation strategy toward low-oxygen zones, called magneto-aerotaxis. However, chemoreceptors for aerotaxis in MTB have not been experimentally identified. This study examines chemoreceptors in the model MTB Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense . Gene deletion analysis shows that M. gryphiswaldens e relies on a complex and partly redundant set of chemoreceptors to sense oxygen. Within this diverse repertoire of chemoreceptors, a receptor formed by two interacting proteins is identified that plays a key role in aerotaxis. Interaction assays and microscopy confirm that both proteins interact within polar-lateral regions in the cell. Moreover, genetic, biochemical, and motility experiments demonstrate that the chemoreceptor complex promotes a cellular response away from oxygen via the redox cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), independent of magnetic fields. These findings provide first insights into how MTB control oxygen sensing at the molecular level, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying bacterial navigation and highly complex chemosensory systems.},

Early infiltration of macrophages predicts the adverse outcome of grafts, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Significant infiltration of M1 macrophages and upregulation of Rictor in macrophages are observed in ABMR allografts. Deficiency of Rictor in macrophages exacerbates histological injury and shortens the survival of ABMR allografts by promoting macrophage M1 polarization. Additionally, loss of Rictor in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages facilitates NLRP3 inflammasome activation through activating NF-κB. Mechanistically, Rictor upregulates E3 ubiquitin ligase SOCS1 to enhance K48-linked ubiquitination of p65, thereby suppressing macrophage M1 polarization. Taken together, Rictor ameliorates acute ABMR following kidney transplantation by suppressing macrophage M1 polarization through the p65-NLRP3 axis and may serve as a therapeutic target for ABMR.},

High levels of TAMs contribute to tumor progression and antiangiogenic therapy resistance. Therefore, intensive study of the regulatory mechanisms of TAMs recruitment during tumor development is important for the discovery of new antitumor and antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies. Here, we found that in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ENH levels positively correlated with microvessel density and TAMs infiltration. Further exploration revealed that ENH promoted LUAD angiogenesis and growth by stimulating TAMs recruitment and M2 polarization. Mechanistically, ENH in LUAD induced YAP nuclear aggregation to promote CCL5 transcription, thereby increasing monocyte chemotaxis and ultimately increasing TAMs infiltration and M2 polarization. Besides, we found that ENH interacted with YAP through LIM domains, which significantly triggered the formation of YAP-KPNA2 complexes. Consequently, YAP is imported into the nucleus by KPNA2 and then promoted CCL5 transcription. Notably, ENH knockdown also significantly increased the chemosensitivity. Together, ENH functions in LUAD cells to mediate macrophage infiltration and M2 polarization, which in turn promotes tumor angiogenesis and growth, and targeting ENH offers a promising target for antiangiogenic therapy through immune modulation.},

  abstract     = {Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains a therapeutic challenge due to its aggressive nature and limited response to immunotherapy. This study identifies lactate-induced histone lactylation as a novel epigenetic mechanism in SCLC, contributing to immune escape and poor therapeutic outcomes. By identifying the LDH-H3K18La-Nur77 axis, new insights into the metabolic regulation of immune responses in SCLC are offered. Multi-omics analysis, including metabolomics and TCR sequencing, is used to compare serum samples and immune cell profiles from SCLC patients. Data from Shanzhong cohort (n = 222), along with a validation cohort from the IMpower133 study (n = 264), demonstrates that LDH levels are associated with poorer outcomes following immunotherapy. ChIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays reveal that lactate-induced histone lactylation at H3K18La induces transcriptional activation of Nur77 in naïve CD8 + T cells, leading to tonic TCR signaling, which impairs antigen recognition and prevents effective anti-tumor activity. In preclinical SCLC models, lactate inhibition reduces Nur77 expression, restores T cell function, and enhances the efficacy of PD-1 blockade, leading to a decreased tumor burden and improved survival. This study uncovers a novel mechanism of immune escape in SCLC through lactate-driven histone lactylation and provides the first evidence that targeting lactate metabolism can enhance immunotherapy effectiveness.},

However, the factors that trigger the abnormal activation of fibroblasts in PF are still not well understood. Using proteomics and single-cell sequencing dataset screening, extra accumulation of Cathepsin K (CTSK) is detected in the periphery as well as in fibroblasts in the lungs of PF mouse models. Addition of recombinant CTSK (rCTSK) aggravates collagen accumulation and PF progression in bleomycin-induced PF mice. Mechanically, CTSK underwent endocytosis through interaction with sorting nexin 9 (SNX9), which is engaged in TGF-β1 induced SMAD3 activation for downstream glutaminase 1 (GLS1) upregulation and glutamine enrichment. In turn, extra glutamine increases collagen synthesis in fibroblasts. More significantly, serum CTSK levels positively correlated with glutamine levels and poor prognosis in patients with PF. Thus, the results identify CTSK as a novel regulator of fibroblast activation that remodels glutamine metabolism and promotes collagen synthesis during PF pathogenesis. The correlation between peripheral CTSK and glutamine levels implies its future feasibility in the prediction and prevention of PF progression.},

  abstract     = {Noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy based on embryonic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released in spent embryo culture media (SECM) has brought hope in selecting embryos that are most likely to implant and grow into healthy babies during assisted reproduction. However, maternal DNA contamination in SECM significantly hampers the reliability of embryonic chromosome ploidy profiles, leading to false negative results, particularly at high contamination levels. Here, we present DECENT ( de ep c opy number variation (CNV) r e co n s t ruction), a deep learning method to reconstruct embryonic CNVs and mitigate maternal contamination in SECM from single-cell methylation sequencing of cfDNA. DECENT integrates sequence features and methylation patterns by combining convolution modules, long-short memory, and attention mechanisms to infer the origin of cfDNA reads. The benchmarking study demonstrated DECENT's ability to estimate contamination proportions and restore embryonic chromosome aneuploidies in samples with varying contamination levels. In contaminated SECM clinical samples, including one with more than 80% maternal reads, DECENT achieved consistent CNV recovery with invasive tests. Overall, DECENT contributes to enhancing the diagnostic accuracy and effectiveness of cfDNA-based noninvasive preimplantation genetic testing, establishing a robust groundwork for its extensive clinical utilization in the field of reproductive medicine.},

Structured light enables spatial control of beams, offering new opportunities for underwater sensing, imaging, and signal transmission. However, compact and robust water-immersed photonic devices remain challenging to realize. Among various approaches, dielectric metasurfaces are particularly promising for underwater optics due to their flat form factor and subwavelength phase control. Nevertheless, current platforms suffer from instability in liquids, incomplete phase modulation, or strong sensitivity to fabrication imperfections. Here, ultrathin water-immersed metasurfaces composed of gallium phosphide (GaP) Huygens’ integrated resonance units (HIRUs) operating in the visible regime are demonstrated. By leveraging the high refractive index and low optical loss of GaP, and integrating both forward and inverse design strategies, metasurfaces with planar geometry (≈1/5 of the operating wavelength), enhanced fabrication tolerance, and stable in-liquid operation are realized. These metasurfaces generate various structured light beams in water, including abruptly autofocusing (AAF) beams, Bessel beams, optical vortices, and Gaussian focusing beams. This work establishes a scalable and reliable platform for underwater nanophotonics and emerging IoUT-related applications.},

Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) are vital for tendon repair, with their stemness crucial to healing outcomes. This study investigated the role of CD248 in regulating TSPC stemness and assessed the therapeutic potential of si-CD248-loaded liposomes in promoting tendon-bone healing under osteoporotic conditions. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified increased TSPC populations, particularly a unique subcluster, TSPC-0, with elevated CD248 expression in osteoporotic tendon samples. CD248 + TSPCs displayed reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and impaired migration, driven by altered FAK-JAK-STAT1 signaling. si-CD248-loaded liposomes were formulated and characterized, demonstrating efficacy in inhibiting CD248 expression, restoring TSPC stemness, and promoting tendon-bone healing. In osteoporotic mice, liposome treatment significantly enhanced tissue regeneration, improving histological scores, collagen organization, and biomechanical properties. This study reveals that elevated CD248 expression negatively impacts TSPC stemness and impairs healing under osteoporotic conditions. Targeting CD248 using si-CD248-loaded liposomes effectively restores TSPC regenerative potential, representing a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance tendon-bone healing in osteoporotic patients.},

  abstract     = {Porcine extended potential stem cells (pEPSCs), which exhibit both self-renewal and pluripotency, are promising for application in both agricultural biotechnology and regenerative medicine. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these two interconnected properties remain elusive. Here, two types of CRISPR-Cas9 screenings are conducted in pEPSCs. This fitness screening identified several genes essential for cell viability, including PRMT1 , MYBL2 , and NASP . Concurrently, FACS-based screenings revealed genes crucial for pluripotency, such as SOX2 , ZFP42 , and FOXH1 . Notably, it is demonstrated that FOXH1 is required for maintaining pluripotency in pEPSCs, which complements the understanding of its role in mesendoderm specification. pEPSCs lacking FOXH1 exhibited a flatter and more dispersed clonal morphology, accompanied by downregulation of pluripotency genes and upregulation of lineage-specific genes. Additionally, FOXH1 knockdown significantly impaired blastocyst formation during early pig embryogenesis. Functionally, the dual role of FOXH1 in pluripotency maintenance and cell differentiation is validated: FOXH1 preserves pluripotency by enhancing chromatin accessibility at pluripotency gene loci, while also influencing lineage specification through H3K4me3 modification at developmental related genes. Thus, these findings uncover a novel role of FOXH1 involved in the core regulatory network that orchestrates gene expression programs to maintain the pluripotency state of pEPSCs and provide valuable insights into categorizing gene function.},

  abstract     = {Most patients with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) may initially experience high-frequency hearing loss linked to greater vulnerability of outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlear basal turn. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this susceptibility in the high-frequency region remains unclear. Here, NOX2 is first identified as a differentially expressed gene related to oxidative damage in the apical and basal turns through single-cell RNA sequencing. In mouse cochleae damaged by neomycin and noise, Nox2-positive OHCs increase progressively from the apex to base, indicating that NOX2 expression clearly differed significantly between the apical and basal OHCs. In NOX2 knockout mice, OHC damage caused by neomycin and noise exposure is significantly reduced. Furthermore, knocking out NOX2 increases the expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and Nrf2 nuclear translocation in OHCs. In addition, Nrf2 inhibitors counteract the protective effect of NOX2 knockout against neomycin. Finally, when Nox2 is used as the target, ginsenoside Rg1 is identified as a compound with protective effects against neomycin-induced hearing loss. In summary, these results indicate NOX2 is highly correlated with high-frequency OHCs vulnerability in the cochlea and is a potential intervention target for the clinical treatment of SNHL.},

However, monitoring the sodiation process in the hard carbon electrode during cycling and understanding the sodiation mechanism remain challenging. This article reports on operando 2D scanning small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) and ex situ 3D SAXS tomography of hard carbon electrodes during the sodiation process. Structural changes are monitored with spatial and temporal resolution during the electrochemical process and shows that sodiation through micropore filling is the more dominating mechanism in the later stages of sodiation, i.e. in the plateau region of the voltage profile, while intercalation occurs continuously. Spatial inhomogeneities are resolved over the electrode and reveal an increased level of inhomogeneity at higher degree of sodiation with regions of different degrees of micropore filling. Resolving the processes spatially shows that plating starts at the interface between the electrode and the current collector where also a high degree of micropore filling and formation of pseudo-metallic sodium is found. The work demonstrates how SWAXS imaging can contribute to understanding the sodiation of hard carbon anodes, not only by spatially resolved analysis, but as a method to decouple contributions from different components in a cell, enabling more accurate scattering analysis in in situ environments.},

  abstract     = {Cobalt-free LiNi 0.5 Mn 1.5 O 4 (LNMO) has recently emerged as a highly promising cathode material owing to its benefits of a high operating voltage platform (≈4.7 V vs Li), high theoretical energy density (≈650 Wh kg −1 ), eco-friendliness, and resource abundance. However, it has also demonstrated low cycle and poor rate performances. Researchers have hitherto identified multiple LNMO failure and degradation mechanisms, including the Jahn-Teller effect, Transition Metal (TM) dissolution, electrolyte decomposition, and Oxygen Vacancies (OVs). The Jahn-Teller effect causes structural material degradation, while TM dissolution could lead to the loss of reactive species and interfacial side reactions. On the other hand, OVs and electrolyte decomposition accelerate capacity decay. Notably, deeply understanding LNMO structural failure mechanisms and the targeting of corresponding modifications presents a vital avenue for modulating its surface-interface structure and improving its electrochemical performance. Although researchers have extensively investigated the failure mechanisms of LNMO to elucidate its modification strategies, a comprehensive and detailed summary of the latest research advancements has yet to be provided. In this work, the research background, encompassing the advantages and disadvantages of LNMO cathode materials, is first introduced. The crystal structure and discharge mechanisms, among other fundamental principles of LNMO, are subsequently analyzed. Finally, recent research findings on the aforementioned failure mechanisms in high-voltage spinel LNMO are synthesized. Subsequently, a critical assessment of recent advancements in modification strategies targeting the failure mechanisms of LNMO is performed, encompassing the tools employed (e.g., doping modification, surface coating, morphology and size management, and surface orientation management) as well as their synergistic effects. Finally, potential future research directions to guide the rational design of high-performance LNMO, particularly manganese-based spinel cathode material, are proposed.},

  abstract     = {To address global challenges in sustainable energy and water treatment, metamaterials have emerged as a transformative class of materials for solar-driven photocatalysis. Through nanoscale engineering, these artificially structured materials enable precise manipulation of light–matter interactions and significantly enhance solar energy utilization beyond the limits of conventional photocatalysts. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in applying metamaterials to solar-driven processes for energy conversion and water treatment, including photocatalytic CO 2 reduction, water splitting for hydrogen generation, degradation of organic pollutants, and solar-driven water evaporation for purification. Key enhancement mechanisms include localized surface plasmon resonance, photonic bandgap engineering, and improved charge separation via metamaterial and semiconductor heterojunctions, which collectively improve light absorption, charge separation and transfer, and surface reactivity. Practical challenges related to scalable fabrication, long-term durability, and integration into real-world systems are also examined. Finally, emerging directions, including AI-assisted inverse design, structural chirality, and multifunctional hybrid architectures, are discussed as promising strategies to further advance metamaterial-based photocatalysts in sustainable energy and environmental applications.},

This review first establishes a comprehensive understanding of zinc degradation mechanisms, revealing how ion transport, solvation dynamics, and electrical double layer structure collectively determine interfacial stability. The fundamental properties and protective mechanisms of biomass-derived materials are systematically analyzed, focusing on four key functional groups: carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl, and sulfonic acid. Through examining their roles in regulating critical interfacial processes, quantitative structure-function relationships are established that reveal optimal interface protection requires balanced binding energies rather than maximizing individual interactions. More significantly, it is demonstrated that spatial distribution and synergistic effects among multiple functional groups enable superior interface regulation beyond simple additive benefits. These molecular-level insights transform empirical additive selection into rational design principles. Critical challenges in mechanistic understanding, scalability, and standardization are identified, proposing strategic directions for advancing zinc-based energy storage technologies.},

Herein, a nano-electro-platform is shown that enables non-invasive screening of aggressive cell subpopulations from heterogeneous tumor samples. Single-cell sequencing further reveals immune evasion pathways associated with their aggressive behavior. Targeting the screened aggressive cells, the platform implements a unique nanopore-focused electric field, which genetically remodels the cells to generate extracellular vesicles (EVs) with significantly enhanced tumor-targeting and therapeutic capabilities. The engineered EVs effectively activate macrophages and T cells, leading to robust tumor cell elimination and metastasis inhibition in lung cancer metastasis models.

Although these therapies show promise in arresting disease progression and improving vision, intraocular implant-based therapies can cause unexpected complications that require further surgery due to implant dislocation or uncontrolled drug release. These frequent complications of intraocular drug implants can be overcome using magnetically controllable degradable milliscale swimmers (MDMS) with a double-helix body morphology. A biodegradable hydrogel, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, is employed as the primary 3D printing material of MDMS, and it is magnetized by decorating it with biocompatible polydopamine-encapsulated iron-platinum nanoparticles. MDMS have comparable dimensions to commercial intraocular implants that achieve translational motions in both aqueous and vitreous bodies. They can be imaged in real-time using optical coherence tomography, ultrasound, and photoacoustic imaging. Thanks to their biodegradable hydrogel-based structure, they can be loaded with anti-inflammatory drug molecules and release the medications without disrupting retinal epithelial viability and barrier function, and decrease proinflammatory cytokine release significantly. These magnetically controllable swimmers, which degrade in a couple of months, can be used for less invasive and more precise intraocular drug delivery compared to commercial intraocular drug implants.},

Emerging evidence have implicated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a multifaceted role in the progression of cardiac hypertrophy and HF. Here, it is identified that a lncRNA forkhead box O6, opposite strand (Foxo6os) is significantly downregulated in murine HF model induced using transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Knockdown of Foxo6os accelerates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, reflects as elevated expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and myosin heavy chain 7 (MYH7). Conversely, Foxo6os overexpression can improve cardiac function and alleviate adverse cardiac remodeling. Mechanistically, Foxo6os directly interacts with myosin-binding protein-C (MYBPC3), which then recruits protein kinase C alpha (PKC-α) to facilitate MYBPC3 phosphorylation, resulting in maintaining myocardial contractility and postponing HF progression. Therefore, these findings underscore the critical role of Foxo6os in preserving cardiomyocyte contractile function, suggesting a potential for Foxo6os as a novel therapeutic target of HF.},

  abstract     = {Flexible lithium metal batteries (LMBs) using polymer-based solid-state electrolytes (PSSEs) are highly desirable for wearable applications because of the potential advantages in energy density and safety. Recently, ether-based polyelectrolytes have received extensive attention because of their good stability, high ionic conductivity, and Li metal anode compatibility. However, it typically forms organic-rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) at the cathode, which is still a pain point that impedes the high-voltage performance. To address this challenge, herein a fluorinated plasticizer, bis(2-fluoroethyl) ether (BFE) is reported, which can be easily blended into ether-based PSSE and enables high-voltage-stable flexible LMBs. The BFE and PSSE molecules form an atypical hydrogen bond interaction, which weakens the interaction between PSSE and lithium ions. This leads to the formation of an anion-rich solvation structure that generates inorganic-rich and high-voltage-stable CEI. The oxidation stability of PSSE is improved from 4.4 V to over 4.7 V after introducing the BFE molecules. LMBs using BFE-blended PSSE can couple with high-voltage cathode and retain 80% capacity after 480 cycles at 1C. Full cells show high energy density (752.2 Wh L −1 ) outstanding capacity retention per cycle (99.88%), and high flexibility with almost identic charge/discharge characteristics after 4000 bending cycles.},

  abstract     = {Traditional biomaterial design often prioritizes empirical knowledge over disease mechanisms and pathological dynamics, resulting in imprecise solutions in complex clinical conditions. Age-related osteoporosis (A-OP) is a disease associated with aging, characterized by a dysfunctional pathological microenvironment that hinders the osseointegration of conventional titanium implants. To develop a targeted titanium implant for A-OP, rat single-cell transcriptomics is integrated with human serum-derived transcriptome data to investigate dynamic changes in skeletal stem cells (SSCs) during aging, which guided the implant design. These findings reveal that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) within SSCs interact via a feedback loop: HSCs undergo premature senescence, leading to depletion of HSCs and secondary senescence of MSCs. Senescent MSCs exhibit adipogenic bias, perpetuating the pathological cycle of A-OP. Using core genes identified in the transcriptome analyses, resveratrol is selected and utilized it and a GelMA-chitosan hydrogel to decorate titanium implants for localized delivery. In the A-OP microenvironment, the hydrogel enables sustained responsive release of resveratrol, which reverses MSC senescence and redirects differentiation from adipogenic to osteogenic lineages, thereby breaking the pathological cycle. This multi-omics-driven implant design enhances precision and offers a novel methodology for biomaterial development.},

However, inorganic aerogels suffer from brittleness and poor processability, whereas their organic counterparts experience high production costs and inadequate elastic recovery. This study used a dual-template (ice and bubble) strategy to fabricate ultralight, superelastic aerogels with hierarchical porosity inspired by stress-dissipating dome architectures. Microbubbles are engineered via a modified “Tessari method” to create macropores (≈100 µm) while ice-templating introduced aligned pores of a few µm in size during freeze-drying. The synergistic interplay of a rigid gelatine (Ge) skeleton, flexible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nodes, and potassium salt-enhanced crystalline domains yielded aerogels with exceptional elasticity, ultralow density and thermal conductivity. Flame retardancy is achieved through potassium salt-mediated catalytic carbonization, reducing the peak heat release rate by 54% and enabling self-extinguishing behavior. Microbubble introduction in precursors can provide macropores for aerogels, which dispersed internal stress during the deformation of aerogel, whereas dynamic hydrogen bonds enabled rapid water-assisted self-healing ability and closed-loop recyclability. Scalable production using commercial compressed air foaming systems and a low raw material cost further highlight its industrial viability. Combined with biodegradability and superior thermal insulation, this work advances sustainable, fire-safe aerogels for multifunctional applications.},

The Janus hydrogel exhibits stable spatiotemporal layering, adaptable degradation, asymmetrical combination of network structures, and mechanical strength. The dense phase, with space maintenance capacity, completely covers the defective area, continuously blocking fibroblast infiltration, and preventing bacterial adhesion. In addition, the loose phase is shape-adapted to the defective cavity, allowing osteoblast-associated cells to migrate and create a favorable osteogenic microenvironment. In situ implantation of this Janus hydrogel effectively promoted osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in both mouse calvarial and rat periodontal bone defect models. Furthermore, the osteogenic efficiency achieved by the Janus hydrogel implanted in mouse calvarial defects and rat periodontal defects is increased by 42% and 13.7%, respectively, as compared with previous studies.

While the endocrine system is crucial in modulating wound repair, the critical hormone receptors orchestrating tissue-layer-specific responses are unidentified. Here, bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and in vivo/in vitro analyses in mouse models of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, as well as wound and skin organoid models, are employed to identify the thyroid hormone receptor Thra as a key regulator of phase-coupled regeneration through two distinct yet coordinated mechanisms. In the initial phase, epidermal Thra activates glutathione metabolism via Gamma-Glutamylcyclotransferase (GGCT), driving keratin filament assembly to accelerate reepithelialization. In the subsequent phase, dermal Thra mediates the Serum Amyloid A3 (SAA3)-Fibronectin 1 (FN1) interaction, establishing angiogenic niches essential for matrix maturation. Using the self-assembled epidermis-dermis dynamic skin organoid model, Thra's role in simulating the wound healing process is further confirmed. This study highlights the essential role of spatiotemporal adaptability in wound repair using Thra as a paradigm and provides insights for developing clinical strategies to enhance skin wound healing.},

However, considerable bystander editing significantly compromise its accuracy. Point mutagenesis, a powerful approach for gradient-tuning protein function, facilitates the generation of diverse plant phenotypes to meet the demands of complex environments and consumer preferences. Here, a series of plant base editors is engineered by fusing three optimized TadA8e variants, TadA9, TadA-LM, and TadA-dual, with a PAM-flexible SpRY nickase (SpRYn, with 5′-NNN PAM recognition). These editors enable A-to-G, C-to-T, and dual-base (simultaneous A-to-G and C-to-T) conversions within a highly condensed active window (1–3 nucleotides). Performance evaluations reveal that the TadDBE (TadA Dual-Base Editor) achieves the most robust outcomes, delivering dual-base editing efficiencies ranging from 2.3% to 61.4%, while maintaining minimal off-target activity. Utilizing TadDBE, targeted point mutagenesis is performed on OsBadh2 , a gene encoding betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase that plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP), a key aromatic compound. This approach yields rice lines exhibiting gradient-tuned aromatic profiles and optimized levels of 2-AP and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

  abstract     = {The cyano group is extensively employed in the molecular engineering of high-performance small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs) to fine-tune energy levels and optimize molecular packing. To date, the application of cyano group has predominantly been confined to end-group modification in SMAs, with limited investigation in central unit engineering. Herein, in this work, the role of cyano substitution is systematically investigated in the central unit of SMAs and design a novel cyano-functionalized wide-bandgap acceptor UF-BCN. The introduction of the cyano group significantly enhances the surface energy of the molecule and substantially deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level due to its strong electron-withdrawing capability, then leading to a blue-shifted absorption. When introduced as the third component in the D18:BTP-eC9, UF-BCN demonstrates complementary light absorption, strong intermolecular interactions, and excellent compatibility with BTP-eC9 to form a mixed acceptor phase, enabling it to function as an effective morphological modulator within the ternary system. Consequently, the ternary OSC based on D18:BTP-eC9:UF-BCN achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.34%. This study underscores the effectiveness of cyano substitution in central unit engineering and highlights its potential for optimizing active layer morphology and enhancing the performance of ternary OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Peptide hormones are essential signaling molecules in plants, playing critical roles in regulating growth and development, stress responses, and crop genetic improvement. However, the full extent of their functions, functional redundancy among different peptide hormones, signaling mechanisms between ligand and receptor pathways, and peptide hormones-mediated regulation of plant development and environmental adaptability are still not fully understood. In this study, recent advances in understanding the formation and functions of plant peptide hormones, distinguishing between non-secretory and secretory peptides and their respective physiological roles are reviewed. These peptide hormones interact intricately with receptor kinases to regulate multiple signal transduction pathways. Plant peptide hormones are involved in cell proliferation and differentiation within both shoot apical and root apical meristems, as well as in the development of various organs. They also play a central role in plant reproduction, particularly in coordinating male-female gametophyte interactions for successful fertilization. Furthermore, plant peptide hormones contribute to abiotic stress responses and immune responses against biotic stresses. An overview of the multifaceted roles of plant peptide hormones in growth, development, and environmental adaptability, emphasizing their importance in plant biology are presented. Understanding the complex functions of these peptide hormones lays the foundation for developing strategies to enhance crop resilience and productivity.},

This patterned surface demonstrates a 20-fold increase in cell-repellent effectiveness against immune cells such as macrophages and fibroblasts due to disturbance of focal adhesion. Furthermore, the cell-repellent interface can also be patterned on the sub-micron electrode layer without compromising its electrical and electrochemical performance. When the electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor applying the cell-repellent interface is implanted into a rat subcutaneous tissue, inflammation and fibrotic reactions are effectively suppressed for 6 weeks.

MGPT constructs a heterogeneous graph network using different entity pairs as nodes and utilizes self-supervised contrastive learning of sub-graphs in pre-training. For downstream tasks, MGPT employs learnable functional prompts, embedded with task-specific knowledge, to enable robust performance across a range of tasks.

However, tracing the formation and evolution of unstable intermediates remains challenging. Here, electrochemiluminescence (ECL) analysis and imaging technique are developed to in situ monitor the important intermediate hydrogen peroxide intermediate (OOH*) on transition-metal-based 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM─TCNQ) metal–organic framework materials as OER catalysts. Thanks to the highly selective ECL probe L-012 to OOH*, the ECL signal evolution (e.g., onset ECL potential and maximal ECL intensity) is bridged with the generation and accumulation of OOH*, allowing for convenient and quick judgment to the rate-determining step of OER. Due to the spatial and temporal resolution of ECL microscopy, it is found that the phase I of Cu─TCNQ shows better catalytic activity. The COMSOL simulation also shows the heterogeneous current distribution during the OER reaction, in agreement with ECL imaging results. Finally, the ECL approach enables to compare the OER performance of three TM─TCNQ, well explaining the free energy profiles for different reaction intermediates. Therefore, the proposed ECL analysis and microscopy provide an alternative way to understand the detailed elemental steps in OER, thus further indicating the direction for high-performance catalysts.},

Recently, machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) and generative models have shown promise in accelerating TS search, but their comparative strengths and limitations remain unclear. In this study, the first systematic and rigorous benchmarking framework is established to evaluate the effectiveness of ML methods in TS search, enabling a standardized and application-relevant assessment of their performance. Using an end-to-end TS search workflow, seven representative MLIPs are benchmarked alongside React-OT, a state-of-the-art generative model. These results demonstrate that pre-trained foundation MLIPs frequently fall short in reliably localizing TSs without task-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, traditional energy and force metrics alone do not reliably predict TS search success, underscoring the need for more tailored evaluation criteria. Notably, with the same graph neural network architecture, React-OT frequently outperforms its MLIP counterpart, highlighting the potential of generative approaches for TS discovery. This benchmark serves as a critical foundation for the development and evaluation of future ML methods in chemical reactions, offering guidance for improving their generalizability and reliability in reactive chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of spatial transcriptomics has provided a critical data foundation for the high-resolution characterization of tissue spatial domains. Traditional methods for spatial domain identification primarily rely on gene expression data from sampled spots in low-resolution spatial transcriptomic data, often overlooking valuable information between spots that can be crucial for domain identification. Furthermore, these methods are limited by their focus on gene expression data from neighboring spots, without fully integrating prior knowledge of cell types within the tissue's spatial structure. To address these challenges, SGCD, a novel method for tissue spatial domain identification based on data interpolation and cell type deconvolution is proposed. SGCD utilizes interpolation techniques to estimate gene expression data for cells in the gaps between spots and applies deconvolution to extract cell type information from both spots and interstitial regions. By integrating gene expression, cell type, and spatial location data, SGCD achieves accurate delineation of complex spatial domains through graph contrastive learning. Evaluations on various publicly available datasets, including the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, mouse brain, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer, demonstrate that SGCD significantly outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and detail, offering strong support for advancing the understanding of tissue functions and disease mechanisms.},

Two subtypes emerged with distinct recurrence risks: Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (adjusted HR = 2.75 for recurrence, 95% CI 1.42–5.33, P = 0.003). Cluster 2’s high recurrence risk was validated in three external cohorts (adjusted HRs: 1.76, 4.33, and 3.09; all P < 0.05). Radiogenomic analysis revealed Cluster 2 showed a higher frequency of VHL mutations and KDM5C mutations compared to Cluster 1, a more immunosuppressive microenvironment (reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration, P < 0.01; suppressed interferon signaling pathways, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis P < 0.05), and lower PD-L1 expression.

This study proposes a colored thermal engineering glass fabricated through a simple annealing process, where Ag nanoparticles are formed on a TiO 2 film and an Ag layer. The structure of Ag layers can be easily controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature, allowing for systematic tuning of the optical efficiencies in the visible and long-wave infrared regions. Consequently, thermal management devices can selectively function as either a photothermal heater or a radiative cooler, depending on the morphology of Ag layers. In particular, the photothermal device can function as an anti-fogging solution for structural designs without requiring external energy. Furthermore, the stacked metal-insulator-metal structure induces plasmonic resonance phenomena, producing visible colors that range from vivid to dull hues. The tunable color variations enhance the suitability of the thermal management device for a wide range of architectural applications.},

  abstract     = {Bandgap engineering is a critical tool for tailoring the electronic properties of functional materials, traditionally achieved by modifying the cation sublattice. Here, a generalizable strategy is introduced that leverages facile anion-lattice doping in high entropy materials to modulate the bandgap in high-entropy metal oxides (HEMOs). By incorporating nitrogen into a single-phase high-entropy metal oxide/nitride (HEMO:HEMN) solid solution, a substantial bandgap reduction is achieved from 3.55 eV (HEMO) to ≈2.46 eV (HEMO:HEMN), significantly enhancing electronic conductivity. Unlike conventional bandgap tuning approaches that rely on cation substitution or heterojunction formation, this method exploits anion-mediated entropy stabilization, enabling uniform bandgap narrowing across the entire solid solution. This anion-lattice engineering strategy is broadly applicable to high-entropy systems, providing a new pathway for designing energy materials with tailored electronic properties. The resulting HEMO:HEMN solid solution exhibits a tenfold increase in capacitance and capacity compared to HEMO in supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery tests, demonstrating the transformative potential of anion-driven bandgap modulation for next-generation energy storage and conversion technologies.},

  abstract     = {Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) have been developed to mimic metalloenzymes by modulating their coordination environment. However, the impact of the coordination geometry at the metal center on the catalytic activity of the SAzymes, particularly those with nonplanar active site configurations, has been minimally explored. Here, the effects of the geometric configuration of the Zn–N 4 active sites on the catalytic activity of the carbonic anhydrase (CA)-mimetic SAzymes are reported. CA-mimetic SAzymes with Zn–N 4 active sites in tetrahedral, distorted tetrahedral, and square-planar configurations are prepared by simple temperature-controlled carbonization of ZIF-8. The SAzyme with the distorted tetrahedral Zn–N 4 configuration displays superior catalytic CO 2 hydration activity, attributed to increased Lewis acidity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a pronounced Zn–OH affinity and localized electron accumulation at the distorted tetrahedral Zn site. These results demonstrate the critical role of precise geometric tuning in enhancing SAzyme efficacy and can be used to facilitate potential avenues for optimizing metal active centers in enzyme mimetics.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-oxygen (Li-O 2 ) batteries offer immense promise for next-generation energy storage technology due to their ultra-high theoretical energy density. However, their adoption faces challenges like large overpotential and slow oxygen reaction kinetics. This study introduces a novel strategy that leverages custom-designed magnetic nanocatalysts and external magnetic fields to boost electrochemical performance. Mn-Co-Fe oxide catalysts with adjustable magnetic properties is developed and demonstrated the correlation between the magnetism of the catalysts and the enhancement of battery performance. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the paramagnetic oxygen molecules experience a Kelvin force, while the Li + ions are influenced by a Lorentz force. This accelerates their diffusion, significantly enhancing the kinetics of both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. The catalyst with the highest magnetization boosted specific capacity by 52.9% (from 8143 to 12 455 mAh g⁻¹) and significantly lowered the overpotential. This breakthrough underscores magnetic field-driven catalysis as a crucial advancement in unlocking the full potential of Li-O 2 batteries, setting new benchmarks for energy storage technology.},

Advances in medical research have led to innovative strategies to combat these conditions, with biomaterials emerging as a promising platform for targeted drug delivery. Various biomaterials—including nanoparticles such as liposomes, polymers, hybrid systems, dendritic polymers, gold nanoparticles, mesoporous silica, calcium carbonate, and exosomes—exhibit excellent biocompatibility. These materials protect therapeutic agents from nuclease degradation, stabilize drug carriers, and enhance cellular uptake via mechanisms such as endocytosis. Chemical modifications further improve biomaterials by facilitating endosomal escape and conjugation with targeting ligands, thereby enabling precise delivery to specific cells or tissues. As a therapeutic modality, mRNA offers high biosafety, notable controllability, efficient translation, and immunomodulatory properties. This review evaluates the impact of lung structure on drug absorption, examines delivery mechanisms associated with various biomaterial types, and presents application examples.

  abstract     = {Pulmonary fibrosis resulting from recurrent lung inflammation due to pathogen infection may lead to serious problems and death. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), consisting of DNAs and proteins released by neutrophils in response to infection, are major pathogenesis factors for pathogen-associated pulmonary fibrosis. By mimicking nucleic acid hydrolase, polymeric artificial DNases bearing imidazole units (PEG-PIm) are developed to degrade the DNAs and thus deconstruct NETs, inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis. By tailoring the PIm segments with varied imidazole units, the polymer hydrolase with a defined number of imidazole units outperforms other samples in the cleavage of DNAs and inhibits the transition of pulmonary fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. This polymer digests the DNAs complexed with cationic peptides, unlike natural DNase I. By aerosol inhalation, it reduces NET infiltration in lungs and significantly alleviates inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the optimized polymer may expose more effective imidazole units to the DNA backbones and thus enhance the affinity and hydrolysis of phosphodiester linkages. The function is also confirmed by systematic administration of PEG-PIm to rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, a strategy is provided for treating pulmonary fibrosis that can be applied in a pandemic to reduce high mortality because of pathogen infection.},

These disorders are often associated with disruptions in neurotransmitter regulation, leading to progressive cognitive and motor impairments. Conventional diagnostic methods are time-consuming and lack the sensitivity required for early-stage detection. Herein, for the first time a novel photoresponsive nanozyme sensor array is presented that integrates metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and machine learning algorithms for the rapid, sensitive, and multiplexed detection of neurotransmitters. Wherein, Zn(II) meso-Tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (ZnTCPP) -based MOFs, with their large specific surface area, enhance the interaction between reactant substrates and catalytic active sites within the material, significantly improving response sensitivity. Additionally, light-driven catalysis greatly accelerates the response speed of the nanozyme. Mimicking the mammalian olfactory system, the array responds to various neurotransmitters in a patterned manner, enabling accurate differentiation and quantification within minutes. It maintains high precision even in complex biological samples such as serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The biomimetic sensor can detect neurotransmitter signatures linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. This platform offers significant potential for early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of neurological conditions.},

Yet, the current preparation methods pose challenges: they are either inefficient for continuous production or involve energy-intensive and time-consuming steps like freeze-drying or supercritical drying, thus restricting their practical utility. Here, a bidirectional phase separation spinning technique is introduced for continuous and rapid production (360 m h −1 ) of aerogel fibers at any desired length. Importantly, fibers can be directly dried at room temperature, eliminating the need for energy-intensive freeze-drying or other additional steps, significantly reducing energy consumption and processing time. Aerogel fibers produced using this method exhibit remarkable properties: low density (0.18 g cm − 3 ), high porosity (84%), and broad operational temperature range (−20 to 120 °C). Notably, the thermal insulation mat composed of these aerogel fibers achieves an exceptionally low thermal conductivity (31 ± 1.2 mW/(mK)). This work provides a novel strategy for the preparation of aerogel fibers, achieving energy savings and efficiency, positioning aerogel fibers as a promising alternative for next-generation textiles.},

  abstract     = {The symmetry-breaking nature of Janus materials enables the design of multifunctional compounds with distinct properties that are inaccessible to traditional materials. However, the limited availability of intrinsically stable Janus materials hinders a complete understanding of their full potential. Here, the first millimeter-sized Janus material, RhSeCl, is successfully synthesized through the precisely controlled chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal the Janus character of RhSeCl, emphasizing its strong correlation with steric hindrance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses demonstrate the highly unusual oxidation states of Rh and Se, underlining their critical role in determining the formation of the inherent Janus structure. Interestingly, a clear second-harmonic generation (SHG) is observed in RhSeCl, weakening with the temperature. DFT calculations attribut the strong SHG response to the band nesting effect, with an intensity modulated by the temperature-dependent interlayer coupling. Notably, its damage threshold surpassed that of Janus MoSSe. Furthermore, devices based on RhSeCl exhibit promising optoelectronic performance at the visible wavelength range of 405–650 nm, showing a great opportunity for solar applications. These findings deepen the understanding of inherent Janus structures, paving the way for the development of new Janus compounds with versatile functionalities in advanced materials.},

Here, it is observed that optogenetic inhibition and activation of anterior basolateral amygdala (aBLA) - ventral hippocampus (vHPC) glutamatergic projections respectively decrease and increase anxiety avoidance behaviors. Then, the contributions of eCBs in aBLA–vHPC projections to anxiety avoidance are investigated by employing three newly developed synapse- and circuit-specific eCB-targeted viral strategies to achieve real-time monitoring of eCB release, in vivo optogenetic activation of CB1 receptors, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes. Prominent eCB release are surprisingly found at aBLA–vHPC glutamatergic synapses during anxiety avoidance, suggesting inhibitory effects of increased eCBs in aBLA–vHPC projections on anxiety avoidance. This idea is further supported by findings that specific activation of CB1 receptors at aBLA–vHPC synapses inhibit presynaptic glutamate release and reduce anxiety avoidance. In contrast, specific knockdown of eCB biosynthesis enzymes at aBLA–vHPC synapses reduce eCB levels at aBLA–vHPC glutamatergic synapses and increase anxiety avoidance. Additionally, inhibition of aBLA-innervated vHPC glutamatergic neurons alleviates anxiety avoidance. Together, these findings reveal counteracting effects of increased eCB signaling in aBLA–vHPC circuits on anxiety avoidance.},

  abstract     = {Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation, is implicated in various diseases, but effective therapeutic strategies remain limited. Lysosomal impairments cause iron dysregulation and initiate ferroptosis, which potentially contribute to ionizing radiation-induced tissue damages. Here, the role of intercellular lysosomal regulation in governing iron homeostasis and protecting against ferroptosis is investigated in models of stem cell aggregation and mandibular regeneration post-irradiation. Lysosomes are discovered to accumulate in specific regions within multi-stem cell aggregates and regulate cell aggregate formation based on iron control, which is occurred through hypoxic signaling-driven lysosomal redistribution mediated by extracellular vesicles. These vesicles exhibit lysosomal features and possess iron-regulating properties, which rescue lysosomal defects to restore iron homeostasis and mitigate ferroptosis in recipient endothelial cells against the irradiation challenge. Based on lysosomal regulation and anti-ferroptosis, these cell aggregate-released extracellular vesicles (CA-EVs) stimulate the growth of CD31 + endomucin + specialized vessels despite irradiation both in vitro and in vivo, which further promote bone regeneration of post-irradiation mandibular defect. These findings highlight the potential of taking CA-EVs as natural therapeutic agents to safeguard lysosomal function, modulate iron metabolism, and protect against ferroptosis, paving an avenue for combating post-irradiation endothelial injuries and enhancing tissue regeneration.},

Furthermore, this study proposes an innovative hybrid system that integrates PTC film, thermoelectric generator (TEG), and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs).

  abstract     = {Lead-acid batteries, widely used in energy storage and power systems, are susceptible to performance degradation due to metal impurities such as iron, copper, and tin. Traditional methods like ICP-OES are accurate but costly and complex. Therefore, this study proposes a new method based on lens-free digital holography (LDH) to detect and distinguish metal impurities in lead-acid battery electrolytes. The study uses a compact setup with a green LED light source and a CMOS camera to capture holographic images of impurities. The technique reconstructs clear particle images using angular spectrum algorithms and analyzes their reconstruction distances and gray-scale differences for identification. Results show that copper particles have a reconstruction distance of 1406.4 µm and a total gray-scale difference of 4.4681; tin particles have a reconstruction distance of 1414.85 µm and a total gray-scale difference of 0.5344; iron hydroxide has a reconstruction distance of 1647.85 µm and the total gray-scale difference of 13.5789. By combining these parameters, the method effectively distinguishes between copper, tin, and iron particles, even in mixed solutions. This cost-effective and efficient method offers a promising alternative for rapid and accurate detection of metal impurities in lead-acid battery electrolytes, with potential applications in battery maintenance and quality control.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies due to its immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. It is hypothesized that overcoming these barriers requires a dual approach: inducing immunogenic tumor cell death (ICD) and enhancing the cancer immunity cycle by exogenous neoantigen targeting on the spleen. In this study, a novel strategy is presented combining irinotecan-loaded silicasomes with spleen-targeting lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) carrying KRAS G12D mRNA and the toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist 3M-052. The goal is to establish a cancer immunity cycle by promoting endogenous tumor antigen release by the generation of KRAS-specific cytotoxic T cells. Using an orthotopic PDAC mouse model, it is demonstrated that this dual-platform approach significantly reduces tumor burden and extends survival compared to monotherapies. Bulk RNA sequencing and gene expression analyses further reveal synergy between the immune responses at the primary tumor site and the spleen, including maximal upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways, antigen presentation pathways, and T cell activation markers. These findings indicate that the combinatorial strategy effectively bridges innate and adaptive immunity. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of nanocarrier-based immunotherapy to enhance PDAC immunity by integrating ICD induction with systemic immune reprogramming, offering a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Pyroptosis is a proinflammatory programmed cell death (PCD) that is causally linked to antitumor immune responses, but the therapeutic potential of pyroptosis has been limited by the lack of tumor-specific and controllable inducers. Here, it is reported that tumor-specific pyroptosis can be spatiotemporally triggered via near-infrared light (NIR-pyroptosis) by using an antibody-bound indocyanine green (ICG), a clinically approved and nontoxic fluorescent dye. Mechanistically, the key molecular steps are identified by which antibody-bound ICG generates excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) within lysosomes after internalization, leading to lysosomal membrane damage and the cytosolic release of cathepsin S (CTSS), which cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), IL-18, and IL-1β independently of caspase-1, and thereby induces pyroptosis, while other cathepsin family members fail to cleave GSDMD. Functionally, in both ICAM1+ and HER2+ solid tumors, antibody-bound ICG-mediated NIR-pyroptosis triggers potent and durable antitumor immune responses through the release of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, NIR-pyroptosis synergize with anti-PD-1 therapy by activating adaptive immune cells via upregulated IFN-γ secretion. The findings identify CTSS as a novel enzyme for GSDMD cleavage and establish NIR-pyroptosis as a non-apoptotic anticancer modality, providing a promising opportunity to overcome apoptosis resistance in current cancer therapies.},

However, the mechanisms underlying this enhancement—particularly the roles of structural geometry, plasmonic coupling, and chiral field amplification—remain incompletely elucidated. A significant challenge persists in designing coupled nanoassemblies with precisely controlled nanostructures to systematically investigate chirality enhancement. Departing from conventional approaches that incorporate chiral molecules, we present the co-assembly of achiral and chiral plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) into AB n -type nanoclustersand the correlation between inherent plasmonic chirality and the quantity of hotspots. Complementary polymer-grafted achiral nanospheres and chiral nano arrows assemble into stable AB n clusters through a combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The coordination number ( n ) of AB n can be tuned from 2 to 7 by adjusting polymer configurations through modulation of solution pH. The g -factor of AB n exhibits a linear increase with the n value of AB n . Simulation results indicate that the enhanced optical chirality arises from the increase in electric field strength due to the increasing number of hotspots within the NP assemblies.},

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) present a viable authentication mechanism, yet existing implementations exhibit three critical limitations: suboptimal authentication accuracy, insufficient multi-level security architecture, and dependence on costly and specialized equipment for verification. To address these issues, this work utilizes colloidal photonic crystals to fabricate PUF anti-counterfeiting patterns spanning from the macro-to-micro scale. These patterns are integrated with the iris recognition algorithm to construct a multi-layered optical anti-counterfeiting system based on the structural color iris. This work experimentally and computationally demonstrates that the “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystals originate from the “coffee ring” effect. By modulating the “coffee ring” effect, the size of the colloidal photonic crystal iris patterns can be controlled, enabling switching between “Ring”-type and “Dot”-type colloidal photonic crystals. Furthermore, multiple characteristic parameters confirm that the PUF codes derived from encoded “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystal images exhibit uniqueness and readability. Finally, a multi-layered anti-counterfeiting system is constructed, comprising three components: structural color patterns, embedded “Morse codes” formed by “Ring”-type and “Dot”-type colloidal photonic crystals, and optical PUF labels based on the “Ring”-type colloidal photonic crystals. This cost-effective system enables low-threshold, high-performance structural color anti-counterfeiting for premium products.},

  abstract     = {Originating from spin and orbital motion, van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetism has emerged as a significant platform to experimentally access the fundamental physics of magnetism in reduced dimensions, including quantum computing, sensing, and data storage. However, currently, available vdW ferromagnetic materials can be achieved with mechanical exfoliation and low-temperature operation, which completely limits the monolithic integration of vdW ferromagnets with other functional materials. Nonetheless, the direct synthesis of room-temperature vdW ferromagnets has not been achieved commercially, owing to the imprecise control of the layer-by-layer growth, high-temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, herein, an artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform has been reported, which activates the nano-crystallization and its corresponding ferromagnetism in bulk VSe 2 via Ar + H 2 S plasma sulfurization. Sweeping the magnetic field, vdW ferromagnetism has been spatially resolved, which experimentally correlates with magnetization reversal behavior and domain pinning effects. Furthermore, nano-crystallization of VSe 2 is clearly validated with transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and selected area diffraction analysis. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the artificial vdW ferromagnetic platform can artificially inject the ferromagnetism in bulk vdW VSe 2 , which has not been possible previously.},

Increasing evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysregulation can impact the initiation and progression of cancers, including colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and pancreatic cancer. This study observes that the beneficial gut bacterium Parabacteroides distasonis ( P. distasonis ) is significantly decreased in bladder cancer patients, and its low abundance is strongly associated with poor prognosis. P. distasonis is a next-generation probiotic which plays a vital role in human health. Furthermore, this work finds that P. distasonis culture medium inhibits metastasis and proliferation of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies that indole-3-acetic acid (3-IAA) produced by P. distasonis exerting similar tumor-suppressive effects. Mechanistically, 3-IAA activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which in turn downregulates fatty acid synthase (FASN) transcription in bladder cancer cells. Notably, the reduction of FASN expression decreases the ratio of MUFAs to PUFAs, thereby increasing ferroptosis sensitivity in bladder cancer cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that P. distasonis -derived 3-IAA can inhibit bladder cancer metastasis and proliferation, highlighting the AhR-FASN axis as a promising therapeutic target to inhibit bladder cancer progression.},

Here the role of the intestinal clock in shaping cognitive function is investigated. It is found that Bmal1 -iKO mice (mice with Bmal1 [ Brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 ] specifically knocked out in the intestine, a mouse line deficient in intestinal clock function) show a defect in cognitive memory irrespective of the time-of-day. Bmal1 -iKO-associated cognitive decline is attributed to impaired adenosine signaling and compromised long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Adenosine signaling promotes LTP via enhancing BDNF expression and inhibiting synapse loss. Furthermore, the impairment in adenosine signaling is accounted for by the reductions in intestinal absorption of and hippocampal level of adenosine but not by a change in adenosine receptors. Consistently, adenosine supplementation rescues cognitive deficits associated with the malfunction of the intestinal clock. Moreover, BMAL1 regulates the expression of ADK (adenosine kinase, a primary enzyme for adenosine clearance) in the small intestine and thus promotes intestinal adenosine absorption through REV-ERBα which binds directly to Adk P2 promoter to inhibit its transcription. Together, an unsuspected role of the intestinal clock in controlling cognitive memory is identified, highlighting the intestinal clock as a promising target for the management of cognitive disorders.},

  abstract     = {Mechanochromic cholesteric liquid crystal elastomer (CLCE) are unique anisotropic rubbers with programmable optical properties in response to external stimuli, bringing considerable interest in display, sensing, and smart textiles. However, creating mechanochromic CLCE fibers with high sensitivity, excellent resilience, and stable color-changing reversibility is still a challenge. This work describes mechanochromic CLCE symmetric hollow fibers with excellent radial helix alignment prepared by solvent evaporation-induced assembly and template assistance. The cylindrical symmetry renders the response identical in all directions perpendicular to the fiber axis. The hollow fibers show mechanochromic ability in the full visible spectrum, a large wavelength blueshift of 2.25 nm·% −1 under low strain. Excellent mechanochromic reversibility of 100 cycles and resilience are both devoted by cross-linking structure in the wall layer, which also contributes to reversible orientation-recovery of liquid crystal units during stretching-recovery cycles. Numerical models and experimental measurements demonstrate the hollow structure enabled fibers to produce air pressure inside when being stretched, and the fiber wall layer is subjected to greater stress compared to solid fibers, thus achieving high mechanochromic sensitivity. In addition, hollow fiber can still change color when subjected to the expansion stress inside the cavity, and programmable information display in fabric prolongs its application in intelligent textiles.},

  abstract     = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) presents formidable therapeutic challenges due to its multifaceted pathological complexity. Here, this work reports engineered macrophage-derived exosomes overexpressing GNA12 and GNA13 (G12G13MExos) that reprogram macrophages toward the M2c anti-inflammatory phenotype and astrocytes into a neuroprotective phenotype. G12G13MExos enhance astrocyte-mediated clearance of myelin debris, glutamate homeostasis, and synapse formation while fostering astrocyte-neuron crosstalk. These effects improve neuronal survival and drove neural stem cell differentiation into V2a neurons, facilitating neural circuit reconstruction. This work develops a chitosan-based thermosensitive hydrogel that functions as a “nasal exosome intelligent slow-release depot” to enable efficient and targeted exosome delivery. This delivery system bypasses hepatic and renal sequestration and overcomes the blood-spinal cord barrier, significantly enhancing therapeutic efficacy. This strategy integrates engineered exosomes with a responsive delivery platform, modulating the inflammatory microenvironment, enhancing cellular crosstalk, and promoting neural repair. This comprehensive approach offers a promising translational avenue for SCI treatment and other central nervous system disorders.},

  abstract     = {Neutrophils are crucial for fighting invading pathogens and for the clearance of sterile wounds. However, in cases of overwhelming pathogens or excessive inflammatory responses, fine-tuning of neutrophil functions can help to either enhance bacterial killing or prevent unwanted tissue damage. Thus, the present study is aimed at developing a nanoparticle-based toolbox to direct neutrophils toward either a proinflammatory or reparative phenotype tailored to the specific inflammatory environment. For this, neutrophil-specific fluorine nanoparticles additionally equipped with either activating or inhibiting peptides for a background-free 19 F MRI-based theranostic approach are engineered. It is demonstrated that with this i) distinct effector functions can be specifically modulated in both murine and human neutrophils, ii) the disease-specific degree of neutrophil infiltration can be non-invasively monitored in vivo, and in turn iii) neutrophil effector functions can either be attenuated during a pharmacological challenge or amplified to ameliorate tissue damage during bacteria-driven acute colitis. Thus, this nanotheranostic approach is suitable to visualize and concomitantly direct neutrophil functionality depending on the specific requirements to improve disease course and outcome, thus paving the way for a personalized neutrophil immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {While nanofiltration (NF) holds promise for separating small molecules, effectively separating structurally similar compounds like monophenols remains challenging. This study unveils a novel NF separation strategy based on the often-overlooked phenomenon of solute self-assembly. Using a combination of experimental and computational approaches, a direct link between monophenol self-assembly and rejection behavior during NF is established. The self-assembly of monophenols, primarily driven by π–π stacking interactions, is shown to significantly influence their rejection rates, with larger, more numerous self-assemblies experiencing higher rejection. Furthermore, a clear relationship between monophenol structures and self-assembly strength is established, revealing that the number and Hydrogen (H)-bonding capacity of substituents on the aromatic ring dictate the propensity for self-assembly. This insight enables the development of a predictive model for monophenol self-assembly, which is validated through NF experiments using binary mixtures, confirming that predictable differences in self-assembly behavior can be leveraged for selective separation. This study establishes solute self-assembly as a tunable parameter for enhancing NF separation of similarly sized molecules.},

  abstract     = {Cancer cell-intrinsic features (e.g., genetic aberrations and dysregulation of signaling pathways) play pivotal roles in orchestrating the composition and functional state of the immune landscape, which in turn impact tumor progression and response to immunotherapy. Here, it is discovered that dysregulation of cancer cell-intrinsic SET and MYND domain-containing protein 3 (SMYD3) leads to the orchestration of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and the impairment of responses to PD-1 blockade by reprogramming the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). SMYD3 cooperates with Sp1 to transcriptionally promote sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) expression by modifying H3-K4 di-/trimethylation and consequently activating the transcription of CD47. CD47, a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, acts as the downstream effector molecule of the SMYD3 signal to promote the infiltration of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, protecting renal cancer cells from immune attack. In summary, the critical role of the cancer cell-intrinsic SMYD3-SREBP1-CD47 axis is elucidated in regulating the immune microenvironment in ccRCC and provides a potential therapeutic strategy to manipulate the tumor immune milieu in favor of antitumor immunity.},

The inflammatory microenvironment promotes ECM degradation, further exacerbating the vicious cycle of nucleus pulposus (NP) degeneration. This study introduces the mRNA encoding a novel therapeutic transcription factor, Brachyury (Bry), into nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) using an injectable microsphere system composed of biomimetic GelMA/Fucoidan (FU) dual-component hydrogel (GF) and surface chemically grafted lipid nanoparticles (LNP) (BLNP@GF). The study aims to alleviate inflammatory response in the NP while restoring the ECM secretion function of NPCs and enhancing the ability of NPCs to withstand inflammatory stress, thereby restoring physiological balance in the NP microenvironment. The GF microspheres demonstrate injectability and porosity, facilitating efficient LNP loading through chemical grafting. In the LPS-simulated inflammatory microenvironment, sustained release of FU significantly reduces inflammatory activity in NPCs. Successful transfection with Bry mRNA upregulate ECM synthesis in degenerated NPCs. In a rat tail puncture IVDD model, local application of BLNP@GF microspheres effectively improved ECM remodeling in NP tissue, thereby ameliorating puncture-induced IVDD. In conclusion, FU-functionalized GelMA hydrogel microspheres loaded with Bry mRNA provide a promising new strategy for reversing IVDD.},

However, traditional photocatalytic and thermal catalytic methods face challenges like low selectivity and yields. Herein, a novel Cu/MoS 2 photothermal catalyst is synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method, anchoring single-atom Cu on layered MoS 2 for CO 2 and H 2 O reduction into C 2 products (ethanol, acetylene, and ethane). Under optimal conditions (250 °C, 903 mW·cm −2 , 320–780 nm), the Cu 5% –MoS 2 catalyst achieves an ethanol yield of 3.1 mmol·g −1 ·h −1 , 4.6 times higher than blank MoS 2 . Mechanistic studies reveal that Cu improves light absorption and enhances CO 2 adsorption and *COOH accumulation at MoS 2 edge S sites, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Mo–Cu dual sites stabilize *CHO intermediates, boosting C 2 product selectivity. The synergistic photothermal effect accelerates charge migration and surface reactions.

However, clinical trials with cGAS-STING pathway agonists have faced setbacks thanks to their short biological half-life, lack of tumor specificity, and potential to promote tumor immune evasion. To address these challenges, a novel exosome-based drug delivery platform, termed cmExo aCD11b is developed, designed to precisely target and reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) in situ for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy. cmExo aCD11b is engineered to encapsulate high copy numbers of IL-12 mRNA and 2′3’-cGAMP (cGAMP) and is functionalized with CD11b antibodies for targeted delivery to macrophages. Notably, cmExo aCD11b facilitated the repolarization of M2 macrophages to M1 phenotype, thereby reprogramming the TME and enhancing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This immunomodulatory effect reversed the immunosuppressive milieu of the TME and significantly inhibited tumor progression. More importantly, cmExo aCD11b exhibited robust therapeutic efficacy in both murine pancreatic cancer and patient-derived xenograft models. These results suggest that cmExo aCD11b represents a promising approach for overcoming immunosuppression in pancreatic cancer, paving the way for its potential application in cancer immunotherapy.},

However, this intermediate state is recalcitrant to detailed structural investigation, as it is only transiently and sparsely populated. Here, this work investigates the intermediate state of an amyloid-forming human lysozyme variant (I59T) using CEST and CPMG RD NMR at low pH. 15 N CEST profiles probe the thermal unfolding of the native state into the denatured ensemble and reveal a distinct intermediate state. Global fitting of 15 N CEST and CPMG data provides kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, characterizing the intermediate state populated at 0.6%. 1 H CEST data further confirm the presence of the intermediate state displaying unusually high or low 1 H N chemical shifts. To investigate the structural details of this intermediate state, this work uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which recapitulate the experimentally observed folding pathway and free energy landscape. This work observes a high-energy intermediate state with a locally disordered β-domain and C-helix, stabilized by non-native hydrogen bonding and amide-π interactions, accounting for its anomalous 1 H chemical shifts. Together, these NMR and MD data provide the first direct structural information on the intermediate state, offering insights into targeting lysozyme amyloidosis.},

Varied characterizations reveal that the existing C═O exhibits stronger adsorption energy on salt (PF 6 − ) than solvent (e.g., EC and DEC), thus accelerating salt decomposition to produce a stable inorganic SEI layer. Besides, C═O moieties can also adsorb K-ions reversibly, accounting for a high capacitive contribution. Benefiting from the double merits of C═O moieties, the interfacial stability and surface properties of the optimized sample are greatly improved, and as a result, the reversible capacity can reach 462.7 mAh g −1 (0.1 A g −1 over 50 cycles) and rate performance is quite superior as well (321.8 mAh g −1 at 2 A g −1 ).

Additionally, the cardiac patch complements the lip guard by monitoring multiple signals, such as electrocardiograms, heart rates, temperature, and motion. This integrated system is capable of detecting exercise-induced conditions such as dehydration, hyperventilation, and abnormal heart signals. By combining data from both physiological and environmental factors, the wearable device offers a comprehensive assessment of how external conditions influence an athlete's performance.

  abstract     = {The essential cytoplasmic RNA sensor Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5 (MDA5) initiates type I interferons (IFNs) signaling and subsequent immune responses. However, aberrant activation of MDA5 by viral infections or gain-of-function mutations leads to severe autoimmune diseases, for most of which effective treatment is limited. Here, it is shown that inactivation of ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8/UBPy) degrades the MDA5 protein, suppressing antiviral signaling and autoimmunity. It is found that viral infection modulates the AKT-dependent phosphorylation of USP8 at serine 718, which not only promotes the activation of USP8 but also enhances the association between USP8 and MDA5 and the consequent deubiquitination and stabilization of MDA5. Inactivation of USP8 specifically degrades the MDA5 protein regardless of the mutation pattern. Genetic deletion of Usp8 in mice contributes to decreased levels of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Importantly, inhibition of USP8 or AKT can effectively suppress MDA5-induced autoimmunity in Aicardi–Goutières syndrome (AGS) mice and anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis (DM)/systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patient cells. Therefore, these results highlight the critical roles of USP8 in innate antiviral immunity against RNA viruses and autoimmunity and provide a potential therapy for treating autoimmune diseases associated with MDA5.},

  abstract     = {Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is a physiological or pathological condition that progresses in an age-dependent manner, which is characterized by impaired ovarian follicle quality, decreased anti-Müllerian hormone levels, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels, and reduced antral follicle counts. Oxidative stress (OS) is one of the culprits of DOR. By imposing OS damage on various kinds of ovarian cells including granulosa cells, OS can result in ovarian hypofunction and eventually lead to female infertility. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, HIGD1A, a mitochondrial inner membrane component, is found to be downregulated in granulosa cells upon OS exposure. By systematically studying the role of HIGD1A in regulating granulosa cell and ovarian functions as well as its corresponding mechanisms, a novel regulatory mechanism underlying OS-related female infertility is revealed, and provided a potential molecular target for anti-OS therapies.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient alkali-resistant non-noble metal electrocatalysts for hydrogen (H 2 ) oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy. Recently, the hydrogen spillover effect has been proven to be one of the vital means to enhance the activity of the HOR catalyst. In this report, a facile and controllable electrodeposition strategy is proposed for synthesizing a tungsten (W)-doped copper (Cu) nanoalloy/WO 3 electrocatalyst with abundant metal-metal heterointerfaces to promote hydrogen spillover, i. e., the migration of * H from W/WO 3 sites to Cu substrates. CuW grown in situ on carbon paper (CP) demonstrates exceptional HOR performance (1.86 mA cm −2 at 0.05 V vs. RHE) and remarkable stability in alkaline media. XAFS and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that alloying W atoms into the Cu lattice induces electronic modulation, significantly boosting the adsorption, decomposition, and oxidation of H 2 . The migration of * H from W/WO 3 sites to Cu sites via the hydrogen spillover effect has been validated by in - situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectra. This study may open up a new path for designing high-efficiency HOR electrocatalysts from the perspective of appropriate hydrogen spillover channel design.},

  abstract     = {Herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) is a leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, with current therapies primarily targeting viral replication rather than addressing host-cell injury. RNA sequencing of corneal tissue from HSK patients and healthy donors identifies a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. Notably, hexokinase-2 (HK2), a pivotal glycolytic enzyme, exhibits the greatest up-regulation, coinciding with a marked reduction in the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in HSK corneas. Pharmacological inhibition of HK2 with lonidamine in human corneal epithelial cells reduces herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication while preserving cell viability. In a murine model of HSK, topical lonidamine restored respiratory-chain activity, lowered viral load, and accelerated corneal re-epithelialization; its early therapeutic efficacy surpassed that of ganciclovir, and combination therapy conferred additive benefit. These findings identify HK2-driven glycolytic reprogramming as a pathogenic hallmark of HSK and demonstrate that metabolic targeting concurrently restricts viral propagation and promotes tissue regeneration. Thus, metabolic intervention has the potential to complement direct antiviral therapy and represents a promising, clinically translatable strategy to preserve vision in HSK.},

Current nanosystem-based therapeutic strategies are mainly confined within the blood-brain barrier (BBB), ignoring the constant intrusion from external challenges. Here, considering the unique vascular localization of NETs, a DNase I-mediated NETs-targeting nanoparticle is developed to integrate the catalytic and chemotactic functions of DNase I and achieve the synergistic regulation of the internal and external microenvironment of the neurovascular unit (NVU). DNase I navigates the nanoparticles to the lesion, enabling the accumulation in the brain through damaged BBB. The removal of intravascular NETs mitigates the ongoing destruction of the endothelium and reduces the recruitment of immunothrombosis. The main nanoparticles with dual antioxidant activity rescue neuronal apoptosis by scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protecting mitochondria.

Through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental comparisons, the clear improvement of energy resolution from 7% to ≈5% is demonstrated, and the highest resolution of 1.9% is observed. Furthermore, to fill up the research framework of radiation, the definition of X-ray sensitivity is extended to quantitatively describe the γ-ray response, and assess the performance of γ-ray detectors, reaching a sensitivity ≈10 5 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 .

However, the mechanical interplay between phase transitions and dimension transitions, in particular wetting, remains elusive, despite being critical for understanding the onset of metastatic dissemination. This study shows that unjamming, mediated by the RAB5A GTPase, alters carcinoma spheroid fluidity, rigidity, and rewires adhesion mechanics to drive supracellular active wetting as a new mode of tumor expansion. Spheroid fluidification enhances the selective expression of integrin subunits and increases focal adhesion dynamics, inducing a fluid-like spreading behavior on specific matrix ligands. Notably, nanoscale regulation of integrin clustering can select for distinct phase transitions at the collective scale upon wetting. In this framework, fluidized spheroids polarize into cohesive “supracells”, and maintain a stiff peripheral actin bundle as measured by nanomechanical mapping. Furthermore, a combination of Brillouin microscopy and 2.5D traction force analysis reveals a mechanical switch within the spheroid core, characterized by significant cell softening and a reduction in compressive forces exerted on the substrate, thereby mimicking the wetting of a liquid droplet. These findings establish unjamming-driven active wetting as a key mechanism to comprehend the molecular and biophysical underpinnings of solid tumor invasion.},

  abstract     = {Osteosarcoma, the most prevalent malignant bone tumour in children and adolescents, exhibits aggressive pulmonary metastasis and poor prognosis. This study identifies LncDARS-AS1 as a key regulator of metastasis via modulation of ATP1A1, the catalytic subunit of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase (NKA). Transcriptomic analyses, validated by qPCR in 217 osteosarcoma RNA samples, reveal that LncDARS-AS1 is significantly upregulated in metastatic lesions and associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Functional assays confirm that silencing LncDARS-AS1 suppresses osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LncDARS-AS1 directly binds ATP1A1, preventing its interaction with the UBQLN4 and subsequent proteasomal degradation, thereby enhancing NKA activity. Protein-RNA interactions were validated using ChIRP, mass spectrometry, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. Functional NKA activity was assessed using ion-sensitive fluorescent indicators and enzymatic assays. Additionally, digoxin, a cardiac glycoside targeting NKA, effectively inhibited tumour growth and metastasis at clinically safe concentrations. These findings uncover a novel LncDARS-AS1/ATP1A1 axis that promotes osteosarcoma metastasis through inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated degradation and provide a rationale for repurposing digoxin in osteosarcoma therapy. ATP1A1 emerges as a promising target for anti-metastatic intervention.},

  abstract     = {No effective treatments are currently available for central nervous system neurotrauma although recent advances in electrical stimulation suggest some promise in neural tissue repair. It is hypothesized that structured integration of an electroconductive biomaterial into a tissue engineering scaffold can enhance electroactive signaling for neural regeneration. Electroconductive 2D Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene nanosheets are synthesized from MAX-phase powder, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility with neurons, astrocytes and microglia. To achieve spatially-controlled distribution of these MXenes, melt-electrowriting is used to 3D-print highly-organized PCL micro-meshes with varying fiber spacings (low-, medium-, and high-density), which are functionalized with MXenes to provide highly-tunable electroconductive properties (0.081 ± 0.053-18.87 ± 2.94 S/m). Embedding these electroconductive micro-meshes within a neurotrophic, immunomodulatory hyaluronic acid-based extracellular matrix (ECM) produced a soft, growth-supportive MXene-ECM composite scaffold. Electrical stimulation of neurons seeded on these scaffolds promoted neurite outgrowth, influenced by fiber spacing in the micro-mesh. In a multicellular model of cell behavior, neurospheres stimulated for 7 days on high-density MXene-ECM scaffolds exhibited significantly increased axonal extension and neuronal differentiation, compared to low-density scaffolds and MXene-free controls. The results demonstrate that spatial-organization of electroconductive materials in a neurotrophic scaffold can enhance repair-critical responses to electrical stimulation and that these biomimetic MXene-ECM scaffolds offer a promising new approach to neurotrauma repair.},

The thrombopoietin (TPO)-activated c-Mpl signaling pathway has been proven to promote megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production and thus has significant value in the clinical treatment of ITP. However, individual differences and unsustainable responses limit the clinical application of c-Mpl agonists. The cell membrane distribution of c-Mpl is crucial for the cell response to c-Mpl agonists. In the present study, this is observed that the distribution of c-Mpl on the megakaryocyte membrane is significantly reduced in ITP patients. The reduction is more severe in refractory patients. Then, this is verified that the membrane trafficking of c-Mpl is mediated by the Myosin-9/Rab6A complex, and demonstrates that the stability of this complex depends on Rab6A-GTPase. Furthermore, this is found that adiponectin promotes the membrane localization of c-Mpl by increasing the expression of Rab6A GEFs. Finally, this is revealed that adiponectin can assist thrombopoietic agents in the treatment of ITP mice. The results clarify the c-Mpl distribution defects in the cell membrane and the corresponding c-Mpl membrane transport mechanisms in megakaryocytes of ITP, providing new insights to improve the clinical efficacy of thrombopoietic agents for ITP patients.},

Its modular nature also enables the integration with alternative pre-trained encoders for enhanced generalization capability. Outlier design can be implemented by adjusting the classifier-free guidance that enables PRO-LDM to sample vastly different regions in the latent space.

The Fe@WO 3 / ZnCo 2 O 4 n-p junctions demonstrated significant alterations in electrical conductivity upon exposure to tetradecane at room temperature. The sensor achieved a reasonable detection limit of 78.4 ppb and a rapid recovery time of 36 s. The remarkable sensing performance is attributed to the synergistic interactions among multiple heterojunction interfaces, doping-induced active sites, the presence of oxygen vacancies, high-energy crystallographic facets, reduced grain size, and enhanced crystallinity, as supported by density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations.

Scanning transmission electron microscopy offers powerful capabilities for materials analysis and modification, but sample damage, drift, and scan distortions hinder single atom analysis and deterministic manipulation. Materials analysis and modification via electron–solid interactions can be transformed by precise delivery of electrons to a specified atomic location, maintaining the beam position despite drift, and minimizing collateral dose. Here a fast, low-dose, sub-20-pm precision electron beam positioning technique is developed, “atomic lock-on,” (ALO), which offers the ability to position the beam on a specific atomic column without previously irradiating that column. This technique is used to lock onto a single selected atomic location to repeatedly measure its weak electron energy loss signal despite sample drift. Moreover, electron beam-matter interactions in single atomic events are measured with time resolution. This enables observation of single-atom dynamics, such as atomic bistability, revealing partially bonded atomic configurations and recapture phenomena. This opens prospects for using electron microscopy for high-precision measurements and deterministic control of matter for quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The demand for hydrogen production compels the development of various strategies for water splitting. Among these strategies, the Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer (AEMWE) offers the advantages such as low cost and the production of high-purity hydrogen. Waste alkaline water generated from various industries can be directly used in the AEMWE system, due to its appropriate pH range of 13–14. While various nickel-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts have demonstrated adequate performance, their long-term stability remains a concern. To ensure long-term stability of AEMWE, it is crucial to address the potential poisoning effects of impurities present in waste alkaline water on nickel-based HER electrocatalysts. In this study, the Ni-CeO₂/Carbon (NCC) catalyst is employed for HER in waste alkaline water containing Li, Mo, and W ions. NCC exhibited an overpotential of 31 mV, showing ≈3 times less overpotential compared to the Ni/C. The XPS results and DFT calculations demonstrated the electrons transferring from CeO 2 to Ni, inducing the Electronic Metal-Support Interactions (EMSI) effects. The NCC shows 1 A cm −2 at 2.03 V in AEMWE while Ni/C needed 2.33 V to achieve the same current densities. The NCC maintaines long-term stability over 2000 h, with a degradation rate of 4.95%.},

  abstract     = {In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria for extended periods and force them to swim along circular trajectories, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in the bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, how bacteria strategically navigate these factors is revealed. It is observed that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias from zero, transitioning to a plateau at the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli (≈0.25). Furthermore, it is found that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near this mean tumble bias. Considering the phenotypic variation in bacterial tumble bias, which is primarily induced by noise in gene expression, this reflects a strategy for bacterial offspring persistence: In the absence of stimulus cues, some bacteria swiftly escape from the nearby surface in case it lacks nutrients, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this 2D environment most efficiently to find potential livable sites.},

Clinical studies show increased anti-Kir4.1 antibody levels in MS patients' serum, indicating its diagnostic potential. However, the specific mechanism has remained elusive. In a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), it is found that impaired Kir4.1 channels in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) hindered myelin repair in the spinal cord. Using a thermal shift assay (TSA), the small molecule 2-D08 is identified, which effectively activated Kir4.1 channels and reduced demyelination in both EAE mice and marmosets. The neuroprotective effects are mainly due to enhanced phosphorylation of FYN tyrosine kinase, promoting OPCs differentiation. The findings highlight the critical role of Kir4.1 channels in MS pathogenesis and suggest that pharmacological activation of these channels by 2-D08 can be a promising therapeutic strategy for enhancing brain recovery in demyelinating diseases.},

UTX has been reported to participate in genome-wide histone modifications and gene expression in tumorigenesis and its mutations are identified in human cancers. Here, UTX is demonstrated to localize both in the cytoplasm and nucleus, notably, cytoplasmic UTX forms puncta and co-localizes in stress granules (SGs) upon different stresses in vitro. Mechanistically, the TPR domain of UTX plays a critical role in regulating SG disassembly by interacting with G3BP1, the central hub of SG, to disrupt the scaffold network of SG under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Importantly, a clinical UTX mutation, D336G in TPR domain, increases cytoplasmic location of UTX, and stabilizes SG. While UTX D336G promotes, WT UTX or UTX TPR inhibits, cell growth and tumorigenesis by regulating SGs both in vitro and in nude mice, and such regulation is G3BP1 dependent. Together, the results suggest a novel cytoplasmic function of UTX as a negative regulator of SG homeostasis, which is involved in stress and disease states such as tumorigenesis.},

  abstract     = {Radiation therapy (RT) is essential for treating thoracic malignancies but often causes significant lung damage. FLASH-RT, an ultra-high dose rate irradiation technique, shows potential in reducing radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) while maintaining tumor control. However, the underlying immune mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the immune and cellular responses to FLASH-RT versus conventional dose rate (CONV) RT during the early phase of RILI. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a dynamic landscape of the lung microenvironment is pictured during RILI within one-week post-irradiation. The analysis reveals that FLASH-RT induces a more immediate but transient cellular response, while CONV-RT causes sustained inflammation. FLASH irradiation significantly reduces neutrophil infiltration compared to CONV irradiation, particularly within the pro-inflammatory Ccrl2 + subset. FLASH irradiation also triggers stronger activation of CD4 + CD40L + Th cells, which are critical for regulating immune responses and balancing inflammation. Moreover, FLASH irradiation attenuates pro-inflammatory activation and intercellular signaling of Mefv⁺ monocytes, thereby restraining excessive macrophage-driven inflammation. Additionally, FLASH irradiation enhances TGF-β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells, promoting tissue repair. These findings highlight FLASH-RT's superior immune modulation and reparative potential, providing valuable insights into its clinical application for minimizing radiation damage and enhancing lung recovery.},

The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases involves the interaction among genetic factors, environmental factors, and immune disorders. The post-translational modified neoantigens are the key nodal of these three factors. Under the intervention of the external environment, changes in metabolic status in vivo induce metabolite-related post-translational modifications (PTMs). These PTM proteins and peptides, after being presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules of specific genotypes, can trigger autoreactive T cell expansions which are antigen-specific and then develop into autoimmunity. Such biological processes are a great challenge to the immune tolerance status and can be an important cause of autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract     = {Allergic asthma is a significant global health issue characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Current treatments only alleviate symptoms but fail to cure the disease due to its complex pathology. Lipid mediators from arachidonate metabolism are pivotal in immune regulation in asthma. Previously, coactosin-like protein (CLP) is identified as a regulator of leukotriene production in vitro. However, its role in asthma is unclear. In this study, it is found that CLP-deficient ( Cotl1 −/− ) mice challenged with house dust mite (HDM) exhibits exacerbated airway inflammation, macrophage polarization, and type 2 immune responses. CLP deficiency increased prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2 ) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and alveolar macrophages (AMs), activating the PGD 2 receptor chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) on immune cells. Notably, HDM exposure reduced pulmonary CLP levels in wild-type (WT) mice, and overexpression of CLP in Cotl1 −/− macrophages decreased HDM-induced PGD 2 in BAL and alleviated inflammation. Cotl1 −/− AMs exacerbated HDM-induced airway inflammation compared to WT AMs, and this effect is dependent on CRTH2 signaling. These findings reveal that CLP modulates macrophage polarization and suppresses the PGD 2 -CRTH2 pathway to alleviate airway inflammation, highlighting CLP as a promising therapeutic target for asthma.},

  abstract     = {Cardiac fibrosis, a key pathological feature of cardiac remodeling, is a major contributor to mortality in older patients with heart failure. The underlying mechanisms are complex, involving alterations in intercellular communication and chronic inflammation. This study investigates the role of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) in aging-related myocardial fibrosis and its regulatory effects on autophagy through palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1). Here, plasma levels of IPA, a tryptophan-derived metabolite, are found to be reduced in older patients with heart failure, and this reduction is associated with deteriorating cardiac function. Notably, IPA supplementation significantly attenuated aging-related myocardial fibrosis. PPT1, a lysosomal enzyme involved in autophagy, is upregulated in macrophages during aging. IPA reversed aging-induced increase in PPT1 expression. Using PPT1 flox/flox Lyz2-cre mice, it is demonstrated that macrophage-specific deletion of PPT1 significantly reduced cardiac inflammation and myocardial fibrosis in aged mice. Furthermore, PPT1 silencing in macrophages reduced the expression of myocardial fibrosis markers in vitro. Mechanistically, IPA regulated PPT1 expression to modulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, thereby restoring autophagic activity in senescent macrophages and suppressing both inflammation and aging-related myocardial fibrosis. Additionally, IPA influenced the cGAS-STING signaling pathway to regulate PPT1 expression. These findings demonstrate that IPA inhibits PPT1, activates autophagy in macrophages, and mitigates aging-related myocardial fibrosis.},

However, whether glycolysis promotes AF remains unknown, as does whether histone lactylation plays a role in its pathogenesis. In the study, spontaneous AF mice are established to monitor AF susceptibility and atrial substrates at different ages (3, 5, 7 months), indicating that enhanced glycolysis acts as a promoter during AF development by inducing atrial fibrosis. The promoting effect of glycolysis on AF and the pivotal enzyme in driving glycolysis are confirmed by treatment with glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) and adeno-associated virus-mediated atrial PFKM expression. Furthermore, lactate stimulates primary mouse cardiac fibroblast (CF) activation. Mechanistically, the observations indicated that atrial lactate accumulation promotes global lactylation and H3K18 lactylation in atrial fibroblasts. P300-mediated H3K18 lactylation up-regulates TGF-β1 transcription, leading to activation of CF, and thereby contributing to atrial fibrosis. The results reveal a novel role of the metabolic-epigenetic axis in AF pathogenesis, which raises the possibility of potential therapeutic strategies targeting AF.},

This process partly results from the complex interaction between root exudates and microbes, a relationship that remains poorly understood. The roles of root exudates and microbes in rhizosheath formation in rice under soil drying (SD) conditions are investigated. In tetraploid rice, rhizosheath formation under SD is approximately 70% greater than in diploid rice. Inoculation of diploid rice with the rhizosheath soil microbiota from tetraploid rice significantly enhanced rhizosheath formation under SD. The bacterial genus Pseudomonas is identified as the key taxon promoting rhizosheath formation in tetraploid rice under SD. Tetraploid rice exhibits significantly higher root flavonoid concentration than diploid rice under SD. Overexpression of the chalcone synthase gene ( OsCHS1 ), a key gene involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, led to a significant increase in the abundance of Pseudomonadaceae in diploid rice. Pseudomonas nitroreducens , isolated from the rhizosheath of tetraploid rice, demonstrates chemotactic attraction to flavonoids, but this behavior is not observed in histidine kinase mutant Δ cheA . Diploid and tetraploid rice inoculated with P. nitroreducens and IAA biosynthesis complemented strain Δ iaaM -c formed larger rhizosheath under SD than those inoculated with its IAA biosynthesis mutant Δ iaaM . These results suggest that auxin-producing Pseudomonas , recruited by root flavonoids, enhances rice rhizosheath formation through the bacterial histidine kinase under SD.

Stage-specific transcriptomic analyses of IVDD via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have primarily focused on nucleus pulposus cell phenotypes but not immune subpopulations. In other disease contexts, integrating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with scRNA-seq data has provided insights on pathomechanisms in relation to specific cellular subpopulations via single-cell disease relevance scores (scDRS). However, such an approach remains to be applied to IVDD. Here, the stage- specific analysis of IVDD in relation to Pfirrmann grading revealed a key transition in immune cells from a preponderance of LCN2 high myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) during early degeneration to a surge of proinflammatory IL1B+ macrophages in advanced IVDD. scDRS implicated IL1B+ M1-like macrophages as a GWAS risk-enriched subpopulation associated with disease, while functional validation indicated an immunomodulatory effect of LCN2 high MDSCs via ANXA1-mediated inflammation suppression. Accordingly, LCN2 knockout mice exhibit accelerated IVDD, whereas recombinant LCN2 promoted macrophage polarization in vitro to the reparative phenotype by enhancing ANXA1 / Arginase-1 expression and countering LPS/IFN-γ-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype. This work identifies LCN2 high MDSCs as an immunoprotective subpopulation in early IVDD and highlights a potential role of LCN2 as a novel therapeutic agent.},

  abstract     = {Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer due to its aggressive clinical features and the lack of effective targeted therapeutics. Mitochondrial metabolism is intimately linked to TNBC progression and therapeutic resistance and is an attractive therapeutic target for TNBC. Here, it is first reported that human transmembrane protein 65 (TMEM65), a poorly characterized mitochondrial inner-membrane protein-encoding gene in human cancer, acts as a novel oncogene in TNBC to promote tumor growth, metastasis, and cisplatin resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Transcription factor MYC and DNA demethylase ten-eleven translocation 3 (TET3) coordinately upregulate TMEM65 in TNBC, and its upregulation is associated with poor patient survival. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of MYC and TET3 attenuates TMEM65-driven TNBC progression. Mechanistic investigations reveal that TMEM65 enhances mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and its byproduct reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Increased ROS induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), which in turn transcriptionally activates serpin family B member 3 (SERPINB3) to enhance TNBC stemness, thus leading to TNBC progression and cisplatin resistance. Collectively, these findings identify TMEM65 as a vital oncogene of TNBC, unveil its regulatory mechanisms, and shed light on its potential role in TNBC therapy.},

  abstract     = {High-brilliance circularly polarized γ-photon beams are of great significance for a wide range of applications. However, their generation through nonlinear Compton scattering must require a high-density longitudinally-spin-polarized electron beam and consequently is still a great challenge. Here, a novel method is proposed to generate such γ-photon beams via the vacuum dichroism (VD)-assisted vacuum birefringence (VB) effect, only utilizing a well-established unpolarized electron beam. A linearly polarized laser pulse is splitted into two subpulses with the first one colliding with a dense unpolarized electron beam to generate a linearly polarized γ-photon beam (via nonlinear Compton scattering), which then further collides with the second subpulse and is transformed into a circularly polarized one via the VB effect. It is found that by manipulating the relative polarization of two subpulses, one can “purify” the polarization of the γ-photon beam via the VD effect, thereby significantly enhancing the circular polarization of the γ-photon beam. Due to the VD assistance, the VB effect reaches optimal when the relative polarization is nearly 30°, not the widely used 45° in the common VB detection methods. The numerical results show that one can obtain a circularly polarized γ-photon beam with average degree of about 30% (43%) for energies above 500 (1000) MeV and brilliance of about 10 24 (10 23 ) photons/(s · mm 2 · mrad 2 · 0.1%BW) at 500 (1000) MeV by using a currently feasible laser with a peak intensity of about 10 22 Wcm − 2. And, it can be further improved to above 60% (75%) by increasing the laser pulse duration. Moreover, our method is shown to be robust with respect to the laser and electron beam parameters, and can also be used to efficiently confirm the well-known VB effect itself, which has been predicted a very long time ago but has not been directly observed in experiments yet.},

  abstract     = {Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of mortality in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), with hypertension being a major contributor to both kidney damage and increased cardiovascular risk. Despite the established link between CKD and cardiovascular disease, the role of uremic toxins in monocyte-endothelial interactions under hypertensive conditions remains underexplored. Here, a 3D microfluidic model is developed to examine the effects of indoxyl sulfate on monocyte adhesion and extravasation across engineered microvessels embedded in hydrogels with different densities under controlled luminal pressure. Elevated pressure alone in absence of indoxyl sulfate significantly enhanced monocyte adhesion and extravasation, regardless of matrix density, while matrix density regulated adhesion and transmigration in the uremic environment. ICAM-1 is identified as a key driver of THP-1 monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Additionally, denser hydrogels primed monocytes toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with reduced phagocytic capacity, while softer hydrogels induced an anti-inflammatory-like phenotype with enhanced phagocytosis. However, the uremic environment reduced phagocytosis and shifted cells toward a pro-inflammatory-like state, irrespective of matrix density. This approach has the potential to dissect multiple factors that contribute to elevated cardiovascular risks in CKD patients and improve the understanding of mechanisms involved in monocyte dynamics in CKD-related cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is a prevalent metabolic disorder, and its associated microvascular dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral vascular disease. However, the mechanism governing metabolic regulation and functional heterogeneity of endothelial dysfunction remains incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of metabolic stress-induced activation of choline kinase α (CHKA) in endothelial cell (EC) subpopulations, contributing to diabetes-induced microvascular dysfunction. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), three distinct EC subclusters are identified within retinal vessels. Among them, one subcluster characterized by elevated CHKA expression is associated with enhanced angiogenic activity. CHKA silencing in ECs inhibited angiogenic effects and reduced retinal vascular dysfunction in diabetic murine models. CHKA silencing also disrupted NAD + metabolism, causing reduced NAD + levels. Supplementation with nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD + , partially reversed the anti-angiogenic effects induced by CHKA silencing. Mechanistically, CHKA regulated endothelial dysfunction through the NAD + -SIRT1-Notch signaling. Clinical sample analysis and Mendelian randomization studies provided strong evidence linking increased CHKA expression with diabetic microvascular complications. Collectively, this study advances the understanding of endothelial heterogeneity and identifies CHKA as a critical regulator of pathological angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diabetic vascular complications.},

  abstract     = {Uncontrolled cell proliferation drives tumorigenesis and malignant progression, making cell cycle regulation a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Phosphorylation plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation and metastasis by regulating the cancer-related proteins. Identifying key phosphorylation sites is essential for inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and optimizing therapy strategy. Here, this study reveals the strong association of oncogene Collaborator of ARF (CARF), a cell-division regulator interacting with p53, with prognosis and survival of lymphoma patients through pan-cancer analysis. In addition, this study finds that mammalian CARF shares homology with Kip-Related Protein6 (KRP6), a cell cycle inhibitor from higher plant Arabidopsis . KRP6 is regulated by casein kinase1 via phosphorylation at serines 75 and 109, which are conservative in CARF at serines 316 and 356. Systemic assays conducted with various B-cell lymphoma cell lines and a mouse xenograft model demonstrate that the non-phosphorylation variant of CARF inhibited cell proliferation and lymphoma formation more effectively than wild-type CARF, highlighting the crucial regulatory role of phosphorylation at these conserved sites in controlling B-cell lymphoma cell proliferation. A similar suppressive effect is observed with plant KRP6, suggesting a cross-species bioengineering application. These findings enlighten the application of phosphorylation-modified proteins as therapeutic targets in precise lymphoma treatments.},

  abstract     = {Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, ultimately leading to irreversible vision loss. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the significant risk factors in glaucoma; however, neurodegeneration continues even after effective IOP management, underscoring the need for neuroprotective therapies. This study investigates the role of connexin43 (Cx43), which is extensively expressed in retinal macroglia, in regulating microglial activation and optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma. A high-fidelity CRISPR-Cas13 (hfCas13X) system is employed to selectively target and knock down Cx43 expression in macroglia. The findings reveal that Cx43-mediated ATP release through hemichannels exacerbates microglial activation and neuroinflammation, thereby contributing to RGC loss. Notably, in a mouse model of chronic ocular hypertension (COH) glaucoma, knocking down Cx43 in macroglia using the hfCas13X system significantly promoted the survival of RGCs and the integrity of the optic nerve, and improved visual function. The hfCas13X system, which offers high-fidelity RNA editing with minimal off-target effects, represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for glaucoma, highlighting the potential of gene editing technologies in the management of neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract     = {Sweet potato ( Ipomoea batatas ) is a globally important autohexaploid root and tuber crop. Fusarium root rot threatens its entire growth, harvest, and storage period, thereby reducing yield and quality. Therefore, a deeper understanding of Fusarium pathogenicity and sweet potato defense is urgently required. Here, two single nucleotide polymorphisms are identified within the promoter region of the I. batatas CHY zinc-finger and ring protein1 ( IbCHYR1 ) gene that encode an E3 ubiquitin ligase linked to root rot resistance. In susceptible varieties, the high dosage allele Pro :: IbCHYR1 Hap1 leads to increased expression of IbCHYR1 . Overexpression of IbCHYR1 increases susceptibility to root rot and Fusarium wilt. IbCHYR1 interacts with the I. batatas CCCH-type zinc-finger protein ( IbZnFR ) to promote its degradation. IbZnFR confers resistance to root rot and Fusarium wilt and improves yield by more than 10%. The high dosage Pro :: IbZnFR Hap2 allele is associated with resistance to root rot disease. Moreover, FfRlpA2 , a conserved Fusarium effector, is identified as a protease inhibitor that stabilizes and hijacks IbCHYR1 to degrade IbZnFR , thereby inhibiting multiple defense pathways. These findings provide insights into Fusarium pathogenicity and a genetic basis for root rot research and improvement of disease-resistant sweet potato varieties.},

  abstract     = {A Genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a European-American cohort identified chr11p11.2 as a neuroblastoma predisposition locus. Combining in-house and public genomic data from neuroblastoma cell lines, this work implicates rs2863002 as the candidate causal variant at the 11p11.2 locus, confirming its cis-regulatory activity through a luciferase reporter assay. The genetic association of rs2863002 with neuroblastoma risk is validated in an Italian case-control cohort. Using ChIP-qPCR, Hi-C, and CRISPR genome editing, this work deciphers the regulatory mechanisms at the risk locus, demonstrating that the rs2863002-C risk allele regulates HSD17B12 expression and reduces GATA3 binding affinity. In vitro functional assays and targeted lipidomic analyses reveal the involvement of the rs2863002-C risk allele in tumorigenicity and modulation of lipid metabolism in neuroblastoma cells through HSD17B12 regulation. This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of neuroblastoma and underscores the importance of post-GWAS functional characterization of risk loci in uncovering relevant biological findings for understanding complex diseases.},

  abstract     = {Aberrant angiogenesis is a hallmark of many pathologies. In cancer, tumor growth and metastasis strongly depend on angiogenesis triggered by neoplastic cells. Antiangiogenic therapies are approved to treat different kinds of cancer. However, the success of these treatments is so far limited as some patients do not respond at all and others develop resistances. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving tumor angiogenesis and the variations in tumor vessels is crucial. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a fast volumetric imaging technique that provides detailed insights into tumor vascularization and perfusion of vessels in a label-free and non-invasive manner. An ultra-high resolution OCTA and confocal fluorescence imaging pipeline are developed to analyze tumor vascularization and blood perfusion in vivo, using a zebrafish cancer model. OCTA imaging operating at 800 nm is optimized to show slow blood flow allowing to compare the functionality of blood vessels in healthy and tumor-bearing zebrafish. Furthermore, effects of small compounds on tumor vascularization can be investigated with our setup. The key outcomes include a qualitative assessment of vascularization and blood vessel perfusion, along with a quantitative analysis of vessel structure, to evaluate how effective the drugs were at different concentrations.},

  abstract     = {Achieving the ultralow critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactant encapsulating the dye has spawned a vital pathway to boost the efficiency and stability of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The attainment of ultralow CMC while sustaining the constant micelle presents a significant challenge. Here, by an ingenious pressurizing strategy, the ultralow CMC is obtained for the immobilized micelle. The ultralow CMC of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) is performed under pressure by the detection of encapsulated coumarin 35 (C35) attractively. At 0.80 GPa, the CMC of CTAB is decreased ≈111-fold to 8.3 ± 0.1 µ m compared to 917.2 ± 8.7 µ m at 0.10 MPa. The ultralow CMC under pressure is probed relying on the quenched fluorescence background of C35. Femtosecond transient absorption spectra confer a clear picture that the pressure-induced fluorescence quenching is ascribed to the reinforced competition for the twisted intramolecular charge transfer process of the C35. This study provides a robust strategy for achieving ultralow CMC, laying the groundwork for the efficient application of DSSCs.},

  abstract     = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal malignancies and epigenetic modifiers play a key role in HCC progression. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine-36 (H3K36me3) determines deposition of mRNA de novo N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) modification. However, it remains largely elusive how long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are selected for proper m 6 A methylation. The current study provides evidence for L1CAM-AS1 as a novel H3K36me3-guided, m 6 A-modified lncRNA through integration of genome-wide H3K36me3 profiles and transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiles of HCC cells. The crucial m 6 A-modification site in L1CAM-AS1 exon 3 is recognized by IGF2BP1, leading to increased lncRNA stability. Oncogenic L1CAM-AS1 shows higher expression in HCC tissues than in normal specimens, and its elevated expression is associated with shorten patient survival. Mechanistically, L1CAM-AS1 interrupts binding of RAN to the E3 ligase OSTM1, suppresses RAN ubiquitination at Lys152 and Lys167, stabilizes RAN protein, enhances nuclear import of RELA (p65), and activates the NF-κB signaling, leading to up-regulated CCL2 expression. L1CAM-AS1-induced CCL2 secretion from HCC cells enhances M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Meanwhile, immunosuppressive M2 macrophages-released CCL5 augments RELA nuclear import in HCC cells, which in turn activates the NF-κB signaling. Given the critical role of macrophages in anti-tumor immunity, inhibition of the L1CAM-AS1-RAN axis promotes the efficacy of PD-1 blockade via TAM reprogramming in HCC mouse models. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into how epigenetic alternations are involved in antitumor immunity modulation and illustrates promising potentials of L1CAM-AS1 in immune-checkpoint inhibitor treatments for HCC.},

This study introduces low-impedance, soft-conducting polymer electrodes capable of forming stable, intimate contacts with peripheral nerve tissues, allowing for continuous and reliable recording of neural activity in awake animals. Using this unique dataset of neurophysiological signals, a neural network model that integrates both handcrafted and deep learning-derived features, while incorporating parameter-sharing and adaptation training strategies, is developed. This approach significantly improves the generalizability of the decoding model across subjects, reducing the reliance on extensive training data.

The novel design leverages numerous conductive nanosheets, randomly arranged in a series-parallel configuration, embedded within a highly compliant dielectric hydrogel. For the nanosheets, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is deposited on the surface of sulfonated cellulose nanosheets (SCNS) to function as microelectrodes (PEDOT@SCNS). The resulting nanosheet-based hydrogel (NSH) demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1356%), excellent adaptability (storage modulus of 102 Pa), and self-adhesiveness (21.7 kPa on pigskin). The nanosheet microelectrodes enable the formation of both microcapacitor arrays and conductive paths within the ultrasoft hydrogel, facilitating the construction of high-fidelity capacitive sensors and bioelectrodes for the real-time monitoring and classification of human activities and physiological states, respectively. This NSH, which significantly reduces skin-interfacial impedance, has demonstrated strong potential as candidate sensors for advanced applications in EMG, facial nerve monitoring, ECG, and brain activity monitoring, achieving reduced RMS noise (9.7 µV) and minimal motion artifacts.},

  abstract     = {Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV + ) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) exhibits a poorer prognosis with limited treatment options. Although recent evidence indicates that the peripheral nervous system is associated with tumor progression, its role in EBV + DLBCL remains poorly understood. In the cohort, patients with EBV⁺DLBCL exhibit significantly shorter overall survival (OS). Two EBV + DLBCL cell lines are established and characterized. Although cell proliferation does not differ significantly in vitro, tumors derived from EBV + DLBCL cells demonstrate accelerated growth compared to their parental counterparts in mouse models. Mechanistically, transcriptome analysis reveals the upregulation of axonogenesis-related genes and pathways in EBV + DLBCL tumors. Immunostaining confirms increased nerve fiber infiltration in SUDHL6-EBV xenografts and enhance neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia co-cultured with EBV + DLBCL cells. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that sympathetic nerves promote tumor growth via β2-adrenergic receptors (β2ARs), which are attenuated by selective β2AR blockers. Clinically, EBV⁺DLBCL patient samples show more sympathetic nerve fibers and higher β2AR expression, both of which are associated with poorer survival. Furthermore, a meta-analysis suggests that beta-blocker use is linked to a reduced risk of cancer-specific mortality. Together, these findings suggest that sympathetic nerve innervation drives the progression of EBV + DLBCL via β2ARs, highlighting a potential therapeutic target.},

The efficacy of ISNLD is evaluated for the early prediction of severe liver disease (SeLD) and analyzed its association with metabolism-related outcomes. The multimodal model performs satisfactorily in classifying individuals into low- and high-risk groups for NAFLD, achieving area under curves (AUCs) of 0.843, 0.840, and 0.872 within training, internal, and external test sets, respectively. Among high-risk group, ISNLD is significantly associated with intrahepatic and metabolism-related complications after lifestyle factors adjustment. Further, ISNLD demonstrates notable capability for early prediction of SeLD and further stratifies high-risk subjects into three risk subgroups of elevated risk for adverse outcomes. The findings emphasize the model's ability to integrate multimodal features to generate ISNLD, enabling early detection and prognostic prediction of NAFLD.

Through hierarchical assembly, the network integrates side-chain quadruple hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), dynamic disulfide bonds, and interfacial H-bonds, facilitating rapid energy dissipation. This epoxy demonstrates exceptional performance through meticulous engineering, exhibiting impressive toughness (210.75 MJ m −3 ), exceeding that of spider silk by 30%. It also shows remarkable stretchability (864.72%) and rapid self-healing capabilities (90.0% recovery within 2 h at 25 °C). This combination of these properties is consistently maintained under various environmental conditions due to the protection of the dynamic bonds by the hydrophobic chains. Furthermore, the bionic network enhanced the composites with superior gas impermeability and high interfacial adhesive strength (9.58 MPa).

As a non-invasive, rapid, non-destructive, accurate, and automated tool that combines advantages from both spectroscopy and imaging techniques, HSI holds significant potential for analyzing and optimizing lyophilization processes and products. However, the huge and information-rich datasets generated from HSI are difficult to be modeled and interpreted properly. This article reviews and discusses the literature on the application of HSI on lyophilization, and the strategies that use the resulting data to build models. Such strategies include preprocessing, spectral unmixing, classification and regression, and data fusion. From the data modeling and application perspectives, the current challenges and future prospects regarding HSI techniques for lyophilization are addressed. This article is intended to provide guidance and insights for non-specialist researchers and engineers into leveraging HSI and the data-driven modeling strategies for addressing a wide range of lyophilization-related challenges.},

  abstract     = {Hearing loss imposes a significant global health burden and often results from genetic factors and various external influences, such as noise exposure and the use of ototoxic drugs. Recent advancements in adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy offer promising new avenues for the treatment of inner ear diseases. Clinical trials of AAV-mediated gene therapies show impressive preliminary results, although further research is needed to evaluate the safety and long-term effects of these therapies. Preclinical AAV-mediated gene therapy is notable for its high transduction efficiency and safety. In this article, the development of AAV-mediated gene therapies is reviewed for inner ear diseases, categorizing these therapies by their strategies for treating hereditary hearing loss, including gene replacement and cluster regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-based methods. AAV-mediated hair cell regeneration therapy is also reviewed for acquired hearing loss, as well as methods to prevent acquired hearing loss. In this article, it is hoped to provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in AAV-mediated gene therapy and its future potential, thereby highlighting the importance of this therapy for researchers and clinicians in the field.},

  abstract     = {Conduction and polarization are known to profoundly impact conductive metal–organic frameworks (c-MOFs) for their applications in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. Albeit a few advances along c-MOF platforms in enhancing their EMW absorption performances, reticular modulation-led inter/intra-layer conduction and polarization loss remains an unmet challenge. To address this, a ligand substitution-guided bottom-up structural control strategy is introduced to study the depth of reticular modulation-led inter/intra-layer conduction and polarization loss in c-MOFs under an electromagnetic (EM) field. A family of triphenylene-X ligands (X = −NH 2 , −OH, and −SH) is harnessed to afford an isoreticular family of three Cu-based c-MOFs. Thanks to the distinct Cu─X bonds, such a platform allowed to systematically study the synergistic features of conduction and polarization loss in EMW absorption enhancement. One of the trio, Cu 3 (HITP) 2 (X = −NH 2 ; HITP, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) is identified with an optimal EM loss capacity under the EM field, achieving a record-high reflection loss of −63.03 dB in the effective absorption range of 3–18 GHz band. Setting up a new benchmark for EM loss among c-MOFs, this study introduces a way to leverage control in the charge mobility characteristics of Cu─X bonds relative to the dielectric losses at both molecular and atomic scales.},

  abstract     = {Zinc plays a crucial role in the gut barrier function and are widely used for the prevention of bowel disease. However, the mechanism via which zinc supplementation exerts this regulatory effect is unclear. The present study identifies and characterizes the zinc-responsive activation of AKT and demonstrates its function in alleviating gut barrier dysfunction. Mechanistically, zinc increased intracellular SAM production, a methyl donor, by promoting the activation of the metallochaperone ZNG1-METAP1 complex. Subsequently, zinc facilitates methylation (symmetrical dimethylarginine, SDMA) of AKT at residues R391 and R15, which is facilitated by PRMT5. The AKT SDMA modification promotes AKT translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane and its interaction with mTORC2, ultimately promoting AKT activation and cell proliferation. Notably, histidine has an antagonistic effect on zinc-induced the AKT activation, cell proliferation, and gut barrier improvement by chelating zinc. These results demonstrate that zinc activates AKT and alleviates gut barrier dysfunction by inducing activation of the ZNG1-METAP1-PRMT5-AKT SDMA pathway, and highlight that limiting histidine intake may have effective therapeutic potential for bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis.},

However, challenges remain, particularly in solid tumors where immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and T cell exhaustion limit effectiveness. Combining ICB with CAR T cell therapy has shown potential but requires further optimization for effective synergy. Here, the bioinformatic analysis identified that CXCL13 expression is highly elevated in T cells from patients who respond to ICB, indicating its possible role in enhancing T cell antitumor responses. Mouse CAR T cells are engineered to overexpress CXCL13 and observed that these cells displayed reduced exhaustion, increased central memory phenotype, and improved mitochondrial function and proliferation in an AKT-mTOR dependent manner. CXCL13-overexpressing CAR T cells show significantly increased antitumor activity in vivo, particularly when combined with PD-1 inhibition, promoting the expansion and persistence of early exhausted CD8 + CAR T cells. CXCL13 also conferred similar in vitro phenotypic enhancements in human CAR T cells as observed in murine cells. These results indicate that CXCL13 expression improves CAR T cell function and responsiveness to ICB, offering a promising and translationally relevant strategy to optimize CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors in clinical settings.},

Structural analysis reveals that the PTA-functional group with extended π -conjugation lengths increases the Mn─Mn distance, results in a lower energy transfer and reduced exciton binding energy compared to DMA⁺ (linear carbon chain). Consequently, PTA 2 MnBr 4 demonstrates an enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and prolonged exciton lifetime. The engineered X-ray detector based on PTA 2 MnBr 4 wafer exhibits a higher sensitivity of 1122 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 and a lower detection limit of 95 nGy air s −1 , while DMA 2 MnBr 4 device are 708.2 µC Gy air −1 cm −2 and 180 nGy air s −1 , respectively, which paves the way for high-efficiency photoelectronic applications.

In this study, its function in inhibiting autophagy in LUAD is explored. Using RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), TMEM99 is found upregulated in LUAD tissues and cell lines, correlating with poor patient outcomes. In vivo and in vitro assays confirmed that TMEM99 promotes cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibits autophagy. Mechanistically, the 3′ end of TMEM99 binds to the K‑homology domain 1 (KH1) and KH4 domains of far upstream element‑binding protein 3 (FUBP3), stabilizing its protein. The TMEM99-FUBP3 complex binds to p21 mRNA and recruits IGF2BP2 in an N⁶‑methyladenosine (m⁶A)-dependent manner, which enhances mRNA stability and translation efficiency.

In this study, using cows, goats, and mice as animal models, the efficacy of ACN extracts from crabapple fruit is investigated in alleviating the severity of mastitis and blood milk barrier (BMB) damage. A monomeric component, cyanidin 3- O -galactoside (C3Gal) is identified, that exhibited considerable effect on mastitis. Mechanistically, C3Gal regulated mastitis progression by inhibiting PANoptosis activation, and suppressing gasdermin D N-terminal activity to regulate BMB damage during mastitis. These findings establish PANoptosis as a critical pathway in the rapid progression of mastitis and highlight the potential of ACN extracts as effective alternatives to antibiotic for mastitis treatment. This study provides a promising strategy for the discovery and application of drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, expands the application of ACN in inflammatory diseases, and elucidates the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory effect.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen is key in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in materials production. At the same time, it significantly affects mechanical properties, often causing unwanted embrittlement. However, rather than solely addressing these disadvantages, hydrogen's inevitable role in sustainable metallurgy should be leveraged to create new and potentially superior materials. Here, it is shown that using hydrogen in the form of metal hydrides introduces a barrier to mechanical alloying, stabilizing otherwise unattainable microstructures. Severe plastic deformation of a composite of the equiatomic high entropy alloy (HEA) TiVZrNbHf and Cu leads to amorphization, while substituting the HEA with its hydride preserves the two-phase structure. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the significantly different hydrogen affinities, together with the restricted dislocation motion in the hydride, create a barrier to mechanical alloying. This hydride route could enable new microstructure states, even in well-studied material systems. It opens an additional dimension in designing materials containing phases with diverging hydrogen affinities, offering tighter control over mechanical alloying.},

Two crucial innovations address existing technological constraints: (i) an augmented matrix-based error-feedback DNA molecular neural network, enabling multidimensional parameter integration through DNA strand displacement cascades and iterative weight optimization; (ii) incorporating membrane diffusion theory with division operation principles into DNA circuits to develop partial differential calculation modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the augmented matrix-based DNA neural network efficiently and accurately learns target functions; integrating the proposed partial derivative computation strategy, this architecture solves the biological Brusselator PDE numerically with errors below 0.02 within 12,500 s.

In this study, a humidity-responsive polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/ polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite membrane is developed with a nanoporous structure and integrated between two layers of glass to engineer a humidity-controlled smart window. By modulating the humidity level between the glass layers, the smart window enables the dynamic and coordinated modulation of solar and thermal radiation via the reversible adsorption and desorption of water vapor by the PTFE/PVA composite. The results indicate that the humidity-controlled smart window demonstrates superior capabilities in solar modulation (54.4%) and thermal radiation modulation (51.4%). Statistical analysis reveals that compared to ordinary windows and low emissivity (Low-E) windows, PTFE/PVA windows reduce total annual energy consumption by ≈25% and 40%, respectively. This broadband dynamic continuous regulation mechanism may offer groundbreaking insights into the advancement of smart window technologies.},

Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for preventing permanent damage. Current methods rely largely on qualitative assessments with limited accuracy, and those that exploit invasive pressure measurements often prove inadequate. Herein, a soft materials-based multimodal sensor probe is introduced, as well as the mechanical and thermal influences to monitor intra-compartmental pressure, tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2 ), and blood flow simultaneously at a common location within an affected compartment. The system integrates three sensors into a thin, flexible probe capable of real-time, wireless data transmission. The device allows for continuous monitoring with high reproducibility and sensitivity, to enhance diagnostic accuracy relative to current clinical practice, with the potential to early diagnosis of an acute compartment syndrome that requires fasciotomies. Large animal model studies, including short- and intermediate-term reliability assessments, highlight the key engineering features. The results reveal expected inverse relationships between pressure, StO 2 , and flow rate under simulated compartment syndrome conditions. This multimodal approach enhances diagnostic precision, offers real-time insights, and promises to yield improved outcomes through a comprehensive, quantitative diagnosis of compartment syndrome.},

The challenge of early diagnosis and the inefficacy of current therapeutic strategies underscore the urgent need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are emerging as critical regulators of post-transcriptional processes and are implicated in cancer progression. Here, the study identifies Staufen Double-Stranded RNA Binding Protein 2 (STAU2) as an oncogenic RBP with high expression in PDAC, which is significantly associated with metastasis. It is demonstrated that STAU2 directly binds and regulates cytoskeletal associated protein Palladin (PALLD) and mediates IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), thereby promoting metastasis via the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Moreover, a 2′-methoxyethoxy (2′-MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting STAU2 is developed, which effectively inhibited downstream targets in vitro and in vivo. STAU2-ASO treatment significantly suppressed PDAC progression and metastasis, with a demonstrated safety profile in vivo.},

  abstract     = {Targeting Nampt to modulate NAD + metabolism and exert antitumor effects has become a research hotspot in the field of cancer metabolism. But early clinical trials have only achieved modest results, primarily due to the need for improved efficacy and the occurrence of severe systemic adverse effects. Therefore, enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing the adverse effects of Nampt inhibitors are urgent challenges. The research reveals that the Nampt inhibitor FK866 can induce ferroptosis in colorectal cancer cells via the NAD + /Stat3/Gpx4 signaling axis. Furthermore, the combination of FK866 and the Stat3 inhibitor C188-9 demonstrates a strong synergistic antitumor effect. Importantly, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hydrogel that encapsulates FK866 and C188-9 for in situ drug delivery, effectively reducing systemic side effects, is developed. Intriguingly, mass cytometry time-of-flight (CyTOF) analysis indicates that the combined treatment with FK866 and C188-9 exerts antitumor effects by increasing the infiltration of CD8 + T cells and neutrophils into the tumor, as well as enhancing the expression of immune-regulatory molecules, including IFN-γ, IL-10, and perforin. Thus, this localized treatment not only minimizes systemic adverse effects, but also markedly amplifies antitumor efficacy through the modulation of both tumor cells and the tumor immune microenvironment, representing a promising antitumor treatment strategy.},

Here, we present the first strategic screening of M 2 X-type MXenes (including Hf 2 CT x , Zr 2 CT x , Ta 2 CT x , Nb 2 CT x , Mo 2 CT x , and V 2 CT x ) for rational heterojunction design with Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , focusing on the interplay between properties of MXenes and photovoltaic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MXenes can induce substantial electronic states near the Fermi level, creating superior charge transfer paths in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , with V 2 CT x exhibiting the lowest interfacial contact barrier and the highest carrier transfer efficiency. Complementary ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses further demonstrate that the functional termination groups like ─F in MXenes effectively passivate Br vacancies in Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , thereby enhancing crystallization and suppressing defect densities. Consequently, the experimental results yielded a trend in line with the calculations, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device with V 2 CT x represented a 36% improvement, accompanied by exceptional stability. By establishing quantitative structure-property relationships between MXenes and Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 , this work provides a universal materials selection paradigm for developing high-performance, environmentally-friendly photovoltaic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a common digestive tract malignant cancer with high incidence and mortality rate. Many studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs are involved in the progression of various types of tumors. The lncRNA protein disulfide isomerase family A member 3 pseudogene 1 (PDIA3P1) promotes the progression of ESCC, but the molecular mechanism behind this is still unclear. In this study, PDIA3P1 is highly expressed in ESCC, produces more lactate by regulating glycolysis, and the increased lactate upregulates lactylation levels to drive tumor progression. Mechanistically, PDIA3P1 competes with miR-152-3p to prevent degradation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, and disrupts the binding between membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8) and hexokinase 2 (HK2) to reduce ubiquitination degradation of HK2, thereby promoting glycolysis. High activity glycolysis produces more lactate, which upregulates the level of histone H4K8 lactylation (H4K8la) and promotes the transcription of target bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP7). Functionally, BMP7 is involved in the regulation of ESCC progression by PDIA3P1 both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP) mediated m6A modification enhances the stability of PDIA3P1 through Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) dependent recognition. Taken together, these findings reveal the key role of PDIA3P1 regulates glycolysis-H4K8la-BMP7 axis in the progression of ESCC and provides new insights into the interplay between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic regulation.},

Further, the charge transfer characteristics as well as the adsorption layer and solid electrolyte interphase formation are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The cation charge density was found to be crucial for diffusion and desolvation processes, yet surprisingly, also a cation-dependent separator tortuosity was observed.

While crystallographic features of Li influence deposition morphology, the orientation of Li crystals during electrodeposition and their temporal evolution under varying kinetic and interphasial conditions remain unclear. This study investigates Li microstructures during electrodeposition at ultra-high capacities (up to 12 mAh cm⁻ 2 ) and over repeated cycling, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the microstructural evolution of Li depends on the interplay between interphasial properties and deposition kinetics. A layer-by-layer epitaxial Li growth with a coherent lattice orientation is achievable under homogeneous interphase and slow deposition kinetics. However, at higher capacities or extended cycling, deterioration of interphase homogeneity disrupts crystal matching, resulting in island-like deposits with randomly oriented single-crystalline grains. In contrast, an inhomogeneous interphase and faster kinetics lead to whisker-like Li deposits. These results demonstrate that while cohesive interactions between depositing Li crystals can result in isolated single-crystalline grains, maintaining interphase homogeneity and stability is essential to enable coherent lattice matching for layer-by-layer epitaxial growth. This study reveals Li microstructural evolution and offers insights for designing stable interphases and optimizing conditions for durable, high-capacity LMBs.},

In this study, MgO-based composites with high thermal conductivities are fabricated to achieve excellent thermal performances by optimizing the heat-transfer path. These composites are produced using a protein foaming method, which effectively forms interconnected ceramic-filler networks. Additionally, the liquid phase formed during the sintering of MgO enhances the bonding with the epoxy matrix, thereby improving the thermal conductivity of the composites. As a result, the composites with 54.64 vol% MgO achieve a high thermal conductivity of 17.19 W m −1 K −1 , which is 101 times higher than that of pure epoxy, 3.7 times higher than that of randomly dispersed composites, and even superior to that of nitride-based composites. Moreover, the composites also exhibited a low thermal-expansion coefficient (27.76 ppm °C −1 ) and high electrical-insulation strength (51.51 kV mm −1 ), ensuring good thermal and electrical performance for electronic-packaging applications.

  abstract     = {Developing high damping alloys (HDAs) with large elastic strain has attracted growing attention due to the increasing demand for energy absorption with overload reliability and reusability. However, damping capacity inherently conflicts with elasticity, because the former requires a liable movement of crystal defects while the latter opposite. To deal with the damping-elasticity paradox, the advantage of pseudobinary eutectic reaction and rapid cooling of laser powder bed fusion is taken to fabricate a bulk NiTiSn nanocomposite with a two-level hierarchical structure. The first-level architecture is composed of martensitic NiTi nanolamellae and reinforced Ti 3 Sn nanolamellae. In addition to lattice strain matching and lamellar boundary strengthening, a novel mechanism of martensite reorientation mediated by reversible stress-induced detwinning-twinning is activated to generate large elastic strain. A high density of nanotwins and nanodomains within NiTi nanolamellae constitute the second-level architecture, which provides pronounced internal friction for high damping capacity. As a result, our NiTiSn nanocomposite exhibits a record-high integration of damping capacity (tanδ > 0.10) and elastic strain (exceeding 4.5%), as well as superb stability under cyclic overload. This research not only represents a major breakthrough in achieving HDAs with outstanding damping and elastic strain but also offers a novel paradigm for high-performance functional and structural materials.},

  abstract     = {Tumor cell-driven exosomes (TExo) have exhibited several major drawbacks that hinder antitumor therapy. A representative immunosuppressive mechanism is the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells with the help of exosomal PD-L1. Another common mechanism is to promote tumor metastasis by promoting the seeding and growth of metastatic cancer cells in distant organs. Therefore, the removal of TExo can provide many benefits for the treatment of cancer patients. Here, a bio orthogonal r eaction- d riven e xosome e limination (Biordee) strategy that promoted macrophage-mediated phagocytosis by using IgG Fc to engineer endogenous TExo (TExo-Fc) was developed. The Biordee strategy effectively reduced the levels of TExo in the circulatory system by leveraging the interaction of IgG Fc with FcγRII/III receptors of macrophage, which further broke down the body's immunosuppression and enhanced the immune response after chemotherapy. Moreover, the Biordee strategy inhibited breast cancer liver metastases, which were enhanced by promoting chemotherapy-induced TExo release. This work provided a new attempt to reduce TExo level after chemotherapy to enhance antitumor therapeutic effects.},

However, their applicability to animals has remained a challenge. Herein, the first case of engineering polyploid genomes with desirable traits via unisexual–sexual reproduction transition is provided. First, a group of genome-reconstructed amphitriploids (GR-A3n) is generated involving unisexual gynogenetic Carassius gibelio , sexual C. auratus , and sexual C. cuvieri . Then, we found that the gynogenesis ability have transferred from C. gibelio to some of the GR-A3n females. This study subsequently established three GR-A3n clones with distinct herpesvirus resistance and in which differential transcriptome profiles are characterized in two main hematopoietic organs. Most genes of the hemoglobin metabolism pathway is found to exhibit high expression levels, as in C. cuvieri , which led to efficient hemoglobin biosynthesis and blood oxygen homeostasis during infection, thereby resulting in strong herpesvirus resistance. Furthermore, this study determined the resistant and susceptible haplotypes derived from chromosome 12B of C. cuvieri , which should be responsible for resistance differences between GR-A3n clones. Overall, this study establishes an approach for genetic improvement through polyploid genome design in animals.},

  abstract     = {Infiltrating monocytes can exert both protective and pathogenic effects during central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. However, the metabolic mechanisms that govern these divergent roles remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and metabolic flow analysis of brain and bone marrow (BM) is used to map the metabolic signatures of monocyte-derived cells (MCs) during lethal West Nile virus encephalitis. Trajectory analysis shows that BM monocytes progress through three metabolic profiles before migrating to the brain and differentiating into a pro-inflammatory HIF1-α⁺ MC population. This population further diverges into an inflammatory, iNOS⁺ MC subset with high glycolysis and amino acid metabolism, and a protective, glycolytically quiescent, antigen-presenting MC subset. Daily in vivo glycolysis inhibition reduces neuroinflammation and disease signs without increasing viral load. This effect does not reflect a broad reduction in myelopoiesis but rather a selective decrease in iNOS⁺ MC migration, revealing distinct glycolytic dependencies among MC subsets. HIF1-α activity remains independent of glycolysis, enabling functional differentiation of antigen-presenting MCs without impairing antiviral responses by cervical lymph node T cells. This study identifies key metabolic drivers of MC function in viral CNS disease, in which selective metabolic reprogramming reduces severe neuroinflammation, demonstrating a promising therapeutic strategy.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic H 2 O 2 synthesis from water and oxygen by covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has attracted much attention currently. However, conventional COFs often suffer from insufficient stability and activity due to the unclear structure-activity relationship mechanisms. Herein, a series of quinoline-linked COFs-R (-R = -OH, -OMe, -H, -Br, -CN) synthesized via multi-component reactions (MCRs) is reported to systematically modulate their pore microenvironments and enhance photocatalytic performance. Experimental results reveal that the electron-donating capacity of substituents significantly enhances charge separation efficiency, with H 2 O 2 production activity exhibiting a negative correlation to the Hammett parameters ( σ p ) of the -R groups. Notably, the COF-OH and COF-OMe, bearing the strong electron-donating group, achieve a remarkable H 2 O 2 generation rate of 4458 and 4138 µmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ in the pure water system. Theoretical calculations confirm that substituents optimize the collective donor structure within the π-conjugated triazine framework, boosting photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the universal Hammett relationship observed in benzylamine coupling reactions establishes a critical structure-activity model for rational COF design. This work provides fundamental insights into the microenvironment engineering of COFs for efficient H 2 O 2 production and advances the development of sustainable photocatalytic materials.},

  abstract     = {Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) dominate the tumor stroma in colorectal cancer (CRC), fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment that supports tumor growth, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Targeting CAF-derived cytokines and secreted proteins offers potential new avenues for CRC treatment. Here, vitronectin (VTN) is identified as a significantly up-regulated gene in CAFs, correlated with poor prognosis in CRC patients, through multi-dataset analysis and multiplex immunofluorescence. Comprehensive analyses, including cytometry by time -of- flight (CyTOF), in vitro co-culture assays, transgenic mouse models, and azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced CRC models, demonstrate that VTN enhances CRC proliferation, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. CyTOF analysis shows a reduced proportion of M2-type macrophages in fibroblast-specific VTN knockout mice ( Vtn fl/fl S100a4-Cre + ), with VTN promoting M2 macrophage polarization in vitro. Mechanistically, VTN upregulates SLC6A8 expression in CRC cells and macrophages by enhancing FAK phosphorylation, which increases creatine and ATP uptake, promoting cancer progression and macrophage polarization. Targeted VTN knockout in fibroblasts significantly improves the efficacy of immunotherapies and reduces CRC progression. These findings highlight the dual role of CAF-derived VTN in driving CRC malignancy and modulating immune responses, positioning VTN as a promising therapeutic target in CRC management.},

Comprehensive electrical measurements, including low-frequency noise analysis and weight update linearity evaluation, validate the memristors’ performance.

Additionally, the ferroelectric-based memristor exhibits a cycle-to-cycle variation of 3.52%, maintaining distinct reservoir states with minimal overlap.

BRD4 plays a pivotal role during embryogenesis and cancer development, but its function in modulating β-cell differentiation remains unknown. In this study, multiple models including calorie restriction db/db mouse, long-term and acute conditional knockout mouse, and human islet organoids are adopted to assess BRD4 function in β cells. Two hundred twenty-two young patients with diabetes are also recruited for whole exome sequencing (WES) to screen for BRD4 mutations. This study shows that BRD4 expression is significantly reduced in human diabetic β cells while significantly increased after calorie restriction in the diabetic mouse. β cell differentiation is impaired after long-term and acute Brd4 knockout. BRD4 knockdown in human islet organoids results in the loss of differentiation and reduction of insulin synthesis. It is found that p.R749C can significantly affect BRD4 signaling and might play roles in diabetes development in patients.

A formulaic description of spin-orbit AM conversion in coupled fields of two nonparaxial Bessel acoustic vortices is given by a thorough theoretical derivation. Experimental results of wave field measurements provide compelling evidence for spin-orbit AM conversion via passive artificial structures.

Although recent advancements have achieved impressive direct current (DC) performance in individual devices, research on the architectural design of CNT-based transistors remains limited. This gap is critical, as device architecture directly influences power consumption and switching speed at the circuit level. In particular, the balance between parasitic capacitance and resistance, key factors determining resistive-capacitive (RC) delay, has not been thoroughly addressed. In this study, top-gate CNT metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) that employ a novel low-κ extension doping technique are presented. This approach utilizes a stacked SiO x /AlF x layer (κ = 3.9 and 2.5) to enhance device performance while minimizing parasitic capacitance between the top gate and contact metal. The proposed approach improves the driving current by 8.4 times and reduces the total resistance by 85% when compared with CNT MOSFETs with undoped extensions. The doping level is tunable from 0.5 nm −1 to 0.59 nm −1 , with electrostatic doping driven by negative charges at the SiO x ​/AlF x interface. The benchmarking results demonstrate the record-low κ-value and physical thickness presented by the proposed approach, highlighting its potential for high-performance, high-speed applications.},

  abstract     = {High energy-density Li metal batteries with improved safety and cyclic performance can be achieved by adopting solid polymer electrolytes. However, current solid polymer electrolytes show inferior room-temperature ionic conductivity and Li-ion transference number (t Li+ ), impeding their practical applications. Herein, a 3-(pyridinium)propane-1-sulfonate zwitterionic covalent organic framework (PSZ-COF) incorporating a eutectic-like ion-conductive phase is prepared by making a complex with N -methyl- N -propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Pyrrol-FSI) and Li salts in its channels as a solid electrolyte (eutectic PSZ-COF). The eutectic PSZ-COF possesses a zwitterionic Li-salt-dissociating mode, a Pyrrol-FSI Li-cation-transporting carrier, and a pyridinium anion-holding trap in the ordered channels, providing a high ionic conductivity (0.127 mS cm −1 ) and t Li+ (0.62) at room temperature. Moreover, the eutectic PSZ-COF can suppress Li dendrites and drive a LiF/Li 3 N-rich solid electrolyte interface layer on a Li anode. Computational simulations reveal that the time-evolved average distance and hoping distance of Li + ions are significantly reduced in the eutectic PSZ-COF, allowing their facile migration. The all-solid-state Li metal batteries bearing eutectic PSZ-COF with a lithium iron phosphate(LFP) cathode (2.0 mg cm − 2 ) exhibit an initial capacity of 153.3 mAh g −1 , 99.9% Coulombic efficiency, and 100% capacity retention over 150 cycles at room temperature.

  abstract     = {Pro-inflammatory photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds immense potential to ignite robust and long-lasting systemic anti-tumor immune responses. However, the limited penetration depth of conventional ultra violet (UV)-visible irradiation and the tumor hypoxia microenvironment significantly constrain the efficacy of immune-regulatory PDT. Here, a mitochondria-targeting enhanced nanoplatform (NZ @TG ) is reported, activated by near-infrared (NIR) light-driven PDT, to address these challenges and amplify systemic anti-tumor immunity. This nanoplatform employs an interfacial lanthanide-organic triplet photosensation mechanism to realize localized oxidative damage of oxygen-rich mitochondria under NIR irradiation. Simultaneously, the exacerbated hypoxia induced by PDT activates a TH302 prodrug, resulting in cell cycle arrest in highly proliferative tumor cells. These combined effects trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to activate immune responses. This approach demonstrates significantly enhanced tumor ablation in deep-seated lesions in orthotopic liver tumor models and induces long-term anti-tumor immune memory. Moreover, the NIR-PDT-induced immune activation markedly improves the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy efficacy. This strategy offers a robust modality for immune activation in cancer therapy, paving the way for effective treatment of deep-seated tumors and preventing recurrence.},

Specifically, in this study, a novel narrow-band green phosphor, Na 0.6 Rb 0.4 BaB 9 O 15 (NRBBO): Eu 2+ , for laser display is obtained. Under chemical pressure, Eu 2+ migrates from Ba 2+ to Na + lattice sites in NRBBO, leading to a gradual decrease in the FWHM, making it more competitive for display applications. The existence of chemical pressure in the lattice is demonstrated through a high-pressure spectrum. The migration of Eu 2+ lattice sites under chemical pressure is verified by XRD refinement, low-temperature spectrum and EXAFS. NRBBO: 0.11Eu 2+ can be effectively excited by NUV and blue light, with an emission peak at 512 nm and a FWHM of 54 nm. It retains 82% of its luminescence intensity at 150 °C compared to room temperature. The luminous flux of NRBBO: 0.11Eu 2+ under 90.7 W mm −2 laser excitation reaches 2081.6 lm without light saturation. Meanwhile, the excellent CL performance demonstrates that NRBBO: 0.11Eu 2+ exhibits stability under high energy density. NRBBO: 0.11 Eu 2+ – based WLED achieves a color gamut of 106% NTSC. The excellent performance of NRBBO: 0.11Eu 2+ demonstrates great potential as a green phosphor for laser display applications.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the initial weeks of human development remains challenging due to ethical concerns and the restricted availability of human embryos. Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived epiblast models mimicking gastrulation processes have sparked significant interest in bridging this gap. However, as a newly emerging field, bioengineered models show limited production throughput and complexity in recapitulating epiblasts’ disc-shaped morphogenesis. Here, a well-defined laminin/alginate bioink to create epiblast-like models from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using electro-assisted bioprinting is proposed. This approach enables the generation of large-scale hiPSC-laden microgels that not only facilitate mass transfer but also mimic the structural characteristics of early embryos, which allow hiPSCs to self-organize into disc-like epiblast models with consistent morphology and phenotype. With adaptability to human embryonic stem cells, this method demonstrates the versatility of engineering reproducible epiblast-like models using various PSC lineages. Importantly, the bioactive components and physical confinement provided by the bioink, and the endogenous regulation of the WNT signaling pathway, contribute to disc-like morphogenesis, recapitulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition critical in the gastrulation process, and generation of the posterior epiblast population, directing the mass production of manipulable embryonic models for studying the spatiotemporal events and possible defects in early human development.},

This study demonstrates that GSDMD-CT acts as a negative regulator that suppresses IFN-I signaling during viral infection. Mechanistically, GSDMD-CT, released upon virus infection, interacts separately with retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and tank-binding kinase (TBK1), promoting the selective autophagic degradation of RIG-I via K48-linked polyubiquitination at Lys181 and TBK1 via K27-linked polyubiquitination at Lys487 by the E3 ligase TRIM28, which serves as a recognition signal for the cargo receptor NDP52 and TOLLIP, respectively. Moreover, the P414, Q416, and E459 amino sites are crucial for GSDMD-CT in counteracting antiviral responses. The findings highlight the role of GSDMD-CT in inhibiting antiviral immunity, providing insights into how viruses manipulate host defense mechanisms to enhance infection.},

  abstract     = {The core challenge in osteochondral tissue engineering is achieving the dual objectives of precise vascularization regulation and effective interface integration. Current tissue-engineering strategies have limitations in addressing these challenges. This study has regulated BMSC differentiation by optimizing the GT/PCL ratio and topological structure of nanofibrous materials, systematically comparing three different materials (r5G5P, a5G5P, and a7G3P), and employing a “rolling and folding” method in order to construct BMSC-NFMC composite structures. This approach achieves effective vascular isolation between the bone and cartilage layers. After implantation in nude mice, the a5G5P group exhibits distinct natural osteochondral tissue structural characteristics, which become more stable after 8 weeks of in vivo culture. Transcriptome sequencing analysis reveals that under ischemic conditions, the a5G5P group effectively regulates cartilage formation by inhibiting the Rap1 pathway and subsequently activating the ERK pathway. In rabbit articular osteochondral defect repair experiments, the a5G5P group successfully regenerates complete articular osteochondral structures similar to those of the adjacent natural tissues. The BMSC-NFMC structure can be used for both local and long-segment osteochondral defect repair, providing broader possibilities for clinical applications.},

Here, the proteome of bacteria evolved to overproduce cellulose is studied and its effect on the structure and mechanics of the resulting cellulose pellicles is investigated. Proteomic analysis reveals that the protein landscape of the evolved bacteria shows pronounced differences from that of native microorganisms.

This paper offers a comprehensive comparison between the actuation behavior of planar and HFDEAs using both analytical and numerical models. An electro-mechanical model establishes analytical correlations between the applied voltage and resulting strain. The results from the simplified model are subsequently compared with a numerical model in COMSOL Multiphysics, where simulations are run in more realistic conditions. Supporting experiments are conducted on HFDEAs with different geometries to validate the model. A geometric factor, β, is introduced to account for the influence of geometric parameters on actuator performance. The results show that HFDEAs exhibit higher strain compared to planar films. Among the different fiber geometries, those with smaller internal diameters and thinner walls exhibit higher axial strain and holding force while using the least amount of material.

  abstract     = {Bacterial endophthalmitis is an ophthalmological emergency that can lead to permanent blindness, and high-efficiency therapeutic strategies that can completely eradicate pathogens within a short timeframe are needed. However, intrinsic limitations of this disease, such as low administration frequency and dosage, render most currently available nano-antibacterial strategies inapplicable. To address this challenge, a bio-targeted catalytic strategy that is based on a bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst (MoS 2 /Fe@mercaptophenylboronic acid@hyaluronic acid, MFBH) and suitable for treating bacterial endophthalmitis is proposed. The results show that MFBH exhibits high-efficiency peptidoglycan-targeted catalytic antibacterial capacity against both standard and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus . Notably, the in vivo results demonstrate that MFBH achieves effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis at an extremely low dose (≈4 µg kg −1 ) via a single intravitreal injection without causing retinal damage. Importantly, the therapeutic efficacy of MFBH is comparable to that of vancomycin. Mechanistic analysis reveals that MFBH induces enhanced ferroptosis-like bacterial killing by accelerating reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst. Further investigations show that the generation of abundant ROS is closely associated with the sulfur vacancies and exposed of reactive Mo 4+ on the surface of the prepared artificial biocatalyst. In summary, this bacteria-specific artificial biocatalyst provides a promising strategy for treating endophthalmitis.},

  abstract     = {Liver fibrosis is a severe liver disease directly linked to chronic inflammation, in which hepatic macrophages play a key role. Growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is the receptor of nutrient-sensing hormone ghrelin that has essential functions in metabolism, inflammation, and wound-healing. However, the role of GHSR in liver fibrosis is unknown. This study uses a carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced liver fibrosis mouse model to investigate the role of macrophage GHSR in liver fibrosis. CCl 4 induces macrophage accumulation and inflammatory responses, noticeably increases GHSR expression in the liver. It is found that macrophage Ghsr deletion ( Ghsr-MϕKO ) attenuates CCl 4 -induced liver fibrosis and inflammation, showing reduced hepatic monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and suppressed proinflammatory responses. In macrophages, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 expression is positively correlated with GHSR expression. GHSR-associated TGF-β1 in macrophages activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by promoting the crosstalk between macrophages and HSCs. Macrophage GHSR controls inflammation and TGF-β1 expression via protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated Forkhead box protein O 1 (Foxo1) phosphorylation at S273; Foxo1-S273D mutation, mimicking constitutive phosphorylation of Foxo1 at S273, shows exacerbated CCl 4 -induced liver inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, targeting the macrophage GHSR−Foxo1 signaling may provide a new strategy to treat liver fibrosis.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior fracture resistance under cyclic loading–specifically, a high-fatigue limit–is crucial for ensuring structural safety and supporting a sustainable society. This study demonstrates a breakthrough in overcoming the conventional fatigue limit ceiling in high-strength as-quenched martensitic steel by enhancing resistance to crack initiation. In the as-heat-treated state, high-angle boundaries with large elastic misfits and plastic incompatibility served as precursory sites for intrusions/extrusions (these are defined as “crack embryos”), eventually leading to fatigue crack initiation. Remarkably, after the pre-fatigue training, surface crack initiation is entirely suppressed, doubling the fatigue limit with minimal change in tensile strength. A novel concept of “crack embryo engineering” is introduced, which targets the prevention of crack embryo formation by extracting intrinsic microstructural self-optimization against fatigue deformation: macroscopic hardness homogenization and selective nano-hardening of the precursory sites. This self-optimization strategy offers a versatile approach to improving fatigue limit in general steels, providing an effective alternative to tempering heat treatment that inevitably sacrifices tensile strength.},

This study aims to develop and validate a Vision Transformer (ViT) model based on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to classify HER2-zero, -low, and -positive breast cancer patients and to explore its interpretability. The model is trained and validated on early enhancement MRI images from 708 patients in the FUSCC cohort and tested on 80 and 101 patients in the GFPH cohort and FHCMU cohort, respectively. The ViT model achieves AUCs of 0.80, 0.73, and 0.71 in distinguishing HER2-zero from HER2-low/positive tumors across the validation set of the FUSCC cohort and the two external cohorts. Furthermore, the model effectively classifies HER2-low and HER2-positive cases, with AUCs of 0.86, 0.80, and 0.79. Transcriptomics analysis identifies significant biological differences between HER2-low and HER2-positive patients, particularly in immune-related pathways, suggesting potential therapeutic targets. Additionally, Cox regression analysis demonstrates that the prediction score is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR, 2.52; p = 0.007). These findings provide a non-invasive approach for accurately predicting HER2 expression, enabling more precise patient stratification to guide personalized treatment strategies. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate its clinical utility.},

  abstract     = {Icephobic surfaces offer a passive protection strategy against icing hazards in industrial applications. However, the improvement of surface icephobicity is normally accompanied by a compromise in mechanical properties and restrains the practical application of current icephobic surfaces/materials. Here, a generic strategy for icephobic material design is reported to address this conflict through interfacial elastic instability prompted by the synergistic integration of fibrous construction (FC) frameworks with icephobic polymers. The FC-based material structures could induce periodically localised/amplified stress at the ice/solid interface, leading to interfacial elastic instability and facilitating effective ice detachment. Low ice adhesion strength is achieved, while the tensile strength of the materials is enhanced by 19 times more than the polymer matrix due to the reinforcement from the FC frameworks. Based on the serrated features of the shear forces and numerically simulated interfacial stress distribution, a new theoretical model is established to interpret the nature of interfacial elastic instability and undulatory interfacial stress. This work provides fundamental insights for designing high-performance icephobic materials that transcend traditional performance trade-offs, advancing both surface science and materials for practical ice mitigation.},

  abstract     = {Brain organoid technology has revolutionized the ability to model human neurodevelopment in vitro. However, current techniques remain limited by their reliance on simplified endothelial cell populations. Multi-Region Brain Organoids (MRBOs) are engineered that integrate cerebral, mid/hindbrain, and complex endothelial organoids into one structure. Unlike earlier approaches based on isolated Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells, the endothelial organoids contain diverse vascular cell types, including progenitors, mature endothelial cells, pericytes, proliferating angiogenic cells, and stromal cells. The strategy employs sequential modulation of key developmental pathways to generate individual organoids, followed by optimized fusion conditions that maintain regional identities while supporting cellular integration. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals that MRBOs develop discrete neural populations specific to each brain region alongside specialized endothelial populations that establish paracrine signaling networks. Integration analysis with human fetal brain data shows that MRBOs contribute to 80% of cellular clusters found in human fetal brain tissue (Carnegie stages 12–16). CellChat analysis identifies 13 previously uncharacterized endothelial-neural signaling interactions. Endothelial-derived factors are uncovered that support intermediate progenitor populations during hindbrain development, but not cerebral development, revealing a role for endothelial populations in regional brain patterning. This platform enables matching of multiple developmental regions while incorporating endothelial components, providing opportunities for studying neurodevelopmental disorders with disrupted neural-endothelial interactions.},

  abstract     = {Nitric oxide (NO), a pivotal redox signaling molecule, coordinates plant development and immune responses through S -nitrosylation-mediated protein modification. While NO-dependent S -nitrosylation fine-tunes immune responses, whether pathogens hijack this process to subvert plant immunity remains unclear. Here it is shown that S -nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), which maintains NO homeostasis by degrading S -nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), positively regulates tomato resistance to Phytophthora capsici . Active-site mutations in GSNOR abolished its function in plant defense. Remarkably, GSNOR is manipulated by PcRD18, which is an RxLR effector of P. capsici that is involved in virulence of this oomycete pathogen. PcRD18 elevates the cellular NO content and S -nitrosylation levels by dually inhibiting GSNOR activity and promoting its autophagy-mediated degradation via enhanced ATG8c interaction. Structure analysis reveals critical PcRD18-GSNOR interaction interfaces and mutations in these sites of PcRD18 abolish its ability to interact with GSNOR, thereby blocking the effector's ability to elevate NO levels, suppress the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst, and enhance virulence. GSNOR mutations disrupting PcRD18 binding produced a mutant form of GSNOR enhancing Phytophthora resistance. These findings unveil a pathogen strategy to subvert NO homeostasis through effector-mediated hijacking of GSNOR and suggest that engineering the host-pathogen interface to disrupt the interaction between GSNOR and PcRD18 will enhance crop disease resistance.},

Exploring new strategies to enhance the efficacy and reduce toxicity of RT has great clinical importance. Here, a PD-L1 affibody (Z PD-L1 ) grafted Janus Ag/Ag 2 S nanoarchitectures is developed as “reactive oxygen species lever” to enhance radiocatalysis and relieve radiation enteritis. The nanoplatform can achieve abundant energy deposition in the form of high-energy electrons within tumors upon X-ray exposure. Subsequently, the transfer of electrons from Ag 2 S to Ag moiety enables effective electron–hole pair separation, which greatly improves the radiocatalysis efficiency in generating highly toxic hydroxyl radical (•OH). Due to the specific binding to tumor PD-L1, Z PD-L1 endows this nanoplatform with efficient tumor targeting and meanwhile reduces immune suppression of T cells by achieving PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, intensifying RT-induced immunologic cell death. Notably, the presence of the Ag moiety allows the nanoplatform to act as an H 2 O 2 scavenger in intestinal tissues during metabolism, effectively relieving radiation enteritis. Moreover, systemic administration of the nanoplatform coupled with Mn-DOTA can guide RT timing selection by magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, this nanoplatform can substantially improve RT effectiveness with reduced radiation enteritis, demonstrating considerable potential in tumor RT.},

The enhancement is confined to the designed resonant energy, while photons with off-resonance energies are fully reflected, making the TP photodetector an ideal candidate for compact and efficient image sensors, eliminating the need for additional filters or bulky microlenses for color discrimination or photon collection. Furthermore, the photocurrent generated by the TP photodetector can be regulated by varying light pulse stimulations, enabling it to mimic the synaptic dynamics of the human brain. By integrating the functions of perception, processing, and memorization of visual images, its potential for facial recognition through simulation based on a 64 × 64 array of TP photodetectors under the artificial neural network-based weight-update expectation thresholding model is demonstrated.

Here, the aim is to examine how stacking of two pathways for mitigation–CDR, via soil organic carbon (SOC) accrual and GHG emissions avoidance via antimethanogenic feed additives–impacts net GHG emissions associated with sheep production. A nonlinear programing approach is invoked to elicit optimal combinations of grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives to maximize farm profit and/or minimize net GHG emissions. It is shown that stacking multiple interventions realizes that greater abatement and profit do any singular intervention. Adoption of 3-NOP feed supplement with 15- and 30-paddock high stocking rate systems is the most prospective stacked intervention for concurrent profit maximization and emissions minimization. It is contended that (1) increasing payments for farming of carbon and ecosystems services relative to that of wool and meat will stimulate participation in carbon markets, (2) economics of participation in carbon markets tend to be more favorable for larger farms than smaller farms due to economies of scale and (3) adoption of optimal grazing management and antimethanogenic feed additives can realize more profit from sheep production and carbon farming than enterprises that only derive income from sheep production.},

The results demonstrated that podocyte-specific RIPK3-KO alleviated albuminuria, mesangial matrix proliferation, foot process fusion, and podocyte loss in DKD mice. Additionally, podocyte RIPK3 is upregulated in renal biopsies with DKD and expression is negatively correlated with albuminuria. In vitro, knockdown of RIPK3 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibition with GSK'872 prevented podocyte injury. RNA sequencing of mouse podocytes revealed that the knockdown of RIPK3 can alleviate HG-induced activation of the NF-κB-related inflammatory pathways. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of RIPK3 by GSK'872 alleviated podocyte damage, and reduced proteinuria in DKD mice. Overall, these results uncovered a novel role of podocyte RIPK3 in promoting podocyte injury and DKD progression by regulating NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling independent of necroptosis, offering novel insights and potential therapeutic strategies for DKD management.},

  abstract     = {Dysregulated RNA splicing has emerged as a pervasive yet understudied feature of cancer. The small GTPase RAC1 undergoes splicing changes in multiple cancers. However, the in vivo functional disparities between the two major RAC1 isoforms, RAC1B and the canonical RAC1A, and their therapeutic implications in cancer remain largely unexplored. Here, RAC1B is found to be significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, particularly in those harboring EGFR mutations. Through isoform-specific overexpression and depletion assays in murine and cellular models of EGFR -mutant LUAD, it is revealed that RAC1B, but not RAC1A, promotes LUAD cell proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, RAC1B stabilizes EGFR by inhibiting its lysosome trafficking and degradation. This function is mediated by the specific binding of RAC1B to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GDS1, which activates RAC1B. The splicing factor RBM10 which is frequently mutated in LUAD is further identified as a negative regulator of RAC1B . Importantly, utilizing LUAD patient-derived organoid and xenograft models, it is demonstrated that targeting RAC1B potently suppresses tumor growth and enhances the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors. Together, the findings delineate functional differences and underlying mechanisms of RAC1 isoforms in LUAD tumorigenesis, highlighting a promising therapeutic route via targeting RAC1B for lung cancer.},

Although promising, the lack of appropriate structural design strategy and limitation of sensing performance in the clinical samples remain challenging for the practical application of nanozymes. Herein, a novel copper silicate nanozyme (CSHSs-Ar) with enhanced peroxidase-like catalytic activity is synthesized through a facile in situ valence-engineered approach. After the optimization of synthesis, the resultant CSHSs-Ar nanozymes containing nearly 60% of Cu + hold a higher peroxidase-like catalytic activity and a better catalytic specificity than the other two derivatives (CSHSs and CSHSs-air). Theoretical calculations also demonstrate that CSHSs-Ar nanozymes are more beneficial toward the activation of H 2 O 2 compared with CSHSs and CSHSs-air. On this basis, the well-developed CSHSs-Ar nanozyme-involved system is employed as an efficient colorimetric sensor for the detection of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) and prediction for periodontitis. Moreover, several visual molecular logic gates are explored as a proof of concept to the application of CSHSs-Ar nanozymes with superior peroxidase-like catalytic activity. This study not only provides guidance for the development of novel nanozymes, but also broadens the biomedical application potential of nanozymes including the detection of oral diseases.},

Hydrogen molecule (H 2 ) is proved as an emerging anti-inflammatory and anti-IRI agent with high biological safety, while local warm heating is well identified and able to improve tissue microcirculation for promoting wound repair. This work proposes a new strategy of visible-photocatalytic hydrogen/warm heat production for combination treatment of PU, and develops palladium nanodots-deposited hydrogen-doped titanium dioxide nanorod (HTON-Pd) as a novel multifunctional photocatalyst, achieving controllable and sustainable visible-photocatalytic production of H 2 and heat. Daily administration of the HTON-Pd encapsulated hydrogel dressing (HTON-Pd@Gel) with the assistance of visible light irradiation receives a high outcome of PU treatment. The stubborn PU wound has completely been cured after 11-day treatment with HTON-Pd@Gel. Mechanistically, hydrogen and warm heat photocatalytically produced by HTON-Pd improve the PU wound microenvironment by synergistically promoting the proliferation and migration of skin cells, inhibiting their apoptosis, reducing the inflammatory response, and boosting the generation of new blood vessels in support of PU wound healing.},

  abstract     = {Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is characterized by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. During I/R, the accumulation and oxidation of succinate contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, worsening tissue damage. Histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3 (HINT3) is identified as a regulator of mitochondrial function and cardiomyocyte survival during I/R. In a mouse I/R model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) model, it shows that HINT3 expression is downregulated after I/R. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of HINT3 exacerbates myocardial injury, impairs cardiac function, and promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, whereas HINT3 overexpression mitigates these effects. Mechanistically, HINT3 interacts with succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA), suppresses HDAC1 expression, and prevents SDHA deacetylation at K335, reducing SDH activity and mitochondrial ROS production. These findings highlight the HINT3-HDAC1-SDHA axis as a key pathway in mitochondrial regulation, offering new insights and therapeutic targets for myocardial reperfusion injury.},

  abstract     = {Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory lung injury for which effective therapeutic agents are lacking. Excessive endothelial cell (EC) activation is a critical trigger of inflammation. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as prominent regulators of inflammatory responses. The previous study identified secretory autophagosomes (SAPs), a novel class of EVs, as a prognostic marker in ARDS, raising questions of whether and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Here, it is shown that inflamed macrophage-derived SAPs (MSAPs) exacerbate lung injury by weakening the role of ECs as gatekeepers of immune cell transport within the lung. Bioinformatics and functional studies reveal that tRF-5004b is a key molecule of MSAPs in mediating endothelial activation. Mechanically, tRF-5004b directly interacts with the nuclear transporter KPNA2, thereby facilitating the association between KPNA2 and the transcription factor p65. This interaction enhances p65 nuclear translocation, a process implicated in EC activation. Additionally, the level of tRF-5004b is positively correlated with the severity of ARDS, and patients with high tRF-5004b levels have a poor prognosis. Overall, it is found that tRF-5004b-enriched SAPs induce acute lung injury by promoting p65 nuclear translocation to activate ECs, suggesting that tRF-5004b may be a novel therapeutic target for ARDS.},

  abstract     = {Recent advancements in proteomics sequencing have significantly enhanced our ability to explore cell-type-specific signatures within complex tissues, providing critical insights into disease mechanisms. However, current proteomic technologies often suffer from low resolution, resulting in the mixing of multiple cell types during profiling. To address this limitation, cell-type deconvolution methods are developed to infer cellular composition from proteomic data. While most existing deconvolution methods are focused on transcriptomics, their application to proteomics is hindered by the weak correlation and divergent quantification between transcriptome and proteome data. Although a few proteomic-specific deconvolution methods are recently emerged, they still exhibit limited capability and performance, partly because they only extract shared information from individual samples while ignoring higher-order relationships between them. Here, GraphDEC is proposed, a novel graph neural network-based method for dec iphering cell type proportions in proteomic profiling data. GraphDEC begins by simulating bulk samples from single-cell proteomic data to create reference data, which is then used to infer cell types in target datasets. Specifically, GraphDEC employs an autoencoder to extract low-dimensional representations from both reference and target proteomic data, enabling the construction of similarity relationships among samples. These relationships, combined with proteomic data, are processed by a graph neural network that integrates a multi-channel mechanism and a hybrid neighborhood-aware approach to learn highly effective representations. To optimize the model, GraphDEC utilizes multiple loss functions, including triplet loss, domain adaptation loss, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, ensuring robust performance and mitigating batch effects. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that GraphDEC achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse synthetic proteomic datasets from different sequencing technologies and real-world spatial proteomic datasets. Furthermore, GraphDEC exhibits strong generalization capabilities, showing high efficiency when applied to cross-species proteomic data and even transcriptomics.},

In contrast, red blood cell (RBC) membrane lipidomics may serve as stable biomarkers that are unaffected by plasma volume changes. Two cohorts are included to investigate the association between RBC indicators and CHF. RBC membrane lipidomics is first used to characterize CHF and its impact on plasma volume overload (PVO) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The first cohort (n = 507,638) shows that the erythrocyte stress index (ESI), better than traditional RBC indicators, is associated with the prevalence of CHF with odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 1.57 (95% CI,1.55-1.59). ESI is also linked with in-hospital death in CHF. Another cohort (n = 1,550) indicated RBC membrane lipidomics ceramide subtype Cer 18:0;O2/16:0 and lysophosphatidylethanolamine subtype LPE 18:0 has an AUC of PVO with 0.75 and 0.61.

This phase is well conductive and ferromagnetic in a wide temperature range, with the highest Curie temperature of ≈275 K among the 4 d /5 d -TMOs. Particularly, this interfacial phase shows a considerably improved saturation magnetization (≈2 µ B /Ru, twice that of the bulk counterpart), and a greatly reduced coercive force. All these features are highly desired by the application of spin-orbit torque. Due to the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, such a Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 interfacial phase exhibits a significantly larger anomalous Hall conductivity than the typical 3 d oxide ferromagnet La 2/3 Sr 1/3 MnO 3 near room temperature. Analyses based on the techniques of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, polarized-neutron reflectometry, and scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a magnetic exchange interaction between the interfacial phases of Ca 0.5 Sr 0.5 RuO 3 and LaMnO 3 and an obvious expansion of the interfacial Mn─O─Mn bond angle, stabilizing the high-temperature ferromagnetic state of the CSRO/LMO interface.},

  abstract     = {Cas12j-8 is a compact Cas nuclease discovered from the metagenome of giant bacteriophages, consisting of only 717 amino acids and recognizing the ‘5-TTN-3′ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. However, its low gene editing efficiency in mammalian cells limits its application in therapeutic gene editing. To address this limitation, structure-guided mutagenesis is employed to replace key negatively charged residues with arginine, strengthening DNA binding. The resulting quintuple mutant, engineered Cas12j-8 (enCas12j-8), demonstrates robust on-target editing efficiency comparable to LbCas12a while maintaining low off-target effects. Cytosine base editors (CBEs) and adenine base editors (ABEs) are developed using enCas12j-8, achieving up to 29.54-fold C-to-T and 36.57-fold A-to-G conversion efficiency compared with the wild-type at the dominated sites, respectively. Notably, enCas12j-8 enables multiplexed editing of three genomic loci simultaneously via a single crRNA array, achieving efficiencies comparable to single-guide approaches.

  abstract     = {The self-assembly of micrometer-to-millimeter components, referred to as “macroscopic supramolecular assembly (MSA),” offers an efficient approach for constructing cell-scale 3D bioactive structures with flexible modular designs. Compared with available 3D bio-printing or conventional modular assembly of cell-material units, MSA is advantageous in decoupling material preparation and cell loading processes by directing cell adhesion after the preparation of 3D structures, which minimizes the trade-off between cell viability and material selection. But the challenge lies in efficient self-sorting of different cells and spatially controlled cell distribution. Hence, MSA is combined with the surface chemistry of orthogonally specific peptides to different cells and magnetic manipulation, and fabricated 3D bioactive structures that direct cell sorting. Microscale polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) components are modified with 1) Arg-Glu-Asp-Val and Val-Ala-Pro-Gly peptides affinitive to endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), respectively, and 2) host/guest molecules as “supramolecular glues” for precise structuring and interfacial bonding. Self-sorting and spatially controlled adhesion of ECs and SMCs is achieved to mimic layered vascular structures. This “Lego-like” strategy is free of compromising cell viability with structure design, thus contributing to spatially intricate and bioactive 3D architectures, and promoting the development of MSA from fundamental advances to applications.},

Challenging this concept, it shows AC-electropolymerization to be a powerful platform for the development of morphology-dependent computing hardware, thanks precisely to its intrinsic stochasticity. The findings reveal that electropolymerized polymer dendrite networks exhibit a complex structure-operation relationship that allows to implement nearly linear to nonlinear functions. Moreover, dendritic networks can integrate a limitless number of inputs from their environment, which can be used to the advantage in the context of in materio computing to discriminate between different spatiotemporal inputs. These results position electropolymerization as a pivotal technique for the bottom-up implementation of computationally powerful objects. This study anticipates this study to help shifting the negative perception of variability in the material science community and promote the electropolymerization framework as a foundation for the development of a new generation of hardware defined by its topological richness.},

  abstract     = {The nervous system plays a pivotal regulatory role in the maintenance of bone homeostasis, and the protective effects of dopamine and its receptors on bone metabolism are emerging. Despite these protective roles, the functional contribution of dopaminergic signaling, particularly through specific receptor subtypes, remains unexplored in glucocorticoid (GC)-associated osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) pathogenesis. Here, the dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1), a G protein-coupled receptor with few identified bone-related functions, is identified as a positive regulator of GC-induced apoptosis. The dopamine levels in the serum of GC-associated ONFH patients are significantly lower than those in the normal population. The protein and gene expression levels of DRD1 and the number of DRD1-positive cells are abnormally elevated in the pathological state of GC-associated ONFH, and DRD1 is expressed in osteoblasts. Overexpression of DRD1 attenuates GC-induced osteogenic inhibition and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, overexpression of DRD1 elevates cAMP levels, activates downstream protein kinase A, and inhibits GC-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis through the ATF3/CHOP signaling pathway, thus improving bone homeostasis. Importantly, Madopar, an FDA-approved dopaminergic agent, inhibits GC-induced osteoblastic apoptosis and ONFH via DRD1. Collectively, this study not only deciphers a previously unrecognized DRD1-mediated neuro-osteogenic axis but also repurposes an FDA-approved drug (Madopar) for precision ONFH management.},

The dock-and-design pipeline retrieves complementary scaffolds from a protein structure database to a given query epitope, where the scaffold is mutated to carve a binding site de novo . The docking step utilizes a novel fingerprint that greatly simplifies and accelerates the surface complementarity evaluation. As proof-of-concept, we designed protein binders to target three distinct epitopes on two different oncogenic targets; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-7 receptor-α (IL-7Rα). Experimental characterization of only 24 candidates identified nanomolar binders against each of the target epitopes, where the binders belonged to five different folds. Several designs were active in vitro. Moreover, anti-VEGF designs showed tumor-inhibiting activity in vivo, highlighting their therapeutic potential.},

  abstract     = {Disturbed blood flow and the resulting oscillatory low shear stress (OSS) are key contributors to vascular endothelial dysfunction and the initiation of atherosclerosis. However, the molecular mediators that translate abnormal hemodynamic signals into pathological vascular endothelial responses remain unclear. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are classical mechanosensors in the vascular endothelium. Here, using vascular endothelial-specific knockout mice, in vitro parallel plate flow chamber systems, and phosphoproteomic analysis, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is identified as a central mediator of OSS-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction. Mechanistically, OSS promotes GRK2 phosphorylation at serine 29, which subsequently activates the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), increasing the expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecules intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). In parallel, AP-1 promotes nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A 1 (NR4A1) transcription, which anchors liver kinase B1 (LKB1) to the nucleus and suppresses downstream AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, leading to metabolic dysregulation and impaired vascular endothelial homeostasis. These findings underscore the GRK2/AP-1 signaling axis as a crucial mechanotransduction cascade linking disturbed flow to vascular endothelial dysfunction. Given the important role of GPCRs in mechanotransduction, targeting GRK2 may offer a novel therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis.},

Importantly, the phase transition couples spontaneous strain, bistable magnetism with switchable dielectric properties. Another distinctive feature of 1 is its pronounced dielectric anisotropy and high dielectric permittivity, which arise due to a barrier layer capacitor effect due to cation displacement polarization and significant electron polarization of the highly conjugated anions.

The process of photosynthesis is exemplary for utilizing sunlight as a regenerative energy source. Enzymes like hydrogenases, which reduce protons to molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) under ambient conditions, are model biocatalysts for generating sustainable, clean fuels. In green algae, photosynthesis and hydrogenases are coupled through ferredoxin, a small electron transfer protein. Here, it is shown that several plant-type ferredoxins can interact with a chemically synthesized active site cofactor analog of [FeFe]-hydrogenases in a way that allows comparably high H 2 evolution rates. UV–vis and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that the natural [2Fe-2S] clusters of the ferredoxin hosts must be absent for a functional interaction of polypeptide and cofactor mimic and that the apo-ferredoxins shield the H 2 -producing cofactor from the solvent. The hybrid proteins exhibited higher O 2 tolerance than natural [FeFe]-hydrogenases and generated H 2 in light-dependent cascades based on photosystem I or the chemical photosensitizer proflavine. These features and the combination of natural hosts and cofactors might contribute to establishing sustainable light-dependent H 2 production systems.},

Thin films of three copolymers, upon doping, demonstrate appreciable conductivity under ambient conditions. EPL- g -O3HT-1 could be fully break down over 12 days by enzymatic degradation. EPL- g -O3HT-1 also displays excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, attributed to its high ɛ-poly-L-lysine content. It is further demonstrated the versatility of EPL- g -O3HTs in transient electronics for electromyography sensors for muscle signal acquisition and as the channel material in organic electrochemical transistors.

  abstract     = {Early childhood caries (ECC) is one of the most common chronic diseases among children globally, affecting the health and quality of life of children. Despite various treatments, cariogenic bacteria persist, resulting in a pessimistic outlook for the prevention and treatment of ECC. A notable presence of persister cells is found within the cariogenic bacterial population, with their dormancy enabling them to evade antiseptics. Mechanistically, the downregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) leads to protein aggresome formation, converting active cariogenic bacteria into persisters, which confers dual defensive barriers through metabolic inertness and concomitant reduction of membrane permeability, rendering conventional antimicrobials ineffective. Given these findings, Ti 3 C 2 MXene, a 2D nanomaterial acting as a “nanothermal knife” to disrupt persister cell membranes is developed. Ti 3 C 2 -mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) upregulated HSPs, inhibited aggresome formation, and prevented persister dormancy, showing efficacy against planktonic and biofilm cariogenic persisters. This PTT strategy demonstrates remarkable efficacy against planktonic cariogenic persisters and multispecies biofilms. Furthermore, the in vivo establishment of aggressive caries models reveals a substantial reduction of cariogenic pathogens following combined Ti 3 C 2 -mediated PTT and antimicrobial treatment, effectively suppressing caries progression. This light-assisted antibacterial strategy may aid ECC prevention.},

Herein, assisted with a catalytic-hairpin-assembly (CHA) amplifier and rational orthogonal design, the first universal weak-inputs-strong-outputs DNA system (named CP-WISO) with contrary logic responses is reported, which exhibited noticeable advantages over previous works. 1) Excellent FRET effect of dual-signal DNA probes (Cy3/Cy5) brought enriched contrary logic output channels; 2) One-step CHA amplification avoided DNAs’ over-consumption, high cost, and complexity; 3) A library of CP-WISO DNA logic nanodevices with the manipulated orthogonal design is realized, accompanied with enhanced flexibility, maneuverability, and computing proficiency; 4) Even and odd parity generators/checkers (pG/pC) are concurrently operated based on the “XOR∧XNOR”-type CP-WISO nanodevice, ensuring the recognition of erroneous bits and secure molecular data transmission; 5) Additionally, taking miRNA-499, miRNA-21 and miRNA-122 as alternative model targets, the “YES∧NOT” and “AND∧NAND” CP-WISO nanodevices achieved intelligent identification and ratiometric fluorescent detection of miRNAs in human serums, promoting the early diagnostics of acute myocardial infarction and liver cancer.},

  abstract     = {Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with the tumor microenvironment (TME) playing a critical role in its progression. Metabolic reprogramming, particularly lactate accumulation, drives immune suppression within the TME. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of 30 LUAD samples, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) involving 29,863 patients and 55,586 controls, and clinical data from 220 LUAD patients, we identified N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) as a key pathogenic gene in LUAD, strongly associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that NDRG1 stabilizes lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby enhancing glycolysis and promoting lactate accumulation. This process fosters immune suppression by inducing M2 macrophage polarization, impairing CD8 + T cell function, and upregulating immunosuppressive genes. Furthermore, histone H3K18 lactylation in macrophages exacerbates this immunosuppressive state. Clinically, elevated NDRG1 expression correlates with increased PD-L1 levels, a higher abundance of immunosuppressive macrophages, and reduced CD8 + T cell infiltration, contributing to immunotherapy resistance. Conversely, low NDRG1 expression is associated with enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration and improved therapeutic outcomes. Preclinical studies demonstrated targeting NDRG1 suppresses tumor growth, alleviates immune suppression, and boosts anti-PD-L1 efficacy. These findings establish NDRG1 as a critical LUAD regulator and a promising immunotherapy target.},

  abstract     = {Heterostructured composite materials with multiple components have potential applications in diverse aspects, as they tend to exhibit superior physicochemical properties than the sum of their single counterparts. However, the fabrication of heterostructures composed of atomic-precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) is seldom reported owing to their inherent instability, leading to the decomposition of metal NCs during the formation of peripheral layers. Here, a spontaneously formed amorphous-crystalline heterostructured Ag 40 @Ag 12 is discovered, wherein the amorphous Ag 40 NCs are enveloped by a single crystal of Ag 12 NCs. The formation of Ag 40 @Ag 12 involves three stages, including initial crystallization of Ag 40 NCs, partial decomposition (self-sacrifice) of Ag 40 NCs enabling Ag 12 assembly, and epitaxial-growth crystallization of the Ag 12 NCs. The partially decomposed Ag 40 NCs provide starting materials for the formation and crystallization of Ag 12 NCs to encapsulate the Ag 40 seeds, while the residual Ag 40 loses its crystallinity in solution simultaneously. This work not only reports a novel class of heterostructured materials for the first time but also provides new insights into the macroscopic co-assembly of distinct silver clusters.},

  abstract     = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by persistent inflammation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis leading to end-stage renal disease. Transient receptor potential canonical 6 (TRPC6) channel inhibition mitigates tubular injury and renal fibrosis in murine models of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and 2-month chronic post–ischemia-reperfusion injury (2m post-I/R). Through integrated analysis of single-cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from UUO mice treated with the selective TRPC6 inhibitor SH045, here the renoprotective cell composition and cell type-specific transcriptional programs are defined. We explored translational aspects by conducting an in-depth scRNA-Seq analysis of kidney samples from patients with CKD. These results reveal global transcriptional shifts with a dramatic diversification of inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Notably, a distinct subpopulation of novel endothelial cells is delineated, which is termed ECRIN, that regulate inflammatory networks implicating VEGF and GAS signaling pathways. The data also indicates that inhibition of TRPC6 channels triggers a Prnp transcription factor regulatory network, which contributes to the alleviation of renal fibrosis. The key findings are supported at the protein level by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. We observed similar patterns in the chronic 2m postI/R injury model. These findings provide novel insights into the potential therapeutic benefits of TRPC6 inhibition in CKD.},

Developing a culture system to bridge the gap is thus crucial. Here, a multicellular approach is employed using human glia and vascular cells to optimize a 3D brain vascular niche model that enabled not only long-term culture of patient derived GBM cells but also recapitulation of key features of GBM heterogeneity, in particular invasion behavior and vascular association. Comparative transcriptomics of identical patient derived GBM cells in 3D and in vivo xenotransplants models revealed that glia-vascular contact induced genes concerning neural/glia development, synaptic regulation, as well as immune suppression. This gene signature displayed region specific enrichment in the leading edge and microvascular proliferation zones in human GBM and predicted poor prognosis. Gene variance analysis also uncovered histone demethylation and xylosyltransferase activity as main themes for gene adaption of GBM cells in vivo. Furthermore, the 3D model also demonstrated the capacity to provide a quiescence and a protective niche against chemotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are dynamic macromolecular condensates that act as crucibles to modulate cellular processes. Since MLOs form in the absence of lipid membranes, it is important to understand how their effective regulation is achieved by the protein homeostasis (proteostasis) system. To address this question, a comprehensive mapping of the proteostasis network (PN) of MLOs, comprising over 220 000 protein–protein interactions is reported. This analysis reveals how regulatory proteins (PN proteins) occupy central roles in the overall protein–protein interaction network of MLOs. It is then investigated which branches of the PN are most important in the regulation of MLOs, finding that the anabolic component, which makes up ≈30% of the PN, is more closely involved than the catabolic component, which makes up the remaining ≈70% of the PN. It is also found that translation-related PN proteins and molecular chaperones play central roles in MLO regulation. Finally, how specificity may be achieved despite shared PN components is explored. These findings suggest that HSP70 chaperones function as generic MLO regulators, while client-specific HSP70 co-chaperones confer specificity to the chaperone action. These results identify the composition of the PN of MLOs, rationalize its organization, and reveal central roles of molecular chaperones in protein regulation within MLOs.},

In this study, single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and high-resolution spatial transcriptomics are employed to comprehensively investigate the development trajectories and the TME. The results revealed that PSCC cells mimicked the differentiation and tissue organization of normal penile epithelium, independent of the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection status. Notably, a spatial subtype, Tum_1, appeared at early stage of tumor differentiation and in tumor–normal boundary regions. This subtype exhibited enhanced basal-like and stemness features and showed high LAMC2 expression, which activated laminin-integrin signaling via ITGA6/ITGB4, promoting tumor invasiveness. Furthermore, the results indicated that HPV-positive basal stem-like neoplasms dampened the immune function of T cells and macrophages, promoting an immunosuppressive environment that facilitates tumor progression. Supporting this, the patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma who have high expression of HPV-positive Tum_1 signatures derived greater benefit from PD-1 blockade therapy. In summary, the findings provide a comprehensive spatial landscape of the PSCC TME and suggest potential treatment approaches targeting laminin-integrin interaction and immunotherapy, especially in HPV-positive patients.},

  abstract     = {Diabetes is widely acknowledged as a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis, facilitating plaque formation through various mechanisms. Although both conditions are linked to the aging process, the relationship among cellular senescence, diabetes, and atherosclerosis remains inadequately understood. This study presents evidence that elevated glucose levels expedite the progression of atherosclerosis by promoting macrophage senescence. Increased glucose levels are shown to induce senescence in macrophages, which enhances the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) and facilitates the formation of foam cells. This mechanism is driven by lactate production via glycolysis, which activates the lactate receptor GPR132, thereby promoting macrophage senescence. The activation of GPR132 is implicated in mediating senescence and lipid uptake through Src phosphorylation. The deletion of GPR132 markedly reduces macrophage senescence and atherosclerosis in mouse models. Furthermore, saracatinib, a specific Src inhibitor, has been demonstrated to effectively alleviate diabetic atherosclerosis in experimental settings. In clinical samples, elevated plasma lactate levels and the activation of the GPR132-Src pathway in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are positively associated with coronary stenosis. These findings propose a potential mechanism through which diabetes accelerates atherosclerosis via the lactate-GPR132-Src pathway, underscoring macrophage senescence as a pivotal target in the context of diabetic atherosclerosis.},

The trial is a 19-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in Chengdu, China, with 121 participants (60–70 years). Participants are randomly assigned to either NTs (1.2 g day −1 ) or placebo group (1:1).

  abstract     = {The DARPA Transfer from Imprecise and Abstract Models to Autonomous Technologies (TIAMAT) program aims to address rapid and robust transfer of autonomy technologies across dynamic and complex environments, goals, and platforms. Existing methods for simulation-to-reality (sim-to-real) transfer often rely on high-fidelity simulations and struggle with broad adaptation, particularly in time-sensitive scenarios. Although many approaches have shown incredible performance at specific tasks, most techniques fall short when posed with unforeseen, complex, and dynamic real-world scenarios due to the inherent limitations of simulation. In contrast to current research that aims to bridge the gap between simulation environments and the real world through increasingly sophisticated simulations and a combination of methods typically assuming a small sim-to-real gap—such as domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning, policy distillation, and dynamic optimization—TIAMAT takes a different approach by instead emphasizing transfer and adaptation of the autonomy stack directly to real-world environments by utilizing a breadth of low(er)-fidelity simulations to create broadly effective sim-to-real transfers. By abstractly learning from multiple simulation environments in reference to their shared semantics, TIAMAT's approaches aim to achieve abstract-to-real transfer for effective and rapid real-world adaptation. Furthermore, this program endeavors to improve the overall autonomy pipeline by addressing the inherent challenges in translating simulated behaviors into effective real-world performance.},

Now in its fourth year, our “AI for Georgia” project (AI4GA) has provided PD to 20 teachers and AI education to over 1600 students. The AI4GA curriculum does more than foster AI literacy: It empowers students to view themselves as creators of AI-powered technology and to think about future career options that involve the use of AI.

This paper adopts a design science research (DSR) approach to develop the equity-aware design thinking for AI (EquiThink4AI) framework, a dual-component model that systematically embeds equity principles into AI education. EquiThink4AI's first component extends design thinking (DT) by incorporating principles from EquityXDesign (EXD) and liberatory design (LD), ensuring that equity concerns are proactively addressed throughout AI system development. The second component enhances the framework with pedagogical strategies, including problem-based learning (PBL), experiential learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration, fostering student engagement, real-world problem-solving, and ethical reasoning. EquityThink4AI provides educators and students with a structured methodology for teaching and applying equity-centered AI development.

  abstract     = {As generative artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into society and education, more institutions are implementing AI usage policies and offering introductory AI courses. These courses, however, should not replicate the technical focus typically found in introductory computer science (CS) courses like CS1 and CS2. In this paper, we use an adjustable, interdisciplinary socio-technical AI literacy framework to design and present an introductory AI literacy course. We present a refined version of this framework informed by the teaching of a 1-credit general education AI literacy course (primarily for freshmen and first-year students from various majors), a 3-credit course for CS majors at all levels, and a summer camp for high school students. Drawing from these teaching experiences and the evolving research landscape, we propose an introductory AI literacy course design framework structured around four cross-cutting pillars. These pillars encompass (1) understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI technologies, (2) learning how to interact with (generative) AI technologies, (3) applying principles of critical, ethical, and responsible AI usage, and (4) analyzing implications of AI on society. We posit that achieving AI literacy is essential for all students, those pursuing AI-related careers, and those following other educational or professional paths. This introductory course, positioned at the beginning of a program, creates a foundation for ongoing and advanced AI education. The course design approach is presented as a series of modules and subtopics under each pillar. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful instructional design, including pedagogy, expected learning outcomes, and assessment strategies. This approach not only integrates social and technical learning but also democratizes AI education across diverse student populations and equips all learners with the socio-technical, multidisciplinary perspectives necessary to navigate and shape the ethical future of AI.},

  abstract     = {Many research fields are currently reckoning with issues of poor levels of reproducibility. Some label it a “crisis,” and research employing or building machine learning (ML) models is no exception. Issues including lack of transparency, data or code, poor adherence to standards, and the sensitivity of ML training conditions mean that many papers are not even reproducible in principle. Where they are, though, reproducibility experiments have found worryingly low degrees of similarity with original results. Despite previous appeals from ML researchers on this topic and various initiatives from conference reproducibility tracks to the ACM's new Emerging Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability, we contend that the general community continues to take this issue too lightly. Poor reproducibility threatens trust in and integrity of research results. Therefore, in this article, we lay out a new perspective on the key barriers and drivers (both procedural and technical) to increased reproducibility at various levels (methods, code, data, and experiments). We then map the drivers to the barriers to give concrete advice for strategies for researchers to mitigate reproducibility issues in their own work, to lay out key areas where further research is needed in specific areas, and to further ignite discussion on the threat presented by these urgent issues.},

  abstract     = {Wave-based mechanisms inspired by traveling wave locomotion in animals have shown great potential use in robots to navigate unstructured environments. Herein, the dual actuator wave-like navigator (DAWN), a multisurface robot employing two actuated helical wave generators to produce continuous traveling waves on flexible link tracks enclosed in elastomer skins, is presented. These skins provide mechanical resilience, enhanced friction, and adaptability on uneven terrain. The robot demonstrates steering and controlled locomotion on flat surfaces, inclines, and declines. To characterize the robot, locomotion tests are performed on plywood, PMMA, and sand, achieving average linear speeds of 16.00, 15.76, and 1.63 mm s −1 , respectively. A key innovation is cyclic pneumatic actuation of the skins with actuation frequencies of 0.5 and 0.9 Hz, improving locomotion performance on sand to 2.22 and 2.70 mm s −1 . DAWN's capability to move on sand, grass, gravel, and wet soil is also demonstrated. Its modular design enables plug-and-play assembly of components including helical wave generators, flexible link tracks, and elastomer skins, allowing for easy maintenance, modification, and replacements. Potential applications include navigation in complex terrains for search and rescue, inspection, and environmental monitoring.},

Meanwhile, most physiotherapy robots based on rigid robotics technology suffer from insufficient safety and adaptability, resulting in unsatisfactory treatment effects. This paper presents a novel wearable pneumatic soft physiotherapy device, designed to achieve high-safety and personalized physiotherapy for shoulder and neck acupoint massage. The device integrates four soft massage actuators, four embedded thin-film stress sensors, two miniature airflow sources, and a power supply system, enhancing its portability. Additionally, a hybrid control strategy combining feedforward inverse compensation and PID feedback is proposed to regulate and customize the therapy intensity on human acupoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed device can apply therapeutic intensities ranging from 0 to 3.45 N to human acupoints, effectively adapting to the human shoulder and neck region to achieve good wearing comfort, and performing safe acupoint massage with customized physiotherapy intensities. This study explores and realizes the integration of emerging soft robotics technology with TCM, providing a paradigm for the development of more soft physiotherapy devices.},

A key challenge is striking the right balance between high compliance, which can undermine stability and control, and high stiffness, which can restrict essential movement and demand more powerful actuators. This study presents a tensegrity-inspired spine-like joint that integrates thin McKibben pneumatic artificial muscles and rubber cords directly into its tensile network. The artificial muscles enable active joint bending while also serving as tensile elements. The rubber cords counteract these forces, storing elastic energy to facilitate smooth recovery to the original position. The joint's topology design is primarily influenced by the artificial muscles’ limited 20% contraction. To optimize the balance between range of motion, payload capacity, and structural stability, the joint's geometry is refined through an evolutionary algorithmic form-finding process. Two generated joints are integrated into two functional robotic applications: a crawling robot and a gripper, showcasing their adaptability for diverse robotic applications.},

This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the discrete elastic rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry, the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like finite element method, particularly in handling contact interactions—an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. The simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and interlayer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming.

  abstract     = {Biological organisms excel in dynamically reshaping their bodies to navigate and manipulate ever-changing environments, and some can even tune their mechanical properties for enhanced adaptability. Many existing shape-morphing robots rely on the inherent softness of materials or structures, which sacrifices load-bearing capacity. Despite efforts to achieve both morphing and stiffness tuning in one system, these strategies often rely on separate mechanisms, such as heating liquid metal components to reduce rigidity before employing other mechanisms to change the shape, leading to bulky and complex systems that limit practicality and scalability. Here, a tunable-stiffness architected morphing structure (TSAMS) is introduced, which unifies shape morphing and tunable stiffness in a single, compact platform. By combining 3D-printed tessellated particles with shape memory alloy springs, TSAMS transitions smoothly from soft to rigid states, exhibiting a ≈308 times increase in bending stiffness while concurrently executing intricate shape transformations through electrothermal actuation. This design is demonstrated with the following robotic applications, including rolling robots that can explore diverse terrains by climbing slopes, avoiding obstacles, and carrying loads; compact manipulators that lift objects nearly 50 times heavier than themselves; and snake-inspired robots performing undulation and sidewinding gaits. These results highlight TSAMS's potential to advance next-generation soft robots and bioinspired systems that demand both dynamic shape reconfiguration and robust structural performance in diverse operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in locomoting robotics have demonstrated how shape morphing can enhance efficiency, mobility, and speed during transitions between domains, such as from land to water. However, prior approaches often optimize a robot's propulsor shape, stiffness, and gait to minimize the cost of transport in distinct domains while neglecting the energy required to achieve these shape and stiffness changes at domain interfaces. Additionally, many shape-morphing robots rely on thermally driven materials that couple shape and stiffness changes to environmental temperatures, limiting their applicability in real-world multidomain scenarios. This work introduces the Jamming Amphibious Robotic Turtle (JART), which employs pressure-responsive, topologically altered kirigami laminar jamming to transform its limbs between hydrodynamic flippers and load-bearing legs. Energetic analyses reveal that JART achieves a 98.5% reduction in the energetic cost of morphing compared to thermally driven predecessors. Its pressure-responsive morphing mechanism also enables temperature-independent energy expenditures when morphing, rapid stiffness switching, decoupled control of stiffness and shape, and robust postloading shape recovery. System-level evaluations highlight JART's ability to efficiently transition between domains, demonstrated through a continuous terrestrial–aquatic–terrestrial transition at an ocean inlet. This study provides valuable insights into the design of deployable, multidomain robots, advancing their potential for real-world applications.},

This study presents the design, fabrication, and wing-morphing behavior of 3D-printed magnetic butterflies, focusing on optimal material and design parameters to replicate monarch wing-morphing behavior. Using composite of thermoplastic polyurethane and micron-sized Nd 2 Fe 14 B magnetic powder, 12 unique butterfly designs—varying in size, vein patterns, and stiffness—are fabricated via powder bed fusion (PBF) 3D printing, resulting in 84 specimens. Lightweight and batch-producible with minimal postprocessing, the specimens have weights per unit area of ≈270, 480, and 1045 g m −2 for small, medium, and large sizes, respectively. A permanent magnet induces deformation in the specimens—mimicking monarch butterflies, without embedded electronics. A systematic analysis combining finite element simulations and experiments reveals the effects of size, geometric features, and laser energy scale on wing morphing. Lower laser energy scales result in porous, fast-bending specimens, while higher scales specimen show greater mechanical strength and varied deformation, with vein structures further improving deformation. The results provide a detailed dataset for optimizing wing-morphing designs while highlighting the potential of the PBF process in creating lightweight magnetic bioinspired structures capable of optimal shape morphing.},

To achieve 3D programmable shape morphing (PSM), the deployment of array-based actuators is essential. However, a critical knowledge gap in 3D PSM is controlling the complex systems formed by these soft actuator arrays to mimic the morphology of the target shapes. This study, for the first time, represents the configuration of shape-morphing devices using point cloud data and employing deep learning to map these configurations to control inputs. Shape Morphing Net (SMNet), a method that realizes the regression from point cloud to high-dimensional control input vectors, is proposed. It has been applied to 3D PSM devices with three different actuator mechanisms, demonstrating its universal applicability to inversely reproduce the target shapes. Further, applied to previous 2D PSM devices, SMNet significantly enhances control precision from 82.23% to 97.68%. In the demonstrations of morphology mimicking, 3D PSM devices successfully replicate arbitrary target shapes obtained either through 3D scanning of physical objects or via 3D modeling software. The results show that within the deformable range of 3D PSM devices, accurate reproduction of the desired shapes is achievable.},

  abstract     = {Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di-SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox-enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from <1 kDa to 16 kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di-SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.},

Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion-pillared metal-organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C 2 H 2 and CO 2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF 6 2− anion-pillared cage-type MOFs (ZNU-17 and ZNU-27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (∼4 Å) and microporous (>7 Å) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU-17 allows the efficient binary C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 separation, ZNU-27 enables the benchmark ternary C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO 2 . Notably, remarkably increased C 2 H 2 (170.1 cm 3 g −1 versus 120.1 cm 3 g −1 ) and CO 2 (91.8 cm 3 g −1 versus 64.5 cm 3 g −1 ) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU-27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU-27 for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU-17 (6.5 versus 1.5). The C 2 H 2 , CO 2 and C 2 H 4 binding sites in ZNU-27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5 Å spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C 2 H 2 and CO 2 . Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer-grade C 2 H 4 (≥99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU-27 with a high productivity of 12.04 mol kg −1 .},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C─N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO 2 -mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N 2 /nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 -CO 2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma-activated N 2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4 µmol h −1 cm −2 with N-selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO 2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 heterointerfaces to form * OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH 2 OH, respectively, while CO 2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the * OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C─N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.},

  abstract     = {Scheelite-type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero-dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite-type materials. In this work, we break this long-standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO 2 F 2 ] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO 2 F 2 ] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO 2 F 2 —the first borate compound adopting a scheelite-type structure. Through a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first-principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite-type framework of SbBO 2 F 2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence.

  abstract     = {β-Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, β 2,2,3 -amino acids—characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter—represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible-light-driven radical-radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, β-keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single-electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox-active NHPI esters derived from α-amino acids are reduced via SET to form α-amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross-coupling to afford β 2,2,3 -amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo-controlled assembly of structurally complex β 2,2,3 -amino esters, overcoming long-standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency. Beyond its synthetic utility, this method offers new opportunities for expanding the chemical space of β-amino acid derivatives and holds promise for advancing medicinal chemistry and peptide-based drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half-lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C─O/C─C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value-added aromatic chemicals. The β-O-4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C β ─O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air–water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C α ─C β bonds in β-O-4 and β-1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C α ─C β bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18 O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C─O/C─C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.},

  abstract     = {Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu-containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C─H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C─H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu-binding β-hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine-brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu-HisPins show LPMO-like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu-HisPins can also perform light-driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu-HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light-stimulated melanin-mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure-activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.},

  abstract     = {Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well-defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self-assembled POM-based superstructures with high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM-based superstructures with ultrathin graphene-like morphologies and well-organized frameworks via a simple self-assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene-like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM-CTAB-TM, TM═Co, Ni, or Cu), POM-CTAB-Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate-determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM-CTAB-Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2 A cm −2 at a cell voltage of 2.247 V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000 h at an industrial-grade current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM-based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.},

Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para -benzoquinone ( p -BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high-/low-current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over-oxidation of generated p -BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p -BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra-low energy consumption of 0.064 kWh mol −1 . Carbon emission accounting and techno-economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol).

  abstract     = {Carbonyl-containing organic electrodes have been widely considered as ideal substitutes for traditional inorganic compounds in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their excellent redox reversibility and structural tunability. However, constructing effective Na + diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N ’-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI-DTMA), containing a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure. The D–A–D architecture significantly enhances π-conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI-DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for Na + mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI-DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g −1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g −1 owing to its fast Na + kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI-DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.},

The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron-rich, electron-deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4-day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency.

TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1–11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80 °C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N 2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO 2 and H 2 O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO 2 at a loading 0.01 mmol g −1 and H 2 O at a loading of 0.7 mmol g −1 are −41 and −38 kJ mol −1 , respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO 2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H 2 O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean-squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO 2 reduction under challenging conditions.},

Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C─H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C─H activation and N -annulation processes in a one-pot and one-step operation. The rhodium-catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights ( M w up to 49900 g mol −1 ) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film-forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP–metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.},

Open-shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non-luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three-stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) ( B < 0.05 T), the Δg -induced spin mixing (0.05–0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8–7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (>14%) under ultra-low magnetic fields ( B < 0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin-optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright–dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin-photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open-shell systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne–water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine···π interaction-induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate-repelled interfacial water-cation is developed over commercial Nafion-modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under −100 mA cm −2 . The fluorine···π effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ-generated surface-active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9 mmol h −1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10 h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at −100 mA cm −2 rationalize the design concept.},

  abstract     = {Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited-state dynamics. Here, we present a charge-rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor-acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual-fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent-dependent emission trade-off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self-calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error<0.2%) with a robust working curve ( R 2 = 0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user-friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-bromine (Zn-Br 2 ) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high-areal-capacity Zn-Br 2 batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus-leaf-biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB-PDDA//Zn@ZnO-PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm −2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual-interface engineering for advancing practical Zn-Br 2 battery technologies.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO 2 into value-added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO 2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO 2 R studies use pure CO 2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain ∼15% CO 2 , requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO 2 -selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM-1) reinforced with the CO 2 -philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF 4 ]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO 2 and suppresses N 2 /O 2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 , 5% O 2 in N 2 ), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF 4 ]/PIM-1 achieved >70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100 mA cm − 2 , versus ∼20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO 2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O 2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and >50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO 2 -selective interlayer enables direct mixed-gas ECO 2 R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.},

We determined the SEC parameter | T xyz | to be 2.04(16) × 10 −10 m · V −1 , two orders of magnitude larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric-field-modulated (EFM) continuous-wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) µs at 5 K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz · m · V −1 .

However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr 2 O 3 , calling for the development of environment-friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO 2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H 2 evolution catalysis. We identify a “surface passivation effect” in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO 2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO 2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO 2 -PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides-organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.},

  abstract     = {Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl − coordination with AlCl 3 and ZrCl 4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al 2 Cl 7 − and ZrCl 5 − , which is predominantly governed by AlCl 3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al 2 Cl 7 − , which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl 5 − , which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small-sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (−0.78 V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high-performance alloys.},

Herein, a series of high-entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na 2 Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 [Fe(CN) 6 ] (HE-Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics.

Serious Jahn–Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] with complicated Na-ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic ↔ cubic ↔ tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high-entropy effect, appearing a zero-strain solid-solution reaction mechanism for HE-Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co-ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation.

Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry-based strategy leveraging Hofmeister “salting-in” effect to disperse binders in a poor-solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li-salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo-dispersed in the Li 6 PS 5 Cl slurry, enabling the film-formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra-low resistance of 0.69 Ω cm −2 , synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li-salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li + -pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathodes and silicon-based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380 Wh kg −1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles.

As a result, CP-D3 successfully exhibits both TADF and RTP properties with a high photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of 91%.

The g CPEL is recorded as −8.13 × 10 −4 /+5.92 × 10 −4 for ( R / S )-CP-D3-based CP-OLEDs.

  abstract     = {Seawater electrolysis represents a promising avenue for hydrogen production, nevertheless, the Cl − corrosion and surface deposition of Ca(OH) 2 /Mg(OH) 2 hinder its practical application by deactivation. Herein, an interstitial boron doped osmium (B-Os) is ultrafast (10 s) constructed by microwave quasi-solid approach, where theoretical and experimental analysis proves that the interstitial boron triggers electron enrichment at the Os site and the formation of negative charge centers. The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl − corrosion as well as promotes H 3 O + adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH − and effectively avoiding Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability. Therefore, B-Os exhibits a remarkably low overpotential, for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), of 7 mV@10 mA cm −2 in alkaline seawater, while maintaining stable performance over 400 h of stable operation in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzer, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. Economic evaluation highlights its hydrogen production costs ($0.81 GGE −1 ) undercutting the U.S. DOE target.},

  abstract     = {Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr-oxo nanocluster-based solid, [Zr 17 O 8 (OH) 24 (OH 2 ) 12 (HCO 2 ) 12 (SO 4 ) 8 ] · 6 HCl · 30 H 2 O (Zr 17 ) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site-selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr 17 for enabling efficient protein-cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr 17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV-Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr 17 , evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next-generation cluster-based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal-organic frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi-hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f-PSCs. Three hydroxyl-substituted phenylacetic acids (p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f-PSC performance. These multi-hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f-PSCs. Additionally, the multi-hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI 2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f-PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 1000 h.},

Herein, we introduce a “Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly” strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen-bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units—C 3 H 3 O 4 − , C 4 H 5 O 4 − , and C(NH 2 ) 3 + —and assembled them into two one-dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 ] ∞ and [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 ] ∞ . These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 and C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 , which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen-bond-guided, module-level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.},

In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox-catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C─N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9–11-membered lactams adorned with a Z-olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing α-amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical-polar-crossover-induced C─N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium-ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.},

In this study, a tandem-triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single-phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid-labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane-less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single-phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular-like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem-triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate-based protocells.},

Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave π-extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP . X-ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti-Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S 1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti-Kasha dual-emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon-based systems. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV–vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C 60 up to 1.92 × 10 6 M −1 . Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge-separated state, C 60 •− /exTTF[10]CPP •+ , which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge-transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C 60 ⊂exTTF[10]CPP -based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.},

In response to these issues, here we report a copper-catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene-derived 1,2-diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse α-azaaryl-α-hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five-membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2-nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2-azaarene migrations.},

This system employs a dual-lock mechanism—combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics—to maintain an ultra-low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665 nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201 nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033-fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression. This strategy significantly enhances the specificity and sensitivity of live-cell imaging, expands the functional utility of AIE luminogens, and offers a versatile platform for high-resolution, multiplexed bioimaging in biomedical research and diagnostics.},

  abstract     = {Tandem or self-evolution Cu-based catalysts effectively regulate *CO to promote the conversion of CO 2 electroreduction to multicarbon (C 2+ ) products. DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self-evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared and in situ Raman. The low C 2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FE C2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (j c2+ ) of 553.9 mA cm −2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C–C coupling in the *CO-rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.},

Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker-type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN) 4 (BF 4 ) 2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted α , β -unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one-carbon ring expansion to deliver 2-fluoro-1,3-dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N -phthalimide. While a semi-pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2-alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-ion batteries suffer from electrolyte-induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation–anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion-decoupled LHCE (ID-LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol (TFP) as anion-affinity diluent. The TFP-mediated anion-diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF − from Zn 2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn 2+ -enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn 2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H 2 O-rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water-deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF − coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF 2 -ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite-free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000 h at 1 mA cm −2 ) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV 3 O 8 ·1.5H 2 O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 . Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere-hour-level pouch cells (1.04 Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.},

  abstract     = {Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) face challenges from unstable and fragile solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C─O─C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25 M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen-bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25° and 80 °C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P = 1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles.

HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6-trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF-κB activity induced upon p300-catalyzed acetylation of NF-κB p50. These findings indicate a potential anti-inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF-κB signaling.},

FLipA-HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10- to 25-fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short-chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid “POVPC” display rapid and selective FLipA-HIPS staining that co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes.

While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP-binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface-exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell-active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface-exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof-of-concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well-known lysine-reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO 2 F, and OSO 2 F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates’ superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low-reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first-in-class squarate-based, cell-active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long-residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine-reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate-containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface-exposed, non-catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {The study of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has become a cornerstone of chemical sciences, providing crucial guidance for advancing a wide range of fields. Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that—alongside both ketones—allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8-membered rings and formally antiaromatic as -indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon-based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.},

Sequence alignment and fluorescence polarization assays indicate that many previously published aptamers bound to the His-tag instead of the intended protein. This work not only obtained a model aptamer for proteins but also revealed critical information on bias toward His-tags during aptamer selections.},

  abstract     = {The integration of renewable energy with electrocatalytic technology affords an effective pathway to reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency, thereby promoting the green electrification of the chemical industry. However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two-electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O-coordinated Co single-atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady-state, start−stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of −50 mA cm −2 , the system sustains over 55 stable start−stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir-containing O-coordinated Co single-atom sites and the self-healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation. By addressing the variability of renewable energy and optimizing the integration of electrochemical processes, our work paves the way for fully realizing green electrification in sustainable chemical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single-port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a “quick” analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre-screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six-dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal–organic frameworks. The method showed a 98–100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre-screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs-Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material-binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH-cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring-opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS-COOH 500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 ± 0.29 g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH-cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C═C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.},

Hence, direct C─C bond formation between pyrroles and arenes was enabled, obviating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. The reaction proceeded under electrochemical conditions in a user-friendly undivided cell, utilizing electricity as a traceless oxidant. Mechanistic studies, including cyclic voltammetry, provided support for a nickel(II/III/IV) regime, wherein anodic oxidation facilitates the dehydrogenation and C─H activation paired with the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Herein, we present a molecular design strategy that enhances emitter stability and efficiency by reinforcing the weak C─N bonds through selective incorporation of heterocyclic carbazole ( Cz ) units into the MR framework. Two proof-of-concept emitters, m-Cz-DABNA and tBu-Cz-DABNA , were synthesized via high-yield, lithium-free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure-blue emissions at 453 and 463 nm with narrow full-width at half-maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21 nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m-Cz-DABNA and tBu-Cz-DABNA show emissions at 456 nm (FWHM 24 nm, EQE max 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467 nm (FWHM 24 nm, EQE max 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu-Cz-DABNA -based device shows an LT 90 of ∼81 h at 1000 cd m − 2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy ≤ 0.10. These results demonstrate a versatile and scalable molecular design strategy for the realization of high-efficiency, long-lifetime blue OLEDs approaching the BT.2020 color standard.},

Rh-NS/Rh-NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO 2 − and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh-NS/Rh-NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH 3 yield rate of 44.3 mg mg cat −1 h −1 for NO 2 RR at high reduction potential (0.00 V). Using Rh-NS/Rh-NR as cathode, the assembled zinc–nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2 mW cm −2 ) and promising NH 3 synthesis capacity (5.96 mg mg cat −1 h −1 ).

This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), we developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target-recognizing molecules with NDM-1, and designed click chemistry-reactive, substrate-caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM-1 activity enabled in situ protein-specific imaging of glycans via proximity-dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein-specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein-based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.},

However, the strategic potential of alkaline earth metals (e.g., Ca, Sr, and Ba) in HOIP assembly remains largely unexplored, with ferroelectric implementations yet to be realized, despite their historical roots in perovskite evolution dating back to the eponymous CaTiO 3 mineral discovered in 1839.

  abstract     = {The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) involves numerous intermediates and simultaneous interactions between these intermediates and water (H 2 O) molecules. Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon-related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H 2 O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H 2 O is critical during CO 2 RR process, as H 2 O molecules are directly involved in CO 2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid–liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper-based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H 2 O molecules on CO 2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H 2 O molecules, instead of asymmetric H-bonded H 2 O or ice-like H 2 O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO 2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C 1 FE to 70% C 2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurement, that the H 2 O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO 2 reduction pathways.},

  abstract     = {Assembly-line enzymes carry out multistep synthesis of important metabolites by using acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) to shuttle intermediates along defined sequences of active sites. Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida ( Pp FabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X-ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short-chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme–ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for Pp FabG4 or weaken it for Ec FabG, an Escherichia coli β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short-chain substrates by over 100-fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme-ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly-line systems.},

Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium-catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench-stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix-and-stir, single-vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 /TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.},

Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real-time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus . Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response ( K d ≈ 9 µM). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate-bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large-scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4°. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the β7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia from nitrate-containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag-N/O bonds on one-dimensional WO 3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding ∼90% over a potential range of −0.6 to −0.2 V RHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at −0.4 V RHE and a maximum NH 3 yield at −0.55 V RHE . Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm −2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ∼94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH 3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h −1 at −4 V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE > 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag-N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NO→*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.},

  abstract     = {Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [Tp Mes Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] and [Tp Mes* Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] (with Tp Mes = hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate, Tp Mes* = hydrobis((3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)(5-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt-analogue [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O 2 – as in case of the parent cysteamine-bound complexes – the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO-Sec toward O 2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen – more slowly but selectively – to give [Tp Mes Co(O 2 Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O 2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.},

Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups ( BP Chol ). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor ( CP Chol ) to BP Chol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high-resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed-induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CP Chol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro-sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BP Chol .},

Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)-amplified protease-sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly-sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide–DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease-triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide-based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual-enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual-protease-triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity-based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme-based POCT technologies.},

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor-analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with < 5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mg L −1 , despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct-indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial-Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on-site detection of complex contaminants across industries.},

Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO 2 C(CH 2 ) n -1 NH 3 )CuI 2 ( n = 3, 4) exhibiting excitation-wavelength-dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n = 4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n = 3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable n = 4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission—resulting from the emission of both components,—while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 °C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor-converted-LED based on 2D-C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.},

  abstract     = {High-throughput experimentation (HTE), the miniaturization and parallelization of reactions, is a valuable tool for accelerating diverse compound library generation, optimizing reaction conditions, and enabling data collection for machine learning (ML) applications. When applied to organic synthesis and methodology, HTE still poses various challenges due to the diverse workflows and reagents required, motivating advancements in reaction design, execution, analysis, and data management. To address these limitations, cutting-edge technologies, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) have been implemented to standardize protocols, enhance reproducibility, and improve efficiency. Additionally, strategies to reduce bias and promote serendipitous discoveries have further strengthened HTE's impact. This review highlights recent advances at every stage of the HTE workflow, including the development of customized workflows, diverse analysis, and improved data management practices for greater accessibility and shareability. Furthermore, we examine the current state of the field, outstanding challenges, and future directions toward transforming HTE into a fully integrated, flexible, and democratized platform that drives innovation in organic synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin-mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen–nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin-mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO 2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO 2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N 2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N─NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N 2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N─N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72-fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO 2 . This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.},

This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30-fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half-life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug-customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8 nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy.

Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly-shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest-performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6 × 10 10 H 2 O s −1 per channel—2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1—without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio-inspired, high-performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer-based AWCs as next-generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.},

  abstract     = {Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) is critical for efficient CO 2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu-based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine-modified copper pre-catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO 2 R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu 2 ⁺ precursors into metallic Cu⁰ with distinct local structures. Cu-F-4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO 2 R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FE CO ) of 81% at −0.45 V. In contrast, Cu-F-1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FE C2+ of 80% at −0.65 V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO 2 -to-chemicals conversion.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO 2 where CO 2 enrichment and purification is an energy-intensive process. Herein, we report a Co-COOH-COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO 2 . The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co 17.7 -COOH-COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 180.5 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 116.0 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H 2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N–Co–O 4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO 2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO 2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high-performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 to syngas.},

  abstract     = {Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new-to-nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single-electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe 3 as a stand-alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe 3 enables the redox-neutral radical cyclization of an N -(bromoalkyl)-substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ-dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox-neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.},

  abstract     = {Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation-derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion-centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C═C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross-linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). The boron ion-centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4 GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium-ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500 h at 0.1 mA cm −2 at 30 °C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid-state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30 °C and 0.2 C.

Herein, the microwave irradiation method is used to prepare deep eutectic solvent (DES) binder; with the rapid conduction and full utilization of energy, citric acid and betaine (CB) binder is formed in a flash. Intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between C and B provide robust adhesion, self-healing capability, and flame-retardant properties. More importantly, Li⁺ flux is directly improved by hydrogen bond acceptor (B) of DES rather than introducing additional segments or chemical treatment; then the redox kinetics are significantly promoted and the polysulfide shuttle is further suppressed. The types and dynamics of the hydrogen bonds are observed via Raman and dynamic mechanical analysis, while effective LiPS adsorption capability is confirmed through theoretical calculations and in situ Raman measurements. Furthermore, rapid LiPS conversion is verified by nucleation/dissolution experiments of Li 2 S and distribution of relaxation times (DRTs) analysis, and nucleation transformation ratio ( NTR ) calculation shows the similar result. Benefiting from the superior merits of the DES binder, lithium–sulfur (Li─S) battery presents stable cycling at 5 C with 61.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles.},

  abstract     = {Chiral ferroelectrics are attracting tremendous interest because of their unique intrinsic chirality and various intriguing optical properties, such as natural circular dichroism (NCD) effects. However, the magnetic CD (MCD), a kind of important magneto-optical effect, has never been explored in chiral ferroelectrics. Herein, through implementing a homochiral strategy on organic radical charge-transfer complexes, we designed a pair of chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals, R- and S- [TBSQ][TCNQ] (TBSQ = 3-(( tert -butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)quinuclidine, TCNQ = tetracyanoquinodimethane), which show both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature. Notably, the chiral transfer from homochiral R/S- TBSQ + to TCNQ• − radical makes R- and S- [TBSQ][TCNQ] can produce remarkable NCD signal in the absorbance region of TCNQ• − radical. More importantly, the CD signal can be modulated and reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6 T, showing a remarkable magneto-optical response. The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect is further demonstrated with the strength g MCD being ∼1 × 10 −4 T −1 at about 600 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on chiral ferroelectrics with MCD effect. Our findings shed light on the exploration of magneto-optical effects in chiral ferroelectrics and stimulate further study on the chemical design of chiral radical ferroelectrics.},

However, prior studies have predominantly focused on through-bond charge-transfer (TBCT) mechanisms. In this work, we report the first examples of luminescent radicals based on TTM (tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical) with through-space charge-transfer (TSCT) excited states, represented by TPA-FR-TTM and CZP-FR-TTM. Spatial separation and non-bonding character between the donor and radical units minimizes electron-vibrational coupling and effectively suppresses non-radiative decay. As a result, CZP-FR-TTM exhibits an outstanding photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 64.3% and an ultralow non-radiative decay rate of 1.3 × 10 6 s −1 , among the lowest ever reported for luminescent radicals. Furthermore, the reduced electronic coupling leads to non-Aufbau electronic structures, enhancing radical stability. These findings establish TSCT as a powerful design strategy for high-performance and stable luminescent radicals, opening new avenues for open-shell optoelectronic materials.},

In this work, we combine chromatographic isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and synthetic validation to identify key molecular intermediates in the early stages of CND formation from arginine (Arg) and ethylenediamine (EDA) under hydrothermal conditions. Using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, 1 H/ 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, we isolate and structurally confirm multiple reaction intermediates, including species arising from Arg cyclization and EDA-derived condensation products. Each proposed intermediate was validated via direct synthesis and comparative analysis. Fully formed CNDs were then isolated and extensively characterized through several techniques. Multi-detection gel permeation chromatography enabled the determination of absolute number average molecular weight ( M n = 4,400 ± 458 g mol −1 ), dispersity ( Đ = 1.34), and hydrodynamic diameter (2.8 ± 0.2 nm). Quantification of amine functionalities using Kaiser test and 19 F NMR, upon condensation with a fluorinated aldehyde probe, established the presence of 6–7 amines per particle. Together, this systematic approach not only elucidates the mechanistic origin of CND formation but also establishes a robust framework for molecular-level CND design and functionalization.},

While several metal complexes have shown promise as ICD inducers, conjugates containing more than one metal center remain to be explored for ICD. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a tri-metallic Au I -Pt IV -Ru II prodrug ( 5 ) that codelivers oxaliplatin (Type I ICD inducer), Ru II arene 2-pyridinecarbothioamides (Type I), and Au(I) bis-N-heterocyclic (Type II) using a single scaffold. Upon reduction, complex 5 releases all three cytotoxic species, resulting in enhanced inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1&2), elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in vitro DAMP release. In vivo studies of complex 5 in a colorectal cancer mouse model demonstrated tumor growth suppression, reduced off-target metal accumulation, and improved immune memory in a tumor challenge study compared to a 1:1:1 mixture of the constituent agents. Furthermore, peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profiling revealed that complex 5 activates both the innate and adaptive immune compartments. This study demonstrates an integrated chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy that unifies multiple ICD triggers within a single prodrug framework. It thus highlights a promising approach to the creation of metal-based multimodal anticancer therapies.},

While this property has been extensively exploited for probing of homomultivalent interactions, there has been comparatively little attention paid to the exploration of heteromultivalent interactions. In this study, we investigated the use of readily assemblable DNA duplexes for programming bispecific targeting of specific cell types. In contrast to previous bispecific agents, we leverage the potential of peptide-based high-affinity binders of cell surface proteins used in diagnostics/therapeutics. Systematic spatial screening revealed the optimal distance between two (cyclo)peptides required for selectively recognizing cells expressing unique combinations of receptors. The VGFR2/α V β 3 receptor system on HUVECs was tolerant to changes of the distance between two cyclopeptides (L and cyclo(-RGDf( N -Me)K-)) and required that the distance exceeded the equivalent of 20 nucleotides distance. A different distance-affinity landscape was observed for recognition of EGFR and MET on A549 cells (through GE11 and bicyclic peptide GE-137). The DNA-programmed bispecific binders demonstrated specificity and efficient internalization into target cells. Auristatin-loaded DNA enabled a selective targeting of cytotoxic payload. Of note, the distance-optimized bispecific DNA-peptide probes have much lower molecular weight than previously used agents based on DNA nanostructures or antibodies.},

  abstract     = {Reducing costs while maintaining efficiency in photocatalytic systems remains a major pursuit in the field of solar photocatalysis. Herein, we explore a universal strategy for regulating electronic transfer by employing earth-abundant polyoxometalates (POMs) as electron sponges, dramatically promoting electron shuttling between photosensitizers (PSs) and substrates. This approach enables highly efficient photooxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids while significantly reducing the usage of noble-metal PSs. Typically, replacing 90% PS [Ir(bpy)(coumarin6) 2 ] + ( Ir-2 ) with an earth-abundant Co 7 POM ([{(B-α-PW 9 O 34 )Co 3 (OH)(H 2 O) 2 (O 3 PC(O)(C 3 H 6 NH 3 )PO 3 )} 2 Co] 14− ) can efficiently boost photo-oxidation efficiency, achieving complete substrate conversion within 3 h in air, ∼3.2 or 5.6 times higher than the system with 100% or 10% Ir-2 , respectively. Notably, this strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with a wide range of substrates and POMs. Systematic kinetic studies and unique “heteropoly blue” characteristic of POMs clearly demonstrated their excellent capabilities for electron accepting, storing, and releasing in these photo-oxidation systems. These properties can significantly promote electron transfer and stabilize reduced PSs, resulting in over five-fold increase in O 2 •− generation under weak visible-light irradiation ( λ > 420 nm, 50 mW cm −2 ) compared to POM-free systems. This work not only opens an avenue for efficient photochemical synthesis but also highlights a promising new direction for POM application.},

The Si─O─Al bonds in DSB exhibit high reactivity toward the deleterious species in the electrolyte, resulting in the formation of deposits on the surface of hard carbon. These deposits protect the anode surface and alter the pore structures. As a result, hard carbon exhibits an increased initial Coulombic efficiency of 83.5% and a capacity retention of 90.5% after 1500 cycles at 1 A g −1 .

The unique architecture of POF-2 synergistically combines the strong oxidative capability of AsPOM with the tunable light absorption and oxygen activation ability of organic monomers, narrowing the bandgap from 3.13 eV (AsPOM) to 2.28 eV (POF-2) and extending light absorption to 575 nm. Under ambient conditions with low-energy visible-light irradiation (10 W LED), POF-2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in aromatic C─H bromination and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, achieving >99% conversion and >99% selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the well-defined donor–acceptor (D–A) structure of POF-2 facilitates rapid hole (h + )-mediated C─H activation on AsPOM nodes and selective 1 O 2 generation on BDOEB linkers, avoiding nonproductive substrate mineralization. This work not only demonstrates a new 3D covalent AsPOM-organic polymer for C─H functionalization but also provides a blueprint for designing molecularly precise, multifunctional photocatalysts for sustainable organic synthesis.},

  abstract     = {The development of blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is critical for advancing next-generation display technologies. However, the fabrication of high-quality mixed-halide blue perovskites remains challenging due to their intrinsic vulnerability to high defect densities, ion migration, and inefficient charge transport. To address this, we introduce a rapid in situ interface reaction at the buried interface between the perovskite layer and the underlying poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) film. This engineered interface reaction represents a novel method for preparing high-quality deep-blue CsPb(Br/Cl) 3 films. By incorporating lithium salicylate (SAL) as a reaction initiator into the perovskite precursor, a proton exchange is triggered between PEDOT:PSS and SAL, resulting in the formation of a multifunctional PSS-Li interfacial layer. This layer modulates perovskite nucleation and growth, producing compact, uniform, and small-grained deep-blue perovskite films with reduced trap densities and enhanced quantum confinement. Combined with optimized charge dynamics, the resulting spectrally stable deep-blue PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 16.3% at 468 nm. This approach facilitates the successful integration of uniform and high-clarity active-matrix displays on thin-film transistor circuit substrates.},

  abstract     = {A rationally designed, bifunctional ammonia-oxidation catalyst spatially decouples NH 3 activation and *OH adsorption to overcome the intrinsic trade-off of single-component systems. Atomically dispersed Zn single atoms in an N,O-doped carbon support (Zn 1 /NOC) serve as dedicated *OH-adsorption sites, while Ir-modulated Pt(100) nanocubes selectively activate NH 3 . Comprehensive structural characterization (AC HAADF-STEM, XPS, XANES, EXAFS) confirms Zn-N 3 O 3 coordination and atomically isolated Zn centers. Electrochemical-kinetic analysis, mechanistic spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that Zn 1 /NOC lowers the *OH-adsorption energy by 0.84 eV (to −0.98 eV versus −0.14 eV on Pt), facilitating the dehydrogenation steps and reducing surface poisoning. Simultaneously, traces of stabilized Ir 4+ -decorated Pt cubes enhance NH 3 dissociation kinetics to form N 2 . The catalyst demonstrates a specific activity of 3.80 mA cm −2 PGMs , exceeding the state-of-the-art benchmarks. When deployed in a membrane-electrode-assembly direct ammonia fuel cell, the catalyst achieves a maximum current density of 200 mA cm −2 and a peak power density of 18 mW cm −2 , representing a significant improvement over previously reported systems, with ∼250% increase over Pt np –C || Pt/C and more than double monofunctional systems. This work demonstrates a generalizable strategy for engineering spatially decoupled active sites in multistep electrochemical reactions, paving the way for high-performance ammonia fuel cells and beyond.},

The microenvironment influences the activity of adsorption site by modulating the orbital interaction between the active site and adsorbate.

As a model system, through hydrothermal processing in a solution of aluminum ions, polyacrylamide hydrogels show dramatically enhanced mechanical properties with tensile strength and elastic modulus up to 12.8 and 75.1 MPa, respectively, and very impressively, they also exhibit excellent RTP properties with long lifetime up to 169.7 ms and very interesting reversible UV-activated RTP emission. The UV-activated and persistent RTP emission enable innovative applications of the hydrogels in self-erasing encryption and ultrasensitive antibiotic sensing. The hydrothermal processing strategy can be applied to preparing other RTP hydrogels by using different polymeric matrices and metal ions. This work establishes a universal paradigm for developing multifunctional RTP hydrogels through metal ion coordination and provides a basis for their practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into solar fuels presents a promising strategy for carbon mitigation and sustainable energy conversion. However, single-component photocatalysts suffer from inefficient charge separation, while binary heterojunctions—even with cocatalysts assistance—often undergo rapid Coulombic recombination due to timescale mismatches between ultrafast charge transfer and slower surface reaction kinetics. To overcome these limitations, a spatially engineered Nb 2 C/Nb 2 O 5 /ZnO ternary heterostructure is developed by anchoring ZnO quantum dots (QDs) onto Nb 2 O 5 nanorods grown in situ from Nb 2 C MXene. This architecture integrates an Nb 2 O 5 /ZnO S-scheme heterojunction and an Nb 2 C/Nb 2 O 5 Schottky junction, sharing Nb 2 O 5 as a central mediator, thereby establishing bidirectional interfacial electric fields (IEFs) that direct photogenerated electrons toward ZnO and holes toward Nb 2 C. In situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) reveal interface-specific electronic interactions and time-resolved carrier dynamics, confirming efficient and spatially resolved charge migration across the decoupled interfaces. This spatial charge separation effectively suppresses Coulombic recombination and prolongs carrier lifetimes. Additionally, the photothermal effect of Nb 2 C MXene enhances CO 2 chemisorption and activation at defective ZnO QDs. These synergistic effects collectively enable high-efficiency CO 2 photoreduction without molecular cocatalysts or sacrificial agents, providing a mechanistically distinct and scalable approach for artificial photosynthesis.},

Compound with smaller angular deviations from the dielectric axis ( α and β ) yielding enhanced anisotropy.

While the static structure–activity relationship of catalysts is well explored, how the evolution of electronic structure dynamically affects the ROS generation remains poorly understood. This study fabricated carbon nanolayer-supported Co x Ni y alloys (Co x Ni y @CNT) with preset atomic Ni/Co ratio ( x / y = 1:3, 2:2, 3:1) to probe the dynamic evolution of electronic structure and its subsequent role for the generation of non-radical ROS. During catalytic PMS activation, the paired electrons of O 2p in PMS fill the corresponding hybrid orbitals of Co to form coordinative Co—O endowed with paired/unpaired electrons. The carbon nanolayer support, as in situ formed with controllable lattice distance, exhibits the unique electron buffering effect to replenish electron to Co 1 Ni 3 or accept electron from Co 3 Ni 1 , thereby driving selective generation of surface PMS* or free 1 O 2 respectively. Further, the specific reaction preferences of PMS * and 1 O 2 toward different organic contaminants were elucidated, and a combined process integrating both alloys was proposed to efficiently treat actual hospital wastewater. Overall, this study offers a molecule-level design of bimetallic alloys with tunable electronic structure for sustainable water purification.},

Light, as an ideal fuel form, offers remote control, spatiotemporal precision, and no chemical waste. However, the energy dissipating mechanism behind current light-driven system hinges on photoisomerization. This strategy has to trade off the slow, incomplete tautomerization against the needs of rapid, dynamic material response. Here, we report a non-isomerized, light-fueled dissipative self-assembly system based on photoexcited radicalization mechanism. Light can activate dipeptide-modified naphthalene diimide (NDI-GV) into high-energy radical anion NDI-GV ●− , thus disrupting the initial π-stacked ribbon architecture and triggering a reconfiguration into homochiral helical nanofibers through spin-spin interactions among the resulted radicals. In turn, ambient air spontaneously oxidizes NDI-GV ●− to the ground state for resetting the system, during which an unusual solvent-involved feedback pathway sustaining the dissipative cycle is uncovered. Shifting light parameters or solvents to tune the kinetics of radical generation and deactivation enables temporal control of the assembly period and lifetime (>10 h). Combining the tunability of phase transition with the photochromism of NDIs, this system can be used for light-programmed information encryption and spatiotemporal patterning, which would inspire a non-photoisomerized paradigm of light-powered dissipative self-assembly and extend the boundaries of systems chemistry.},

By incorporating distinct cations, we synthesized a library of homologous single crystals, including metastable (BA) 2 Cs 2 Sn 3 I 10 (BA + : butylammonium) via growth kinetics control. It is revealed that A-site cations critically govern structural symmetry, exciton-phonon coupling, lasing, etc. Tailoring cation composition enables the continuous bandgap tuning (1.62–2.01 eV) with minimal lattice mismatch (<3.6%). A-site cation engineering idealized the perovskite lattice and improved the crystal quality, e.g., the multication (BA) 2 Cs 0.7 MA 0.4 EA 0.5 GA 0.4 Sn 3 I 10 (MA + : methylammonium, EA + : ethylammonium, GA + : guanidinium) achieves a long carrier lifetime (15.1 ns), nearly three times that of containing single A-site, and then increases diffusion length to >1 µm. The n = 3 tin perovskites with multication exhibited exceptional phase stability and the corresponding nanolaser bridged the emission gaps between single-A-cation analogs, delivering a low threshold and unprecedented stability.},

  abstract     = {Sodium (Na) storage in hard carbon (HC) is a fundamental electrochemical process for sodium-ion batteries, where adsorption energy critically influences charge/discharge rates and storage capacity. Accurate prediction of this energy is essential for designing of high-performance HC. Traditional quantum mechanical simulations often neglect charge effects from electrochemical potentials, leading to inaccurate adsorption energies and discrepancies with experiments. Here, we demonstrate that potential-driven charge effects play a pivotal role in governing Na storage under realistic conditions. To address this, we develop a charge-dependent computational model (CDM) that explicitly incorporates potential-induced charge dynamics. Using flat carbon layers as a model, we show that charge effects significantly influence the identification of active Na-storage sites and induce sodiation/desodiation voltage shifts exceeding 1.1 V relative to conventional charge-neutral models. These effects originate from distinct chemical reactivities between neutral and charged carbon. When extended to curved and defect-rich carbon—hallmarks of HC—CDM accurately predicts storage sites and voltage-capacity profiles that closely match experimental data. This work resolves long-standing theory-experiment inconsistencies and provides a powerful framework for designing next-generation sodium-ion batteries.},

An aminotransferase XhnB1 and a methyltransferase XhnM are identified to catalyze the formation of N-methylated pipecolic acid building block, leading to the completion of the polyketide–peptide backbone. The identification of XhnM facilitated stereochemical determination of six chiral centers in xinghaicarcins by co-crystallization. Notably, xinghaicarcins exhibit potent antibacterial activity against drug-resistant pathogens and cytotoxicity against multiple cancer cell lines. Additionally, the HTH-42 superfamily resistant protein, XhnU2, was characterized to mitigate xinghaicarcin-induced genotoxicity. This work provides comprehensive insights into structure, biosynthesis, bioactivity, and self-resistance mechanisms of xinghaicarcins, expanding diversity of DNA alkylating natural products.},

  abstract     = {We report the first direct observation of the pentafluorophenyl cation in the gas phase via vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (PI) of the thermally generated pentafluorophenyl radical. The reactive intermediates and stable reaction products were characterized utilizing photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation. Electron removal from the pentafluorophenyl radical yields the cation with an adiabatic ionization energy (AIE) of 9.84 ± 0.02 eV. Threshold photoelectron spectra combined with high-level ab-initio calculations show that the cation is described as a π 5 σ 1 diradical with an open-shell singlet ( 1 A 2 ) ground state, while the triplet ( 3 A 2 ) state lies only 1.5 ± 0.4 kcal mol −1 higher in energy. The closed-shell singlet ( 1 A) state is highly distorted and lies >4 kcal mol −1 above the ground state. This unique aryl carbenium ion exhibits a ∼40 kcal mol −1 higher hydride affinity (HA) as compared to the parent phenyl cation, explaining its high reactivity and elusive character. In addition, the radical's reactivity was investigated upon hydrogen abstraction and unimolecular decomposition, forming tetrafluoro ortho -benzyne as well as smaller fluorinated species.},

CNR1 + OTf − , CNR2 + OTf − , and CNR3 + OTf − can be readily prepared by treating their corresponding methoxy precursors with triflate acid. Remarkably, they all display excellent stability under light and ambient conditions. CNR1 + exhibits a closed shell electronic feature, whereas CNR2 + features an open shell singlet ground state. CNR3 + OTf − possess triplet ground electronic state, as evidenced by ESR and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. Through meticulous fitting of the SQUID data, a singlet-triplet energy gaps (∆ E S-T ) of +1.04 kcal mol −1 along with intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions ( θ ) of -28 K were obtained. In comparison to CNR1 + , both the open shell CNR2 + and CNR3 + display distinctively red shifted long wavelength absorption bands that extend up to approximately 2400 nm. Such long wavelength absorption characteristics are quite scarce among organic materials. This research offers a novel approach for the design and synthesis of iminium diradical(oid)s, which feature tunable ground states and exhibit intense absorption in the second near infrared (NIR-II) region, opening up new possibilities in the field of organic materials research.},

However, the conventional post-treatment strategy utilizing phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) frequently results in the formation of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite structures with mixed n-values and the phase evolution under operating conditions, thereby constraining further enhancement of device performance and deteriorating the operation stability. Through intermolecular interactions and localized polarity modulation, this method facilitates cation exchange reactions between phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and formamidinium (FA + ) ions, enabling the formation of homogenized 2D perovskite layer with n = 2 on WBG perovskite surface. Benefiting from the precisely defined 2D passivation layer, the WBG single-junction device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.98%, while the 2-terminal (2T) all-perovskite tandem device based on this strategy attains a PCE of 28.35%.

  abstract     = {Glycation is a nonenzymatic posttranslational modification associated with aging and disease. Because it occurs spontaneously, it is extremely difficult to control the extent of glycation at distinct sites within target proteins, especially in cellular systems. Here, we report a chemical approach, referred to as “dialAGE”, that enables the site-specific control of protein glycation. This unique tool requires the introduction of just a single point mutation that modulates the glycation susceptibility of a nearby arginine. As proof-of-concept, extensive mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm that dialAGE can modulate site-specific glycation levels at multiple arginine residues in ubiquitin in vitro, enabling both enhanced and diminished glycation. Introduction of dialAGE point mutations and/or glycation with the biologically relevant glycating agent methylglyoxal did not affect polyubiquitin chain formation using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Furthermore, we show that dialAGE can be used to modulate ubiquitin glycation levels in living mammalian cells. We, therefore, anticipate that this method will be particularly useful for enabling the study of glycation as a genuine, functional, and posttranslational modification.},

We introduce alkyl N -pyridinium carboxy aldehydes (ANCA) as ideal orthogonal functional group for PAM. The herein presented nanospheres undergo quantitative PAM with a variety of aniline derivatives, allowing the creation of hydrophobic, chiral, catalytic, and other confined spaces. As the parent spheres can be easily characterized before PAM, this methodology not only allows for the preparation of highly desirable multifunctional confined spaces but also serves with its post modulation possibilities as a fast and efficient tool for screening secondary interactions and confined spaces on probes of interest.},

Herein, we develop a Pd SAs+NPs /PTI catalyst by co-anchoring atomic and nanoparticulate Pd species on poly(triazine imide) crystals, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability for CO 2 reduction to CO using H 2 O as the reductant. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the dual Pd species synergistically enhance charge separation and transfer while promoting CO 2 activation, CO desorption, and H 2 O dissociation. Photo-stimulated electrons migrate to Pd nanoparticles to reduce CO 2 , and holes oxidize Pd 2+ sites to Pd 4+ species that catalyze H 2 O splitting to OH* and H*. The resulting H* spills onto adjacent Pd nanoparticles to support proton-coupled CO 2 reduction, whereas OH* is oxidized by Pd 4+ to evolve O 2 , regenerating Pd 2+ , and closing the catalysis cycle. Importantly, the photoinduced Pd 4+ sites dynamically modulate the local adsorption environment, weakening *CO binding on nearby Pd nanoparticles. This facilitates *CO desorption and hampers its hydrogenation to CH 4 , enabling high CO selectivity. The optimal catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 22.2 mmol g Pd −1 h −1 with 95.7% selectivity, stably operating over 30 h.},

The continuous pGO nanochannels modified by amino groups (NH 3 + ) further prevent the passage of dehydrated Mg 2+ by enhanced electrostatic repulsion while allowing Li + to transfer. Under the synergy of the two nanochannels, the JGOM demonstrates robust Li + /Mg 2+ separation performance, outperforming symmetrical structure GO membranes and other reported membranes, which was further confirmed by simulation results.

Subsequently, using a facile and scalable high-speed mechanofusion technology, we construct a continuous, uniform, and tightly bound DS coating layer onto LCO, denoted as DS@LCO cathode.

Coupled with the lattice-coherent DS coating layer and reinforced CEI film, the hybrid surface architecture synergistically enhances the interfacial stability, thermal safety, and electrochemical performance of DS@LCO cathode. As a result, a stable operation of DS@LCO half-cell is achieved at 4.6 V (90.1% capacity retention after 250 cycles). Long-life and high-energy-density (1032 Wh L −1 ) pouch cells are harvested, retaining over 86% capacity after 1000 cycles.

Both experimental and theoretical results revealed the key role of the intermetal bias between Pt and Rh amplified by the rectifying contact with nitrogen-doped carbons support in accelerating the pre-enrichment of protons on Rh sites, diffusion of H species from Rh to Pt sites, and final H dissociation from Pt sites.

Moreover, the Pt 3 Rh 2 /NC cathode can reduce the proton diffusion resistance from 0.95 Ω of Pt/C to 0.69 Ω at a cell voltage of 1.5 V due to the promoted hydrogen species diffusion on catalyst surface, largely decreasing the cell voltage and extending the lifespan by 3.2 times.},

These anilines can subsequently serve as versatile intermediates for accessing a variety of heterocyclic structures, thereby facilitating the rapid synthesis of novel bioactive analogs.

However, this technology currently faces two major challenges: low methane conversion and significant overoxidation. Herein, we report a gold (Au) decorated niobium pentoxide (Nb 2 O 5 ) featuring unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced oxygen vacancies (O V ), which achieved a CH 4 conversion rate of 3.21 mmol g −1 h −1 with a selectivity of ∼98.1% toward C 2+ hydrocarbons ( λ = 320−780 nm, 300 mW cm −2 ), outperforming the selectivity of previously reported photocatalysts. Operando characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that the unsaturated Nb centers play a crucial role in promoting methane activation and facilitating the transfer of methyl (*CH 3 ) intermediates to the Au cocatalyst, thereby boosting the C─C coupling pathway while suppressing undesired overoxidation. Concurrently, the photoinduced O V sites enable the timely release of H 2 O from the lattice oxygen, thus enhancing O 2 activation and improving the lattice oxygen looping efficiency.

  abstract     = {Xylene isomer separation is a long-standing challenge due to the nearly identical properties of para-xylene (PX), meta-xylene (MX), ortho-xylene (OX), and ethylbenzene (EB). Here, we report a rationally designed pillar-layered metal–organic framework (MOF), Ni-HDB, incorporating a cylindrical 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) pillar that blocks lateral channels and directs molecular transport through elliptical windows (3.2 × 6.7 Å 2 ). These apertures closely match the dimensions of PX and EB, enabling kinetic sieving. As a result, Ni-HDB exhibits high selectivity for PX and EB, moderate selectivity for MX, and exclusion of OX under ambient conditions. It achieves record liquid-phase selectivities for EB/OX (1943), PX/OX (951), and MX/OX (158), along with high PX and MX adsorption capacities. Comparative studies with isoreticular analogues confirm that DABCO-driven confinement is key to enhancing size-based selectivity. Density functional theory calculations indicate kinetic preference for PX and EB, thermodynamic favorability for MX, and exclusion of OX. Ni-HDB also shows excellent thermal and structural stability, with no performance loss over ten cycles. These results highlight the importance of channel geometry in MOFs and provide a framework for developing next-generation adsorbents for energy-efficient hydrocarbon separations.},

  abstract     = {High-capacity Co-free Ni-rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for lithium-based batteries, but they suffer from chemo–electro–mechanical instabilities. While single-crystal morphologies reduce these issues, slipping, and microcracking persist during extended cycling, and the degradation mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Herein, we report on multi-directional planar slipping and microcracking along the (003) and (100) planes in a single-crystal LiNi 0.75 Mn 0.25 O 2 (LNM) cathode. According to the Darken–Gurry theory and formation energy in LNM, magnesium (Mg 2+ ) has been selected as the best pillaring element to strengthen the structural integrity and improve cycling stability. Notably, Li 0.99 Mg 0.01 Ni 0.75 Mn 0.25 O 2 (LMNM) achieves a capacity retention of 91% after 1000 cycles at 4.3 V operation against graphite by alleviating instability issues. We systematically unravel the pillaring effect, for the first time, from the quantum scale to the lattice level and from the microscale to the macroscopic level of the cathode particles, providing an in-depth understanding of chemo–electro–mechanical degradation.},

As unraveled by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations, the core@satellites microstructure enables the tandem ECO 2 RR pathway to happen at the interfaced Ag and AgCu sites to facilitate C 2 H 5 OH formation, with Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C 2 H 5 OH reaching 61.4% at −100 mA cm −2 .

In this study, CuO x H y is grown on Cu foam as a model electrocatalyst to investigate the active phases of the Cu-based catalyst in the HMFOR, elucidate their oxidation mechanisms and adsorption behaviors at varying potentials, and ultimately to reveal the potential-regulated selectivity of the Cu-based catalyst. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Cu III ─OOH, generated from CuO at high potentials, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, enabling HMFOR to proceed via an indirect oxidation process that favors aldehyde oxidation. A further increase in potential activates the direct oxidation process of Cu III ─OOH, selectively oxidizing hydroxyl groups owing to the increased substrate coverage on the catalyst, which hinders aldehyde adsorption. This study offers a new strategy for enhancing the selectivity towards the oxidation of specific functional groups in value-added biomass conversion processes.},

  abstract     = {The incomplete conversion of sulfur species, particularly the pivotal intermediate solid Li 2 S 2 during redox processes, poses a significant limitation on the cyclability of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a synergistic modulation strategy of ion-/dipole–dipole interactions that tailors the solvation sheath configuration and activates the electrochemical reactivity of Li 2 S 2 is initially proposed for accelerating kinetics. As a proof of concept, the molybdenum nitride quantum dots located on nitrogen-doped carbon (MoNQDs/NC) were designed. Advanced in situ/ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that MoNQDs/NC effectively weaken the ion-dipole interactions within Li(solvent) x + species, thereby facilitating the desolvation process. Furthermore, the robust dipole–dipole interactions between polar domains of MoNQDs and Li 2 S 2 are realized to generate localized tensile strain fields to destabilize the S─S/Li─S bonds network. Consequently, the optimal cells maintain a high areal capacity (>5.0 mAh cm −2 ) after 50 cycles at high sulfur loading (4.4–9.1 mg cm −2 ) over a wide temperature range (0–60 °C). Furthermore, the pouch cell with a sulfur loading of 1.5 g retained a capacity of 1.79 Ah after 15 cycles, highlighting the potential of this ion-dipole modulation strategy for commercializing LSBs.},

Despite recent advances in biocatalysis, recombinant expression systems for hemoproteins leave much room for improvement due to the strict regulation of heme biosynthesis in the host organism. To develop an efficient cofactor supplementation system for the expression of active holohemoproteins, we describe metabolic engineering of the heme biosynthetic pathway in E. coli . Through incorporation of a heterogeneous C4 pathway involving 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase of Paracoccus denitrificans , it was found that the concentrations of 5-aminolevulinic acid and heme in the engineered cells are increased during cultivation, and the expression level of the holohemoproteins is significantly improved. Notably, the heme content in the engineered cells is even higher than that produced by conventional cultivation methods, which add 5-aminolevulinic acid into the culture medium. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the application of this engineered E. coli cells in whole-cell and lysate-based biocatalysis using various types of heme-dependent enzymes. Considering the recent demand for biocatalysis, the system developed in this study will serve as a new practical and versatile platform for hemoprotein-based biocatalysis.},

  abstract     = {Fullerene (C 60 ) was considered as a catalyst promoter in various electrochemical reactions, yet its catalytic role in enhancing catalytic performance beyond electron transfer remains a puzzle to chemists. Traditional simulations imply C 60 ’s inertness in CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) due to weak interaction with COOH* intermediates. Here, according to a pH-field coupled microkinetic model at reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, we demonstrate that C 60 acts as molecular active sites to facilitate the CO 2 RR toward CO through a strong binding to COOH* in the electrochemical conditions. This binding is mainly due to the unique structure of C 60 that induces large dipole moment changes to stabilize COOH* intermediates across different pH conditions. By detailed comparison of experimental CO 2 RR observations and quantitative pH-dependent modeling, this work provides new insights on C 60 -based catalysts, highlighting the large dipole moment change upon adsorption at curved surfaces should not be dismissed when analyzing the pH-dependent binding strength and electrocatalytic activity.},

Here, we present a modular and programmable DNA nanocage strategy for constructing stable and adaptive synthetic organelle networks. Using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a model, we anchored tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDNs) on the EV surface and assembled a mechanically reinforced biomimetic DNA nanocage via palindromic hybridization chain reaction (PHCR), thereby significantly enhancing vesicle stability and effectively preventing membrane fusion upon contact. The modular design enables the integration of logic-gated DNA elements as dynamic contact sites, allowing environment-responsive reconfiguration of inter-artificial-organelle spatial organization and signaling.

Furthermore, the BN-Se -based OLED showed ultralow efficiency roll-off, with EQEs remaining at 36.7 and 31.8% at 100 and 1000 cd m −2 , respectively. These emitters do not easily suffer from aggregation-caused quenching. Even at 12 wt% doping, the EQE max of the OLEDs with BN-S and BN-Se were 36.7 and 36.4%, respectively, with mild efficiency roll-off (EQEs at 1000 cd m −2 of 19.1 and 30.8%, respectively), and nearly unchanged electroluminescence spectra.},

  abstract     = {Dehydroamino acids (ΔAAs) are vital building blocks in the design and optimization of peptide drugs. The exact olefin geometry, side chain chemotype, and ancillary β-carbon substituents play a significant role. Unfortunately, general approaches to install these motifs into peptides are lacking, complicated by the instability of unsaturated residues during traditional amide-bond coupling and failure of divergent protocols, such as oxidative Heck and Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons, to accommodate a complete range of substrate classes. Herein, we conceive and interrogate an original bioorthogonal reagent, β-sulfonyldehydroamino acid (ΔSulf), that can be site-specifically encoded into standard peptides through solid- or liquid-phase synthesis. When combined with an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, myriad boronic acids and 525 nm light—a more biologically benign portion of the flavin visible absorption spectra that has not previously been exploited for flavin photoredox catalysis,—this latent residue becomes one of several ( Z )-ΔAA variants (aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic) via stereoretentive radical conjugate addition and β-scission. The importance of green light is established through mechanistic studies showing that it tempers radical formation and discourages flavin-catalyzed isomerization, controlling product selectivity. We apply our original reagent and catalytic platform in a brief medicinal chemistry campaign to discover tetrapeptides that modulate Aβ42 aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.},

However, the molecular polarity and strong ionic interactions of conventional electrolytes hinder ion mobility and compromise interfacial stability. In this study, we developed a deep eutectic electrolyte based on Li-bond (Li-DEE) comprising tetraethylammonium nitrate and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, which is different from the traditional hydrogen bonding or lithium ionic bonding electrolyte. The Li-bond network within the Li-DEE enables rapid lithium-ion transport (6.5 × 10 − 3 S cm −1 at 100 °C) while forming a stable electrode interface rich in Li 3 N and LiF. As a result, the Li-DEE enables an LMB to deliver a high capacity retention of 80% over 635 cycles at 0.5 C and a capacity of 84.4 mAh g −1 after 1500 cycles at 2 C and 100 °C.

Selenourea is a frequently used platform for the Lewis base catalyst design. In literature, it is generally believed that the Lewis basic selenium can form a Lewis adduct with the halogen as the active halogenating species. Herein, we report our recent finding that unveils an alternative mechanism of this type of reaction. It was found that the Lewis basic selenourea is first oxidized by the halogen source to give a benchtop stable and non-hygroscopic imidazolium hypervalent selenium dibromide compound that acts as the actual catalyst. The negative charge in the hypervalent selenium compound is stabilized by the electronegative bromide, leading to the site-isolated and unoccupied imidazolium cationic moiety. Mechanistic studies suggest that the electropositive C–Hs of the imidazolium cation can act as a strong hydrogen bond donor to activate the N -haloimide reagent for efficient halogenation reaction, including late-stage halogenation of drug molecules, with low catalyst loading. Further study revealed that hypervalent imidazolium selenium dibromide can generally be applied to other mechanistically unrelated hydrogen bond-catalyzed reactions.},

This transformation leverages the unique reactivity of enolized zinc homoenolates, which effectively act as a β-hydroxycyclopropyl anions and engage imines through a sequence of Mannich addition and ring closure. The key to this reactivity lies in the use of bulky N -heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, which promote efficient coupling with N -sulfonyl aldimines as well as chiral N -sulfinyl trifluoromethyl-ketimines while ensuring excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters. Furthermore, the resulting γ-amino alcohols can be transformed into β- or γ-aminofunctionalized ketones via homoenolate or β-keto radical intermediates, offering versatile platforms for downstream derivatization.},

  abstract     = {The micromorphology of composite cathodes is known to play a vital role in determining all-solid-state battery (ASSB) performance. However, much of our current understanding is derived from empirical observations, lacking a deeper mechanistic foundation. The “rocking chair” concept of battery chemistry requires maintaining charge neutrality, emphasizing the necessity of examining electrode micromorphology from the perspective of conductive networks. This study systematically investigates the microscopic electrochemical impacts of conductive network micromorphology by varying the Li + -to-e − channel ratio in cathodes comprising LiNbO 3 -coated LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 , Li 6 PS 5 Cl, and carbon fibers. Utilizing multiscale synchrotron-based spectro-microscopy, we unravel that unbalanced Li + and e − conducting channels intensify charge polarization within active cathode particles and accelerate their degradation. A further model system with X-ray nano-tomography resolved e − and Li + channels indicates that spatially uniform and well-paired Li + and e − conducting channels are highly desirable as they could promote more uniform lithiation/delithiation, mitigating microscopic electrochemical polarization. Electrode-scale X-ray holotomography analysis reveals that the impact of conductive networks is particle-size-dependent, with smaller cathode particles being more significantly affected. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between conductive networks and all-solid-state battery operation, laying the groundwork for rational design and optimization of cathode architectures in future solid-state battery technologies.},

  abstract     = {All the objects that surround us can be seen as combinations of elementary shapes like spheres, rods, and squares that perform complex tasks when connected in a well-defined manner. While making a device by assembling those shapes remains relatively easy at the human scale, it is extremely challenging to do so at the nanoscale, due to the difficulty to covalently attach at a defined position a nano-object with a given shape to another one of different geometry. To circumvent this hurdle, here, we introduce an innovative approach that consists in performing polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) onto core-crystalline micelles prepared by crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA). Because of the intrinsic properties of CDSA, one can construct one- or two-dimensional substrates to initiate PISA at very specific locations. Performing CDSA- substrated -PISA (CDSA- s -PISA) onto triblock co-micelles where only the central block was PISA active, led to the formation of elongated structures bearing one or two beads on their central parts, while CDSA- s -PISA on entirely PISA active micelles and in presence of free macro-CTA, allowed the preparation of uniform elongated micelles fully decorated with beads. These results offer a sneak peek of what the next generation of multitasks polymeric assemblies will be.},

In the trans -state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material. UV-induced switching to the sterically demanding cis -configuration restricts ring mobility, thereby increasing the Young's modulus by two-fold while reducing toughness. Control experiments with noninterlocked analogs revealed the opposite mechanical response—light-induced softening—highlighting the pivotal role of topology in property regulation. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions. This work establishes a versatile strategy for post-synthetic topological control via molecular photoswitches, enabling the design of adaptive polymers with stimuli-responsive mechanical properties for applications in smart materials.},

Conventional biological and chemical synthetic approaches suffer from low efficiency and elevated energy demands. While emerging thermocatalysis and photocatalysis strategies offer promising alternatives, their environmental sustainability is substantially constrained by their reliance on Haber–Bosch-derived ammonia as a nitrogen source, which contributes to a significant carbon footprint. Here we developed a hybrid thermochemical-plasma-electrochemical system for sustainable alanine synthesis directly from end-of-life polylactic acid (PLA) plastic using atmospheric nitrogen as a nitrogen source. The synthetic pathway for alanine production initiates with the thermocatalytic oxidative depolymerization of PLA to pyruvic acid (PA) in aqueous medium under mild conditions (140 °C, 1 MPa air), utilizing a Pt/SiO 2 catalyst with high impurity tolerance. Concurrently, a nitrate-enriched solution is generated through plasma-mediated activation of air and water under ambient conditions. Subsequently, the PA and nitrate solutions are mixed and directly introduced to the electrochemical reactor. We employ a strain-engineered CuBi alloy electrocatalyst capable of stably catalyzing alanine production via co-electrolysis of PA and nitrate. This integrated process establishes a sustainable pathway to valorize low-cost feedstocks into high-value commodity chemicals using renewable energy while mitigating plastic pollution.},

The key features of this chemistry include 1) stereoselective addition of the difluoro(sulfoximidoyl)methyl anion to C═C bonds, although it was considered to be highly unfavorable from the view of hard–soft acid–base (HSAB) theory; 2) intriguing neighboring group participation of the oxygen from the nitro group that was found to play a crucial role in controlling the stereoselectivity and efficiency of the transformation and was supported by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. This method has been applied to the late-stage modification of several complex molecules and the preparation of enantioenriched bioactive γ-fluorinated amines, such as a phytopathogenic fungi inhibitor, TRPC6 and CDK11 inhibitors, and even monofluorinated lorcaserin, which further demonstrated the significance and potential of this approach.},

Electrolyte additives, especially organic molecule additives, provide an effective and cost-efficient strategy to address these issues. To efficiently screen a large number of organic molecules for developing new electrolyte additives, we employ an artificial intelligence-driven approach, using graph neural network to analyze 75 024 organic molecules based on three key properties, including adsorption energies on Zn(002) surface, redox potentials, and water solubility. We identified 48 promising candidate molecules by this high-throughput screening method, among which cyanoacetamide (CA) and hydantoin (HN) were experimentally validated as novel electrolyte additives for AZIBs that have not been reported previously. The experimental and calculation results demonstrate that CA and HN preferentially adsorb onto the surface of the zinc anode, resulting in the enhanced interfacial stability of zinc anodes. This behavior effectively mitigates zinc dendrite formation, contributing to the improved stability and reversibility of the zinc electrode. It is believed that our work combines AI-assisted high-throughput research, experimental validation, and theoretical calculations, providing a scalable framework for selecting and developing new electrolyte additive molecules.},

Most clinical isolates belong to serotype 5 or 8, which express unique capsular polysaccharides (CP), composed of the rare N -acetyl-β- d -mannosaminuronic acid (β- d -ManNAcA), N -acetyl-α- l -fucosamine (α- l -FucNAc) and N -acetyl-β- d -fucosamine (β- d -FucNAc) that can be used for the development of conjugate vaccines. Different acetylation patterns of CP5 create microheterogeneous polymers, carrying partial zwitterionic character, which may be important for immunological activity. We here report on the assembly of a set of conjugation-ready CP5 oligosaccharides, ranging in length from trisaccharides to nonasaccharides. The developed protecting group strategy has allowed the incorporation of N- acetyl, -NH 3 + and O -acetyl groups. The reported syntheses offer solutions for the construction of the challenging cis -glycosidic linkages, the incorporation of many different functional groups and the installation of an appropriate linker for future conjugation purposes. Conformational analysis of the O -acetylated oligomers has revealed a distinctive linear conformation with the repeating units (RUs) being flipped ∼180° with respect to the flanking RUs. Binding studies with CP5-antibodies revealed the trisaccharide to be too short for relevant binding, while the hexa- and nonasaccharides exhibited strong binding. The l -FucNAc acetyl esters and d -FucNAc acetamides were shown to be crucial for binding.},

  abstract     = {DNA hybridization and assembly processes are governed by the concerted effects of Watson–Crick pairing and base-stacking interactions. While sequence engineering and chemical modifications have been extensively exploited to regulate DNA hybridization processes and complex structural assembly of DNA, here we demonstrate the use of locked nucleic acid (LNA) modifications to finely tune base-stacking interactions, which are yet to be explored in DNA assembly processes, to program the growth of self-assembled DNA crystals. We find that sticky-end LNA modifications decrease base-pair spacing and enhance base-stacking energy, which synergistically improves interstrand affinity and accelerates hybridization rate constants, as revealed by strand displacement kinetics, molecular dynamics simulations, and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis. This LNA-based base-stacking engineering strategy can finely tune base-stacking energy landscapes to drive anisotropic growth and morphological control in self-assembled DNA crystal. We further establish a quantitative framework for probing structure–energy relationships in base-stacking interactions, which not only paves the way for better control of structural DNA nanotechnology but also provides mechanistic insights for developing dynamic DNA nanosystems.},

Herein, we report a robust, water-soluble, metal-free tetracationic cyclophane ( B ) capable of achieving >99% selective extraction of ST from EB in aqueous media with excellent recyclability. B features a hydrophobic, conformationally adaptive cavity (∼6.5 Å × 14.3 Å) that selectively recognizes planar over nonplanar guests in aqueous medium. Solution-state and solid-state analyses confirm that the preferential binding of ST is driven by favorable interactions with its vinyl group and induced planarization of the host. B also distinguishes phenanthrene ( P ) from 9,10-dihydroanthracene ( DHA ), further validating its precision in shape-selective molecular recognition. Our findings demonstrate a unique aqueous separation of ST from EB employing a metal-free receptor that advances the design of selective host–guest systems and supports greener alternatives for hydrocarbon purification.},

Here, we show that zeolites can be used to size-selectively acetalize sugars and polyols in a single step, and we demonstrate the potential of this approach for producing functional chemicals and materials. We show that high selectivity is dependent on effective pore confinement, which is achieved by a careful pairing of the substrate size and the zeolite morphology. This zeolite-catalyzed strategy exhibited consistently good-to-excellent yields (70%–95%) of novel polyol/sugar monoacetals, notably offering an easy route to bio-based amphiphiles.

Here, we demonstrate a transformative approach by converting CO poisoning into a beneficial strategy to achieve high activity and selectivity in urea electrosynthesis. We designed a multiscale and multisite nanoreactor composed of copper–carbon dots (Cu-CDs) and bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4 ), which exploits CO-poisoned iron sites as anchors to facilitate efficient multi-species integration. This nanoreactor configuration delivers an unprecedented C urea - selectivity of 100%, a high urea yield rate of 1131.84 µg h −1 mg cat −1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 42.35% at an ultra-low potential. Consequently, the catalyst achieves exceptional dual benefits of a high yield rate and low energy consumption of 31.18 kWh kg urea −1 , outperforming all previously reported earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between Fe and *CO, coupled with spatially separated yet adjacent Fe, Cu 1 , and Cu 2 sites, enables stepwise conversion from *CO to *CONH 2 and subsequently to *CO(NH 2 ) 2 within the nano-confined space dominated by Cu-CDs. This work provides a groundbreaking catalyst design strategy by effectively harnessing CO poisoning for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.},

However, the practical application of COFs for scalable solar-to-hydrogen conversion remains limited due to their insufficient photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we achieved an exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 364 mmol g −1 h −1 using HCl-protonated COF-920 under ultraviolet-visible light, as confirmed by water-drainage and gas-gathering experiments, exceeding most previously reported COF-based photocatalysts. Three series of isoreticular COFs were synthesized, incorporating benzene, biphenyl, and triphenyl linkers, along with their structural isomers featuring reversed imine bond orientations, to systematically investigate the collaborative influences of linker length, structural isomerism, and protonation on the photocatalytic performance. Experimental results revealed that COFs employing biphenyl-based linkers exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared to those with benzene or triphenyl linkers. Moreover, the performance difference resulting from variations in imine orientation decreases with increasing linker length, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing narrower energy differences between units connected by imine bonds (─C═N─). Our findings not only provide new insights into structure–activity relationships in COF photocatalysts but also highlight the potential of COF materials for sustainable solar-to-fuel conversion.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to formate offers a sustainable pathway for carbon-neutral fuel production, yet achieving high selectivity and activity remains challenging due to competing hydrogen evolution. While grain boundaries (GBs) enhance catalytic performance, the impact of GB density, uniformity, and twisting angles remains unclear. Here, we engineer SnS nanoplates with high-density GBs via cation exchange (CE), preserving sulfur frameworks while inducing strain-driven domain segmentation. The GB-SnS catalyst achieves a formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.9% at −1.0 V RHE , with a partial current density of 204.6 mA cm −2 at −1.2 V RHE , surpassing single-crystalline (SC) SnS by 3.5-fold. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) reveal high-angle GBs lower *OCHO stabilization barriers while suppressing *H adsorption. Counterintuitively, small-angle GBs raise the *OCHO barrier, impairing CO 2 RR—a finding that challenges the assumption that all GBs benefit catalysis. DFT further predicts out-of-plane rotational GBs similarly enhance stabilization, guiding future 3D defect engineering. The catalyst demonstrates industrial viability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), sustaining >80% FE at 200 mA cm −2 for 150 h. Statistical analysis of >200 GBs correlates twisting angles with adsorption strength, establishing an angle-dependent design principle. This work decouples geometric/electronic GB effects and pioneers solution-phase CE for scalable defect-rich catalysts, advancing sustainable CO 2 utilization.},

  abstract     = {Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 (NZSP) has stimulated considerable attention due to its remarkable ionic conductivity and exceptional chemical/electrochemical stability. However, an unstable electrolyte/electrode interface and large interface resistance severely restricted its practical application. To settle this issue, an interface-targeting integrated sandwich-like NZSP composite electrolyte was constructed by designing an artificial interface layer on both the anode and cathode sides. The uniformly deposited SbF 3 layer on the anode side of NZSP instantly formed a Na x Sb/NaF-rich conductive layer during discharging, which effectively suppressed the growth of Na dendrites. The flexible PVDF layer on the cathode side of NZSP mitigated volume expansion/contraction and thus enhanced the poor solid–solid interfacial contact. Befitting the unique interface design, the Na/SbF 3 -NZSP-SbF 3 /Na symmetric cells demonstrated a critical current density of up to 1.9 mA cm −2 and achieved ultra-stable plating/stripping cycling over 2600 h at 0.1 and 0.2 mA cm −2 , respectively. Noticeably, the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /PVDF-NZSP-SbF 3 /Na full cells attained a high capacity retention of 90.0% after 2100 cycles at 0.5 C. Even for a high mass loading of 10.33 mg cm −2 , Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /PVDF-NZSP-SbF 3 /Na has no capacity attenuation over 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This bilateral interface design strategy promotes the utilization of NZSP electrolytes and offers an avenue for the development of solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).},

  abstract     = {Rational molecular design at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface presents a viable strategy to suppress nonradiative recombination in CsPbI 3-x Br x -based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, simultaneously achieving efficient defect passivation and rapid charge extraction with a single molecular modifier remains challenging. Herein, we employ a planar conjugated molecule, 1,8-naphthyridin-2-amine (2-NA), as a multifunctional interfacial modifier that concurrently enhances charge extraction and suppresses interfacial recombination in CsPbI 3-x Br x PSCs. Combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analyses reveal that 2-NA forms a dense protective layer via noncovalent interactions (e.g., π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding), effectively passivating undercoordinated Pb 2+ while inhibiting ion migration. Remarkably, 2-NA incorporation facilitates hot-carrier extraction, reducing the carrier cooling time from 515 to 240 fs and quadrupling the carrier diffusion length, thereby improving charge transport. As a result, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.49%, the highest reported value for this class of PSCs to date. Furthermore, the device retains 93.6% of its initial PCE after 1008 h under ambient conditions, demonstrating exceptional stability.

  abstract     = {Addressing the environmental persistence of plastics requires the development of next-generation polymers that combine high performance with enhanced degradability. Progress toward this grand challenge has been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a “macroisostere” design strategy, where the carbonyl group (–CO–) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (–SO 2 –), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young's modulus. Notably, the S(VI)-based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability. These results highlight the potential of the “macroisostere” approach as a generalizable strategy for designing high-performance, degradable alternatives to traditional plastics.},

Herein, we proposed a novel strategy by integration of metallosalen (M-Salen) active sites and Zr-MOF, to promote the selective production of syngas through photocatalytic CO 2 and H 2 O reduction. A series of M-Salen (Co, Co 2 , Cu, Cu 2 ) with carboxylic groups were embedded into a Zr-MOF (NKM-908) by replacing the terminal coordinated -OH - /H 2 O on the Zr 6 clusters. The integration of M-Salen and NKM-908 significantly accelerate the transfer dynamics of photogenerated charge and promote CO 2 enrichment around the M-Salen active sites. The M-Salen sites played a crucial role in enhancing CO production. Specifically, the mononuclear Co-Salen exhibits stronger CO 2 adsorption and activation capabilities than the binuclear Co 2 -Salen, with enhanced *CO 2 coverage. In addition, the Co-based salen catalyst exhibits a lower energy barrier for *CO desorption—the rate-determining step—compared to its Cu-based counterpart. As a result, the Co-NKM-908 exhibited optimal performance in photocatalytic CO 2 and H 2 O conversion, achieving a high CO production rate of 1.92 mmol g −1 h −1 and a H 2 production rate of 1.52 mmol g −1 h −1 with a standard syngas CO/H 2 ratio of 1.3/1.},

  abstract     = {Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) enables the quantification of nanoscale distances and biomolecular interactions. Luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) are frequently combined with fluorescent dyes or proteins in FRET. However, their use in inter-NP FRET with luminescent NPs as both donor and acceptor remains less common due to the inherent size constraints that can limit FRET efficiencies. This review critically examines the early advances and current state-of-the-art of inter-NP FRET with a focus on the most commonly used NPs, namely quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), and fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs). We show how NP sizes, surface shells, and coatings increase FRET-distances; propose how these drawbacks can be overcome or outcompeted by the unique photophysical properties of the NPs; and discuss representative examples of inter-NP FRET for biosensing. High luminescence brightness, outstanding photostability, near-infrared excitation and emission, spectral and temporal multiplexing, and large surfaces for multifunctional bioconjugation are only some of the features that make luminescent NPs very attractive for biosensing, and FRET efficiencies up to 90% have demonstrated their potential for successful translation into bioanalytical applications.},

  abstract     = {Chirality-driven self-assembly is crucial in biological systems, but achieving precise control over chiral narcissistic or social self-sorting as well as the distinction between them remains a major challenge in multicomponent supramolecular systems. To investigate chirality-driven self-assembly, two classes of chiral building blocks, photo-responsive (cinnamic glutamide derivative, L/D-CG) and fluorescent molecules (dansyl glutamide derivative, L/D-DNSG), were designed and integrated into homochiral systems (L-CG/L-DNSG or D-CG/D-DNSG) and heterochiral systems (L-CG/D-DNSG or D-CG/L-DNSG). Either homo- or heterochiral systems could form organogels with fibrous structures. Upon photoirradiation, the homochiral systems remained stable, whereas the heterochiral systems underwent a significant transformation from uniform organogels to suspensions, in which nanokebab structures appeared. The results demonstrate that social self-sorting dominates in the homochiral systems while narcissistic self-sorting prevails in the heterochiral systems. Remarkably, the difference between homochiral and heterochiral systems is magnified through photodimerization. Various characterizations and simulations unveil the underlying homo- and heterochiral interactions that drive narcissistic self-sorting from the molecular to hierarchical nanoscale levels. This work decrypts the narcissistic or social self-sorting behavior in chirality-driven supramolecular systems through photoirradiation and provides a new perspective for understanding the regulation of chiral-driven functions in biological or material systems.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state artificial photosystems need precise control over their singlet or triplet excited states to enable desired photochemical transformations. While persistent triplets are often selected to drive chemical bond formation or spin-specific photoreactions, singlets can allow for ambient applications. Among different heterogeneous systems, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a solution-stable platform with many benefits, including large chemically accessible interior surfaces where excitons can be transferred from their original formation sites. Porphyrins demonstrate high intersystem crossing efficiency, with QY ISC ≈ 80% for free-base (FB) cores, which can be increased to about 92% for palladium-metalated cores. This study shows that framework assembly prevents ISC in FB-MOFs; whereas, ISC is enhanced in Pd-MOFs compared to monomeric linkers. The MOF topology influences the excited state dynamics, resulting in short-lived triplets with τ 0.5 ≲10 ps in microporous MOFs. This extensive control over QY ISC (from 0 to approximately 100%) and triplet behavior through framework assembly offers new design principles for creating artificial photosystems that operate exclusively in their singlet or triplet states manifold.},

Here we disclose that a bioinspired peptide-phosphonium salt (PPS) catalytic system successfully enables precise desymmetrization of phosphinic acids through synergistic ion-pairing and hydrogen-bonding interactions. This strategy affords multifunctional platform molecules bearing P(V)-stereocenters with excellent enantiocontrol and broad compatibility (43 examples, up to 92% yield, up to >99% ee) at very low catalyst loading (1 mol%). Furthermore, the P(V)-chiral building blocks undergo stereospecific derivatization to access structurally diverse phosphinates (27 examples, up to 75% yield, up to >99% ee) and tertiary phosphine oxides (10 examples). Mechanistic studies reveal that the stereochemical origin is from a semi-enclosed chiral cavity, where dynamic electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions synergistically orchestrate the stereodetermining transition state. The two-stage desymmetrization–derivatization process establishes a versatile platform for modular synthesis of valuable P(V)-stereogenic pharmaceuticals and functional molecules.},

The optimized Co 3 O 4 @CuO catalyst exhibits a superb nitrate reduction performance, including a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 93.4 % at an ampere-level current density of approximately 2500 mA cm −2 .

Herein, we demonstrate a chlorine-modified ZrO 2 supported Pd catalyst (Pd-Cl/ZrO 2 ) efficiently converting lignin to cyclohexanones under optimized reaction conditions, based on poplar RCF (reductive catalytic fractionation) lignin oil. Notably, the addition of trace HCl enables the catalytic process to proceed under milder conditions (200 °C), achieving a cyclohexanones yield of 34.3 wt% (relative to lignin content in poplar biomass). The acidity (H⁺) from HCl promotes dehydroxylation of lignin oil. Moreover, studies on model compound guaiacol reveal that Cl species may partially block Pd to suppress aromatic ring hydrogenation and promote electron transfer from Pd to the ZrO 2 support, collectively promoting ketone yield. This study presents a novel catalytic approach for the efficient and selective conversion of lignin, advancing biorefineries toward the direct synthesis of ketone derivatives.},

However, metal/semimetal anodes contributing to high theoretical capacity are prone to creep at high temperatures, which raises significant concerns about battery safety and cycling performance. Here, we identify the generation of Li-rich phases at anodes that leads to the sustained degradation of high-temperature batteries. The non-conformal interface between anode and electrolyte constricts lithiation in local contact areas, resulting in extremely low chemical potential and subsequent evolution of high temperature unstable Li-rich phases. We therefore designed a heat-resistant anode featuring a Zintl-like phase core and an ion-electron co-conducting conformal coating, which releases local constriction while inhibiting high-temperature interfacial deactivation. Consequently, solid-state battery (SSB) assembled with this designed anode can stably cycle over 1,000 cycles at 120 °C (2C, pouch cell-340 Wh kg −1 ). Particularly distinguishing itself from molten salt high-temperature batteries, the SSB exhibits outstanding temperature adaptability in full-temperature dynamic tests (−40–150 °C).},

Controlling the reversible uptake of functional molecules, however, remains a major challenge. To address this, we developed a novel aniline-type diarylethene (DAE) crosslinker and prepared a series of corresponding poly( N -vinylcaprolactam)-based microgels with varying degrees of DAE crosslinker. Upon UV light irradiation, the aniline (and thus enamine) motif of the DAE is converted to its imine form, thus allowing for reversible exchange with primary amines. Irradiating the DAE with blue light covalently locks the equilibrium and traps the amine in the microgels. The light-controlled covalent binding of fluorinated, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic amine derivatives was proven by dynamic light scattering and 19 F NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, the impact of photoisomerization and amine binding on microgel properties was investigated and we were able to remotely control size as well as temperature and pH responsiveness by light. Overall, this study demonstrates optically gated uptake and release of functional amines in multi-responsive microgels and highlights their potential biological applications.},

However, the incorporation of ubiquitous aryl chlorides remains a challenge due to the slow rate of oxidative addition of metal catalysts to these electrophiles relative to iodide and bromide derivatives. This study reports a simple metallaphotoredox-catalyzed C(sp 2 )─C(sp 3 ) cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) method for the selective coupling of a broad range of aryl chlorides and alkyl halides. By design, this methodology exploits the enabling interplay of a bidentate 2-(1 H -imidazol-2-yl)pyridine ligand, incorporating the strong σ-donor capacity of a 1 H -imidazole moiety with the moderate π-acceptor capacity of a pyridine unit. The synergy provided by these modular components allowed for the electronic requirements of elementary steps to be accommodated, such as the synchronous integration of alkyl radical generation (typically relatively fast) and oxidative addition of low valent nickel species to aryl chlorides (often relatively slow). This protocol enabled the efficient late-stage diversification of the drugs Me -fenofibrate, indomethacin, and etoricoxib to enhance their sp 3 -rich complexity. Using an equimolar ratio of substrates, this methodology facilitated a decagram XEC in continuous flow, showcasing the applicability of the method for large scale synthesis.},

In this study, we provide a solution to this long-lasting problem by introducing a new concept, asymmetric dynamic bond mediated polymerization (ADBP). In this case, the polymerization between asymmetric and reversibly deactivated AA’-type dielectrophiles and B 2 -type dinucleophiles has a preferential reaction pathway between the functionality A’ of the asymmetric AA’ monomer with B 2 . We observe that this polymerization allows us to achieve better control of the step-growth process where in the first stage only well-defined trimers and dimers are primarily formed up to conversion ( p ) ≤ 0.6, followed by their polymerization stage ( p ≥ 0.6). This leads to polymers with reduced Đ (<1.5), in comparison to traditional SGP, and improved molar mass control. Such technique is further exploited to prepare polyurethanes with Đ = 1.2, which exhibit the ability to form microphase-separated domains with higher ordering, giving rise to polyurethane thermosets with superior mechanical properties compared to a traditional SGP analog.},

  abstract     = {Gold catalysis has long been dominated by the ability of gold(I) to activate unsaturated systems as a carbophilic Lewis acid. However, recent advances have highlighted the significance of Au(I)/Au(III) redox transitions, unlocking new catalytic pathways. Among the strategies facilitating these oxidative processes, electrochemical anodic oxidation has emerged as a powerful tool. Despite its potential, the electrochemical properties of key gold complexes remain largely underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate the oxidative behavior of a series of gold complexes using cyclic voltammetry. A comprehensive electrochemical scale is established, revealing that N -heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based gold complexes are among the least prone to oxidation, whereas phosphorylated ligands significantly enhance oxidizability. Within triphenylphosphine gold complexes, the nature of the X-type anionic ligand plays a crucial role in determining oxidative behavior, a trend rationalized through density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Additionally, hemilabile P^N ligands dramatically facilitate oxidation, correlating with their ability to promote oxidative addition. These findings provide fundamental insights into the redox properties of gold complexes, offering valuable guidelines for the design of new gold-catalyzed transformations.},

As a result, the optimal n-i-p PSC achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.85% alongside enhanced operational stability under simulated 1-sun illumination over 1200 h. A large-area device with an area of 1 cm 2 also exhibited a PCE of 24.79%.

  abstract     = {Neuropeptides are key neuromodulators in the central nervous system that shape sensory processing, yet their extracellular dynamics in the somatosensory cortex (S1) remain poorly understood. This study applies an innovative membrane-free silicon nanodialysis (ND) probe coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze the extracellular neuropeptidome in the mouse S1 with spatial resolution down to 100 µm. Localized in vivo sampling identified extracellular peptides from secretogranin-1, ProSAAS, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and others. Minimal tissue damage, enabled by probe dimensions of 75 × 15 µm 2 , resulted in an absence of structural peptides in the dialysate indicating low intracellular contamination. Many detected secretory peptides correlated with strong local mRNA expression; however, the detection of POMC-derived peptides, despite negligible local expression, suggests long-distance peptide transport or extracellular processing. To expand peptide identification, a discovery-to-targeted peptidomic approach was developed, revealing 46 peptides from 24 proteins in dialysate samples, including 10 proteins with low local expression. Complementary S1 tissue analysis confirmed POMC peptides and showed that 17% of 304 prohormone-derived peptides had low local expression. These results uncover a complex extracellular peptide landscape shaped by both local and long-distance signaling. By overcoming the limitations of traditional microdialysis, this approach advances the understanding of neuropeptide signaling in cortical function.},

Unlike the well-known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d-band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by finite-different-time-domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub-100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (≤ 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near-infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low-energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser-generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn 3 O 4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.},

This dependency introduces stability challenges and complicates device fabrication due to the traditional air-oxidation doping process, which is time-consuming, unpredictable, and requires continuous monitoring of device variability. Here, we propose two triphenyl sulfonium (TPS) salts as UV-light-triggered radical-generating dopants for 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis [ N,N -di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene(spiro-OMeTAD). These dopants eliminate the need for air-based oxidation, thereby simplifying fabrication while enhancing the electrical properties of spiro-OMeTAD through efficient p-type doping. Using this approach, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.18%, surpassing the performance of traditional doping methods. Notably, PSCs incorporating TPS dopants and cost-effective silver top-electrodes demonstrated exceptional stability under various operational conditions. This work presents a scalable, cost-effective doping strategy that addresses critical stability-efficiency trade-offs in PSCs, positioning them as viable contenders for commercial renewable energy applications.},

Innovatively, an n-type 2D perovskite functional layer featuring a distinctive edge/corner-sharing (E/C-sharing) [PbI 6 ] 4− octahedral framework is constructed on a 3D film surface by utilizing N -methylethylenediamine cations (MEDA 2+ ) to regulate the connection modes of [PbI 6 ] 4− octahedral units. Specifically, the 2D-MEDAPb 2 I 6 with the E/C-sharing octahedra yields the narrowest interlayer spacing recorded to date (8.39 Å) among 2D perovskites, thus boosting the octahedral interlayer coupling effect and weakening the quantum and dielectric confinement effect to improve carrier mobility. Additionally, the 2D capping layer reinforces surface lattice stability by inducing a compressive stress field and increasing defect formation energy. The resulting type-II 3D/2D heterojunction significantly lowers the interfacial energy barriers for electron transfer and reduces the carrier recombination losses. Consequently, the inverted PSCs achieve an optimal efficiency of 26.43% (certified at 26.10%) and maintain over 94% of their initial efficiency after operating for 1200 hours under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. This research provides a unique perspective for developing novel 2D perovskites in perovskite-based photovoltaics.},

Due to the increased torsion degree of the helicene backbone and the improved helical chiral molecular self-consistency, P and M enantiomers of A7HPA molecules tend to stack in an alternating pattern similar to “gear mesh,” leading to reinforced intermolecular π–π interactions and conjugation effect to rigidify the hole transport layer. Consequently, the A7HPA-based single-junction wide bandgap PSC and perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell exhibited impressive long-term stability under both damp-heat and light-thermal synergetic stress tests and provided 23.41% and 33.06% (certified as 32.57%) power conversion efficiencies, respectively.},

So, we propose an encapsulation-confined strategy, by which a poriferous Ni(OH) 2 on Pt nanocages (thereafter Pt/Ni(OH) 2 ) was spatially wrapped to regulate charge transfer. As the heterogeneous interface enables spreading the surface electric field, the wrapped Ni(OH) 2 layer not only optimizes the proton-coupled electron dynamics but also stabilizes the Pt sites via undifferentiated adsorption of solvent molecules in the IHP, as demonstrated by using identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM). Consequently, the Pt/Ni(OH) 2 (11.85 mA/mg Pt at an overpotential of 70 mV) achieves an excellent mass activity of 12.74 times higher than the commercial Pt/C and long-term durability in 1 M KOH.

  abstract     = {Cascade metathesis polymerization (CMP) offers a powerful route to complex yet precise polymer microstructures. However, achieving both high cascade selectivity and polymerization efficiency remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report our efforts to enhance cascade efficiency (CE) in CMP of various dicycloalkenes and explore their closed-loop chemical recycling. A comprehensive investigation revealed that second-generation Grubbs catalysts ( G2 and DIPP-G2 ) exhibited superior cascade selectivity (CE up to >99%) and polymerization efficiency (turnover numbers up to 3550) compared to first-generation Grubbs catalyst ( G1 ). This is attributed to a preferred intramolecular cascade pathway that suppresses competing ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Polymers with high CE showed markedly improved glass transition temperatures ( T g ), by up to 47 °C. Remarkably, in-depth studies on sulfonamide-based dicycloalkenes uncovered an unexpected intramolecular cascade transformation, forming new bicyclic monomers, which underwent ROMP and yielded highmolecular-weight polymers ( M n up to 141 kDa). Importantly, these well-defined polymers underwent selective and complete depolymerization into small molecules via reverse CMP or ROMP, which then were repolymerized thereby achieving closed-loop recycling. Computational studies explained how these small molecules were preferentially formed. Overall, this work underscores the potential of our insights (understanding the detailed mechanistic pathways of CMP transformation depending on catalysts and monomer structures) toward sustainable chemical recycling.},

  abstract     = {Alcohols are highly common organic compounds but remain scarce as alkyl donors in synthetic procedures. Here, we describe an electrochemical procedure for their deoxygenative cross-electrophile coupling with hydrosilanes, furnishing organosilane products in good to excellent yields. Mechanistic studies provide insights into the operating pathways of this semi-paired electrolytic transformation, suggesting that silyl ethers are likely reaction intermediates. Furthermore, a unified mechanistic proposal is presented that accounts for observed reactivity differences with analogous deoxygenative electrocarboxylation.},

  abstract     = {High-energy lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) demand next-generation alloying-type anodes with high capacity and low voltage. While silicon-based anodes are in industrial use, commercial alloying-type anodes still suffer from excessive volume expansion and inadequate cycle life. Even incorporating silicon-carbon composites within graphite (typically <20% in commercial products) fails to resolve these limitations. Herein, we report a novel SrGe 2 O 4 S anode for ultralong-cycling lithium storage. An oxysulfide matrix (Li₂O/SrS) was in situ formed around Ge nanodomains. Enabled by the strong covalency of soft S 2 ⁻ anions and the pinning effect of large Sr 2 ⁺ ions, this synergistic matrix has demonstrated capabilities to enhance interfacial compatibility with Ge, facilitate efficient Li⁺ transport, suppress agglomeration of Ge nanoparticles and buffer volume expansion, as evidenced by in/ex situ characterizations, density functional theory calculations, and finite element analysis simulations. The anode harvests a low charging medium voltage of 0.42 V and reversible capacity of 587 mA h g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 after 800 cycles (8300 h) with 93.2% capacity retention. The LiCoO 2 ||SrGe 2 O 4 S full cell delivers a high capacity of 142 mA h g −1 and energy density of 482 Wh kg −1 . This work sheds light on constructing functional matrix to relieve volume expansion and particle agglomeration of high-capacity ultralong-cycling alloying-type anodes.},

  abstract     = {Scintillators can convert high-energy ionizing radiation, such as X-ray, into low-energy ultraviolet-visible photons, and they have been widely used in various fields. However, like most luminogens, the emission intensity of a scintillator is usually influenced by the environmental temperature, increasing the temperature results in extreme decreases in radioluminescence. Here, a temperature-inert coinage metal cluster scintillator of Cu 4 S was prepared, and it exhibited not only intense radioluminescence at room temperature but also minimal fluctuations from 80 to 450 K. Mechanism study revealed that Cu 4 S is a typical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminogen. Owing to the strong C─H··· π interactions between the clusters, the geometric relaxation of Cu 4 S was restricted during the spin crossover process, leading to an exceptionally small reorganization energy. This induced intersystem crossing within the Marcus inverted region, resulting in temperature-independent luminescence behavior. More importantly, Cu 4 S metal cluster has excellent water‒oxygen stability and thermal stability and can be used to prepare flexible scintillator screen with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). On the basis of these features, temperature-independent high-resolution X-ray imaging with the Cu 4 S -PDMS scintillator screen was achieved, and the resolution at different temperatures was maintained above 20 LP mm −1 .},

This difficulty primarily stems from the spontaneous generation of planar chirality-induced stereoisomer mixtures during synthetic procedures, which considerably complicates the isolation process. In this study, we introduce a social chiral self-sorting strategy utilizing a triangular gold complex, enabling the stereochemically controlled synthesis of [9]cycloparaphenylene-pillar[5]arene trimers ( [9]CPP-3P[5]A ). Diverging from conventional synthetic approaches that typically yield four stereoisomers of pillararene trimers ( pSSS , pRRR , pSSR , and pRRS ), our methodology demonstrates selectivity, predominantly generating pSSR and pRRS isomers of [9]CPP-3P[5]A , with only trace amounts of pSSS and pRRR isomers. This stereoselectivity, as elucidated by crystallographic analysis, arises from the dynamic reorganization of Au─C σ -bonds during the assembly of the hexagold(I) complex, synergistically combined with specific phosphine ligand conformations and inter-pillararene interactions. The resulting chiral trimers exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, which facilitates the fabrication of CPL-active supramolecular polymers by leveraging the superior host–guest complexation capability of the pillar[5]arene units, opening new avenues for the development of chiral functional materials.},

Nevertheless, the issues of limited ionic conductivity and insufficient solid–solid contact interfaces significantly impede their practical applications. In this study, an intrinsically safe QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) in high flash point tetraglyme (G4)-based electrolyte is developed. Owing to the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms within the polymer matrix and Li + , solvation cage caused by the “chelating” effect between Li + and solvent molecules is disrupted. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that a solvated structure predominantly characterized by the contact ion pair is formed. Therefore, a robust solid electrolyte interface enriched with anion-derived LiF- and B-species is constructed. As a result, matched with a commercial-level loading LiFePO 4 cathode, a capacity retention of 92.7% is obtained even after 200 cycles. These results elucidate the polymer matrix's pivotal role in QSEs, offering novel pathway for designing advanced quasi-solid-state batteries, such as Li/Na/K/Mg/Ca et al.},

Aiming at novel concepts for tailoring the property profile of synthetic rubber in post-polymerization reactions, we introduce the thioether-containing 6-methylthio-hexa-1,3-diene (MTHD) as a diene monomer derived from the biobased methional. The obtained isomeric cis-/trans-mixture was successfully polymerized via anionic techniques. In situ 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) kinetics revealed different reactivities of the trans - and cis -isomer and dispersities of Ɖ = 1.21–1.35. Copolymerization with isoprene afforded a series of well-defined statistical copolymers with molar masses up to 50 kg mol −1 , permitting precise adjustment of MTHD content from 2% to 10%. These copolymers exhibited moderate to narrow distributions (Ɖ < 1.19). Targeting the thioether groups via post-polymerization modifications (i.e., alkoxylation and alkylation) permitted tailoring of the properties of the diene-based copolymers. The respective sulfoxide was obtained selectively by mild oxidation and represents an internal antioxidant group.

A promising strategy is to inhibit the protein-protein interaction between Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 using noncovalent compounds that target the Keap1 Kelch domain. These compounds may be more specific than covalent Keap1-reacting Nrf2 activators. However, the development of drug-like noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors faces challenges due to the size and polarity of the Kelch binding pocket. Here, we present a new series of noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors developed from a weak fragment hit identified by crystallographic screening. A two-step growing strategy and optimization guided by several X-ray cocrystal structures led to compounds with low nanomolar affinities and complete selectivity for Keap1 in a panel of homologous Kelch domains. In cells, compounds 24 and 28 potently activated the expression of Nrf2-controlled genes and showed anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome and STING signalling activation. RNA sequencing revealed activation of cytoprotective pathways and a different profile from typical covalent Nrf2 activators.

A specially designed iron single-atom catalyst (SAC) supported on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (NHCS), which feature high catalytic activity of the Fe-N 3 motifs, was employed, which facilitates the C─C bond cleavage during EG oxidation, and generates formaldehyde (CH 2 O) species. These intermediates subsequently react with S-containing nucleophiles, that is, SO 3 2− , to form hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) via C─S bond formation. Our method achieves a remarkable faradaic efficiency of over 60% and an unprecedented production rate of 1800 µmol cm −2 h −1 for HMS. Additionally, we validate the use of PET as feedstock for C─S bond formation, achieving a considerable faradaic efficiency of over 25% and an unprecedented production rate of 900 µmol cm −2 h −1 .

  abstract     = {Freshwater scarcity and nitrate contamination in water sources are critical environmental sustainability challenges. We address these two challenges by coupling seawater desalination with electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO 3 RR) via bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks. They serve as high-performance catalysts for NO 3 RR toward ammonia (NH 3 ) production. The efficient NO 3 RR is integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, enabling the production of freshwater from seawater and the removal of nitrate from contaminated water. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that Zn-N 4 units incorporated into the Fe polyphthalocyanine framework modulate Fe-N 4 sites’ d-band center to enhance the adsorption of NO 3 − and the generation of *H, resulting in 3.22 times higher turnover frequency and highly selective reduction toward NH 3 . The optimized Fe 8 Zn 1 PPc delivered NH 3 Faradic efficiency (>97% over a wide potential range (−0.55 to −0.95 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), the NH 3 yield rate of 2.68 mmol h −1 cm −2 at −0.85 V versus RHE, and over 120 h of stable operation, outperforming previously reported Fe-based catalysts for NO 3 RR. The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92 µg cm −2 min −1 ) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of natural seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal. This work presents an innovative solution for addressing sustainable water challenges.},

  abstract     = {Although polyoxovanadates (POVs) and their silver nanocluster composites have attracted significant research attention owing to their remarkable structural diversity and multifunctional properties, the mechanistic interplay between their dual chemical roles—serving simultaneously as host matrices in supramolecular architectures and as structural templates directing silver nanocluster (Ag NC) assembly—remains insufficiently understood. Herein, we systematically optimized the condensation of {VO x } ( x = 4, 5) tetrahedra or square pyramids around simple anions (S 2− and SO 4 2− ) to tailor two distinct host–guest cyclodextrin-like POV supermolecules: [S@V 16 O 48 ] 18− and [SO 4 @V 14 O 42 ] 16− . Remarkably, these two cyclic POVs were generated in situ and have never been observed before, either in vanadate chemistry or in silver nanoclusters, representing a new category of POV condensation species. These two host–guest supramolecular anions function as templates, inducing the formation of the POV-bearing Ag 0/I NCs, dubbed as Ag78 and Ag68 . Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ag68 and Ag78 is comprehensively discussed and the excellent PCE is attributed to the nonradiation transition process, encompassing the fast deactivation of the excited charge transfer (CT) state and the slow recombination of CT state, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work not only optimizes the condensation of {VO x } ( x = 4, 5) polyhedral building units to tailor novel host–guest POV supermolecules but also offers a new perspective on supramolecular anion templates in guiding the assembly of silver NCs.},

  abstract     = {Advanced membrane technology for the separation and purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) requires improvement in both membrane materials and manufacturing processes to achieve the high rejection of macromolecular solutes combined with high permeance for organic solvents in pharmaceutical industry. Here, we report a novel approach to preparing aromatic polyamide membranes (PAMs) with tunable microporosity and micropore size via modulator-assisted interfacial polymerization. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of PAMs are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate interfacial polymerization, which can be demonstrated through experiments and molecular simulations. The resulting optimal membrane achieves a methanol permeance of 11.9 L m − 2 h −1 bar −1 , representing a impressive 19.8-fold increase compared to commercial benchmark membrane (0.6 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 ) at the same molecular weight cut-off (∼460 g mol −1 ). For practical applications, the optimal membrane demonstrates exceptional capability in the separation of high-value APIs such as dipyridamole, achieving not only accelerated ethanol permeance but also a 6-fold enrichment factor relative to commercial membranes. This work demonstrates the significant potential of phenolphthalein-based microporous polyamide membrane in advancing API separation technologies.

  abstract     = {Mixed-linker-based multivariate metal-organic frameworks (MTV-MOFs) recently received considerable research effort because they exhibit tailored physicochemical properties that are often not possessed by single-linker MOFs and therefore find unique applications. Relative to the pristine linker, the incorporated linkers may tend to form different topologies, bringing about lattice mismatch and structural disorder. This leads to a low mixed-linker incorporation limit, and further increasing the linker incorporation rate may disrupt the crystallinity of the parent MOF, resulting in amorphous products or other topologies. Therefore, increasing the linker incorporation rate without changing the structure of the parent MOF represents a challenge. Herein, for the first time, an MTV-MOF of imidazole-incorporated zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-7 is constructed by 60 Co gamma ray radiation. Both experiments and theoretic calculations demonstrate that the distinct radiation-induced activation of the synthesis reaction gives rise to a much higher mixed-linker incorporation limit in ZIF-7, up to twice that synthesized by the solvothermal process, further leading to increased flexibility of aperture, higher specific surface area, and notably enhanced separation performances for Kr and Xe. These observations suggest that radiation synthesis may emerge as a general route to a series of MTV-MOFs with significantly enhanced linker mixing limit and physicochemical properties.},

  abstract     = {Single-molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well-suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based detection strategy utilising an aptamer-protein-aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double-stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge-based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub-picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer-binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real-time monitoring of ligand-induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single-molecule-based diagnostics.},

Here, a steric presubstitution strategy is devised using tert -butylphenyl-functionalized indolo[3,2- b ]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora–Friedel–Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter, therefore, achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W −1 . The efficiency roll-off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1000 cd m −2 and 5000 cd m −2 , respectively.

Although high-temperature redispersion offers a potential solution, this strategy remains restricted to reducible support materials, severely limiting the selection of catalyst supports with versatile compositions and tunable functionalities. Here, we engineer cationic vacancies at Al 2 O 3 -La 2 O 3 interface via strong oxide-support interaction (SOSI)—driven interfacial reconstruction during calcination. The vacancy-mediated confinement effect dynamically intercepts migrating Pt species, enabling the construction of Al 2 O 3 -Pt 1 -La 2 O 3 structure with precisely defined coordination environments. The resulting catalyst achieves complete CO conversion at 145 °C and maintains stability with minimal decline after a 6-h treatment at 1100 °C in air with 10% steam. This interfacial engineering strategy proves universal, as demonstrated by ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 counterparts. Our findings break the reducibility dependency in traditional single-atom catalysts (SACs) stabilization by establishing oxide–oxide interface as universal anchoring platforms, which expands the design space of industrial-grade SACs beyond conventional reducible oxides.},

Catalysts can efficiently improve the flash intensity but scarcely achieve persistent enhancement due to their catalytic limitation on CL reaction. Herein, a medium-entropy (ME) nanozyme with trinuclear configuration and a classical Prussian blue analogue (PBA) structure was designed to break the catalytic limitation. The ME PBA showed favorable enhancement on both flash and persistent CL emission of luminol-H 2 O 2 system due to the recycling generation of catalytic center Co(II) through quick electron transfer among metal sites within framework, which provided a relatively stable CL emission enhanced by over two orders of magnitude in 1 h, achieving the transformation of CL from flash to glow. The CL enhancement and active valence cycle mechanism via intrareticular electron transfer were revealed by both experiments and density functional theory calculations. A facile CL imaging method was proposed to evaluate the bacterial motility, which demonstrated the application potential of the ME PBA. This work offers a new avenue to transform CL from flash to glow by breaking the catalytic limitation of nanozymes, which will conveniently expand their application in bioanalysis.},

  abstract     = {Inverse-electron demand cycloaddition reactions of tetrazines are widely used in bioorthogonal chemistry, but the opposing effects of substituents on reactivity and stability make optimizing tetrazines for chemical biology applications challenging. Building on the discovery that bulky substituents can unexpectedly enhance both the stability of tetrazines and their reactivity toward isonitriles, we hypothesized that substituents that are both bulky and electron-withdrawing could yield tetrazines with desirable properties. We synthesized a series of tetrazines designed to explore these kinetic properties. A novel computational method quantifying intermolecular atomic contributions to dispersion forces supported the analysis substituent effects on tetrazine reactivity. Study results indicate that tetrazine reactivity is governed by an interplay of frontier-orbital levels, dispersion forces, and conformational preferences. These insights were apparent in the form of a “bromo effect,” where bromine atoms enhanced tetrazine reactivity by influencing frontier-orbital levels and increasing dispersion forces. Notably, 3,6-bis(2-bromopropan-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine exhibited a ∼80-fold increase in reactivity to isonitriles compared to dimethyltetrazine with high orthogonality to other dienophiles. The 2-bromoprop-2-yl group could also be incorporated into asymmetric tetrazines for tuning reactivity properties. In addition to introducing novel tetrazines for bioorthogonal chemistry, this work provides valuable insights into the role of dispersion forces in the transition states of cycloaddition reactions.},

Directed evolution was performed on Ao HMS to provide evolved variants that could utilize O -pivaloylhydroxylamine triflic acid as the nitrene precursor and produced various primary aminoazidation products with up to 44% yield, 44 total turnover number (TTN), and 98.5:1.5 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.). Mechanistic studies indicated that this new biocatalytic transformation proceeds through a stepwise radical addition and azide recombination pathway.

However, this strategy traditionally relies on the cyclometallation process. Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper-catalyzed asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3-b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.},

Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric-hindrance-directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6-fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow-green solid-state fluorescence and high-contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli-responsive materials for interesting applications.},

Herein, we reported the design and in-situ synthesis of A′-site cations with oxygen–phosphorus–nitrogen–carbon (O─P─N─C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P─Cl and P═O functional groups. The P─Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA + ) and phenethylammonium (PEA + ) cations, yielding large A′-site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin-coating. Concurrently, P═O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual-functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non-radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low-defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi-2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A′-site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high-performance PeLEDs.},

Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt 4 ] 4 [Fe 6 C(CO) 15 ] ( 1 ) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa-iron carbide clusters [NEt 4 ] 3 [Fe 6 C(CO) 14 (SR)] (R = CH 3 , 2 ; C 6 H 5 , 3 ; p -C 6 H 4 CH 3 , 4 ; L -cysteine, L - 5 ; D -cysteine, D - 5 ). Compounds 2–5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2–4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). The chirality of the L -5 and D -5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the ν CO region of both L -5 and D -5 . This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH 2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.},

Here, we report coronene-derived ( CoDe ) luminophores exhibiting ultra-narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM = 11.2 nm) with a 1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low-frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high-power excitation, the CoDe -PhB further exhibits organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40 min (FWHM = 14.7 nm), governed by a two-photon ionization-induced charge-separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt-casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high-color-purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low-frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi-resonance-based designs.},

  abstract     = {To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high-entropy superlattice layered oxide (K 0.7 Mn 0.4 Li 0.1 Co 0.125 Ni 0.125 Fe 0.125 Cu 0.125 O 2 , KMNCFCL 0.1 ) is proposed as a cathode for K-ion storage. High-entropy composition and [Li─O─K] configuration coupled with Cu─O covalency and local CuO 6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic–cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid-solution mechanism benefited from high-entropy stabilization, and “cocktail” effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn–Teller (J–T) lattice distortion, O─O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K + /vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL 0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8 Wh kg −1 , superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability.

  abstract     = {Aminophosphines have emerged as promising phosphorus candidates for the synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs), offering an alternative to traditional tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine. However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full-width at half-maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H with InCl 3 , leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near-unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48 nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III-V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.},

Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA 2 EA 2 Pb 3 Br 10 ( 1 , where OA is n-octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self-driven full-Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1 , simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in-plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full-Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%–5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self-driven, filterless full-Stokes polarization detection.},

In this work, incorporation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H 4 edta) into the main chain backbone of flexible, linear polymers results in substantial modulation of mechanical properties via conformational changes in the imbedded ligand within the polymer backbone induced by metal ion binding. Upon the addition of metal ions, these polymers transform from viscous liquids into solids with improved elastic characteristics. Polymer strength and toughness are significantly enhanced without the need for extensive polymer crosslinking.

Herein, we design conjugated polymer-based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu–N 4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7 Å) to optimize CO 2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0 Å-spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc-4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0 mmol h −1 g −1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at −1.3 V (versus RHE), outperforming wider-spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0 Å cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5 Å), thereby enhancing C–N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball-milling treatment increases single-atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%.

  abstract     = {Electro-Fenton treatment through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) offers an effective approach for degrading persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water; however, aeration is always required to overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water, ensuring adequate oxygen availability for the 2e − ORR to generate H 2 O 2 and facilitate its transport for activation into hydroxyl radicals. The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration-free dual-cathode system featuring a natural oxygen-harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode-generated oxygen for H 2 O 2 synthesis (957.1 mg g cat −1 ) without external aeration. By decoupling H 2 O 2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90 h continuous use. By eliminating energy-intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen-bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework, HOF-FJU-119 , constructed from an anthracene-core, that exhibits multimode guest-responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF-FJU-119a undergoes distinct gate-opening transformations in response to CO 2 at 196 K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene-loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C≡N⋯H─C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60 nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real-time visual tracking capabilities.},

Several quinary multicomponent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc) 2 ·2H 2 O with adenine and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC incorporates three distinct zinc-based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN 2 (O 2 C─) 2 ], a dinuclear [Zn 2 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 2 ], and a hexanuclear [Zn 6 N 3 ( μ -H 2 O) 3 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 6 ], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage-like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson─Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single-step ethylene purification from trinary C 2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost-effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-efficiency and low-cost multi resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters especially in the deep-blue region is critically limited due to intrinsic excimer quenching of planar π-extended frameworks. Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high-efficiency oxygen-bridged cyclized boron-based MR-TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D–A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited-state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin-flip, and thus achieving near-unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7 × 10 5 s −1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR-TADF OLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR-TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited-state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.},

A 24-crown-8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether–tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N- and C-termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide–axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.},

Lithiation-borylation has emerged as powerful methodology for the stereocontrolled construction of acyclic carbon chains but has not previously been used for the stereocontrolled synthesis of carbocycles. Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis-boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2-metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation-borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo- and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors.

  abstract     = {Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette-shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen-bonding moieties. An all-atom molecular-dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various “conformations” due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real-time high-speed atomic-force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.},

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin-polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox-active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light-induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations.

To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium-copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover-mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100 h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0 ± 119.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2 ± 1.6%) at record-low energy consumption (3.55 kWh kg ethylamine −1 ).

Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring-expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C─H sites with tunable site-selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

The In 3+ /In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO 2 two-electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl − anions restructure the In 3+ solvation, forming stable chloro-complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO 4 2− -rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO 2 crystallization and MnO 2 /Mn 2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl − /SO 4 2− ratios and an anion-decoupled dual-electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at ∼1.7 V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode-less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying-driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4 mA cm −2 (2 mAh cm −2 ), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5 Wh kg −1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm −2 .

Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C( sp 3 )─H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C( sp 3 )─H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane-associated copper-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four-helix coiled coil, and C-terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x) n HxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen-dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper-dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.},

However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl-bridged triphenylamine (TPA)-based chromophores via metal-free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.},

However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3–30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli-responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.},

Herein, we report an ultra-low Ir anode, consisting of Re-doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrO x during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high-surface-area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three-electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts. The optimized Ir anode achieved a current density of 3.0 A cm −2 at 1.69 V (0.2 mg Ir cm −2 ) and 1.73 V (0.1 mg Ir cm −2 ) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), exceeding the US DOE 2026 targets (0.5 mg PGM cm −2 at 1.8 V for 3.0 A cm −2 ).

  abstract     = {While considerable research efforts have been devoted to developing narrowband B,N-embedded multiple resonance (BN-MR) emitters, despite the formidable challenge, the design of efficient narrowband red phosphors has been overlooked. Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN-MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN-PyPt and DPABN-PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN-PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605 nm with a small full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 35 nm/0.118 eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2 µs (compared to 7.6 µs for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield ( Φ PL ) of 75% in doped films–representing a 4.4-fold enhancement over PhPyPt ( Φ PL = 17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN-MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay ( k r = 3.3 × 10 5 s −1 versus 0.1 × 10 5 s −1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN-PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.},

In this work, a dual-site Ru-RuO 2 cocatalyst anchored on Si-supported GaN nanowires (NWs) is developed for solar-powered CO 2 -to-CO conversion. The assembled Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89 mmol·cm −2 ·h −1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5 W·cm −2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28 × 10 5 h −1 . The temperature-programmed desorption, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and DFT calculations collectively reveal that the Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 enables simultaneous activation of CO 2 and H 2 . Moreover, the synergy between Ru-RuO 2 and GaN substantially reduces the reaction energy barrier from 0.83 to 0.64 eV via the key *COOH intermediate, thereby establishing a new benchmark for light-driven RWGS efficiency.

Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs ( RuSe , OsSe , RuIP , OsIP ) containing triadic electrophilic centers (─N(δ − )─X(δ + )─N(δ − )─). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7-transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the π-cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.},

However, the structure–performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination-mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional-group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn 2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H 2 O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight-chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)-facet-dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000 h and subzero-temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

However, due to the lack of two-electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of β -diketiminate-supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (L Nacnac - κ 2 N , N′ )RE(III)(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 1-RE , RE = Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; L Nacnac = {[(2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 )NCMe] 2 CH} − ) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N′ )RE(III)( η 2 - cis -PhNNPh −• ) 2 (THF) ( 2-RE ) and 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene ( I ) via a reductive elimination-powered pathway. The key intermediate (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N' )Lu(III)(PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C )(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) ( 3-Lu ), which is formed via ortho -H deprotonation in azobenzene by the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group in 1-Lu , was isolated and structurally identified. The computational studies indicate that the subsequent η 2 -coordination of a cis -azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C group, consequently enabling the C─C cross-coupling that affords product I . In this elementary process, the two N═N π *-orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e-reductions of RE centers.},

Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system-level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge-separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge-separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron-rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF 6 − ) on the electron-deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic-rich SEI containing fluorine- and phosphorus-based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li-ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li-ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast-charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra-stable cycling performance over 50 000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g −1 with negligible capacity decay.},

  abstract     = {Exploring the impact of different dimensions on the properties and functions of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) has always been a key goal, as this can provide feedback to assist in the design of advanced COFs. However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion-torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion-torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non-planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion-torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D > 3D > 2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in-plane and out-of-plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.},

Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg-C 3 N 4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (>93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen-mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes. This study provides a green and sustainable technology for both petrochemical (ethylene purification) and coal-chemical (ethylene production) industries.},

We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time-efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.},

However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self-healing cationic high-entropy gel (CHEG) G-FeCN 4−/3− -K + -Na + -Li + -Gdm + -Cs + in a multi-ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41 mV K −1 with 2.3 mV K −1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3 mW m −2 K −2 and an energy density of 4.5 J m −2 K −2 . In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13 mW m −2 K −2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B. This work demonstrates a feasible way to design high-performance ionic thermoelectric gels and provides a new application in water pollution treatments.},

Herein, we report the single-site metal-nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu 10 and Cu 11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy-filling elements. The quantum-size effects endow Cu 10 and Cu 11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non-radiative decay rate and weaker electron-phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu 11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu 11 -based film demonstrated effective X-ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster-based nanomaterials for X-ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different-attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic-level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster-based nanomaterials.},

  abstract     = {P-type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd-vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl-based polymeric backbone and π−π stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation-driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox-active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long-term cycling stability but also enables high-capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10-diaryl-5,10-dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual-mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated π-electron redox activation.},

  abstract     = {The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro-conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single-atom Pt-doped Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high-valence Cu sites (CuO-MOF-Pt 1 ), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the –CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron-withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu 3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C─C bond scission over CuO-MOF-Pt 1 , and a stable Cu 3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO-MOF-Pt 1 delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587 mA mM −1 cm −2 , a low detection limit of 0.93 µM, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO-MOF-Pt 1 -based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.},

  abstract     = {We report a series of shape-persistent molecular nanotubes with top rim connectivity traversing from an all- meta - ( m 4 ) to an all- para -phenylene ( p 4 ) bridged species, including all possible members in between them. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta -phenylenes relative to para -phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m 4 (∼31 kcal mol −1 ) to p 4 (∼90 kcal mol −1 ). Structural transitions from m 4 to p 4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394 nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546 nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time-dependent (TD)-DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S 1’ ) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para -phenylenes are introduced into m 4 en route to p 4 , while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased π-conjugation within the nanotube's top-segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.},

Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out-of-equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct.

In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor-acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid-liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi-axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non-radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink-free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.},

In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF), composed of one-dimensional Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains interconnected by 1,4-ndc linker, into catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . This top-down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4-ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra-low-dimensional (thickness ∼ 1.5–2.6 nm), defect-rich β -Ni(OH) 2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm −2 , surpassing commercial IrO 2 . In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH- and potential-dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni─O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89 Å under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni 2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high-performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.},

Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr₃(O)(OH)₃ nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O─H and C─H bonds (70–100 kcal mol⁻ 1 ). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground-state, pre-association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedented ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.},

ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (-OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H 2 O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H-bonding between the -OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN-g-CN, generating proton-rich interfaces and local H-bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH 4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN-g-CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH 4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85 µmol g −1 h −1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN-g-CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re-crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton-supply sites while maintaining superior CH 4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.},

In this context, space-confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement-enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in-situ/ operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D-3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in-situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)-guided design and structure–property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in-situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.},

However, at sub-zero temperatures, the operation of LIBs is constrained by degraded electrolyte ion transport performance and severe charge transfer polarization. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the construction of solvation structures dominated by compact ion-pair aggregates (CIPAs) through weak lithium-solvent interactions design, which significantly improved the lithium-ion transference number and reduced the de-solvation energy barrier. Excitingly, this strategy can induce the formation of a robust anion-derived solid electrolyte interface, thereby enabling the rapid transport of lithium ions across the interface even at extremely low temperatures.

  abstract     = {Carbon-heteroatom cross-coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in synthetic chemistry. However, the formation of carbon–sulfur (C─S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C─S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur-induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single-atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C─S cross-coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-atom-sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C─S coupling and demonstrate the power of single-atom catalysts in addressing long-standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long-wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of -extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri -anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all-red and near-infrared addressability. The excited-state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady-state and time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the -system and peri -connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid-based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.},

The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid-base neutralization reaction through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity.

  abstract     = {Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi-field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one-pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4-difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4-difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 /(4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light -ultrasonic activation. Under dual-field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26 mmol g −1 h −1 , outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 and (4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy-level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high-efficiency piezo-photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next-generation solar-driven catalysts.},

We develop a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) nanogenerator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1 O 2 -cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1 O 2 -generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1 O 2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single-molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.},

The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.},

However, achieving stable and reversible high-voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high-voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t 2g state of V and the e g state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na 3.5 MnV 0.5 Ti 0.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high-voltage Mn 4+/3+ and V 5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh g −1 . This strategy opens new paths for developing high-energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.},

  abstract     = {While birefringence phase-matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (Δ n < 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) region ( λ < 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a π-conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite-based NLO crystals: (C 2 N 4 OH 7 )H 2 PO 3 (GUPO) and C(NH 2 ) 3 H 2 PO 3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of π-conjugated guanidinium cations and [H 2 PO 3 ]⁻ anions enables record-breaking optical anisotropy (Δ n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full-wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 × KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 × β -BBO at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented π–π interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes π-conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.},

Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li + within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC-based weakly-solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic-dominated cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4 V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li + -PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8–4.4 V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at −20 °C, surpassing conventional EC-based electrolytes.

The low solubility of hydrogen in water severely hinders the hydrogenation, therefore requiring high temperature and pressure to increase the activity, which have safety and cost concerns. Herein, we report a hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) polymer-supported Ru nanoparticle catalyst (Ru/PDVB) with both high activity and excellent stability for the hydrogenation of pyridines in water, even at ambient hydrogen pressure (0.1 MPa). The average turnover frequency (ATOF) of the Ru/PDVB (836.8 mol mol Ru −1 h −1 ) is about 6.0 and 768.0-fold higher than those of traditional Ru/C and commercial Raney Ni catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrophobic polymer prevents filling of water in the nanopores of PDVB, allowing hydrogen enrichment to boost the hydrogenation. This work provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrially important reactions that suffer from poor gas solubility and mass transfer.},

As such, strategies to efficiently access carbon-boron bonds from simple chemical feedstocks are highly desirable. The radical borylation of alkyl bromides presents an attractive approach. However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition-metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal-free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen-atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high-temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (∼1 nm) Ir-based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub-nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub-IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm - 2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO 2 . Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub-nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.},

Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature-responsive reversible polymerization-dissociation dynamics and remarkable long-wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl-functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity-triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer‒π dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near-infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted π dimer absorption band centered at 960 nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin-μ (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh-brightness fluorescence imaging-guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.},

Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a key bacterial secondary messenger involved in growth, biofilm formation, virulence gene expression and others. The activation mechanisms of c-di-AMP receptors like the trimeric P II -like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger-bound forms of the 44 kDa homotrimeric P II -like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural-biology understanding.},

This -system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al─P coordination polymer. sc-XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state.

Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co-doped Fe 2 O 3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co-doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co-catalyst promotes the cleavage of C─C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)-NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of ∼1.9 mA cm −2 with continuously operation of 100 h. The bias-free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683 µmol cm −2 , representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high-value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization.

  abstract     = {The realization of long-lived charge-transfer-based organic room-temperature phosphorescence ( 3 CT-RTP, τ Ph = 210 ms) via the construction of U-shaped donor–acceptor (D–A) dyads is impeded by suboptimal phosphorescence efficiency ( = 6%). Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D–A dyads from U-shaped to V-shaped configurations yields 3 CT-RTP with both long τ Ph (150–220 ms) and high (13%–25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D–A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin-orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V-shaped D–A dyad can potentially reduce the non-radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons ( k nr,T ), thereby facilitating the attainment of long τ Ph and high .},

However, comparative studies of charge transport in these two junction types are limited. Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single-molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature-independent coherent tunneling to temperature-dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration-mediated transport, while vibration-suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple-reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl-phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using Cu I -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO-reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody-conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2-step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine-labeling with bicyclo-[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) or trans -cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO-rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2 + cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl-phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl-ditriazolyl-phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single-reagent peptide-cyclization-bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide-protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide-cyclization and peptide-protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.},

In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671 nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type-I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity-sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis-driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis-mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis-based cancer immunotherapy.},

Besides near-quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co-translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase-psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.},

  abstract     = {Organic-inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) with multi-color switchable luminescence have raised pervasive attention in the field of sensing, optoelectronics, anti-counterfeiting, information encryption and storage. However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA 3 SbCl 6 , PA 6 InCl 9 , PMA 4 InCl 7 , PEA 2 InCl 5 ·H 2 O and PPA 4 InCl 7 . Tunable self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678 nm originated from [SbCl n ] 3-n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb 3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb 3+ -doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red-shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non-radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi-emission centers are constructed in Sb 3+ /Bi 3+ -doped PMA 4 InCl 7 , achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi-color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi-color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi-color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns 2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low-dimensional OIMHs.},

Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self-assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left- and right-handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)-esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant – a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self-assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.},

By utilizing GPT-4o, molecular groups such as ─SiR 3 , ─PR 2 , ─SH, and ═NH that interact effectively with BP were identified and a high-throughput workflow employing graph neural networks (GNNs) models was developed to successfully predict and screen 662 promising candidates from over 117 million molecules. These candidates were validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments, with synthesis protocols guided by GPT-4o, achieving great interfacial stabilization of BP for up to 24 days under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a new synergistic molecular engineering strategy was proposed by incorporating functional head, linker, and tail groups of molecules to even enable the use of hydrophilic molecules to stabilize BP surface, overcoming traditional design limitations.

In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism-guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin-dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high-molecular-weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine-reactive warhead to a bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.},

  abstract     = {Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition-metal-based electrodes is crucial to designing high-performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co 4 N, CoO, and Co 4 N–CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH − and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co 4 N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH − species. The one-sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co 4 N and CoO. Constructing Co 4 N–CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one-sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH − and glycerol adsorptions on Co 4 N–CoO, the OH − was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high-valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co 4 N–CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co 4 N–CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178 mV dec −1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40 mmol cm −2 h −1 . Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120-h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co-adsorptions of OH − and organics on Co 4 N–CoO interfaces.},

In this work, we report on the construction of a new metal–organic cage, Zn II 4 L 4 tetrahedron 1 , using a protonated azacalix[3](2,6)pyridine-based ligand as the capping faces. The cage features a large cavity and wide gaps between its faces, enabling the simultaneous binding of anionic guests centrally and peripherally. Encapsulation of α-Mo 8 O 26 4− within the T -symmetric tetrahedron 1 leads to a C 3 -symmetric inclusion complex Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 . The apertures of Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 act as secondary binding sites for accommodating tetraarylborate guests or for providing access to the included Mo 8 O 26 4− for catalyzing reactions. Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within 1 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo 8 O 26 4− for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo 8 O 26 4− .},

  abstract     = {To achieve multi-state, visible-light-excited, long-wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high emission efficiency within a single molecular dye system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of V-shaped emitters comprising electron-deficient benzothiadiazole and electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet-triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long-wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single-molecule and aggregate states. The V-shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited-state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single-molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V-shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation-caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate-state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration-independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment. This work paves the way for designing long-wavelength TADF materials with efficient multi-state emission.},

  abstract     = {Organic molecules exhibiting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional solid-state luminescent properties. Understanding the AIE mechanism has been a focal point of both theoretical and experimental research. While conical intersection (CI) dynamics on potential energy surfaces (PESs) have emerged as a key factor in elucidating the AIE mechanism, modulating the accessibility to CI to regulate the non-radiative decay pathways remains a substantial challenge. Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE-incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo / exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE-CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo -TPE-CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo -TPE-CPPs do not, opposite to strain-free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo -TPE-CPPs and Exo -TPE-CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited-state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.},

Despite their potential, performance limitations arising from high solution viscosity at high concentrations of active material and rapid degradation due to active material crossover continue to pose challenges. Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox-active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer-independent control over self-condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well-defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox-active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox-active HBCs exhibited long-term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer-based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high-precision electrolyte design.},

Herein, we report a chromium-catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem -dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio-, enantio-, diastereo-, and Z/E -selectivity. This radical-polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z -alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E -alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium-mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway. This work establishes a versatile platform for constructing stereochemically defined homoallylic alcohols and expands the synthetic utility of allyl gem -dichlorides in asymmetric catalysis.},

Among them, Iron-Chromium RFBs (Fe-Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous-based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low-cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K 3 [Cr(CN) 6 ]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe-Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long-term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91 Wh L −1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%–77%.

The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration-damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption-controlled one-electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical-initiated polymerization process.

This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions.

Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the ─CF 2 H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li─F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated ─CF 2 CF 2 H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li + ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual-layer interface featuring a LiF-rich inner phase and a Li 2 CO 3 -dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO 2 cells (2.5 mAh cm −2 ) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140-mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles.

  abstract     = {Climate change, driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions, demands urgent action to prevent a 2050 tipping point. With CO 2 levels at 427 ppm (50% above pre-industrial levels), deploying energy-efficient carbon capture technologies is crucial. Electrochemical carbon capture processes that have been touted to have the potential to meet these needs rely on the applied cell voltage, and electron utilization (CO 2 molecules separated per electron), which has generally been asserted to have a theoretical limit of one. Here, we introduce an electron-leveraging strategy to enhance electron utilization beyond this limit to 1.43 by employing Fe-EDDHA, a redox-active coordination complex having a ligand with multiple hemi-labile coordination sites. The reversibility and robustness of the system were enabled by the efficient prevention of CO 2 reduction upon the introduction of nicotinamide as a guardian of the iron(2+) center. The proof-of-concept cyclic system exhibits a minimum operational energy of 22.6 kJ e mol −1 and an average of 63.7 kJ e mol −1 over 29 cycles, using a simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 ). Our electron-leveraging strategy holds promise for advancing energy-efficient electrochemical carbon capture technologies, and offers an alternative to prevalent redox potential shifting methods proposed to mitigate undesired electron transfer reactions in redox-active materials across diverse operational conditions.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non-antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4′s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.},

  abstract     = {Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro-)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange-correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open- and closed-shell CO 2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.},

  abstract     = {Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its abundance, cost-effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging-donor-ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA − ), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal-ion battery electrolytes.},

The conventional Haber–Bosch process relies heavily on fossil fuels, making ammonia synthesis a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we show a carbon-negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces ammonia from the air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO 2 (DAC). This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80 °C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co-produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO 2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4 mmol CO 2 /g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high-purity gaseous CO 2 . This proof-of-concept of ammonia production from air coupled with DAC paves a new way for the development of sustainable and negative-emission technologies.},

The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self-sorting of L into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right-handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.},

The construction of pseudo-dimers often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Dearomatization reactions represent an ideal method to transform planar aromatics into 3D skeletons, which has attracted increasing interest in medicinal chemistry and total synthesis. Herein, we present a dearomative dimerization of N -heteroarenes under mild photochemical conditions. Through additive regulation, the catalytic dearomative cross-coupling of two distinct quinolines could also be achieved. With aromatic compounds as coupling partners, this strategy provides a straightforward avenue to pseudo-dimers of N -heteroarenes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal the intertwined EnT/SET nature and offered guidelines for synthesizing novel bridged polycycles. In addition, this strategy provides an effective approach for constructing functional polymers with high atom economy and environmental benefits via metal-free, one-pot polymerization. Furthermore, the synthetic transformations offer a complementary route to access formal crossed products that were previously inaccessible.},

  abstract     = {The first total synthesis of the potent polycyclic xanthone antibiotics CBS72, CBS87 and CBS100 was accomplished by a modular strategy featuring a very demanding intermolecular aromatic keto-arylation. Central to the solution was a recently-developed ligand type approach, rather than brute force screening, demonstrating the usefulness of this novel concept in complex target synthesis. Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late-stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high-yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross-couplings.},

  abstract     = {Tin-based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two-dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out-of-plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi-epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced π-conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)-dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI 2 to pre-form NEA 2 SnI 4 , which subsequently converts to NEA 2 FASn 2 I 7 and ultimately FASnI 3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long-term stability. Consequently, the NEAI-based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04 cm 2 ) and 12.44% (1 cm 2 ), representing the record performance for two-step deposited tin-based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin-based perovskite films, paving the way for high-performance lead-free perovskite photovoltaics.},

Additionally, excellent stability endows HOF-TDBB with good separation ability under various harsh conditions. For example, the separation performance can be well maintained within the dozens of consecutive separation experiments. Even at 338 K, 5.7 mol kg −1 of pure C 2 F 6 can also be collected. More importantly, this material can be rapidly synthesized with a large scale by simple rotary evaporation.

  abstract     = {CO 2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C 2+ ) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single-pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO 2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong-polarized layer-covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen ( sp 3 -N)-enriched azulene-based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO 2 -diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84% C 2 Faradaic efficiency at 200 mA cm −2 , and demonstrates long-term stability over 40 h, which is the record for CO 2 RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene-polarized sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment can increase the local CO 2 /H 2 O ratio at electric double-layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop-bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong-polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C–C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion-reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO 2 RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong-polarized polymers.},

  abstract     = {Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity ( λ ) of 0.1∼0.5 W/(m·K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high-power flexible electronic devices. This study proposes a molecular level design strategy for side-chain azobenzene-containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and recyclability. By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen-bond network along the polymer chain through controlled radical polymerization, a thermal conduction network featuring “high-efficiency conduction within crystal domains and low-resistance interfacial connections” was constructed. Azobenzene moieties self-assemble into highly oriented crystalline domains through π–π stacking, where their dense packing significantly enhances phonon coupling efficiency and increases phonon mean free paths. Concurrently, the dynamic reversibility of hydrogen bonds guides domain-boundary molecular chains to form gradual phase transitions, suppressing phonon scattering at amorphous-crystalline interfaces and improving phonon transport efficiency. The film of random copolymer with 35 azobenzene units achieves an outstanding highest intrinsic λ of 2.01 W/(m·K), representing a substantial improvement over its block copolymer counterpart (with a higher crystallinity) and traditional polymers. Additionally, the photoisomerization property of azobenzene endows the material with light-controlled dynamic deformation capabilities. Meanwhile, the noncrosslinked polymer films feature easy recyclability/reprocessability.},

Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here, we present a rotaxane-based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a β-lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.},

  abstract     = {The application of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly drives the enhancement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSC). However, the transition mechanism of SAM molecules from colloidal solutions to films remains unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the SAM precursor solutions and the crystallization quality of the resulting SAM and perovskite films. Fibrous micelles of about 460 nm are found in the pristine SAMs solution, leading to nonuniform and low coverage distribution of films. Strong dipole molecules are employed to establish supramolecular interactions with SAMs, enabling the formation of highly monodisperse cubic micelles in solution (160 nm) and uniform SAM films. The contact at buried interface is determined by the balance between dipole moment and steric hindrance. Consequently, the regulated SAMs based inverted PSCs (0.09 cm 2 ) and mini-module (aperture area of 14.40 cm 2 ) achieves efficiency of 26.58% (certificated 25.81%) and 22.95%, respectively. The optimized devices retain more than 96.30% of the initial efficiency for 5,100 h under the ISOS-D-1 condition with a linear fitting extrapolation to T 90 of 11,259 h and 98.30% efficiency for 2,660 h under the ISOS-L-2 condition.

Herein, we develop an electrochemical approach for late-stage trideuteromethyl incorporation of thioether by using stoichiometric methanol- d 4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source via a sulfide alkyl displacement. This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram-scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in-situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate.

Control of the energy level of the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open-shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron-poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of –5.7 to –3.9 eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one-electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO ≤ -4.5 eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X-ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled-cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open-shell species.},

  abstract     = {Organic radicals that are both readily synthesized from commodity chemicals and stable at extreme redox potentials are rare, yet highly desirable for applications in energy storage and organic electronics. Herein, we report feedstock-derived thiophene radical anions bearing ester functionalities that undergo galvanostatic charge–discharge redox cycling at potentials below −2 V versus Fc/Fc + (Fc = ferrocene). Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low-cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced “quinoidal” thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended π-delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.},

  abstract     = {Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic ß -fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF 3 , HF as well as PF 5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer-sphere fluorination of the metal-bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF 3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.},

  abstract     = {While polymeric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) offer scalable solutions for gas separations, their performance is fundamentally limited by the permeance-selectivity tradeoff and imprecise microporosity regulation. Herein, we propose a surface fluorination strategy using carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4 ) plasma to engineer a sub-10 nm fluorinated and crosslinked layer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated Matrimid ® HFMs. Through precise modulation of plasma parameters, we achieved controlled substitution of PDMS methyl groups/methyl hydrogen atoms with fluorine species (up to 27.7 mol% F content), 5.3-fold enhanced chain rigidity via fluorine-induced interchain interactions and steric hindrance, as well as narrowed pore size distribution with preferential ultra-micropore filling. The optimized HFM-50W-65Pa-500s membrane exhibits record-breaking He/N 2 and He/CH 4 selectivities of 1202 ± 13 and 1790 ± 12 with 170 ± 2 GPU He permeance, surpassing perfluoropolymer upper bounds and outperforming previously reported polymeric HFMs. Remarkably, it demonstrates molecular discrimination precision (α(He/CO 2 ) = 56 ± 2.2, α(He/H 2 ) = 4.1 ± 0.2) for pure-gas and attractive ternary He/(CO 2 +CH 4 ) selectivity of 1005 ± 20 under 40-bar mixed-gas conditions while maintaining 720-h operational stability. This plasma-engineered fluorination paradigm combines nanoscale precision with industrial scalability, opening new avenues for advanced membrane design.},

The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H 2 O in [Na(H 2 O) 5 ] + to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram-scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g −1 , showing promising industrial potential in CO 2 RR.

  abstract     = {Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage devices due to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they suffer from some issues in Zn anodes, including dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction, and byproducts. Herein, an organic-riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode by introducing sodium anthraquinone-1-sulfonate (AQS) into the aqueous electrolyte with ethylene glycol (EG). In such an electrolyte, the zincophilic -SO 3 − groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anodes, and stable chemical bonds are achieved between them. After that, the low-polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone group in the AQS layer tends to repel H 2 O molecules. Simultaneously, more AQS and EG molecules are attracted and migrate toward AQS layer due to polar compatibility, constructing the AQS/EG-riched layer on the Zn anode by the interlocking effect among them. When Zn 2+ solvated structures migrate through the ORP layer on Zn anode surface, AQS and EG molecules enter Zn 2+ solvated structures, and thus, the solvated H 2 O molecules are removed. As a result, hydrogen evolution and side reactions were significantly suppressed, and the Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes during plating/stripping process reached 99.56%. To illustrate the feasibility of the ORP layer, Zn||V 2 O 5 full cells were assembled and exhibited superior cycling performance.},

  abstract     = {Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non-standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In 2 Bi 11 ) 2 Bi 2 ] 6− and the complex [La(C 5 Me 4 H) 3 ] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)─Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron-rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X-ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe–Salpeter-equation ( GW -BSE) calculations.},

Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the optimized emitter, BO-BTC, achieves a well-balanced trade-off among emission efficiency, color purity, singlet–triplet energy gap, and horizontal dipole orientation ratio.

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid-state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion-transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X═Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL-100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF-HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5–1 nm) of MIL-100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size-selective sieving but also enable continuous Li⁺ transport through tunable host–guest interactions between the Lewis-acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI-embedded composite (E-LiI) exhibits a high Li⁺ transference number (0.88 at 25 °C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li⁺ plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen-dependent desolvation energetics and Li + transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E-LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention ∼100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high-voltage cathodes and wide-temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi-scale ion-conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high-energy-density solid-state battery systems.},

However, the absence of molecular-level insights into ion transport behavior in sub-nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit-for-purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross-linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom-scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual-coagulation bath-induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion–pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub-nanometer channels. Based on “dehydration–diffusion” mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion–pore wall interactions facilitate low-energy-barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc–iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8 mW cm −2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 . Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub-nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next-generation ion-selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.},

Here, we report a two-step transition metal-free formal C─H/C─H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides that proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little-known α-amido sulfonium salts; the amide motif “catches” the sulfoxide partner prior to its delivery to the ortho -position of the aromatic ring by rearrangement of a sulfur ylide intermediate. The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations. This protocol has allowed the synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator without recourse to the use of transition metals.},

The cascade comprises oxidative generation of an allene radical cation from an allene, its nucleophilic trapping to the corresponding allyl radical and highly regioselective cross coupling by a concomitantly reductively generated NHC-derived ketyl type radical. Ionic fragmentation of both the NHC and nucleophile ultimately yields the desired substituted allene. The organic photocatalyst, 4CzIPN, is highly effective in promoting both oxidative and reductive electron transfer steps. Tri- and tetra-substituted allenes can be obtained in good yields through such a cascade. Mechanistic studies—including radical trapping, acylazolium reactions, and Stern–Volmer quenching—support the proposed mechanism. Moreover, follow-up chemistry is conducted to demonstrate the synthetic value of the cascade products.},

However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H 2 O 2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5 µmol g −1 h −1 , surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent-reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron-rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O 2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, its Ag single-atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H 2 O 2 into ·OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.},

Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)–silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster-assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology-dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (±)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited-state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light-emitting materials.},

Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400 mA cm −2 and >60% across 100–800 mA cm −2 .

In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO 2 , as well as balanced proton supply via self-regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO 2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH) 2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO 2 RR products.

Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO 2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high-value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial-engineered CoS/Co─N─C n─n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built-in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record-low onset potential of 1.12 V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO 2 ─to─CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO 2 RR, which outperform the previously reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO 2 RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50 h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co─N 4 electron-deficient and Co─S electron-rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi-electron CO 2 reduction via charge accumulation.

We report the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides I 3 H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C-terminal histidine-based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self-assemble into β-sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH-dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in β-sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel β-sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong π-π stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel β-sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of β-strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH-dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I 3 GH assembly maintaining this effect while I 3 GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual β-sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side-chain interactions.},

Transition metal hydroxide (TMOH), utilized in various electrocatalysis, yet is clumsy in SOR due to overstrong adsorption toward S-containing intermediates from unsuitable electronic structure. Herein we report, for the first time, that the SOR performance of TMOH can be awakened by intercalation chemistry. Take Co(OH) 2 as a proof-of-concept demonstration, MoO 4 2− intercalated Co(OH) 2 2D nanosheet array is engineered, and presents remarkably enhanced SOR behavior with an ultralow potential of 0.29 V versus RHE to attain 100 mA cm −2 , a record Tafel slope of 27.7 mV dec −1 , and stable operation for 192 h without appreciable deterioration. The experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO 4 2− -intercalated nanoarray is advantageous for active site exposure, and boosting mass transport with enhanced sulfion enrichment and superhydrophilicity. Impressively, MoO 4 2− intercalation can manipulate electronic structure of Co(OH) 2 with downshift of d-band center, thereby weakening binding strength with HS − and S 8 , and decreasing the |ΔG s* |, eventually enhancing both activity and stability. Notably, such intercalation wake-up strategy for the SOR is general and can be extended to other oxometallate intercalated TMOH systems. This contribution provides a new paradigm to evoke TMOH for SOR electrocatalysis via elegant intercalation tactic.},

  abstract     = {Precise therapy for tumors faces challenges associated with traditional methods, such as low targeting efficiency, substantial side effects, and drug resistance. As the core regulators of cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, mitochondria exhibit considerable advantages through targeted molecular tools that precisely deliver drugs, interfere with key pathways, and activate immune responses. This article reviews the latest advancements in mitochondria-targeted molecular tools for precision tumor therapy. Modifying molecular structures or designing functionalized carriers, small molecular drugs, metal complexes, nanodrugs, and polymeric drugs can be precisely enriched in mitochondria, disrupting the mitochondrial membrane, interfering with the respiratory chain, or activating immune pathways, thereby significantly enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. However, further optimization of the design of mitochondria-targeted molecular tools is required, and their synergistic potential with immunotherapy metabolic regulation, and mitochondrial DNA targeting warrants further exploration. The rational design of mitochondria-targeted molecular tools holds great promise for achieving precise, personalized, and low-toxicity tumor therapy.},

The precise mechanism responsible for this neuronal labeling has remained a longstanding enigma. We investigated four potential mechanisms underlying NeuO's fluorescence, including its interaction with neuronal proteins, transportation into neurons, export from glial cells, and structural alterations within neurons. Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.},

However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase-catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid-liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade-off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET-binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid-liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic-degrading enzymes.},

At low electric fields, p -phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules exhibit a high-conductance state, which transitions successively to two distinct low-conductance states as the external electric field strength increases. This precise control of supramolecular junctions through electric field manipulation achieved an on/off ratio G H /G L of ∼1.25×10 3 , which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the intrinsic mechanism for the observation, i.e ., electric field promoting the formation of trimer supramolecular junctions leads to the striking on/off ratio.

  abstract     = {Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4-membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro-[2 + 2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and β-lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.},

Solar-driven photocatalytic technology depending on photocatalysts with matched energy band structure for simultaneously driving both O 2 reduction and water oxidation half-reactions, without necessary use of any sacrificial agent, enables green H 2 O 2 synthesis from O 2 and/or H 2 O, offering a low-energy and simple-operation process without secondary pollution while avoiding safety and environmental risk of conventional methods. Herein, a novel acylhydrazone-linked 2D COF, COF-S-OH , was prepared from benzo[1,2- b :3,4- b ':5,6- b '']trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde and 2,3-dihydroxysuccinohydrazide. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that introduction of benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups enhances the electron donor-acceptor effect in COF-S-OH , optimizes the light-harvesting and adsorption capacities to O 2 and H 2 O, and particularly enables efficient proton transfer, thereby synergistically improving photogenerated charge carrier separation and surface reaction efficiency. Consequently, COF-S-OH achieves an exceptional H 2 O 2 production rate of 10.2 mmol g −1 h −1 with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 2.1%, superior to all the thus far reported photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 synthesis. This work underscores the critical importance of carrier separation, active site, and proton supply in photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation, providing guidance for designing and fabricating next-generation photocatalysts.},

However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in-depth understanding of structural insights into P′2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn-valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P′2–P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ∼40 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ∼93 mAh g −1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%.

  abstract     = {Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid–base neutralization (e.g., ─SO₃H and ─NH₂) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water-lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra-substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single-crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation–anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water-lean conditions is confirmed by X-ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C–F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites. The approach developed herein further pushes the boundary of POS materials to withstand both aqueous and water-lean conditions.},

Here, we report for the first time a low-cost, high-performance Ni-based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C 5+ OH) in the cross-condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three-coordinated Ni─Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross-condensation to C 5+ OH.},

  abstract     = {Photoreduction of CO 2 is often hindered by the sluggish kinetics for its activation. Refinement of host–guest interactions is an effective strategy to overcome this barrier. Here, we report the immobilization of active Co(II) sites within a covalent-organic framework (COF) with a one-dimensional (1D) chain structure, Co-PyPDA-COF, which demonstrates a remarkable CO generation rate of 30.5 mmol g −1 h −1 and a high CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2 h for CO 2 photoreduction at room temperature. The pore size of Co-PyPDA-COF is comparable to the diameter of CO 2 , which allows simultaneous interaction of a single CO 2 molecule with the two Co(II) sites. The enhanced interaction result in increased local CO 2 pressure, limited CO 2 diffusion after adsorption, shortened distance for photoelectron transfer, and reduced energy barrier for the rate-determining step in CO 2 reduction, promoting CO 2 activation and conversion. This work opens a new way to design efficient catalysts by optimizing the pore size of the host.},

  abstract     = {Whole-plant biomass from non-agricultural sources and waste biomass from processing agricultural products are both promising feedstocks for biopolymer production because they are abundant and do not compete with food production. However, their processing steps are notoriously tedious with the final materials often displaying inferior performance and limited scope in their properties. Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole-cell spirulina, a green-blue algae, into robust biohybrid algae-polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The biohybrid algae-based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all-synthetic equivalents. These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.},

The most straightforward pathway for preparing 1,4-DHPs is the direct 1,4-reduction of pyridines and quinolines. However, existing strategies are not effective for pyridines with electron-withdrawing substituents at the C2 position. To address this long-standing issue, a new strategy has been developed that utilizes underexplored carbodications as the Lewis acids to activate pyridines. For the first time, pyridines with -CN and -ester substituents at the C2 position have been successfully converted to 1,4-DHPs through direct reductive dearomatization in exclusive C4 selectivity. The potential utility of this 1,4-DHP synthetic protocol is demonstrated with C5-bromination, C5-trifluoromethylation, C5-deuteration, and C4-deuteration of pyridines using the in situ generated 1,4-DHPs as key intermediates.},

Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100 000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium-entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium-entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p-band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual-cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As-incorporated Co vacancies favor the β-to-γ phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (∼1.9 nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485 C g −1 was achieved after 150 000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state-of-the-art NiCo-based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.},

Hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI), an energy-efficient desalination method, depends on electrode materials. Removing chloride ions (Cl − ), a key salinity factor, is vital for balanced electrode capacity. Yet, efforts focus mainly on cathode materials for Na + capture, limiting the progress of electrochemical desalination. Herein, we have developed a covalent organic framework (COF)-based redox-active anode material with excellent chemical stability and unique pseudocapacitive behavior. In the HCDI cell, the rationally designed material showed a remarkable chloride ion removal capacity (Cl-RC) of 71.5 mg g −1 in 1300 ppm saline solution with a noteworthy removal capacity rate (Cl − RCR) of 1.85 mg g −1 min −1 , while maintaining 98.7% capacity retention over 30 cycles. Under optimized conditions, the COF electrode displayed a high selectivity toward Cl − over other anions present in real-seawater samples with Cl-RC of 89 mg g −1 , implying its practical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a purposefully functionalized COF serving as an anode in HCDI, highlighting the promising role of COFs in advancing capacitive deionization technologies.},

The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF.

By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration-functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theoretical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep-level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT-modified n-i-p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS-L-2 protocol.

  abstract     = {Accelerating the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics through electrocatalysis has been regarded as one of the key factors to achieve Li–S batteries of cell-level energy densities exceeding 600 Wh kg −1 . Though single-atom catalysts (SACs), typically with symmetric M-N 4 coordination structures have demonstrated attractive electrocatalytic performance in Li–S batteries, herein we discovered that an asymmetric-coordinated metal center distinctly shifts sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics—from first-order (concentration-dependent) behavior in the symmetric-coordinated SACs—to zero-order (surface-saturated) kinetics, highlighting fundamentally altered reaction pathways, leading to a concurrent polysulfide conversion. Experimental and theoretical studies on the Ni atom-based SACs showed that symmetry breaking raises the Ni d-band center, enabling a monodentate-to-bidentate Li 2 S 4 adsorption transition, which strengthens polysulfide adsorption and shifts the rate-limiting step from sluggish solid-solid transformation (Li 2 S 2 → Li 2 S) to a more favorable liquid–solid conversion (Li 2 S 4 → Li 2 S 2 ), effectively lowering the overall energy barrier of the SRR process. Consequently, Li–S cells employing Ni-NPG, a SACs with asymmetric Ni-N 3 P 1 coordination, achieved a specific capacity of 877 mAh g −1 at 4 C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm −2 , the cell retained 92% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, outperforming conventional SACs with symmetric coordination structures.},

However, the current EASH systems predominantly follow hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways, which are prone to over-hydrogenation and at the same time compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we report a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism enabled on Cu(111) surface for highly efficient and selective EASH. Well-defined two-dimensional Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) facets achieve > 98% selectivity for electrochemical semi-hydrogenation of 4-aminophenylacetylene to 4-vinylphenylamine in a membrane electrode assembly reactor. The Cu nanosheets can also efficiently remove 1%–8% alkyne impurities in alkene and exhibit broad substrate scope, stereoselectivity, as well as operational stability. In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, during the PCET-mediated EASH, the covalent adsorption of alkynes and their conversion to weakly bound planar intermediates facilitate the EASH process and suppress over-hydrogenation. Interfacial K + -structured and linearly hydrogen-bonded water species further enhance EASH selectivity via proton supply and steric modulation. Radical scavenging and kinetic isotope effect studies, along with theoretical calculations, corroborate a PCET-dominated mechanism on Cu(111) surface. This work establishes a PCET-driven paradigm for selective hydrogenation beyond the conventional HAT pathways.},

Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was revealed for the first time that the dual-phase interface exhibits competitive adsorption interactions with solvent molecules and anions within the solvation sheath. This unique interfacial interaction triggers dynamic reconstruction of the solvation structure at the interface, significantly reducing the Li + desolvation barrier by 33%. Benefiting from the integration of these multifunctional advantages, the symmetric cell delivers an ultra-long cycle lifespan of over 5000 h at 1 mA cm −2 with an exceptionally low overpotential of 13 mV. Moreover, the full cell coupled with LiFePO 4 cathodes achieves an impressive cycling stability of 2000 cycles at 5 C, with a capacity retention of 107%.

  abstract     = {A hinge-like supramolecular mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and two excimer-forming 1,6-bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophores is presented. Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue–green monomer-dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress–strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge-like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.},

  abstract     = {Artificial proton channels exhibiting high selectivity remain largely unexplored, with only two such systems recently reported. Inspired by the DNA duplex's iconic helical structure, we present here a novel strategy for designing a molecular-scale staircase configuration. The resulting molecular staircase ( MS ), predominantly linear in shape, consists of pyridine units linked by hydrazide groups, with backbone rigidity enhanced by intramolecular H-bonding. This MS incorporates up to five proton-transporting motifs, demonstrating remarkable efficacy as a proton-conducting channel within lipid bilayer membranes. Our findings indicate that the MS exhibits high proton transport activity (EC 50 of 0.31 mol%, relative to lipids) and significant selectivity for protons, with selectivity values of 160.3 for K + , 90.5 for Na + , and 3.5 for Cl ⁻ . These results underscore the potential of the MS and its variants as a highly selective and efficient proton channel, advancing the field of artificial ion transport systems.},

Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface-engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb-TiO 2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic-scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir─O support bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity-stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrO x /m-Nb-TiO 2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mg Ir cm −2 ), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72 V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm −2 , coupled with unprecedented durability with <1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Developing high specific energy seawater electrolyte-based zinc–air batteries (SZABs) is crucial for marine energy supply systems. However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl − in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon-supported Fe single-atom catalyst [Fe-SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe-SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential ( E onset ) and halfwave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 1.174 and 0.907 V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (E onset : 0.972 V, E 1/2 : 0.848 V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 800 mAh g −1 , surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl − adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.},

Through the reaction of sulfonyl azides with terminal alkynes and a wide variety of amines, we establish the robust on-resin synthesis of δ/ε-amidine amino acids, arginine isologues, fluorescently labeled peptides, drug-peptide hybrids, and PEGylated derivatives. This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform.

Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR-free SDM method that uses DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double-stranded DNA, we employed single-stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single-stranded DNA-assisted double-stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double-stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target-specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR-incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost-effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA-cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.},

  abstract     = {Zeolites stand out as promising materials for flue gas separation, however, it poses a significant challenge to conduct pore interior modifications to improve the separation performance. Herein, we present a novel strategy for constructing hydrogen-bonding traps in a small-pore RHO zeolite by embedding carbon dots (CDs), thereby to regulate pore microenvironment and enhance the separation ability of CO 2 /N 2 . The incorporation of CDs into the RHO zeolite is realized via a straightforward calcination process, which endows the zeolite with the defect sites rich in hydroxyl groups that easily form hydrogen bonds with CDs. Along with 1 H- 1 H DQ-SQ experiments, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations, the unique hydrogen-bonding traps are unraveled, which can selectively capture and concentrate CO 2 . As a result, the CDs-containing zeolite (R-500) showcases exceptional performance in terms of both CO 2 adsorption (90.40 cm 3 g −1 at 298K and 1 bar) and CO 2 /N 2 (15/85) separation (IAST selectivity of 1063.6). Strikingly, a superior CO 2 adsorption with a capacity of 42.9 cm 3 g −1 is achieved in the dynamic separation process (CO 2 /N 2 15/85). The facile synthesis and impressive separation performance of R-500 provides a promising solution for industrial scale CO 2 /N 2 separation in flue gas.},

  abstract     = {Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), a class of bioactive natural products, are highly valued in drug development for their unique pharmacological activities. Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self-sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8 mg L −1 . Additionally, we established a dual-cell factory co-expressing engineered hMAT2A-TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7 mg L −1 . Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant Escherichia coli system's scalability, producing 430 mg indolactam V, 170 mg teleocidin A1, and 300 mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.},

  abstract     = {Porosity and Al siting are key levers for optimizing zeolite catalysts, yet they are often addressed independently due to the lack of effective integrated tuning strategies. Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (Z F ) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al-rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (Z P ). Remarkably, ∼60% of the framework channels’ Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections’ Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Brønsted acid sites (BAS), Z F exhibits a 1.8-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Z P during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site-specific 31 P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h −1 , which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h −1 ). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to Z P . These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high-performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite-based catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The preparation of peptidic molecules is a mainstay of synthesis, creating new tools that advance chemical biology, catalysis, and drug discovery. Despite the wide adoption of methods for amide synthesis based on electrophilic acyl transfer reactions, significant limitations remain that restrict access to chemical space and plague accessible peptides with imperfect conservation of stereochemical information. These problems persist in key applications (i.e., solid phase peptide synthesis) where reagent excess can be used to drive maximal yield. As a general tactic, however, use of excess coupling agents that are often hazardous is unsustainable. Here we report the synthesis of the antiviral tridecapeptide feglymycin where half of the amides are formed using umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS) to replace conventional amide synthesis. Reliance on UmAS further allowed the enantioselective synthesis of each noncanonical residue from an inexpensive aldehyde. As a result, the most process-intensive components were simplified to a chiral Brønsted acid organocatalyst and potassium iodide/urea·hydrogen peroxide (KI/UHP). This solution-phase total synthesis illustrates the harmonious, strategic application of complementary amide synthesis methods, and it serves as a touchstone for the green synthesis of peptides composed of noncanonical amino amides.},

We show here that, in the construction of POM–organic cages with Keggin-type {SiW 9 Ni 4 } cluster nodes, introducing a secondary ligand may change the self-assembly processes in two distinct ways: by coordination or as supramolecular templates. The use of a tetracarboxylate panel L C , in complementary to a bent dicarboxylate linker (L A or L B ), allows the integrative self-sorting to give heteroleptic coordination cages POM 8 L A/B 4 L C 4 ( 3 or 4 ) that are otherwise not accessible through either ligand alone. The aromatic L C can also alter the outcome of the self-assembly process by acting as a non-coordinating template, transforming a coordinatively frustrated, homoleptic cage POM 8 L D 6 ( 5 ) to POM 8 L D 5 ( 6 ). These octa-Keggin cages were all shown to be efficient molecular catalysts for visible-light-driven hydrogen production; for 4 , in particular, an apparent turnover number of 4910 was achieved in 5 h under minimally optimized conditions. Mechanistic studies confirmed the existence of both reductive and oxidative quenching processes, with the former being dominant.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of high-performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light-driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light-driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible-light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light-driven nanomotors. Among them, the m -aminophenol-formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine-quinoid structure with a low HOMO–LUMO gap (1.90 eV). These nanomotors feature broad-spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H 2 O 2 concentration, enabling precise control over in-plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO 2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light-driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Defect structures within the carbon matrix play a crucial role in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe single atom and nitrogen-doped catalysts (Fe-N-C SACs). However, overlooking the O 2 pre-adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe-N-C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe-N v -C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O 2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe-N v -C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe-N-C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules results in the d-band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules on Fe single-atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.},

Here we present the synthesis, electronic structure analysis, photophysical characterization, and initial demonstration of water-soluble amphiphilic molecular wires, consisting of a rosamine, as a fluorescent PET acceptor, and a PET donor consisting of a conjugated bridge terminated by dimethylaniline (DMA). The rosamine moiety is extended by several carboxylates or polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, which render the probes highly water-soluble and facilitate labeling of phospholipid membranes, positioning molecules in proper orientation. The probes produced functional responses in electrically stimulated mouse cardiomyocytes and as well as in intact neurohypophysis, and in glucose-stimulated murine islets of Langerhans.

Here we report atomically dispersed manganese‒sulfur (Mn─S) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively drive enzymatic catalysis, in which the S atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn site to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also functions as the secondary catalytic site for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption. Consequently, this metal‒nonmetal dual-site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity. As a potential application, the Mn─S catalytic pairs with coupled catalase-, peroxidase-, and oxidase-mimicking activities are successfully demonstrated for synergistic tumor catalytic therapy.

And now, the host–guest-doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host–guest-doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the “strong assisting weak” effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79 s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5 s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long-lived RTP materials.},

This system leverages multi-metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH 3 ) from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH 3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first-principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on-demand modulation of NO- or NH 3 -mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines.

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs) are known for their enhanced safety, higher electrochemical stability, and improved energy density compared to liquid-state LOBs. However, the investigation of solid-state LOBs is limited with little understanding of their discharge and charge processes. In this work, a polymer-based solid-state LOB is used to investigate the effect of discharge rate on lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ) formation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and cycle performance. Notably, we observe a counterintuitive trend: Li 2 O 2 particle size increases with increasing discharge current density, in contrast to liquid systems. This behavior arises from inherent space charge layers that restrict Li⁺ transport under high current, and spatially heterogeneous active sites at the solid electrolyte–cathode interface, directly evidenced by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which govern nucleation accessibility and promote site-selective Li 2 O 2 growth. Furthermore, higher current densities improve ORR and OER efficiency but accelerate anode degradation, while lower currents promote side reactions. These opposing effects result in a trade-off that defines an optimal discharge rate (0.1 mA cm⁻ 2 ) for maximizing cycle life. This study provides a new mechanistic perspective on discharge-driven processes in solid-state LOBs and offers practical guidelines for performance optimization in future high-energy battery systems.},

  abstract     = {Photoferroelectrics coupling spontaneous polarization and remarkable semiconductor attributes have emerged as promising candidates for self-powered X-ray detection. However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic-based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 (4Br2FBZ = 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine-π, which achieves a stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection. Notably, the aromatic cations rotate driven by synergistic molecular interactions to form a T-shaped stacking architecture, resembling interlocking puzzle pieces. This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48 µC cm −2 and a high Curie temperature of 408 K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self-powered X-ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 ), and exceptional detection stability. Strikingly, the polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits excellent self-powered X-ray detection behavior due to its biaxial ferroelectricity, indicating the potential for next-generation flexible and thin-film integrated devices.},

  abstract     = {In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple-phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well-defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple-phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen-enriched transport channels. Under low-platinum loading conditions (−0.05 mg Pt cm −2 ) in a H 2 ─O 2 PEMFC, the COF-modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55 W cm −2 , 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high-performance low-platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.},

  abstract     = {In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual-functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni–DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn 2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn 2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni–DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g −1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g −1 , respectively after 10 000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni–DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni–DAPTO cathodes and Ni–DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g −1 . These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high-performance and long-lasting aqueous secondary batteries.},

  abstract     = {Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single-structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm-eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV-induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6 (MC)⊂CB[8], a self-assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day–night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 µg mL −1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%).

  abstract     = {Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro- and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid-state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three-armed diazo crosslinker ( 3G ) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C─H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18 mJ cm −2 , in stark contrast to 200–500 mJ cm −2 for diazirine-based crosslinkers) required for sufficient crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G , and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G -based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi-layer structures for dual-mode anti-counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system-level devices.},

A well-known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp 2 -hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone-Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene-based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional SW-based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible-light-induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW-based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8 eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene-bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon-based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next-generation optoelectronic devices.},

While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process-specific phase diagrams to model A-element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti 3 AlC 2 , V 2 AlC, and Ti 2 AlN in ZnCl 2 molten salt, we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials—defined here by the Al-to-Zn exchange—of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.},

Recently a promising family of photoswitches based on the rhodanine motif was described. Here, the photophysics of a typical example are investigated by ultrafast UV and IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, the photophysics are very different to and more complex than those of closely related monomethine photoswitches, which relax by ultrafast internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the rhodanine photoswitch, the allowed Franck–Condon excited state also relaxes on a sub-picosecond timescale, but the ground state is repopulated only after several hundred picoseconds. Instead, the Franck–Condon state relaxes through (at least) two intermediate states. These states are characterized by transient spectroscopy, and the reaction pathway is modeled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggests that a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is rapidly populated via coupling of a nearly degenerate nπ * state populated by ultrafast internal conversion from the bright ππ * state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has important implications for the synthesis, analysis, and application of rhodanine photoswitches.},

Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high-entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B-site elements (Pb 2+ , Sr 2 ⁺, Ca 2 ⁺, Cd 2 ⁺, and Mg 2 ⁺). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr 3 NCs (∼7 nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band-edge shallow states. We show that these HEA-induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.},

A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf 2 ]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL-confined COF mesopore-nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38-fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH 4 in pure water under UV-vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z-scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi-hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM] + cations, ii) promoted CO 2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO 2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM] + cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.},

  abstract     = {Chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the most attractive method for achieving the closed-loop usage of polymers, in which polymers are recycled back to their starting monomers and then used to produce new polymers without loss of the virgin material properties. However, during the CRM process, the depolymerized products are usually accompanied by the formation of byproducts (e.g., cyclic oligomers) in addition to monomers. Therefore, the directional depolymerization to monomer through catalyst design is significant. Herein, we report the directional depolymerization of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) to ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) under solution conditions through innovative design of catalyst structure. The (BisSalen)Al catalysts, featuring a confined cavity, demonstrated exceptional performance, enabling highly selective depolymerization of PCL with excellent monomer selectivity (>99%) and yield (93%). The mechanism of selective depolymerization was further investigated in detail through controlled NMR experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work reveals the correlation between catalyst structure and depolymerization selectivity, providing theoretical guidance for the design of directional depolymerization catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH * desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH * desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn 3 O 4 , in which Ru clusters are decorated on Mn 3 O 4 via Ru─O─Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn 3 O 4 facilitates the water dissociation, whereas the formed heterointerface can efficiently desorb OH * via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec −1 , surpassing recently reported Ru-based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 increase about 11- and 8-fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high-performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.},

Genetic manipulation of the lipid metabolic network or supplementation of a high-fat diet/oleic acid (OA) are the traditional routes for voluntarily triggering LD formation in cells and animals to study the role of LDs in disease biology. We developed a new screening platform for identifying small molecule-based LD inducers, which identified linoleic acid (LOA, diunsaturated fatty acid) as a better tool than OA (monounsaturated fatty acid) in promoting LD formation in cells. Subsequent screening and validation discovered a novel heterocyclic compound and respective iron complex for promoting a rapid organization of endogenous lipids into droplets by mimicking desaturase function and modulating oxidative lipid metabolism. Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H 2 S from CO 2 , another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H 2 S from CH 4 , the selective removal of H 2 S from CO 2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H 2 S, departing from conventional acid-base interaction-based liquid-phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H 2 S. Dispersion-corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H 2 S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H 2 S into [HS]⁻ species. The unique cascade H 2 S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H 2 S, endowing the [6ca]-derived ILs with unprecedented high H 2 S capacities and record-breaking H 2 S/CO 2 selectivities (67–89 at 1.0 bar and 229–319 at 0.1 bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy-efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H 2 S/CO 2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.},

Particularly, the β-turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability. Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-decorated poly(L-cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic-aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from β-sheet to β-turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual-modal approach to real-time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors. Such conformation-mediated structural and functional transformations hold significant potential for specific drug delivery and theragnosis of diseases such as cancer.},

Here, we report a facile yet effective biomineralization strategy to construct nanovaccine (OVA-ATV@MnO₂) that co-delivers ovalbumin (OVA) and atorvastatin (ATV) within MnO₂ matrix. The ATV-mediated nanovaccine reprograms endosomal trafficking by inhibiting the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thereby delaying endosomal maturation and preventing antigen diversion to degradative lysosomes. This intervention significantly enhances antigen preservation and MHC-I presentation in DCs. Simultaneously, the MnO₂ framework not only stabilizes the vaccine nanostructure but also releases Mn 2 ⁺ ions as an adjuvant to potently activate the cGAS-STING pathway, amplifying DC maturation and antitumor T-cell priming. In vivo studies demonstrate that the nanovaccine induces robust tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable prophylactic immunity. By synergistically rewiring intracellular antigen trafficking and amplifying STING-mediated immune activation, this mineralized vaccine platform provides a transformative strategy for precise cancer immunotherapy.},

More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) rather than Λ-f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that Δ-f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs.

Upon admixture with Bu 4 N – BBcat , 31 P NMR chemical shift of O═PEt 3 significantly lower-shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX-BBcat exhibited an 8.2-fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX-BArF consisting of the non-coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis-basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis-basic sites, located at remote positions to the C─H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis-basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition-metal center and the counteranion.},

  abstract     = {Protein-based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and the ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood–brain-barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled-coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of the targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7-fold increase in doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulation compared to TRAP and demonstrates a 1.3-fold improvement in uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near-infrared (NIR) dye-labelled TMPA (NIR-TMPA) is intravenously administered to mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and to control mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model reveals a significantly prolonged distribution-phase (short-phase) half-life in tumor-bearing mice compared to control, while the elimination-phase (slow-phase) half-life remains comparable between groups. This suggests altered early-phase kinetics likely due to tumor-associated sequestration or retention. The resulting increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in tumor-bearing mice supports enhanced accumulation or slower clearance. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs and 3D reconstructions of whole mouse heads further corroboratesa preferential localization of NIR-TMPA in tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of TMPA and its future derivatives for targeted GBM therapy.},

The prepared nanocomposite, termed TCN, is composed of defect-rich titanium oxide quantum dots with ultrasound-electric conversion effect and fibrous carbon substrate. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the TCN enables cell surface engineering through carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic β cells without chemical modification, while the TiO x quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound-responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from β cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subcutaneous implantation of TCN-engineered β cell complexes in type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice enables the restoration of normoglycemia by ultrasound stimulation, establishing a nanomaterials-enabled controlled cell therapy paradigm for diabetes.},

In this study, we developed a direct detection platform, a peptide–gold nanocluster-assembled binder (PEGNAB), in which antigen-binding polymeric peptides are modified on a single gold nanocluster. This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500–800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1–100 copies per well. A PEGNAB-based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost-effectiveness, and ultra-high sensitivity. In a double-blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

  abstract     = {Dizygotic-atom-site catalysts (DASCs), consisting of multi-atomic dispersed catalytic centers, perform well in several reactions but have poor electrocatalytic activity toward alcohol electro-oxidation. In this study, DASCs of atomically dispersed platinum and palladium on nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC) are successfully synthesized using an impregnation–adsorption method. The Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC catalyst has higher mass activity toward ethanol and methanol oxidation than commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. In contrast, Pt or Pd single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages are virtually inert. Ethanol and methanol on Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC are electro-oxidized to acetate ion and CO 2 as the final product, respectively. Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC exhibits long-term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate. Ab initio simulations show that Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC optimizes the ethanol oxidation pathway thanks to a lower energy barrier and onset potential than individual single Pt or Pd atom catalysts on NCNC. This study opens a new path to developing advanced DASCs for alcohol oxidation.},

While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom-substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here, we disclose a cobalt-catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac) 2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2-, 4,1-, 1,4-, and 4,3-hydroboration products in good yields and high regio- and enantioselectivities (up to >99%). Mechanistic studies, including deuterium-labeling, kinetic, and UV–vis experiments, suggest the involvement of Co–H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late-stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.},

  abstract     = {The periphery surrounding oxide-supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal-oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO 2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface-to-surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15 nm. Operando modulation–excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface-bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO 2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal-specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal-oxide interfaces.},

This article replies to their Correspondence, including: the experimental and theoretical analysis on the driving force of electron transfer and a series of new experiments conducted with purer reagents under more stringent conditions, which suggest that the process of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) followed by ConPET cannot be excluded, as proposed in our previous publication. Yet, Ceroni et al.’s efforts to study organic photochemical reactions using time-resolved spectroscopy remain worthwhile, and their proposed mechanism also led us to consider other possible pathways for the reaction.

A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO) 4 ] – anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PN H P ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(–I) centers. Then, the PhSiH 2 group at the Co(–I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + cation, regenerating the [Co(CO) 4 ] – species. [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H 2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH-assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.},

  abstract     = {Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV-transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade-off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual-sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly-shaped UV organic–inorganic hybrid crystals—(C 6 H 4 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (PCSF) and (C 10 H 6 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (QCSF)—in which planar π-conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb 3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense π–π stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record-high birefringence of Δ n = 0.87 at 546 nm, surpassing all previously reported lone-pair-containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN 2 O 2 F] coordination geometry, near-planar molecular configuration, and extended π-electron delocalization. First-principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the π-conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next-generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.},

  abstract     = {Sub-Ångstrom pore engineering offers a new paradigm for molecular separations. Here, we report sucrose-derived carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) with precisely tailored sub-Ångstrom slit pores that enable diffusion-gated kinetic sieving for the challenging separation of alkenes from alkanes. The optimized materials, C-Suc-650 and C-Suc-750, set new industry-leading standards for the kinetic separation of C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 and C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 , respectively. Through a combination of breakthrough experiments, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) modeling, we demonstrate that these sieves consistently achieve >99.9% alkene purity, with outstanding selectivity, rapid uptake kinetics, and remarkably low energy consumption. Mechanistic studies reveal that slit pore architecture uniquely enhances alkene diffusion while hindering alkane movement, establishing a clear design principle for next-generation, energy-efficient gas separations. These results provide a blueprint for exploiting diffusion-gated kinetic sieving at the sub-Ångstrom scale to address longstanding challenges in industrial gas purification.},

  abstract     = {Privileged chiral catalysts have transformed asymmetric synthesis, conferring generality to processes that are routinely leveraged in the construction of societally important functional small molecules. Operating in the ground state, these catalysts are conspicuous in their ability to simultaneously regulate reactivity and translate chiral information, often with broad substrate tolerance: this technology continues to expedite chemical space exploration. In stark contrast to the specificity of many enzymatic transformations, this promiscuity affords remarkable latitude for creative endeavour in synthesis. Given the transformative impact that stereoselective photocatalysis has had over the last decade, identifying privileged chiral catalysts that permit reactivity and enantioselectivity to be regulated in excited-state scenarios has emerged as an attractive but challenging frontier. Providing solutions to address this paradox will require the reactivity/selectivity divide to be reconciled through the validation of chiral scaffolds that effectively operate in non-ground state environments. Inspired by the venerable treatment by Yoon and Jacobsen entitled “ Privileged chiral catalysts ” ( Science 2003 , 299 , 1691–1693), this mini-review is intended to survey the conception and evolution of privileged chiral photocatalyst scaffolds, and offer a perspective on emerging contenders.},

However, the slower development of n-type materials compared to p-type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene-based donor building block, 2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)fumaronitrile ( DTFMCN ), for D–A conjugated n-type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one-step process. The DTFMCN-based D–A conjugated polymers, S-DTFMCN and B-DTFMCN , exhibit extremely low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n-type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra-low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high µ C* values of 13.49 and 13.57 F cm −1 V −1 s −1 , respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n-type OECT devices reported to date. This study highlights the effectiveness of DTFMCN in improving the operational stability of n-type OECT devices, offering promising potential for applications in bioelectronics.},

Here, a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress–strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi-component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (>10 MPa) and high strain at break (>200%). Analysis of the high-performing materials revealed structure-property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine-guided, human-augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi-objective materials optimization.},

While combinations of Ni pre-catalysts and Al additives are known for site-selective C─H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD) 2 ] and [(BDI)AlH 2 ] ( 1 ; BDI = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl-β-methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni–Al heterometallic complex [( η 4 -COD)Ni{( μ -H) 2 Al(BDI)}] ( 2 ; COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp 2 )─H activation of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H 2 evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy 3 . The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1 st order in PCy 3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9–1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C─H oxidative addition and H 2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.},

  abstract     = {Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chain-based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors , namely, the ∠(O─Nb─O′) bond angle, χ [F,Nb,Nb′,F′] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO 2 F 4 ] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating π-conjugated biuret (C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 ) molecules with optimally aligned 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chains, we synthesized (H 3 O)(Biu) 2 (NbOF 4 ) (Biu = biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record-breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH 2 PO 4 , among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (Δ n = 0.062 @1064 nm) and wide band gap ( E g = 4.50 eV) further support its potential as a high-performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next-generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.},

We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically-controlled higher-order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase-separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.},

Extending the device durability is still very challengeable for these emitters. Deuteration of emitters to slow down their degradation and lengthen device lifespan is a promising strategy. However, how to access deuterated high-order MR-TADF emitters remains to be explored. Herein, a synthetic protocol of high-order B/N products is proposed using deuterated starting materials and sequential borylation. Combining with fine-tuning electronic effect through adjusting position of tert -butyl ( t Bu) substituents, we successfully obtained deuterated triboron MR-TADF material ω’-DABNA-D that delivers precisely tuned pure-green emission with close-to-unity quantum yield and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The resulting binary OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% at maximum and 30.7% at 1000 cd m −2 . Additionally, an Ir(ppy) 3 -sensitized device shows excellent operational stability, with an extrapolated lifetime (LT 80 ) of 6078 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 .

  abstract     = {Artificial ion channels with specific organelle-targeting capabilities have been scarcely investigated. Here, we report the first-in-class mitochondria-targeting anion channels derived from a structurally simple tetrabenzylphosphonium framework, in stark contrast to its phenyl-based counterpart, which lacks anion transport activity. Structural and computational analyses underscore the critical role of the methylene (CH 2 ) linkers in the benzyl groups. These CH 2 units reduce positive charge delocalization to enhance σ-hole–anion interactions, while also enabling H-atoms from both the CH 2 linkers and aromatic rings to cooperatively form multiple C─H⋯anion H─bonds. In further conjunction with the rigid benzene rings, they help create sufficient spatial voids to accommodate anion translocation, collectively facilitating and energizing the anion transport process. Among the series studied, those bearing methyl and tert -butyl substituents exhibit the highest transport activity via a channel mechanism, with a conductance value as high as 26.5 ± 0.8 pS. Furthermore, leveraging the cationic nature of the quaternary phosphonium center, this family of anion channels readily achieves targeted mitochondrial localization, demonstrating potent anticancer activity, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.42 to 3.04 µM across three cancer cell lines.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE-5d, TPE-10d, and TPE-20d), combined with steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter-mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE-20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure–property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.},

However, most conventional systems suffered poor thermal stability of chiral configurations and low luminescent dissymmetry factors. Herein, we reported a pair of triptycene-bridged enantiomers with a point chirality and a donor–acceptor architecture. Robust point chirality, originating from quaternary bridgehead-carbons, prevented the common racemization during thermal sublimation. Thanks to the reduced electric transition dipole moment (µ e ) in donor–acceptor architecture, tuned parallel alignment between the further reduced µ e and magnetic transition dipole moment (µ m ) in the exciplex emitter, and the utilized chiral exciplex host for energy transfer to phosphor, the corresponding dissymmetry factors of emitters were sequentially amplified from 3.3 × 10 −4 to 4.5 × 10 −3 , and to 8.1 × 10 −3 . Remarkably, the CP-OLED device simultaneously achieved outstanding electroluminescence performance with a high external quantum efficiency of 31.8% and a large dissymmetry factor of 2.2 × 10 −2 .

Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H-dependent C═N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H-dependent cellular functions.

Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene-protected Cu(I)-alkynide cluster, {NaCu 35 (TC4A) 4 (Ph-C≡C) 20 } ( Cu 35 ), which exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. This metastable cluster can grow into a Cu 36 species via ion substitution or undergo thermal-induced fragmentation to form a smaller Cu 14 cluster. Under thermal etching by Ag + ion, structural reconstruction is triggered, leading to the formation of the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 and Cu 40 Ag 16 clusters. The structural reorganization significantly alters the catalytic outcomes in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Although the monometallic Cu 35 and Cu 14 favor gaseous CH 4 /C 2 H 4 production, the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 demonstrates remarkable selectivity for ethanol synthesis. Notably, Cu 14 Ag 6 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 49.27% for ethanol production, alongside a high partial current density of −67.94 mA cm −2 . This marks the highest ethanol selectivity reported to date for atomically precise cluster catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, compared to homometallic Cu⋯Cu dual sites (which typically favor C 2 H 4 ), the unique Ag⋯Cu⋯Cu trimetallic microstructure in Cu 14 Ag 6 is more thermodynamically favorable for asymmetric C─C coupling between *CHO and *OCH 2 , facilitating the formation of the key *CHO−*OCH 2 intermediate, which drives the ethanol-selective pathway.},

  abstract     = {The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer–Nørskov d-band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold-twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high j k,m value of 106.6 mA mg Ni −1 , which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold-twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW cm −2 with H 2 /O 2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent long-term cycling performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)-free HEMFCs.},

Traditional heavy-metal-based and crystalline systems are often toxic and environmentally sensitive, while strategies involving host–guest doping and encapsulation frequently suffer from phase separation and limited controllability—ultimately resulting in poor repeatability and restricted applications. Here, we developed a novel polyphenol-mediated molecular splicing and ring-locking strategy to incorporate benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BZT) into polyphenol molecules, yielding a range of eco-friendly and processable amorphous single-component systems with a lifetime of up to 124 ms. Experimental and calculational analyses confirm that phosphorescence arises from synergistic interactions between polyphenol and BZT. Furthermore, phosphorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via nanoprecipitation in tetrahydrofuran with 30% water content. These well-dispersed, metal-free NPs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, facilitating time-resolved luminescence imaging with minimal background fluorescence interference both in vitro and in vivo.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1α-target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PS B -BCB-04 stabilized HIF1α under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC ( k i =  7.9 ± 1.3 nM) and preventing VHL-mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a sevenfold difference in its EloBC-binding capacity. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1α degradation enabled isomer-specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1α and provided a new toolbox for on-demand photocontrol over the HIF-signaling pathway as well as VHL-mediated degradation.},

Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at −1.8 V versus RHE, the Zr-MOF-In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm −2 .

  abstract     = {Lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxides (LRMOs) have emerged as promising cathode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), primarily due to their exceptional capacity originating from oxygen redox chemistry. Although Li 2 MnO 3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox-active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural-engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel-layered heterostructures (designated as LMO-SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O 2− ) and molecular oxygen (O 2 ) – the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese-based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li + diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO-based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high-capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single-atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high-activity candidates. High-throughput screening of 261 transition metal single-atom-doped metal oxides (M SA -MO x ) identified nine top-performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential < 0.5 V), including Mn SA -RuO 2 and Fe SA -TiO 2 (theoretical overpotential < 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant-potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of Mn SA -RuO 2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, ML prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO 2 cathode in high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO 2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high-efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr 2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO 4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO 4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de-solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self-optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr-MnO 2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), better rate capability (115 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g −1 , when compared with pure δ-MnO 2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries and beyond.},

The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding α-chloro-β-keto esters, showing high D- syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar = 2-furyl) and simotaxel (Ar = 2-thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross-coupling chemistries performed on the p -bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti- conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an ( S )-configured C─Cl bond, in addition to the D-facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short-chain dehydrogenase enzyme.},

This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe-cMOFs) that enable efficient NO 3 RR via an unconventional [6 + 2] electron-transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2 + 6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO 3− to *NH 2 OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO 2− and guarantees selective NH 3 production. The CoFe-cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH 3 -producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h −1 cm −2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn-NO 3 − battery prototype incorporating CoFe-cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm −2 peak power density with stable NH 3 production.

These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity but also exhibit excellent physicochemical stability and contain abundant redox-active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT-COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (<0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 . This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox-active centers (C═O and C═N groups), which enable efficient Na + storage through multielectron redox mechanisms.

  abstract     = {A new empirical electrophilicity reactivity parameter, E RB , was developed based on the rotational barriers of a series of N -phenylimide molecular rotors containing various electrophilic groups. In the bond rotation transition state, these electrophilic groups form close contact with an electronegative C═O oxygen. Thus, strong electrophilic groups significantly lowered the rotational barrier. As a result, the rotational barriers were inversely correlated with the strengths of the electrophiles. The rotational barriers were measured by dynamic NMR (EXSY), enabling the quantification across a wide range of types of electrophiles. Computational analysis confirmed that the observed variations arose from intramolecular interactions in the transition state, where the C═O oxygen served as a probe of both the electrophilic group's electrostatic potential and steric accessibility. By simultaneously capturing attractive and repulsive transition state interactions, E RB provides an effective means of predicting electrophilicity and reactivity trends across a broad range of electrophiles and reaction types. The utility of E RB was initially validated using a series of rotors containing Michael addition electrophiles, followed by broader application to a diverse array of reactions involving sp 3 and sp 2 electrophiles, including S N 2, S N Ar, Pd-oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions.},

Here, we report a series of fast Ca 2+ -conducting compounds of methylamine calcium tetrahydridoborates, Ca(BH 4 ) 2 · x CH 3 NH 2 (0 < x < 4.9) and related nanocomposites stabilized by inert MgO nanoparticles. Three new crystal structures are identified: a three-dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated Ca 2+ complexes for x = 1, a molecular structure of neutral complexes for x = 4, and a structure of cationic complexes for x = 6. The thermal stability generally decreases with increasing CH 3 NH 2 content, and samples with x > 2 slowly release CH 3 NH 2 in “open” atmosphere at room temperature, but are stabilized in “closed” environments, e.g. capillaries. The ionic conductivity increases with CH 3 NH 2 content and correlates with increased void space and structural flexibility, reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 5.0·10 −5 S cm −1 at 60 °C for x = 4. Moreover, the effect of nanocomposite formation provides mechanical stability and a doubling of the ionic conductivity for Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ·4CH 3 NH 2 − MgO (50 wt%), reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 1.3·10 −4 S cm −1 at 60 °C.

Here, we develop a subtle strategy using light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis with Fe(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-Feᴵᴵ) to achieve redox-coupled conversion of NO and SO 2 mixtures. LMCT excitation in EDTA-Fe II induces directional charge separation under irradiation, routing photogenerated electrons (e⁻) to Feᴵᴵ for driving selective NO-to-N 2 conversion (selectivity: 99.89%), while photogenerated holes (h + ) oxidize SO 2 to SO 4 2 ⁻ (selectivity: 96.34%). This spatial segregation of redox pathways suppresses N 2 O generation, enabling continuous operation with 90.3% NO and nearly 100% SO 2 removal efficiency. Mechanism studies reveal the LMCT-enhanced charge transfer from carboxyl/amino groups to Fe centers, while in situ EPR confirms the •SO 3 2 ⁻ radical-mediated h + scavenging that accelerates charge separation and utilization. This work establishes Fe-LMCT catalysis as a sustainable platform for gas-phase pollutants remediation, achieving unprecedented selectivity through precise redox pathway control.},

  abstract     = {Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL-mediated signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution-processable, n-doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n-PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, an efficient, scalable and cost-effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n-PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone-mediated or copper-catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO 2 -catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 )-catalyzed polymerization of n-PBDF. Remarkably, MoO 3 at parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations achieves near-quantitative monomer conversion (>99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain-growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high-quality n-PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO 3 mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This innovation not only provides a scalable, low-cost route to high-quality n-PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.},

These fungi are distinguished by a distinctive cell wall architecture further reinforced by two virulence-associated layers, melanin and capsule, rendering them insensitive to antifungal agents targeting the cell wall, such as echinocandins. The molecular interplay between these three biomolecular layers remains poorly understood. Here, we employ solid-state NMR spectroscopy to examine intact cells of both wild-type and capsule-deficient strains of C. neoformans , along with melanized cells. High-resolution 13 C and 1 H data revealed five distinct structural forms of α-1,3-glucans that play versatile roles in forming the rigid cell wall scaffold by interacting with chitin microfibrils and chitosan, and in stabilizing the mobile matrix by associating with β-1,6-glucan and a small fraction of β-1,3-glucan. Two primary forms of α-1,3-glucans were distributed throughout the wall, capable of hosting melanin deposition in the inner domain and capsule attachment on the cell surface. These findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding the cryptococcal cell wall and its interaction with two key virulence factors on opposite sides, raising critical biochemical questions that could inform the development of more effective antifungal treatments for cryptococcosis.},

However, their costly synthesis and the vague understanding of their mechanical property hinder extensive progress. Herein, the supramolecular complexation approach is developed for the feasible construction of MGMs with hierarchical structures, while in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is applied to monitor the mechanical deformation of MGMs for microscopic understanding. Amphiphilic oligomers are assembled from the ionic attraction of 1 nm molecular clusters and further pack into ordered hexagonal phases (HEX1) driven by hydrophobic interaction. Interestingly, stretching can induce structural orientation, and thus triggering the transformation of HEX1 to another hexagonal phase (HEX2) with denser packing, accounting for the tensile yield behavior of the MGMs. The supramolecular structure endows hierarchical structure relaxation dynamics, enabling their unique viscoelasticity with a resilient rubbery plateau even at high temperatures. Their flexibility renders the capability to facilely process the MGMs into highly oriented films and coatings with anisotropic properties for potential applications in optical device fabrications.},

Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain-boundary-free nature, which facilitates intimate solid-to-solid contact and uniform lithium-ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen–chlorine dual-anion framework, formulated as Li 3 x +0.1 ZrN x Cl 4.1 , for high-voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li 2 ZrCl 6 with a triclinic structure, increased N 3− substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 ), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li + conductivity from 0.46 to 3.01 mS cm −1 , alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8 V. This dual-anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high-energy LiNi 0.83 Co 0.06 Mn 0.11 O 2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g −1 at 4.5 V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long-term cycling stability exceeding 3000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50  °C) and higher cut-off voltages (up to 4.8 V). These results highlight the promise of dual-anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next-generation SSEs beyond traditional single-anion systems.},

  abstract     = {n -type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ∼1.8 at 873 K in n -type PbSe doped with MoCl 5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl 5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4 d orbital hybridized with the Se 4 p -Pb 6 p . This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n -type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (σS 2 ) of ∼21 µW cm −1 K −2 at 873 K for PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 . When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano-heterostructures (5-30 nm) of PbSe-MoSe 2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano-heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κ lat ) of 0.20 W m −1 K −1 at ∼725 K in PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 sample.},

Although Zn (100) exhibits faster Zn electroplating/stripping kinetics than Zn (002), its high chemical reactivity results in susceptibility to water-induced side reactions. Herein, a two-pronged electrolyte engineering strategy is proposed to enhance the reversibility of Zn anodes, that is, modulating vertically oriented Zn (100) plating while simultaneously constructing a water-poor electrical double layer (EDL). Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB − ) anions of sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) function as a Zn 2+ trapping agent at the inner Helmholtz layer, displacing active water molecules and inducing the preferential deposition of Zn on the Zn (100) crystal facets, thus effectively inhibiting both side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, a symmetrical cell with the ZnSO 4 /NaDFOB electrolyte exhibited a long lifetime of over 950 h under severe conditions of 10 mA cm −2 and 5 mAh cm −2 . Furthermore, a practical Zn||NH 4 V 4 O 10 pouch cell could achieves a high capacity of 156 mAh at industrial-level mass loading of 16.6 mg cm −2 .

The composite showcases outstanding CO 2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FE formate ) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of −0.5 V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long-term stability over 150 h. Depending on the designed CH 3 OH electrooxidation catalyst (CuO x /ZnCo(OH) x ) at the anode to couple with CO 2 conversion, symmetrical/asymmetrical electrolyzers were developed. The approach could obtain high-added value products with FE formate >90% at both electrodes, achieving a production rate of 4980 µmol h −1 cm −2 under industrial current density.

  abstract     = {Integrating different polymer types into a unified system in a thoughtful manner leverages their complementary advantages, providing a promising strategy for developing high-performance materials. Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs), characterized by their unique spatial entanglement, exhibit distinctive performance advantages, yet their potential to expand material properties through rational integration with other polymer architectures presents substantial opportunities for continued investigation. Herein, we report a coherent integration of covalent polymers (CPs) and mechanically interlocked polymers through sequential orthogonal polymerizations, developing a novel synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP) featuring both structural stability and force-induced dynamics. Compared to its structurally similar but noninterlocked control sample, CMIP demonstrates markedly enhanced thermomechanical stability and performance recovery, achieving a 93.4% recovery efficiency at 100% strain after just 5 min of rest, in contrast to 59.7% for the control. This remarkable stability and recovery result from the synergistic interplay between the covalent polymer framework and the interlocked structure, which work in tandem to preserve network integrity and enable rapid host−guest reformation. Notably, despite this significant improvement, CMIP retains a comparable damping capacity (91% versus 87%) and material toughness (14.8 versus 15.1 MJ m −3 ), owing to the efficient energy dissipation mechanisms enabled by host−guest dissociation and subsequent sliding motion. This strategy imparts CMIP with unique characteristics, offering a prospective pathway for the development of a diverse array of advanced synergistic materials with enhanced, multifaceted properties.},

  abstract     = {Sequence-controlled semiconducting polymers represent a new frontier in organic electronics, where precise molecular sequence directly dictates device performance. However, achieving both high sequence fidelity and structural diversity remains a significant challenge using conventional synthetic protocols. To address this issue, we introduce a versatile halide-pair-driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy that enables the library synthesis of sequence-controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs). By optimizing halide pairing in conjunction with a rationally designed Buchwald ligand–Pd system featuring catalyst-transfer capability, we achieved efficient sequential cascade aminations, thereby enabling the MCP. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated through the synthesis of a library of sequence-controlled PTAAs, including dendronized variants, underscoring its potential as a general platform for functional semiconducting material discovery.},

Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that the bright yellow-colored diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature-dependent time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time-dependent) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed, involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second-order Jahn–Teller distorted structures.

Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin-oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C─H···π interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non-chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor ( g lum ) of 1.5 × 10 −2 . Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin-oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect.

As a prominent class of reactions, transition-metal-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C─H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92%, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (>99%). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor, which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule-substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in-solution and on-surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues, thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni–O 2 –Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof-of-concept strategy with S, Co co-doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron-withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co–O 2 –Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000-h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm −3 H 2 @ 4000 A m −2 .

Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self-supporting carbon cloth with N-doped carbon arrays (PdCo-NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3 d -4 d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz 2 -5 σ and dyz -2 π* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self-supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO 2 methanation while serving as a photo-to-heat converter to improve the temperature of the reaction system. As a result, PdCo-NC/CC exhibits unprecedented photothermal performance toward CO 2 methanation, delivering a CH 4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol g metal −1 h −1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source.

Although post-treatment of InP cores with zinc compounds is a common approach to alleviate interface strain, conventional synthesis methods often fail to achieve effective doping, typically leaving zinc on the core surface rather than within the lattice. Herein, we present a dual-mode strain relief strategy using the small-molecule precursor Zn(Ac) 2 . Its ionic bonding character and low steric hindrance enable efficient Zn doping into the InP core and promote uniform epitaxial shell growth, leading to a 50% reduction in interfacial strain and a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield in InP QDs. This approach simultaneously addresses two major sources of strain: lattice mismatch between the core and shell and steric hindrance from bulky surface ligands. The fabricated green InP-based QLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 26.3% and a current efficiency of 108.3 cd A −1 .

Carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) have emerged as promising candidates; however, achieving precise sub-Angstrom micropore control and ensuring structural stability remain significant challenges. Here, we introduce a dual cross-linked strategy to engineer microporosity of the resulting CMSMs by utilizing a decarbonylated 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA)-induced rigid network ( Type A ) in conjunction with a sulfur bond-induced flexible network ( Type B ). The 6F-D-S-CMS membrane exhibits a record-high H 2 permeability of 3464 Barrer with H 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 3807, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. Upon pyrolysis at 850 °C, the 6F-D-S-CMS-850 membrane achieves exceptional selectivity values: H 2 /CH 4 at 6538, H 2 /N 2 at 1634, and H 2 /CO 2 at 149—outperforming most reported CMS membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Type B network suppressed CH 4 adsorption (3.6 cm 3 g −1 versus 6.2 cm 3 g −1 ) and significantly enhanced the small pore volume ratio ( V H2 / V CH4 : 10.3 versus 2.1) during carbonization, thereby eliminating non-selective pathways and reducing inter-skeletal spacing (4.09 Å versus 3.78 Å), which enables precise molecular sieving. This rigid-flexible cross-linked strategy for CMSMs establishes a scalable blueprint for next-generation hydrogen production.},

  abstract     = {Efficient charge separation and carrier transfer are critical determinants of the performance of photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reactions (NRR) which are critical for agricultural and chemical industries. In this study, a novel type of heterostructure, termed an “In-Lattice heterojunction”, has been constructed by introducing a Fe─N 4 -anchored carbon layer (Fe─N─C) onto the surface of defective TiO 2 (D-TiO 2 ), as well as implanting it into the cavities of D-TiO 2 . The in-lattice heterojunction, defined as FNCTO, achieves efficient radial carrier transfer along the Ti─C─N─Fe in-lattice atomic channel and greatly promoted N 2 adsorption benefiting photocatalytic NRR. Thus, FNCTO exhibits an excellent photocatalytic N 2 reduct`ion into NH 3 activity (88 µmol g −1 h −1 ), obviously higher than that of Fe─N─C sites on noncavity P25, illustrating the crucial role of cavity patch induced in-lattice heterojunction. This study paves a way for the development of high-performance Fe─N─C atomic photocatalysts based on noncarbon materials.},

  abstract     = {The performance of flexible all-polymer organic photovoltaics (OPVs) constrained by low short-circuit current density ( J SC ) and fill factor (FF), resulting in diminished power conversion efficiency (PCE) and compromised mechanical stability. Enhancing the exciton diffusion length ( L D ) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [Δ G (r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium-MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended L D and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ-based all-polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in J SC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record-breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco-friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8-BO) with small-area devices (0.0621 cm 2 ), whereas large-area modules (23.60 cm 2 ) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.},

In a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with pure acetylene, this polymeric catalyst achieved high ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 93.1% at −0.5 A cm −2 and 83.3% at −1.0 A cm −2 , with stable operation for 100 h at −0.5 A cm −2 .

  abstract     = {In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter- and intra-ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light-driven charge separation in the well-studied “molecular lightswitch” [Ru(bpy) 2 dppz] 2+ (aqueous [Ruthenium II (2,2′-bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine)] 2+ [Cl − ] 2 ) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real-time using ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. Sub-70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra-ligand electron transfer following Ru-to-dppz metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time-resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter-ligand electron “hopping” between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru-to-bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well-studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light-driven electron transfer chemistry.},

We propose the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed-width cavities and UV–vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C═C bond. In all cases, no substantial changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.},

Although “dual-locked” probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan-cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy-H-NTR , a cascaded-activation, doubly quenched NIR-II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity—universal tumor hallmarks—it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan-cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem-locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan-tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR-II emission and “activation–retention” mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9-fold higher tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan-cancer models, it enabled high-contrast imaging (T/N ∼7.8) and precise resection with sub-2 mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem-locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR-II imaging capabilities, and activation-retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan-cancer identification and surgical navigation.},

However, the efficient adsorption and speedy reaction of reactants following the specific mechanism in a favorable way is still a challenge for enhancing catalysis. Herein, we propose the strategy aimed at adjusting electronic properties of Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs through constructing oxygen vacancies on Ce/WO x , thereby fostering SCR activity. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs not only provide more Ce 3+ sites for promoting the reactivity of adsorbed NO, but also accelerate the reaction between NH 3 and gaseous NO owing to the generation of W 5+ species with superior surface acidity, which enhance Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanisms, respectively. Consequently, the designed catalysts achieve over 90% NO x conversion above 250 °C and exhibit higher activity than normal Ce/WO 3 and V/W-TiO 2 commercial catalysts, with anti-poisoning of SO 2 and H 2 O under harsh working conditions, expecting to provide the guidance for promoting de-NO x industrial application.},

  abstract     = {Layered transition-metal oxides have attracted growing attention for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, their application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to Na-deficiency and solid-electrolyte interphase formation. Herein, a universal chemical presodiation pathway is reported with Na-bipyridine dissolved in diethyl ether (Na-Bpy/DEE) for stable Na-deficient P2-Na 2/3 Ni 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 (NNMO) electrode under air condition. The strongly electron-withdrawing N-functional groups of Bpy •− radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na + from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF-rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g −1 , and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high-capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles.

  abstract     = {The low-coordination polyhedral architecture of Cu(I)-based chiral metal halides induces significant structural distortions, endowing these materials with remarkable circularly polarized light (CPL) activity and exceptional nonlinear optical (NLO) performance. However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors ( g lum ) in Cu(I)-based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared 1D chiral ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 (where MPZ is 2-methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular–tetrahedral configuration in the noncentrosymmetric cubic P 1 2 11 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH 2 PO 4 . Additionally, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and g THG-CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG-based CPL detection in Cu(I)-based metal halides. The self-powered CPL photodetectors based on ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0 V and further achieve self-powered X-ray detection with excellent low-dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure–performance relationship in chiral organic–inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) provides a promising strategy for producing high-value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high-performance photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen-coordinated metal-organic cages (MOCs) (Ni 8 L 12 X 4 , X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate-limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO 2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni 8 L 12 I 4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 µ mol g −1 h −1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl- and Br-coordinated Ni MOC by 200- and 5-fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction.},

Herein, we develop boron-doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate-to-NH 2 OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B-induced p-sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential-determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH₂OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at −0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.},

We contribute here to this field with the development of a unique class of supramolecular polymers that are able to selectively encapsulate guest molecules within their lumen. This is achieved through a rational design of the monomer units, which self-assemble in amphiphilic cyclic entities that then stack into lipophilic tubular architectures that contain a polar pore. These tailored assemblies are able to host hydrophilic dye molecules that are complementary in size and chemical affinity for the pore coating. Dye extraction is characterized by: (1) the emergence of the dye absorption and emission features in solution, (2) a red shift of the absorption and emission maxima, caused by a confined environment of high viscosity, and (3) an energy transfer process from the monomer at the tube's walls to the included dye guest, which was characterized by photoluminescence (PL), excitation, and transient absorption measurements. When different dyes are co-encapsulated, the tubular supramolecular polymer provides a unidimensional confined chiral environment to promote sequential energy transfer processes between them.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemistry offers a promising route toward facilitating organic transformation reactions in a sustainable manner. However, there are often a multitude of factors at play; hence, it can be unclear how operating conditions can be rationally tuned to optimize selectivity. Here, we demonstrate how the identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can control the selectivity of electrochemical C─H chlorination. Specifically, we obtained a 90.3% Faradaic efficiency with KCl as compared to 78.4% with LiCl for the conversion of cyclohexane to chlorocyclohexane at 1000 mA using an IrO x electrode. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments indicate a greater propensity for Cl − oxidation to generate Cl radicals in the order: K + > Na + > Li + . This leads to an increase in the selectivity toward the chlorination of cyclohexane and a concomitant decrease in competitive Cl 2 formation. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments indicate that this is likely due to a decrease in *Cl binding energy on IrO x in the presence of K + . These findings highlight the important role of alkali metal cations, which can be a key consideration for designing electrochemical organic synthesis systems.},

Although homocysteine (Hcy) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring amino acid, it was excluded from the universal genetic code. Hcy is very interesting, yet mostly unexplored, for probing protein active sites because of its subtle structural and electronic differences from cysteine and serine, which are widespread catalytic residues in enzymes. We report the genetic encoding of a new protected Hcy precursor, HcyX, that can be conveniently deprotected by chemical reductants or bioorthogonal reagents. We find varying and sometimes remarkable levels of activity for different purified enzymes with Hcy at catalytic positions. By exploiting partial intracellular deprotection to Hcy, we show that two proteins rendered Hcy-dependent, an intein and thymidylate synthase, can rescue growth of Escherichia coli by catalyzing a reaction essential for cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples in which cell growth is linked to a genetically incorporated ncAA directly involved in catalysis. We further demonstrate that Hcy-based disulfide bonds are chemically more stable than cysteine disulfides. Together, these findings open new paths for the experimental evolution of the genetic code.},

However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme-assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme-metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions. The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co-encapsulation and dual-optimization of both components. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2-fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA), and a 2.7-fold enhancement in racemization conversion, compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers 91% yield, >98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines.

By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73 µmol g cat. −1 h −1 . Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and activation, generating *N 2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO 2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N 2 to form a “tower-like” urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual-active-site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high-value products.},

In this study, we used a solvothermal method to synthesize a sub-1 nm copper oxide-phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CuO-PMA) for ultrasound (US)-controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to induce pyroptosis. Owing to the narrow bandgap of CuO-PMA, the electron holes are rapidly separated under US irradiation, then quickly migrate through the sub-nanosheet structure to the surface to catalyze the formation of singlet oxygen (¹O₂) and superoxide anions (•O₂⁻), while simultaneously consuming glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, leveraging electron delocalization properties, US triggered the directional migration of electrons in CuO-PMA, facilitating the Cu(II)-to-Cu(I) transition to enhance hydroxyl radical (•OH) production. The ROS burst together with ions and h + -mediated GSH exhaustion synergistically provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating the caspase-1/GSDMD axis to induce pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CuO-PMA significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed excellent antitumor immunotherapeutic effects. This sub-nanosheet amplifies ROS generation in response to the electronic delocalization characteristics of the US, which provides a new strategy for the ultrasound-controlled pyroptosis activation (sonopyroptosis) and tumor immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has been recognized as a powerful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small-molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein-targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR-ABL, BRD4, EGFR L858R , and EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S . Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the “pan-kinase” inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK-3β, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide-containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {The separation of ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) from mixtures with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) is of great industrial importance but remains a critical challenge. Here, we report that a rationally designed flexible metal–organic framework (FMOF), featuring a specifically engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality, can promote the efficient one-step separation of C 2 H 4 from a ternary mixture. Adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough tests provide experimental evidence confirming the selective adsorption of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 over C 2 H 4 on such a FMOF, as well as its ability to separate C 2 H 4 from a CO 2 /C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 ternary mixture. Theoretical calculations and simulations provide critical insights into the flexible adsorption process and the separation mechanism of the FMOF. The bifunctionality incorporated in FMOF provides exceptionally strong binding of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 but inhibition of C 2 H 4 , which, in turn, enables high adsorption selectivity for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 . This FMOF has high potential for industrial applications in the separation of C 2 H 4 from gas mixtures.},

The gels were synthesized via an acid-catalyzed step-growth reaction of a difunctional PEG-thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross-linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross−links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water-swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV ( λ = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm −1 ), and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating were investigated by dynamic shear rheology.

However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the π + core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion-π + type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion-π + type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF-Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE-PEG 2000 to obtain NPs (named DF-TB X or DF-FTB X , X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF-Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X = 8 in DF-TB 8 and DF-FTB 8 , resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF-FTB 8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion-π + type photosensitizers.},

Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between nonzero and zero values in both second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ (2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second-harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 (BTA = 3-bromo-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432 F 2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362 K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between nonzero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both χ (2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG-CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432 F 2 phase transition enables ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG-CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG-CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG-CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase.

Those transformations relied on the multi-task ability of poly(ionic liquids) (PILs), which provides efficient electro-steric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates, and organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter-anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I − , triggers the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation-hydrogenation process. Conversely, in the presence of non-nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically a spectator, yielding to the “direct hydrogenation” of EC by the RuNPs.},

Here, based on the donor-acceptor molecular backbone, an oligoether chain is introduced with different chain lengths to endow two novel SAMs, namely, EPA and MEPA, with good capability of bottom-up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiO x with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain-containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization, and importantly well-matched energy level alignment at the top surface, especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiO x /MEPA-based PSCs along with good device stability, which can maintain 90% of the initial efficiency under ISOS-L-1 conditions over 1260 h.},

  abstract     = {Integrating solar-driven CO 2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic-ferroelectric heterojunction (WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 ), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO 3-x and ferroelectric polarization in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 , thereby not only promoting energetic hot-carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot-electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K 4 Nb 6 O 17 surface for CO 2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO 3-x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76 µmol g −1 h −1 ), which is 9.87 and 6.27-folds higher than that of K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C─C coupling for directed production of more value-added hydrobenzoin (313.15 µmol g −1 h −1 ). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar-to-fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.},

However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9′,10,10′-tetraphenyl-2,2′-bianthracene ( TPBA ) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn - and anti -TPBA . To address the “Janus-type” photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation-wavelength-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn - and anti -TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge-transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment-dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in-depth study of the Janus-like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.},

  abstract     = {Cyclodextrin-based slide-ring gels (SRGs) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross-links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light-responsive SRGs based on azobenzene-containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) macrocycles. By using UV–Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that α-CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E to Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.},

  abstract     = {Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well-characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP-InsPs, such as 5-PP-InsP 5 (5-InsP 7 ) and 1,5-(PP) 2 -InsP 4 (1,5-InsP 8 ), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5-PP-InsP 4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31 P-NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18 O-labeled PP-InsP 4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), enabling the assignment of PP-InsP 4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation-induced root-specific PP-InsP 4 isomer does not match any 5-PP-InsP 4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6-OH]-InsP 5 and [3-OH]-InsP 5 at the 5-position, while other InsP 5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP-InsP 4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP-InsP 4 , providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.},

  abstract     = {Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi-domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication-mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co-occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis -COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis -COM domain within an E-COM-C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity-dependent photo-crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis - and trans -COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.},

Therefore, designing high-molecular-weight acceptors with well-defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene-tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g mol −1 and a well-defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8-IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8-BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state-of-the-art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature ( T g ), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high-performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Most record-efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin-coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent-bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent-antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in-situ crystallization monitoring via time-resolved UV–Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%–50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256 h storage in N 2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra-wide processing window (10 s–10 min bathing duration, >2 min post-bathing delay tolerance).},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage. However, their application is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low-temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with the desolvation kinetics of Zn 2+ . We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3-butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable glass-forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen-bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid–liquid transition temperature from −16.4 to −101 °C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn 2 ⁺ to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by-reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long-term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at −40 °C under 0.1 mA cm −2 /0.1 mAh cm −2 , and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (−40 °C to 60 °C). This work offers a guideline to design stable and low-temperature AZIBs, expanding the application scope for aqueous electrolytes.},

However, their selective synthesis remains a considerable challenge in catalysis. Regioselective hydration of non-activated C─C double bonds is typically hindered by poor selectivity and low atom efficiency in conventional methods. In this study, we harness the underexplored potential of the acyclic carotenoid 1,2-hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus IL144, employing it as a whole-cell biocatalyst for cofactor-independent terminal hydration of a diverse range of terpenes. This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C 12 ─C 20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high-yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations. These findings highlight the biocatalytic potential of acyclic carotenoid hydratase, offering a green and efficient route to the production of valuable tertiary alcohols.},

  abstract     = {The direct conversion of methane-to-methanol remains a critical challenge in methane valorization. In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO 2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd 0.3 Au 0.7 /CeO 2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (∼80%) at 500 K with a 1:1 methane-to-water ratio. While Pd/CeO 2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over-reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO 2 composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine-tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO 2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.},

  abstract     = {High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug-protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging-based HCS and bio-orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof-of-concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide-alkyne (TL-alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe-labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio-orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.},

Transient infrared absorption (TRIR) indicates diffusion-controlled release of urea, and kinetics studies after photolysis demonstrate the functionality of the new caged molecule for photocontrolled delivery of urea to urease.

  abstract     = {Carbazole-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been commonly used as a single-component hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but suffer from facile π-π stacking and self-aggregations in solution and consequently poor anchoring ability with the atop perovskite layer. Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn-SAM) strategy through blending a non-planar molecule 3,3-(4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)-dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me-4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi-device compatibility. The single-junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn-SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm 2 ) for 1.56  and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively. Moreover, this approach is beneficial for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured surfaces of heterojunction (HJT) silicon bottom cells, affording PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm 2 ) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm 2 ). All devices exhibit excellent long-term storage and thermal stability even under non-encapsulated conditions.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential genes for mitochondrial and cellular functions and acts as a cell signaling molecule in innate immune and inflammatory responses. Defects in mtDNA are implicated in a range of mitochondrial disorders and human diseases. Currently, no chemical strategy exists to prevent mtDNA loss under genotoxic stress. To address this, we developed a mitochondria-targeting probe (mTAP) that selectively reacts with key mtDNA repair intermediates–abasic (AP) sites. We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA-binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA-binding activity of a mtDNA-packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.},

Here, we leverage the “structural tolerance” of recently-developed polymeric metal halides to integrate two distinct coordination units of a single metal into a material, thereby achieving highly tunable optical properties in single-phase metal halides. By manipulating the steric hindrance of polycations, facilely adjustable green, red or bicolor emission can be realized in manganese bromides, which originates from controllable transformation from manganese-bromine tetrahedra into octahedra. This design principle is further extended to polymeric copper halides, wherein broad self-trapped exciton emissions derived from distinct copper-iodine polyhedrons allow the emission colors to be linearly tunable from blue to yellow, encompassing pure white light, by tailoring the composition, excitation wavelength, or temperature. This study opens avenues for facile and precise modulation of the optical properties of metal halides by exploiting the intrinsic coordinative diversity of metal elements.},

  abstract     = {The stress-responsive up-regulation process is a sophisticated biological response to maintain cellular homeostasis. In intracellular anti-oxidant systems, the expression level of oxidoreductases is up-regulated under oxidative stress, mitigating oxidative damage on biomolecules and enhancing protein folding capacity. Herein, inspired by the biological system, we developed a synthetic folding promotor whose reactivity is up-regulated under stress conditions. We conjugated two metal-binding 1,4,7,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligands and a redox-active disulfide to obtain cyclam-SS, whose reactivity can be enhanced under metal-induced stress. Metal coordination increased the redox potential of cyclam-SS, activating it as an oxidant. While Cu II ions severely hampered the oxidative folding of substrate polypeptides, cyclam-SS exhibited bifunctional folding-promoting properties, i) suppressing Cu II -mediated misfolding and aggregation, and ii) harnessing Cu II to enhance oxidative folding. Cyclam-SS was also useful for disulfide-bond formation to promote oxidative folding of pharmaceutical and pathological proteins, as demonstrated with proinsulin and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, cyclam-SS protected cultured cells from copper-induced stress. Thus, we demonstrated the induction of the stress-responsive up-regulation process by a bifunctional folding promotor controlling the folding status of biologically important proteins under metal-induced stress. The strategy of “stress-responsive up-regulation” could aid the development of novel synthetic materials for treating intracellular stress and related disorders.},

Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current collector as in lithium-ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando charge and mass transport. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on simplified models. Herein, we build digital-twin electrodes with digital-space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital model-driven simulation, we find an “lithium trapping” effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next-generation energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Upholding data privacy, especially in medical research, has become tantamount to facing difficulties in accessing individual-level patient data. Estimating mixed effects binary logistic regression models involving data from multiple data providers, like hospitals, thus becomes more challenging. Federated learning has emerged as an option to preserve the privacy of individual observations while still estimating a global model that can be interpreted on the individual level, but it usually involves iterative communication between the data providers and the data analyst. In this paper, we present a strategy to estimate a mixed effects binary logistic regression model that requires data providers to share summary statistics only once. It involves generating pseudo-data whose summary statistics match those of the actual data and using these in the model estimation process instead of the actual unavailable data. Our strategy is able to include multiple predictors, which can be a combination of continuous and categorical variables. Through simulation, we show that our approach estimates the true model at least as good as the one that requires the pooled individual observations. An illustrative example using real data is provided. Unlike typical federated learning algorithms, our approach eliminates infrastructure requirements and security issues while being communication efficient and while accounting for heterogeneity.},

In this paper, we introduce a new model that incorporates subject-specific and serially correlated time-specific distribution-free random effects on the unit interval into logistic regression multiplicatively with fixed effects. This new multiplicative model facilitates the interpretation of random effects on the unit interval as risk modifiers. This multiplicative model setup also eases the model derivation and random effects prediction. A quasi-likelihood approach has been developed in the estimation of our model.

However, smaller studies, such as platform trials, require high flexibility and easy interpretability to take study objectives into account and facilitate the communication. Another challenge in platform trials is that due to the shared control arm some of the -values are dependent and significance levels need to be prespecified before the decisions for all the past treatments are available. We propose adaptive-discarding-Graphs (ADDIS-Graphs) with FWER control that due to their graphical structure perfectly adapt to such settings and provably uniformly improve the state-of-the-art method.

AFT models are collapsible and, unlike hazard ratios in proportional hazards models, the acceleration factor—a key effect measure in AFT models—is collapsible, meaning its value remains unchanged when adjusting for additional covariates. In addition, AFT models provide an intuitive interpretation directly on the survival time scale. From the recent development of smooth parametric AFT models, we identify potential issues with their applications and note several desired extensions that have not yet been implemented. To enrich this tool and its application in clinical research, we improve the AFT models within a flexible parametric framework in several ways: we adopt monotone natural splines to constrain the log cumulative hazard to be a monotonic function across its support; allow for time-varying acceleration factors, possibly include cure and accommodating more than one time-varying effect; and implement both mixture and nonmixture cure models. We implement all of these extensions in the rstpm2 package, which is publicly available on CRAN. Simulations highlight a varying success in estimating cure fractions. However, in terms of covariate-effect estimation, flexible AFT models appear to be more robust than the Cox model even when there is a high proportion of cured individuals in the data, regardless of whether cure is reached within the observed data.

  abstract     = {Phase I dose escalation trials in oncology generally aim to find the maximum tolerated dose. However, with the advent of molecular-targeted therapies and antibody drug conjugates, dose-limiting toxicities are less frequently observed, giving rise to the concept of optimal biological dose (OBD), which considers both efficacy and toxicity. The estimand framework presented in the addendum of the ICH E9(R1) guidelines strengthens the dialogue between different stakeholders by bringing in greater clarity in the clinical trial objectives and by providing alignment between the targeted estimand under consideration and the statistical analysis methods. However, there is a lack of clarity in implementing this framework in early-phase dose optimization studies. This paper aims to discuss the estimand framework for dose optimization trials in oncology, considering efficacy and toxicity through utility functions. Such trials should include pharmacokinetics data, toxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods used to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on optimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level summary measure should reflect only the properties used for estimating this utility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events has been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations regarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless phase I/II dose optimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject receives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional clarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding of the drug under consideration, which would enable the correct dose to move to phase II of clinical development.},

(2) Empirical evidence shows that problematic situations, which could occur in theory due to strong heterogeneity, are usually avoided in typical randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract     = {Partially linear models are commonly used in observational studies of the causal effect of treatment and/or exposure when there are observed confounding variables. The models are robust and asymptotically distribution-free for testing the causal null hypothesis. In this research, we investigate methods for estimating the partially linear models with data missing at random in all the variables, including the response, the treatment, and the confounding variables. We develop a general estimation method for inference in partially linear models with nonmonotone missing at random data. It proposes using partially linear working models to improve the estimation efficiency of the standard complete case method. It can be shown that the new estimator is consistent, which does not depend on the correctness of the working models. In addition, we recommend bootstrap estimates for the asymptotic variances and semiparametric models for the missing data probabilities. It is computationally simple and can be directly implemented in standard software. Simulation studies are provided to examine its performance. A real data example with sparsely observed missingness patterns is used to illustrate the method.},

Recent works have shown that taking advantage of relatedness between these subtasks can be beneficial. This paper proposes a unified neural framework to address these subtasks simultaneously. Apart from the sequence tagging paradigm, the proposed method tackles the multitask lexical analysis via two-stage sequence span classification. Firstly, the model detects the word and named entity boundaries by multi-label classification over character spans in a sentence. Then, the authors assign POS labels and entity labels for words and named entities by multi-class classification, respectively. Furthermore, a Gated Task Transformation (GTT) is proposed to encourage the model to share valuable features between tasks. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on Chinese and Thai public datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.},

  abstract     = {Nonlinear transforms have significantly advanced learned image compression (LIC), particularly using residual blocks. This transform enhances the nonlinear expression ability and obtain compact feature representation by enlarging the receptive field, which indicates how the convolution process extracts features in a high dimensional feature space. However, its functionality is restricted to the spatial dimension and network depth, limiting further improvements in network performance due to insufficient information interaction and representation. Crucially, the potential of high dimensional feature space in the channel dimension and the exploration of network width/resolution remain largely untapped. In this paper, we consider nonlinear transforms from the perspective of feature space, defining high-dimensional feature spaces in different dimensions and investigating the specific effects. Firstly, we introduce the dimension increasing and decreasing transforms in both channel and spatial dimensions to obtain high dimensional feature space and achieve better feature extraction. Secondly, we design a channel-spatial fusion residual transform (CSR), which incorporates multi-dimensional transforms for a more effective representation. Furthermore, we simplify the proposed fusion transform to obtain a slim architecture (CSR-sm), balancing network complexity and compression performance. Finally, we build the overall network with stacked CSR transforms to achieve better compression and reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion performance compared to the existing LIC methods and traditional codecs. Specifically, our proposed method achieves 9.38% BD-rate reduction over VVC on Kodak dataset.},

The energy consumption model and the simulation model have been implemented for the efficient selection of VM. The proposed model CSOA-VM not only lessens the violations at the service level agreement (SLA) level but also minimises the VM migrations. The proposed model also saves energy and the performance analysis shows that energy consumption obtained is 1.35 kWh, SLA violation is 9.2 and VM migration is about 268.

However, physiological recordings often exhibit irregular and unordered patterns, posing a significant challenge in conceptualising them as matrices. As a result, GNNs which comprise interactive nodes connected by edges whose weights are defined by anatomical junctions or temporal relationships have received a lot of consideration by leveraging implicit data that exists in a biological system. Additionally, our study incorporates a structural GNN to effectively differentiate between different degrees of infection in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain. Subsequently, demographic data are included, and a multi-task learning architecture is devised, integrating classification and regression tasks. The trials used an authentic dataset, including 800 brain x-ray pictures, consisting of 560 instances classified as moderate cases and 240 instances classified as severe cases. Based on empirical evidence, our methodology demonstrates superior performance in classification, surpassing other comparison methods with a notable achievement of 92.27% in terms of area under the curve as well as a correlation coefficient of 0.62.},

However, in the face of increasingly complex optimization challenges, the Bat algorithm encounters certain limitations, such as slow convergence and sensitivity to initial solutions. In order to tackle these challenges, the present study incorporates a range of optimization components into the Bat algorithm, thereby proposing a variant called PKEBA. A projection screening strategy is implemented to mitigate its sensitivity to initial solutions, thereby enhancing the quality of the initial solution set. A kinetic adaptation strategy reforms exploration patterns, while an elite communication strategy enhances group interaction, to avoid algorithm from local optima. Subsequently, the effectiveness of the proposed PKEBA is rigorously evaluated. Testing encompasses 30 benchmark functions from IEEE CEC2014, featuring ablation experiments and comparative assessments against classical algorithms and their variants. Moreover, real-world engineering problems are employed as further validation. The results conclusively demonstrate that PKEBA exhibits superior convergence and precision compared to existing algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Tibetan medical named entity recognition (Tibetan MNER) involves extracting specific types of medical entities from unstructured Tibetan medical texts. Tibetan MNER provide important data support for the work related to Tibetan medicine. However, existing Tibetan MNER methods often struggle to comprehensively capture multi-level semantic information, failing to sufficiently extract multi-granularity features and effectively filter out irrelevant information, which ultimately impacts the accuracy of entity recognition. This paper proposes an improved embedding representation method called syllable–word–sentence embedding. By leveraging features at different granularities and using un-scaled dot-product attention to focus on key features for feature fusion, the syllable–word–sentence embedding is integrated into the transformer, enhancing the specificity and diversity of feature representations. The model leverages multi-level and multi-granularity semantic information, thereby improving the performance of Tibetan MNER. We evaluate our proposed model on datasets from various domains. The results indicate that the model effectively identified three types of entities in the Tibetan news dataset we constructed, achieving an F1 score of 93.59%, which represents an improvement of 1.24% compared to the vanilla FLAT. Additionally, results from the Tibetan medical dataset we developed show that it is effective in identifying five kinds of medical entities, with an F1 score of 71.39%, which is a 1.34% improvement over the vanilla FLAT.},

The proposed model optimises the PID controller by minimising key performance metrics: integration time squared error (ITSE), integration time absolute error (ITAE), and rate of change of deviation (J). This approach balances convergence rate, overshoot, and oscillation dynamics effectively. A fuzzy-based method is employed to select the most suitable solution from the Pareto set. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the SNSGA-based approach offers superior tuning capabilities over traditional NSGA-II and other advanced control methods. In a two-area thermal power system without reheat, the SNSGA significantly reduces settling times for frequency deviations: 2.94s for and 4.98s for , marking improvements of 31.6% and 13.4% over NSGA-II, respectively.},

This paper contributes to enhancing age prediction as a regression problem using a union of two CNNs and exchanging knowledge between them. This specifically re-starts the training process from a possibly higher-quality point in different iterations and, consequently, causes potentially yeilds better results at each iteration. The method proposed, which is called cooperative deep neural network (Co-DeepNet), is tested on two types of age prediction problems. Sixteen datasets containing 1899 healthy blood samples and nine datasets containing 2395 diseased blood samples are employed to examine the method's efficiency. As a result, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) is 1.49 and 3.61 years for training and testing data, respectively, when the healthy data is tested. The diseased blood data show MAD results of 3.81 and 5.43 years for training and testing data, respectively. The results of the Co-DeepNet are compared with six other methods proposed in previous studies and a single CNN using four prediction accuracy measurements ( R 2 , MAD, MSE and RMSE).

  abstract     = {Cross-domain graph anomaly detection (CD-GAD) is a promising task that leverages knowledge from a labelled source graph to guide anomaly detection on an unlabelled target graph. CD-GAD classifies anomalies as unique or common based on their presence in both the source and target graphs. However, existing models often fail to fully explore domain-unique knowledge of the target graph for detecting unique anomalies. Additionally, they tend to focus solely on node-level differences, overlooking structural-level differences that provide complementary information for common anomaly detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, Synthetic Graph Anomaly Detection via Graph Transfer and Graph Decouple (GTGD), which effectively detects common and unique anomalies in the target graph. Specifically, our approach ensures deeper learning of domain-unique knowledge by decoupling the reconstruction graphs of common and unique features. Moreover, we simultaneously consider node-level and structural-level differences by transferring node and edge information from the source graph to the target graph, enabling comprehensive domain-common knowledge representation. Anomalies are detected using both common and unique features, with their synthetic score serving as the final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving an average performance by 12.6 on the AUC-PR compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Selecting appropriate tourist attractions to visit in real time is an important problem for travellers. Since recommenders proactively suggest items based on user preference, they are a promising solution for this problem. Travellers visit tourist attractions sequentially by considering multiple attributes at the same time. Therefore, it is desirable to consider this when developing recommenders for tourist attractions. Using GRU4REC, we proposed RNN-based sequence-aware recommenders (RNN-SARs) that use multiple sequence datasets for training the recommended model, named multi-RNN-SARs. We proposed two types of multi-RNN-SARs—concatenate-RNN-SARs and parallel-RNN-SARs. In order to evaluate multi-RNN-SARs, we compared hit rate (HR) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the item-based collaborative filtering recommender (item-CFR), RNN-SAR with the single-sequence dataset (basic-RNN-SAR), multi-RNN-SARs and the state-of-the-art SARs using a real-world travel dataset. Our research shows that multi-RNN-SARs have significantly higher performances compared to item-CFR. Not all multi-RNN-SARs outperform basic-RNN-SAR but the best multi-RNN-SAR achieves comparable performance to that of the state-of-the-art algorithms. These results highlight the importance of using multiple sequence datasets in RNN-SARs and the importance of choosing appropriate sequence datasets and learning methods for implementing multi-RNN-SARs in practice.},

  abstract     = {Urban traffic prediction with high precision is always the unremitting pursuit of intelligent transportation systems and is instrumental in bringing smart cities into reality. The fundamental challenges for traffic prediction lie in the accurate modelling of spatial and temporal traffic dynamics. Existing approaches mainly focus on modelling the traffic data itself, but do not explore the traffic correlations implicit in origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, we propose STOD-Net, a dynamic spatial-temporal OD feature-enhanced deep network, to simultaneously predict the in-traffic and out-traffic for each and every region of a city. We model the OD data as dynamic graphs and adopt graph neural networks in STOD-Net to learn a low-dimensional representation for each region. As per the region feature, we design a gating mechanism and operate it on the traffic feature learning to explicitly capture spatial correlations. To further capture the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among different regions, we propose a novel joint feature, learning block in STOD-Net and transfer the hybrid OD features to each block to make the learning process spatiotemporal-aware. We evaluate the effectiveness of STOD-Net on two benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% in terms of prediction accuracy and considerably improves prediction stability up to 80% in terms of standard deviation.},

  abstract     = {Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to locate a specific region in an image described by a natural language. Existing two-stage methods generate multiple candidate proposals in the first stage, followed by selecting one of these proposals as the grounding result in the second stage. Nevertheless, the number of candidate proposals generated in the first stage significantly exceeds ground truth and the recall of critical objects is inadequate, thereby enormously limiting the overall network performance. To address the above issues, the authors propose an innovative method termed Separate Non-Maximum Suppression (Sep-NMS) for two-stage REC. Particularly, Sep-NMS models information from the two stages independently and collaboratively, ultimately achieving an overall improvement in comprehension and identification of the target objects. Specifically, the authors propose a Ref-Relatedness module for filtering referent proposals rigorously, decreasing the redundancy of referent proposals. A Relatedness module based on robust multimodal pre-trained encoders is built to precisely assess the relevance between language and proposals to improve the recall of critical objects. It is worth mentioning that the authors are the pioneers in utilising a multimodal pre-training model for proposal filtering in the first stage. Moreover, an Information Fusion module is designed to effectively amalgamate the multimodal information across two stages, ensuring maximum utilisation of the available information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the approach achieves competitive performance with previous state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {Although the image dehazing problem has received considerable attention over recent years, the existing models often prioritise performance at the expense of complexity, making them unsuitable for real-world applications, which require algorithms to be deployed on resource constrained-devices. To address this challenge, we propose WaveLiteDehaze-Network (WLD-Net), an end-to-end dehazing model that delivers performance comparable to complex models while operating in real time and using significantly fewer parameters. This approach capitalises on the insight that haze predominantly affects low-frequency information. By exclusively processing the image in the frequency domain using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), we segregate the image into high and low frequencies and process them separately. This allows us to preserve high-frequency details and recover low-frequency components affected by haze, distinguishing our method from existing approaches that use spatial domain processing as the backbone, with DWT serving as an auxiliary component. DWT is applied at multiple levels for better information retention while also accelerating computation by downsampling feature maps. Subsequently, a learning-based fusion mechanism reintegrates the processed frequencies to reconstruct the dehazed image. Experiments show that WLD-Net outperforms other low-parameter models on real-world hazy images and rivals much larger models, achieving the highest PSNR and SSIM scores on the O-Haze dataset. Qualitatively, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in handling a diverse range of haze types, delivering visually pleasing results and robust performance, while also generalising well across different scenarios. With only 0.385 million parameters (more than 100 times smaller than comparable dehazing methods), WLD-Net processes 1024 × 1024 images in just 0.045 s, highlighting its applicability across various real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Early exiting has shown significant potential in accelerating the inference of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by allowing easy samples to exit from shallow layers. However, existing early exiting methods primarily rely on local information from individual samples to estimate prediction uncertainty for making exiting decisions, overlooking the global information provided by the sample population. This impacts the estimation of prediction uncertainty, compromising the reliability of exiting decisions. To remedy this, inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), the authors define a residual score to capture the deviation of features from the principal space of the sample population, providing a global perspective for estimating prediction uncertainty. Building on this, a two-stage exiting strategy is proposed that integrates global information from residual scores with local information from energy scores at both the decision and feature levels. This strategy incorporates three-way decisions to enable more reliable exiting decisions for boundary region samples by delaying judgement. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark validate that the method achieves an average speed-up ratio of 2.17× across all tasks with minimal performance degradation. Additionally, it surpasses the state-of-the-art E-LANG by in model acceleration, along with a performance improvement of 0.6 points, demonstrating a better performance-efficiency trade-off.},

  abstract     = {The goal of point cloud completion is to reconstruct raw scanned point clouds acquired from incomplete observations due to occlusion and restricted viewpoints. Numerous methods use a partial-to-complete framework, directly predicting missing components via global characteristics extracted from incomplete inputs. However, this makes detail recovery challenging, as global characteristics fail to provide complete missing component specifics. A new point cloud completion method named Point-PC is proposed. A memory network and a causal inference model are separately designed to introduce shape priors and select absent shape information as supplementary geometric factors for aiding completion. Concretely, a memory mechanism is proposed to store complete shape features and their associated shapes in a key-value format. The authors design a pre-training strategy that uses contrastive learning to map incomplete shape features into the complete shape feature domain, enabling retrieval of analogous shapes from incomplete inputs. In addition, the authors employ backdoor adjustment to eliminate confounders, which are shape prior components sharing identical semantic structures with incomplete inputs. Experiments conducted on three datasets show that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Analysing patient data within clinical settings reveals a pronounced focus on refining diagnostic accuracy, personalising treatment plans, and optimising resource allocation to enhance clinical outcomes. Nonetheless, this domain faces unique challenges, such as irregular data collection, inconsistent data quality, and patient-specific structural variations. This paper proposed a novel hybrid approach that integrates heuristic and stochastic methods for anomaly detection in patient clinical data to address these challenges. The strategy combines HPO-based optimal Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise for clustering patient exercise data, facilitating efficient anomaly identification. Subsequently, a stochastic method based on the Interquartile Range filters unreliable data points, ensuring that medical tools and professionals receive only the most pertinent and accurate information. The primary objective of this study is to equip healthcare professionals and researchers with a robust tool for managing extensive, high-dimensional clinical datasets, enabling effective isolation and removal of aberrant data points. Furthermore, a sophisticated regression model has been developed using Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to assess the impact of the ensemble abnormal pattern detection approach. Various statistical error estimation techniques validate the efficacy of the hybrid approach alongside AutoML. Experimental results show that implementing this innovative hybrid model on patient rehabilitation data leads to a notable enhancement in AutoML performance, with an average improvement of 0.041 in the score, surpassing the effectiveness of traditional regression models.},

The proposed framework selects the five best-performing pre-trained models, namely, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet201, as the base-learners and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as a meta-learner. To ensure broader applicability, we curated a dataset of chest X-ray images of Lung Disease. Initially, we choose the ten transfer learning models, fine-tune them to extract features relevant to respiratory diseases on the dataset, and select Top-5 best-performing models as base-learners. The effectiveness of the framework is determined by analysis of precision, recall, F1-score, or the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve.

  abstract     = {Despite high predictive performance, machine learning models can be unfair towards specific demographic subgroups characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender or race. This paper presents a novel approach using Computational Profile Likelihood (CPL) to assess potential bias in neural network decisions with respect to sensitive attributes. CPL estimates the conditional probability of a network's internal neuron excitation levels during predictions. To assess the impact of sensitive attributes on predictions, the CPL distribution of individuals sharing a particular value of a sensitive attribute and a specific outcome (e.g., “women” and “high income”) is compared to a subgroup sharing another value of the sensitive attribute but with the same outcome (e.g., “men” and “high income”). The resulting disparities between distributions can be used to quantify the bias with respect to the sensitive attribute and the outcome class. We also assess the efficacy of bias reduction techniques through their influence on the resulting disparities. Experimental results on three widely used datasets indicate that the CPL of the trained models can be used to characterize significant differences between multiple protected groups, highlighting that these models display quantifiable biases. Furthermore, after applying bias mitigation methods, the gaps in CPL distributions are reduced, indicating a more similar internal representation for profiles of different protected groups.},

Firefighting represents a crucial area where accurate information gathering is paramount for efficient resource allocation. Social media platforms as Twitter (or X) have emerged as valuable sources of real-time data, often referred to as ‘citizen science’, offering additional insights alongside traditional data sources. In this work, we introduce a novel pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Twitter data, utilising transformer models to identify and monitor wildfire incidents. Expanding on this approach, we incorporate sentiment analysis to provide deeper insights into public perceptions and emotions related to fire events. Additionally, we present visual representations of geographic data through heat mapping, potentially aiding firefighters in making informed decisions. By integrating advanced NLP techniques with social media data, our approach presents a promising strategy for enhancing wildfire management efforts.},

Speech plays a pivotal role in shaping the emotional climate (EC) of peer conversations. We propose DeepBispec, the first framework to integrate deep bispectral image analysis with affect dynamics (AD) for speech-based EC recognition. Bispectrum representations capture nonlinear and non-Gaussian speech characteristics, while AD descriptors model temporal emotion fluctuations. Evaluated on K-EmoCon, IEMOCAP and SEWA datasets, DeepBispec consistently improved EC classification performance. For example, on K-EmoCon, arousal accuracy increased from 79.0% (bispectrum only) to 81.4% (with AD), while valence accuracy improved from 76.8% to 77.5%; similar trends were observed for IEMOCAP and SEWA. DeepBispec outperformed strong CNN, LSTM, and Transformer baselines, demonstrating robust cross-lingual performance across seven languages. These findings highlight its potential for real-world applications such as mental health monitoring, affect-aware learning platforms and empathetic dialogue systems.},

However, a critical limitation of FL arises in the presence of Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which is common in real-world scenarios. Traditional FL algorithms, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), tend to underperform when faced with data heterogeneity across participating clients. To address this challenge, we propose CalibSNN, a method that combines calibration re-sampling with Soft Nearest Neighbour (SNN) loss to mitigate the bias and variance introduced by uneven data distributions. Calibration aligns local data distributions with global statistics, while SNN loss improves feature representations across heterogeneous clients. Through extensive experiments on diverse datasets and non-IID conditions, we demonstrate that CalibSNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a robust solution to the challenges of non-IID data in FL.},

The conventional recurrent neural network model needs to pad the target with zeros when handling long inputs, resulting in a loss in accuracy. Recently, it was proposed to divide a time series input into patches and merge the learned weights. However, such a model is difficult to interpret. In this article, we consider a mixture of continuous and discrete Markov states to model long-range time dependencies. For example, in a vehicle, each gear level can be a discrete state and the throttle input is continuously controlled to maximise the efficiency of the engine. Data collected from the sensor is prone to noise due to component faults or external disturbances. Hence, we apply a stability constraint to select samples for training. We validate our algorithm on three datasets: (1) Apple Watch, (2) Car engine and (3) Election tweets. On all datasets, we achieve an improvement in the range of 5%–20% in the F-measure. Furthermore, the features learned are easy to explain in terms of real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In various fields, including environmental monitoring, communication, surveillance, and disaster response, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly essential. Autonomous multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs), where multiple UAVs work together, offer powerful solutions in these fields. However, making these networks fully autonomous is challenging, especially concerning real-time decision-making, coordination, and resource management. In the field of literature, there is a demand for a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Q-learning (QL) and deep Q-learning (DQL) within MUWNs. To address this gap, we provide a thorough evaluation of QL and DQL approaches, focusing on their application in autonomous MUWNs. We highlight their roles in route planning, communication relays, and network optimization, discussing advantages and limitations. The survey also explores key challenges, including scalability, energy efficiency, and real-time adaptability, and reviews how QL/DQL enhancements address them. In particular, this paper provides an overview of some QL and DQL applications in MUWNs, such as data retrieval, monitoring, aggregation, resource allocation, and task scheduling to support wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted autonomous trajectory planning, navigation, security, and jamming avoidance. The use of these technologies enables the effective use of UAVs in smart cities, monitoring of industrial complexes, agricultural surveys, and border security. Additionally, using the knowledge gathered from our review, we identify and discuss several open challenges.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce Traversal Learning (TL), a novel approach designed to address the problem of decreased quality encountered in popular distributed learning (DL) paradigms such as Federated Learning (FL), Split Learning (SL) and SplitFed Learning (SFL). Traditional FL often suffers an accuracy drop during aggregation due to its averaging function, while SL and SFL face increased loss due to the independent gradient updates on each split network. TL adopts a unique strategy where the model traverses the nodes during forward propagation (FP) and performs backward propagation (BP) at the orchestrator, effectively implementing centralised learning (CL) principles within a distributed environment. The orchestrator is tasked with generating virtual batches and planning the model's sequential node visits during FP, aligning them with the ordered index of the data within these batches. We conducted experiments on six datasets representing diverse characteristics across various domains. Our evaluation demonstrates that TL is on par with classic CL approaches in terms of accurate inference, thereby offering a viable and robust solution for DL tasks. TL outperformed other DL methods and improved accuracy by 7.85% for independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets, macro F1-score by 1.06% for non-IID datasets, accuracy by 2.05% for text classification and AUC by 1.41% and 2.82% for medical and financial datasets, respectively. By effectively preserving data privacy while maintaining performance, TL represents a significant advancement in DL methodologies.},

The review also addresses the challenges specific to this domain, such as the interpretation of humour and sarcasm, which add complexity to sentiment analysis in the context of memes. A key focus of this review is the need for novel datasets that better capture the unique nature of memes, particularly those that blend text and images with cultural and emotional nuances. Existing benchmark datasets often fall short in representing the diversity of meme formats and regional variations, highlighting the necessity for more comprehensive datasets. Looking forward, we anticipate advancements in analytical methodologies and the development of such specialised datasets, which would significantly enhance the accuracy and depth of sentiment analysis models. This review serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in advancing the study of sentiment analysis in the evolving field of memes.},

However, existing active DA methods often struggle in real-world scenarios where, due to data privacy concerns, only a pre-trained source model is available, rather than the source samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the structure-based uncertainty estimation model (SUEM) for source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA). To be specific, we introduce an innovative active sample selection strategy that combines both uncertainty and diversity sampling to identify the most informative samples. We assess the uncertainty in target samples using structure-wise probabilities and implement a diversity selection method to minimise redundancy. For the selected samples, we not only apply standard-supervised loss but also conduct interpolation consistency training to further explore the structural information of the target domain. Extensive experiments across four widely used datasets demonstrate that our method is comparable to or outperforms current UDA and active DA methods.},

  abstract     = {Skeleton-based action recognition using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has achieved remarkable performance, but recognising ambiguous actions, such as ‘waving’ and ‘saluting’, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically rely on a serial combination of GCNs and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), where spatial and temporal features are extracted independently, leading to an unbalanced spatial-temporal information, which hinders accurate action recognition. Moreover, existing methods for ambiguous actions often overemphasise local details, resulting in the loss of crucial global context, which further complicates the task of differentiating ambiguous actions. To address these challenges, the authors propose a lightweight plug-and-play module called Synchronised and Fine-grained Head (SF-Head), inserted between GCN and TCN layers. SF-Head first conducts Synchronised Spatial-Temporal Extraction (SSTE) with a Feature Redundancy Loss (F-RL), ensuring a balanced interaction between the two types of features. It then performs Adaptive Cross-dimensional Feature Aggregation (AC-FA), with a Feature Consistency Loss (F-CL), which aligns the aggregated feature with their original spatial-temporal feature. This aggregation step effectively combines both global context and local details, enhancing the model's ability to classify ambiguous actions. Experimental results on NTU RGB + D 60, NTU RGB + D 120, NW-UCLA and PKU-MMD I datasets demonstrate significant improvements in distinguishing ambiguous actions.

  abstract     = {In the field of oncology, lung cancer is a leading contributor to cancer-related mortality, highlighting the need for early detection of lung nodules for effective intervention. However, accurate segmentation of lung nodules in Computed Tomography (CT) images remains a significant challenge due to issues such as heterogeneous nodule dimensions, low contrast, and their visual similarity with surrounding tissues. To address these challenges, this study proposes the Edge-Enhanced Feature Pyramid SwinUNet (EE-FPS-UNet), an advanced segmentation model that integrates a modified Swin Transformer with a feature pyramid network (FPN). The research objective is to enhance boundary delineation and multi-scale feature aggregation for improved segmentation performance. The proposed model uses the Swin Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and integrates an FPN for robust multi-scale feature aggregation. Its window-based self-attention mechanism also reduces computational complexity, making it well-suited for high-resolution CT images. Additionally, an edge detection module enhances segmentation by providing edge-related features to the decoder, improving boundary precision. A comparative analysis evaluates the EE-FPS-UNet against leading models, including PSPNet, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3. The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms these models, achieving a Dice Similarity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.89, establishing its efficacy for lung nodule segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Accurate point correspondences is critical for rigid point cloud registration in correspondence-based methods. Many previous learning-based methods employ encoder-decoder backbone for point feature extraction, while applying attention mechanism for sparse superpoints to deal with the partial overlap situation. However, few of these methods focus on the intermediate layers yet mainly pay attention on the top-most patch features, thus neglecting multi-faceted feature perspectives leading to potential overlap areas estimation inaccuracy. Meanwhile, obtaining correct correspondences is usually interfered with the one-to-many case and outliers. To address these issues, we propose a multi-level features extraction network with integrating linear dual attention mechanism into skip-connection stage of encoder-decoder backbone, both efficiently suppressing irrelevant information and guiding residual features to learn the common regions on which the network should focus to tackle the overlap estimation inaccuracy issue, combined with a parallel-structured decoder forming distinguishable features and potential overlapping regions. Additionally, a two-stage correspondences pruning process is designed to tackle the mismatch issue, which mainly depends on the rigid geometric constraint. Extensive experiments conducted on indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate our method's accuracy and stability, by outperforming state-of-the-art methods on registration recall.},

  abstract     = {Medical images often exhibit low and blurred contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues, with considerable variation in lesion edges and shapes even within the same disease, leading to significant challenges in segmentation. Therefore, precise segmentation of lesions has become an essential prerequisite for patient condition assessment and formulation of treatment plans. Significant achievements have been made in research related to the U-Net model in recent years. It improves segmentation performance and is extensively applied in the semantic segmentation of medical images to offer technical support for consistent quantitative lesion analysis methods. First, this paper classifies medical image datasets on the basis of their imaging modalities and then examines U-Net and its various improvement models from the perspective of structural modifications. The research objectives, innovative designs, and limitations of each approach are discussed in detail. Second, we summarise the four central improvement mechanisms of the U-Net and U-Net variant algorithms: the jump-connection mechanism, the residual-connection mechanism, 3D-UNet, and the transformer mechanism. Finally, we examine the relationships among the four core enhancement mechanisms and commonly utilized medical datasets and propose potential avenues and strategies for future advancements. This paper provides a systematic summary and reference for researchers in related fields, and we look forward to designing more efficient and stable medical image segmentation network models based on the U-Net network.},

  abstract     = {The extensive coverage of satellite constellations has rendered the satellite–terrestrial integrated network (STIN) a pivotal solution for communication and computation services in internet of vehicles (IoVs) rescuing in remote or disaster areas with limited terrestrial networks. To optimise network resource utilisation and service quality, the integration of the service function chain (SFC) into STIN-enabled IoV rescuing systems has become essential. However, traditional SFC-based STIN systems encounter challenges in flow scheduling flexibility, stemming from the sequential execution of subtasks on satellites equipped with virtual network functions (VNFs). This leads to a trade-off between data volume reduction and the additional communication and computation energy costs incurred in the orbit. To address this issue, this paper introduces a space ground collaborative SFC (SGC-SFC) flow scheduling strategy. This strategy enables the execution of subtasks on either VNF-equipped satellites or the ground vehicle formation, contingent on network conditions. Firstly, we carry out a computation–space–time graph (CSTG) model specifically for the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system with SFC. This model integrates the computational layer into the space–time graph (STG), accurately capturing the data volume reduction characteristics and sequential execution constraints of SFC in the STIN-enabled IoV rescuing system. Secondly, a SGC-SFC flow scheduling algorithm is designed to identify a set of feasible paths with minimal energy cost and maximum processable data volume. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SGC-SFC under diverse conditions.},

  abstract     = {Based on the dimensional splitting method (DSM) and an improved complex variable element-free Galerkin (ICVEFG) method, the complex variable dimension coupling method (CVDCM) is proposed to analyze 3D inhomogeneous transient heat conduction problems. The original 3D governing equation is split into a collection of 2D forms by the dimensional splitting method (DSM), and the discrete equation of the 2D problem is derived via the ICVEFG method. The splitting direction is then treated by using the finite element method (FEM), while the time-dependent term in the governing equation is handled by the finite difference method (FDM). Finally, the numerical solution formula is obtained. To verify the accuracy of the CVDCM, the ratio of the L 2 norm to the true value is used as the relative error. The convergence of the proposed method is demonstrated by increasing the number of nodes and meshes. Five numerical examples of transient inhomogeneous heat conduction problems with spatially varying material properties (density, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity) are solved using the CVDCM; the results show that the proposed method achieves good convergence and achieves higher accuracy compared to the dimension coupling method (DCM) and the improved element-free Galerkin (IEFG) method in five examples.},

The methodology integrates the Crank–Nicolson (CN) scheme for discretizing temporal derivatives and applies the Trigonometric Quintic B-splines (TQBS) approach to approximate both the state variable and its spatial derivatives on an exponentially graded mesh. Through a meticulous convergence analysis, the study establishes a parameter-uniform convergence of fourth order in space and second order in time. To verify the theoretical claims and evaluate the method's efficacy, four test examples are solved using the numerical algorithm, offering tangible evidence of the parameter-uniform convergence of the proposed numerical scheme. Additionally, the paper includes a graphical comparison of the proposed method with Shishkin meshes, providing empirical evidence of its efficacy and parameter-uniform convergence.},

  abstract     = {Topology optimization has experienced rapid development over the past two decades and has been widely applied in fields such as aircraft structures, civil engineering, and transportation equipment. Common topology optimization methods, such as density-based methods and level set methods, focus on global variable optimization. These global optimization approaches often consume substantial computational resources and are not suitable for parallel optimization. In contrast, structures in nature evolve from a combination of numerous local optimization problems, where each cell unit adjusts on the basis of its perception of the surrounding environment, leading to the formation of biological structures. This paper proposes a novel heuristic topology optimization method, the biomimetic moving-mesh (BMM) method, inspired by biological cell growth and evolution. The BMM method uses the positions of mesh nodes as variables to simulate cellular expansion and contraction, thereby creating a new optimization approach. Compared with traditional topology optimization methods, the BMM method offers smoother meshes and is more suitable for handling large-scale parallel optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {The classical material point method (MPM) is particularly suitable for large deformation problems with surface contact, but its capability to capture size effects remains relatively limited. In order to capture the size effect widely observed in solid materials as well as to eliminate mesh dependency, we present an F-bar B-spline MPM for solving finite strain-gradient plasticity in the micromorphic approach. A multiplicative finite strain thermoplasticity model is first regularized in a micromorphic approach, where a global internal variable is introduced to take into account the size effect. An implicit B-spline MPM is developed to solve the coupled problem in a monolithic manner with consistent linearization. This implementation provides a general framework to incorporate phenomenological elasto-plasticity models while preserving the prescribed size effect in the MPM. Although B-spline basis function is effective in suppressing the volumetric-locking deformation pattern when volume-preserving plasticity model is used, severe stress oscillation may manifest when the deformation mode approaches the incompressible limit. Therefore, we propose an F-bar method for the implicit B-spline MPM to suppress the spurious stress oscillation. The exact linearization of the F-bar method and its coupling with the balance equation of micromorphic momentum are derived in closed form. Three representative numerical examples are presented to validate our implementation and demonstrate the advantages of our method. Results show that the proposed method is effective in capturing the size effect at extreme conditions with large distortion and contact, and the F-bar method suppresses the spurious stress oscillations associated with volume-preserving plastic flow. One limitation is that the convergence behavior is less satisfactory when strain-softening model is used due to the inherent limitation of the implicit MPM.},

  abstract     = {Focusing on the homogenization of periodic composite materials, this study investigates computational methods based on volume integral equations. Such formulations are revisited from the standpoint of the preconditioning of the original cell problem by the introduction of a comparison material. This allows for to recovery of simple convergence criteria for iterative steepest-descent and fixed-point schemes for composites with general non-linear behaviour. In the case of linear materials, the preconditioned volume integral formulation coincides with the well-known Lippmann–Schwinger equation. The spectral properties of the featured linear integral operator, which is bounded and self-adjoint, are investigated to shed light on the behaviour of conventional computational homogenization methods. The so-called Lippmann–Schwinger spectrum is analyzed, with its bounds governing the convergence rate of iterative solution methods. The associated eigenvectors, which constitute the eigenstates of the composite material considered, are also described in detail to understand their role in constructing the solution to the cell problem and ultimately in computing the effective properties. Formulated in the continuous setting, this analysis is followed by the investigation of a discrete representation of the integral operator considered. A number of examples on synthetic microstructures are finally considered in the conductivity setting to illustrate the obtained theoretical results and highlight the role of the spectral properties in the operation of computational homogenization methods. This paves the way for the development of reduced models and more efficient computations.},

  abstract     = {Statistical depth is the act of gauging how representative a point is compared with a reference probability measure. The depth allows introducing rankings and orderings to data living in multivariate, or function spaces. Though widely applied and with much experimental success, little theoretical progress has been made in analysing functional depths. This article highlights how the common h -depth and related depths from functional data analysis can be viewed as a kernel mean embedding, widely used in statistical machine learning. This facilitates answers to several open questions regarding the statistical properties of functional depths. We show that (i) h -depth has the interpretation of a kernel-based method; (ii) several h -depths possess explicit expressions, without the need to estimate them using Monte Carlo procedures; (iii) under minimal assumptions, -depths and their maximisers are uniformly strongly consistent and asymptotically Gaussian (also in infinite-dimensional spaces and for imperfectly observed functional data); and (iv) several -depths uniquely characterise probability distributions in separable Hilbert spaces. In addition, we also provide a link between the depth and empirical characteristic function based procedures for functional data. Finally, the unveiled connections enable to design an extension of the -depth towards regression problems.},

It shows that the emerging best practice relies heavily on the approach and tools created by the original authors of the causal forest such as their grf package and the approaches given by them in examples. Generally, researchers use the causal forest on a relatively low-dimensional dataset relying on observed controls or in some cases experiments to identify effects. There are several common ways to then communicate results–by mapping out the univariate distribution of individual-level treatment effect estimates, displaying variable importance results for the forest and graphing the distribution of treatment effects across covariates that are important either for theoretical reasons or because they have high variable importance. Some deviations from this common practice are interesting and deserve further development and use. Others are unnecessary or even harmful. The paper concludes by reflecting on the emerging best practice for causal forest use and paths for future research.},

To handle the mixture of continuous and discrete data, we use Wasserstein distance as a new marginal utility to measure the difference between the joint distribution and the product of marginal distributions. In theory, we establish the sure screening property under less restrictive assumptions on data types. The proposed procedure does not require model specification, gives a more effective geometric measure to compare the discrepancy between distributions and avoids introducing biases caused by the choice of slicing rules for continuous data. Numerical comparison indicates that the proposed Wasserstein-SIS method performs better than existing methods in various models. A real data application also validates the better practicability of Wasserstein-SIS.},

To address this gap, we review a family of chance-corrected IRA statistics for two-rater dichotomous-response cases, a fundamental setting that not only serves as the theoretical foundation for categorical-response or multirater IRA methods but is also practically dominant in most empirical studies, and we propose a novel data-generating framework to simulate correlated decision processes between raters. Subsequently, a new estimand, which calibrates the ‘true’ chance-corrected IRA, is introduced while accounting for the potential ‘probabilistic certainty’. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the reviewed IRA methods under various practical scenarios and were summarised by an agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis. Finally, we provide recommendations for selecting appropriate IRA statistics based on outcome prevalence and rater characteristics and highlight the need for further advancements in IRA estimation methodologies.},

The nature of the interactions is analyzed using molecular electrostatic potential maps, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, delocalization indices, and electron density difference maps. In the presence of LiH, NH 3 molecules engage in several types of noncovalent interactions, namely, hydrogen bonding (HB), lithium bonding (LB), and dihydrogen bonding (DHB). The LiH:NH 3 dimer is stabilized primarily through Li···N interactions. The role of these noncovalent interactions in complexes having more than one NH 3 molecule, for example, hetero-trimer, tetramer, and pentamer structures, is also examined. Increasing the number of NH 3 molecules enhances the number of HB sites. Additionally, the strengths of LB and DHB interactions associated with HB-bonded NH 3 molecules increase. Interaction energy estimates and many-body energy decomposition analysis suggest that increasing NH 3 molecules increases cooperativity, approaching ~10% of the total interaction's energy in the case of tetramers and pentamers.},

The interactions between residues can be described by distances or energies. The former is simple but less rigorous. The latter is complicated but more precise, especially when considering the solvent effect. In this work, we apply an existing energy decomposition method based on the Poisson–Boltzmann equation solver. The calculation is especially accelerated on GPU for higher performance. In four formal applications, the constructed interaction energy (IE) network shows good results. First, it is found that the protein folding rate has a stronger correlation with the energy-based contact order than the distance-based contact order. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is 0.839 versus 0.784 on a dataset of non-two-state proteins. Second, we find that most thermophilic proteins have lower IEs than mesophilic proteins. The IE in solvent acts as an indicator to evaluate the thermostabilities of proteins. Third, we use the IE network to predict the key residues in the formation of the insulin dimer. Most key residues are in agreement with the findings in previous alanine-scanning experiments. Lastly, we propose a novel method (called APFN) to predict the allosteric pathway based on the IE network. The method gives the same allosteric pathway for CheY protein as in previous nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. On the whole, the IE network in the solvent has been demonstrated to be reliable in describing the characteristics embedded in protein structures.},

  abstract     = {The carbon and oxygen atoms of tetrahydropyran form the common substructure of pyranose monosaccharides in vertebrate glycans. This substructure can assume various ring puckering chair and skew-boat conformations, and can thereby impact glycan conformations relevant for biomolecular structure and signaling. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) provides a wealth of experimental glycan structural biology data that can be useful in the development and validation of molecular mechanics force fields for these molecules. However, these experimental data are typically from solvent-depleted crystalline environments at very low temperatures, in contrast to biological conditions that are aqueous and near ambient temperature, which is the regime targeted by biomolecular force fields. To determine if these PDB X-ray crystal data can be of utility as references for carbohydrate force fields, we compared ring puckering conformations from these experimental data to both vacuum and explicit aqueous solvent puckering free energy data from extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) molecular dynamics simulations using the previously validated CHARMM36 force field. We found that, for monosaccharides that are not charged (glucose, N -acetylglucosamine, galactose, N -acetylgalactosamine, mannose, xylose, and fucose), both the vacuum and aqueous simulation puckering preferences strongly correlate with PDB data, and therefore with each other. In contrast, all charged monosaccharides that were considered (the conjugate bases of N -acetylneuraminic acid, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid) had puckering preferences correlating with PDB data only in aqueous simulations and not in vacuum simulations. These results suggest that comparing puckering preferences from aqueous simulations to PDB X-ray crystal puckering conformation data can be a valid and useful component of carbohydrate force field development and validation.},

  abstract     = {Molecular properties in combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations have been shown to be dependent on the size of the quantum mechanical (QM) region and the amount of conformational sampling. Previous studies have largely focused on enzymatic systems, which have made it difficult to distinguish the effects of QM region size and conformational sampling from other factors including QM-MM boundary artifacts and the boundary effects. This study uses the difference-based adaptive solvation QM/MM method to investigate the tautomerization reactions of alanine and aspartate in explicit solvent. The choice of computationally tractable systems enables the decoupling of QM region size effects from other factors and a direct comparison of free energy surfaces with potential energy surfaces (PESs). The results show that (1) it is crucial to properly account for thermal fluctuations along the reaction pathways, and (2) free energy surfaces converge rapidly with increasing QM region size, whereas charge transfer requires a slightly larger QM region to achieve convergence. These findings are expected to guide future studies of enzymatic systems and other complex systems where QM/MM methods are applied.},

The acyl transfer reaction occurs between the activated carboxylate group of the fatty acid and the free hydroxyl group on the glycerol backbone of DAG. However, how the two substrates enter DGAT1's catalytic reaction chamber and interact with DGAT1 remains elusive. This study aims to explore the structural basis of DGAT1's substrate recognition by investigating each substrate's pathway to the reaction chamber. Using a human DGAT1 cryo-EM structure in complex with an oleoyl-CoA substrate, we designed two different all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation systems: DGAT1 away (both acyl-CoA and DAG away from the reaction chamber) and DGAT1 bound (acyl-CoA bound in and DAG away from the reaction chamber). Our DGAT1 away simulations reveal that acyl-CoA approaches the reaction chamber via interactions with positively charged residues in transmembrane helix 7. DGAT1 bound simulations show DAGs entering into the reaction chamber from the cytosol leaflet. The bound acyl-CoA's fatty acid lines up with the headgroup of DAG, which appears to be competent to TAG formation. We then converted them into TAG and coenzyme (CoA) and used adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations to explore the egress pathways of the products. We identify their escape routes, which are aligned with their respective entry pathways. Visualization of the substrate and product pathways and their interactions with DGAT1 is expected to guide future experimental design to better understand DGAT1 structure and function.},

We study misinformation diffusion between the decentralized and the centralized platforms and identify three decentralized governance mechanisms to mitigate the spread of misinformation in decentralized networks: user flagging, user article ratings, and user reputation. Our empirical experiments using agent-based simulations leveraging real-world data from two platforms reveal two findings. First, comparing misinformation diffusion between the decentralized Steemit and the centralized Pokec platforms suggests that in the absence of any mitigation mechanisms, misinformation in decentralized platforms affects more users, at faster rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user. Second, within the decentralized platforms, misinformation affects fewer users, at slower rates, and reaches shorter distance from the misinformation initiating user in the presence of mitigating mechanisms than in their absence. We discuss the implications of these results both for the understanding of misinformation diffusion and for the governance of decentralized social network platforms.},

We implement a quasi-experimental design by leveraging the first and most famous vampire attack launched by SushiSwap (the attacker) against Uniswap (the incumbent). We examine both the deposit-side and exchange-side impacts of the vampire attack on the operational performance of the liquidity pools on Uniswap. Surprisingly, we find that the vampire attack has no significant effect on the liquidity provision on the deposit side. Even more surprisingly, the vampire attack significantly increases the incumbent's trading volume on the exchange side. We further uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to these intriguing results. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the novel tokenized incentives strategy. We show the generalizability of our findings by examining an alternative vampire attack event in the context of non-fungible token marketplaces.

This study examines the impact of “lazy minting,” a new NFT production method introduced by major NFT marketplaces to lower minting costs by deferring blockchain certification until the first sale. In response to the call for further research on emerging technologies in operations management, we explore how this policy affects the net sales performance of existing sellers in the NFT marketplaces. Based on transaction cost economics (TCE) and the literature about different IP protection methods, we distinguish between lazy- and regular-minted NFTs by their differential transaction costs and utilize the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to conduct our analysis. We find that lazy minting adoption significantly boosts the net sales performance of existing sellers. This is attributed to their cost-adaptive IP protection behavior. Specifically, they achieve this by minting more NFTs with a larger proportion of style-consistent NFTs through lazy minting, while strategically employing regular minting for style-breaking NFTs, which is contingent upon their reputation. Our study has important theoretical and practical implications for operations management under the emerging technological revolution.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain technologies have catalyzed the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which operate in an incentive network fueled by crypto tokens. In essence, these tokens are imbued with either payment rights (i.e., transactional tokens) or ownership rights (i.e., governance tokens). The decentralized organizational paradigm dismantles the traditional management structure and bring new research opportunities to Operations Management (OM). While the performance of DAOs has been largely examined in current OM literature, the effectiveness of their internal incentive mechanisms—specifically the one that uses ownership as rewards to promote user contributions—remains unclear. Focusing on DAO-enabled virtual communities, we seek to examine whether decentralized ownership provides stronger incentives for user behaviors, such as creation and curation, in comparison to traditional monetary rewards through the lens of psychological ownership theory. We obtained data from Steemit that captures the reward, creation, curation and transaction behaviors of 98,000 users from May 2017 to April 2019. By leveraging the “power-up” action as a shock that increases user ownership shares, we established a quasi-experimental setting. Employing the PSM-DID model, we found that the use of governance tokens is associated with enhanced creation and curation efforts but declined creation novelty, compared to the use of transactional tokens. Our additional analyses further reveal that the incentive effects of governance tokens diminish over time. However, upon the recurrence of the intended choice, these effects become reinforced. Notably, we find that governance token ownership is more strongly associated with curation efforts for users with weaker social ties. Conversely, for users with high reputation scores, their content creation behaviors are less strongly associated with governance token ownership. This study contributes to the burgeoning discourse on blockchain and cryptocurrency from an operational perspective, providing valuable insights for the design of incentive mechanisms in DAOs and advancing our understanding of operational efficiencies and stakeholder engagement in decentralized structures within Operations Management.},

In developing the theory, I highlight that blockchain represents a distinct organizational form for coordinating operations under a highly decentralized structure, in which the essential tasks of system infrastructure maintenance are assigned to third-party crowd workers through the unique governance mechanism of consensus protocol. I specifically focus on two widely adopted consensus protocols in the context of cryptocurrency, namely, proof-of-work (PoW), which assigns tasks that sustain the blockchain system operation based on workers' investments in computing power, and proof-of-stake (PoS), which assigns these tasks based on workers' investments in the native cryptocurrency as stakes. I argue that compared with PoW, PoS increases worker participation and task decentralization because the investment requirement of task participation in the form of blockchain native assets reduces workers' transaction costs in task contracting and their tendencies for hyper-competition. My empirical analysis leverages a natural experiment on Ethereum, namely, the “Merge” event on September 15, 2022, in which the blockchain changed the assignment rules by switching the consensus protocol from PoW to PoS. The results under a difference-in-differences research design confirm my arguments.},

However, it is still unclear how smart contracts may affect firms' operational efficiency. We address this issue empirically by conducting a quasi-natural experiment in the United States in which certain states have enacted relevant laws that increase in-state firms' propensity to adopt and use smart contracts. Our difference-in-differences estimation suggests that compared with out-of-state control firms, in-state treatment firms' operational efficiency increases significantly after the enactment of smart contract laws. Our post hoc analysis further suggests that state-level smart contract laws help increase in-state firms' actual smart contract activities, which in turn lead to operational efficiency improvement. We also find that the operational efficiency improvement varies across firms with different supply chain complexities. While firms with a large number of supply chain partners (i.e., high horizontal complexity) gain more operational efficiency improvement, the improvement becomes less pronounced if firms' supply chain partners are distributed across different countries (i.e., high spatial complexity). Overall, our research not only demonstrates smart contracts' ability to improve operational efficiency but also reveals the critical role of supply chain complexity in affecting the operational efficiency improvement.},

This study explores how this paradox unfolds in a large, blockchain-based logistics platform that was ultimately discontinued. Through an in-depth, longitudinal case study, we identify three interrelated governance contradictions—regarding ownership, trust, and growth—that triggered destabilizing oscillations between centralized and decentralized governance modes. We introduce the concept of semirigid limits to capture the bounded flexibility within which governance can be made and adapted under such paradoxical conditions. Our findings show that the centralization–decentralization paradox is especially difficult to navigate when strategic boundary conditions—here, industry competition, fragmented coordination, and high interdependencies—are present. Our study contributes to the paradox and governance literature by theorizing how governance contradictions emerge and persist and by identifying the mechanisms that constrain alignment and adaptation. We also offer guidance for managers in regard to addressing the competing demands of centralization and decentralization in interorganizational platforms.},

In our inductive case study of five technology providers offering blockchain services for operations and supply chains, we examine how founders' power (i.e., expert, prestige, and ownership) shapes management behaviors that build blockchain perceptions and influence stakeholders toward strategic adoption. Our findings reveal that high-performing cases actively seek inspiration beyond the blockchain ecosystem for service designs and adopt a centralized decision-making approach where key strategic decisions are made internally. In contrast, low-performing cases struggle due to within-blockchain exploration and decentralized decision-making, leading to slower implementation and limited scalability. Furthermore, we find that founders' behaviors in blockchain adoption are embraced by firm members through performance evaluation and interactions, shaping organizational practices and culture, ultimately determining the success or failure of blockchain technology providers. This study extends previous research at the intersection of founders' power and blockchain literature by developing propositions about how different sources of founders' power lead to distinct management behaviors, influencing the success or failure of blockchain adoption outcomes.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of identifying financial asset price bubbles, particularly through the development of time-series unit-root tests featuring fractionally integrated errors and panel unit-root tests. This study introduces an innovative approach for assessing the sign of the persistence parameter ( α ) within a panel fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, based on the least squares estimator of α . This method incorporates three distinct test statistics based on the Hurst parameter ( H ), which can take values in the range of ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) , be equal to 1 / 2 , or fall within the interval of ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . The null hypothesis corresponds to α = 0 . Based on a panel of continuous records of observations, the null asymptotic distributions are obtained when the time span ( T ) is fixed and the number of cross sections ( N ) goes to infinity. The power function of the tests is obtained under the local alternative where α is close to zero in the order of 1 / ( T ⁢ N ) . This alternative covers the departure from the unit root hypothesis from the explosive side, enabling the calculation of lower power in bubble tests. The hypothesis testing problem and the local power function are also considered when a panel of discrete-sampled observations is available under a sequential limit, that is, the sampling interval shrinks to zero followed by the N goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we develop two families of sequential monitoring procedure to (timely) detect changes in the parameters of a GARCH(1,1) model. Our statistics can be applied irrespective of whether the historical sample is stationary or not, and indeed without previous knowledge of the regime of the observations before and after the break. In particular, we construct our detectors as the CUSUM process of the quasi-Fisher scores of the log likelihood function. To ensure timely detection, we then construct our boundary function (exceeding which would indicate a break) by including a weighting sequence which is designed to shorten the detection delay in the presence of a changepoint. We consider two types of weights: a lighter set of weights, which ensures timely detection in the presence of changes occurring “early, but not too early” after the end of the historical sample; and a heavier set of weights, called “Rényi weights” which is designed to ensure timely detection in the presence of changepoints occurring very early in the monitoring horizon. In both cases, we derive the limiting distribution of the detection delays, indicating the expected delay for each set of weights. Our methodologies can be applied for a general analysis of changepoints in GARCH(1,1) sequences; however, they can also be applied to detect changes from stationarity to explosivity or vice versa, thus allowing to check for “volatility bubbles”, upon applying tests for stationarity before and after the identified break. Our theoretical results are validated via a comprehensive set of simulations, and an empirical application to daily returns of individual stocks.},

We propose a test for the presence of speculative bubbles in the context of mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive processes. The test exploits the fact that bubbles are anticipative, that is, they are generated by an extreme shock in the forward-looking dynamics. In particular, the test uses both path-level deviations and growth rates to assess the presence of a bubble of a given duration and size, at any moment in time. We show that the distribution of the test statistic can be either analytically determined or numerically approximated, depending on the error distribution. Size and power properties of the test are analyzed in controlled Monte Carlo experiments. An empirical application is presented for a monthly oil price index. It demonstrates the ability of the test to detect bubbles and to provide valuable insights in terms of risk assessments in the spirit of Value-at-Risk.},

This article explores the usefulness of quantile regression (QR) technique in detecting and surveilling financial bubbles, encompassing both global testing and real-time monitoring. We demonstrate that the QR-based quantile unit root test, coupled with an optimal quantile selection technique, serves as an effective tool for a global bubble test without necessitating additional recursive techniques. Moreover, we propose two QR-based bubble monitoring techniques. We show that the monitoring statistics follow a random variate under the null hypothesis of no bubbles but diverge to positive infinity in the presence of a mildly explosive bubble, and hence consistently date the origination of a bubble. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that compared with their LS counterparts, in the presence of skewed distributions, the QR-based global test delivers substantially greater power, while the QR-based monitoring procedures offer higher bubble detection rate and more accurate dating of the bubble origination. As an illustration, we conduct a pseudo real-time monitoring exercise with the S&P 500 composite index.},

In this article, I show that unit root quantile autoregressive models can approximate such dynamics by allowing the largest autoregressive root to take values below unity at low quantiles, which correspond to price crashes, and above unity at upper quantiles, that correspond to bubble expansions. On this basis, I employ two unit root tests based on quantile autoregressions to detect bubbles. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that the two tests have good size and power properties, and can outperform recursive least-squares-based tests. The merits of the two tests are further illustrated in three empirical applications that examine Bitcoin, US equity and US housing markets. In the empirical applications, special attention is given to the issue of controlling for economic fundamentals. The estimation results indicate the presence of asymmetric dynamics that closely match those of the simulated bubble processes.},

We first consider a data generating process that entails a switch from a unit root regime to an explosive regime followed by a collapse and subsequent return to unit root behavior. We demonstrate analytically that the standard OLS estimates are inconsistent and date both the origination and implosion points with a delay in large samples. A simple modification that involves omitting the residual corresponding to the implosion date is shown to yield consistent estimates. We also develop an efficient dating algorithm that can accommodate a framework with multiple bubbles. The algorithm exploits the explicit form of the unit root restrictions to directly embed them into the recursive optimization problem which obviates the need to rely on an iterative scheme that requires initial values. Extensive simulation experiments indicate that our proposed procedure typically delivers estimates with lower bias and root mean squared error relative to competing alternatives.

This modification, based on the approach developed in Beare (2018) in the context of conventional unit root testing, is achieved by purging the impact of unconditional heteroskedasticity from the data using a kernel estimate of volatility before the application of the bubble detection methods proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015) (PSY). The modified statistic is shown to achieve the same limiting null distribution as the corresponding (heteroskedasticity-uncorrected) statistic from PSY would obtain under homoskedasticity, such that the usual critical values provided in PSY may still be used. Versions of the test based on regressions including either no intercept or a (redundant) intercept are considered. Representations for asymptotic local power against a single bubble model are also derived. Monte Carlo simulation results highlight that neither one of these tests dominates the other across different bubble locations and magnitudes, and across different models of time-varying volatility. Accordingly, we also propose a test based on a union of rejections between the with- and without-intercept variants of the modified PSY test. The union procedure is shown to perform almost as well as the better of the constituent tests for a given DGP, and also performs very well compared to existing heteroskedasticity-robust tests across a large range of simulation DGPs.},

Further refinements, such as the point-optimal linear test, approach the power envelope remarkably closely.

Against this background, this study investigates the formation of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market with a specific focus on the so-called Magnificent Seven (Mag-7) individual stocks during the AI boom, spanning the period from January 2017 to January 2025. We apply the real-time PSY bubble detection methodology of Phillips et al. (2015a, 2015b) while controlling for market and industry factors for individual stocks. Confidence intervals to assess the degree of speculative behavior in asset price dynamics are calculated using the near-unit root approach of Phillips (2023). The findings reveal the presence of speculative bubbles in the Nasdaq stock market and across all Mag-7 stocks. Nvidia and Microsoft experience the longest speculative periods over January 2017–December 2021, while Nvidia and Tesla show the fastest rates of explosive behavior. Speculative bubbles persist in the market and in six of the seven stocks (excluding Apple) from December 2022 to January 2025. Near-unit-root inference indicates mildly explosive dynamics for Nvidia and Tesla (2017–2021) and local-to-unity near explosive behavior for all assets in both periods.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the Riemann solutions and their asymptotic limits for the macroscopic production model with modified Chaplygin gas are investigated. Due to this model belonging to the Temple class and the curve of this rarefaction wave lying between the one of shock and uncertain waves in the phase plane, the Riemann solutions we constructed differ from those of previous studies. More specifically, a special structure R J ‾ + J $$ R\overline{J}&amp;#x0002B;J $$ is found in the construction of the Riemann solution. R J ‾ $$ R\overline{J} $$ is formed by a rarefaction wave R $$ R $$ and a discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ attached to the wavefront of this rarefaction wave. It should be stressed that the rarefaction wave and the shock wave share the same wave velocity on this discontinuity J ‾ $$ \overline{J} $$ . In the asymptotic limits of the Riemann solutions, not all solutions converge to those of the conservation law equations when the perturbation parameters tend to 0 with the same initial data. What is interesting is that the vacuum and delta shock wave solutions are obtained by the small Riemann solution S + J $$ S&amp;#x0002B;J $$ , which consists of a shock wave S $$ S $$ followed by a contact discontinuity J $$ J $$ , where the small Riemann solution means that the solution whose structure remains unchanged for the solution of the Riemann problem of the macroscopic production model with modified Chaplygin gas under the small enough perturbation parameters.},

  abstract     = {Predator-prey models, such as the Leslie-Gower model, are essential for understanding population dynamics and stability within ecosystems. These models help explain the balance between species under natural conditions, but the inclusion of factors like the Allee effect and intraspecific competition adds complexity and realism to these interactions, enhancing our ability to predict system behavior under stress. To detect early indicators of population collapse, this study investigates the intricate dynamics of a modified Leslie-Gower predator-prey model with both Allee effect and intraspecific competition. We analyze the existence and stability of equilibria, as well as bifurcation phenomena, including saddle-node bifurcations of codimension 2, Hopf bifurcations of codimension 2, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations of codimension at least 4. Detailed transitions between bifurcation curves–specifically saddle-node, Hopf, homoclinic, and limit cycle bifurcations–are also examined. We observe a novel transition phenomenon, where a system jumps from saddle-node bifurcation to homoclinic and limit cycle bifurcations. This suggests that burst oscillations may serve as an early warning of system collapse rather than simply a tipping point. Our findings indicate that moderate levels of intraspecific competition or Allee effect support coexistence of both populations, while excessive levels may destabilize the entire biological system, leading to collapse. These insights offer valuable implications for ecological management and the early detection of risks in population dynamics.},

In detail, nonlinear multisource disturbance encompasses the disturbances brought about by exogenous systems and norm-bounded disturbances. In this relation, two kinds of PDE-type disturbance observers are put forward for the purpose of estimating the disturbances produced by the exogenous systems. Subsequently, an output feedback-based secured control law is devised through the assistance of estimation information gathered from the constructed observer. In addition, hybrid cyber attacks are undertaken in the control channel with the goal of enhancing the security of the system. In this context, a Bernoulli distributed white sequence is utilized for the purpose of managing the randomness of cyber attacks. Also, the gain fluctuations in the control framework are considered within a structure of linear fractional form to improve the control design robustness. Apart from this, with the intent of addressing the norm-bounded disturbances, an extended dissipative technique is implemented. At the end, a numerical example accompanied by the simulation findings is provided to showcase the efficacy of the developed theoretical results and control mechanism.},

  abstract     = {The equivalence problem in differential geometry investigates whether two geometric structures can be transformed into one another through an appropriate change of variables. This issue is central to understanding the invariants associated with dynamical systems, which remain unchanged under such transformations. The Cartan equivalence method provides a powerful and systematic framework for addressing these problems by reducing complex equivalence questions to more tractable ones involving coframes and structure equations. In this study, we apply Cartan's method to second-order autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), offering insights into the intrinsic geometric structure of these systems under coordinate transformations. Specifically, we examine a class of second-order ODEs that model nonlinear dynamical behavior, employing the pseudogroup of web transformations to identify differential invariants and symmetry classes. The study introduces a step-by-step construction of an invariant coframe, elucidates the structure equations governing the system, and provides a classification of the equations based on their differential invariants. Two representative physical systems are investigated in detail: the motion of a damped spring-mass system and the van der Pol oscillator. In addition to these applications, the paper explores the interplay between equivalence, symmetry reduction, and integrability. By leveraging Cartan's method, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the equivalence problem in the context of higher order differential equations, highlighting both the theoretical elegance and practical utility of the approach in uncovering hidden geometric features, symmetries, and conserved quantities.},

Numerical results substantiate the outcomes of the control-induced system, and we have compared the results under various maximum control efforts.

The fractional derivative has been introduced within the context of transmission and recovery process, displaying characteristics similar to tempered fractional ( T F $$ TF $$ ) derivatives. It has been established that under certain condition, a function's T F $$ TF $$ derivatives are proportional to the function itself. Applying the following observation, we examined the stability of several steady-state solutions, such as disease-free and endemic states, in light of this newly formulated model, using the reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ). In addition, the precise range of epidemiological parameters for the fractional-order model was determined by calibrating weekly registered dengue incidence in the San Juan municipality of Puerto Rico, from April 9, 2010, to April 2, 2011. We performed a global sensitivity analysis method to measure the influence of key model parameters (along with the fractional-order coefficient) on total dengue cases and the basic reproduction number ( R 0 $$ {R}_0 $$ ) using a Monte Carlo-based partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC). Moreover, we formulated a fractional-order model with fractional control to assess the effectiveness of different interventions, such as reducing the recruitment rate of mosquito breeding, controlling adult vectors, and providing individual protection. Also, we established the existence of a solution for the fractional-order optimal control problem. Finally, the numerical experiment illustrates that policymakers should place importance on the fractional-order transmission and recovery parameters that capture the underlying mechanisms of disease, along with reducing the spread of dengue cases, carried out through the implementation of adult vector control.},

  abstract     = {A priori estimates and the nonexistence of nonconstant positive steady-state solutions of a charge transfer model are established. Steady-state and Hopf bifurcations are carried out in detail, especially under the degenerate conditions such as invalid simple eigenvalue condition or crossing condition. It is shown that the steady-state solutions under the violated simple eigenvalue are characterized by a coupling of two eigenfunctions, and the bifurcation direction from simple eigenvalue is supercritical or subcritical. Meanwhile, there is no nonconstant steady-state solution under the degenerate case of violated crossing condition. In addition, whether the transversality condition in Hopf bifurcation is true or not, instead of the center manifold theory, we apply the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction method and the singularity theory to illustrate the existence and stability of periodic solutions as well as the bifurcation diagrams. But it is proved that the usual pitchfork Hopf bifurcation is changed to the transcritical bifurcation through the invalid transversality condition. Finally, some numerical simulations allow us to identify the influence of external current on the predicted dynamics. The novel results on the effect of degeneracy obtained in this paper shall complement classical theories and enrich numerical examples in the existing work.},

By employing the vector fields obtained from the optimal system, we efficiently transform the governing model into a collection of ordinary differential equations.

According to the credit period provided by the supplier to retailer, three distinct scenarios may arise among which are discussed in detail. The corresponding optimization problems are solved with the help of three tournament-based hybrid algorithms (tournament differential evolution [TDE], tournament teaching learning-based optimization [TTLBO], and tournament RAO-3 algorithms).

The model, represented by a system of ordinary differential equations, captures the complex interaction between the host's immune response and viral infection. The study focuses on the model's fundamental aspects, such as equilibrium analysis, computing the basic reproduction number ℛ 0 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0 $$ , stability analysis, bifurcation phenomena, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis reveals both an infection equilibrium, which indicates the persistence of the illness, and an infection-free equilibrium, which represents disease control possibilities. Applying matrix-theoretical approaches, stability analysis proved that the infection-free equilibrium is both locally and globally stable for ℛ 0 < 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;lt;1 $$ . For the situation of ℛ 0 > 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;gt;1 $$ , the infection equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable via the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. We also studied the uniform persistence of the infection, demonstrating that the infection remains present above a positive threshold under certain conditions. The study also found a transcritical forward-type bifurcation at ℛ 0 = 1 $$ {\mathcal{R}}_0&amp;amp;#x0003D;1 $$ , indicating a critical threshold that affects the system's behavior.

  abstract     = {Software has been increasingly important in many critical systems. To measure the growth of software reliability during testing phases, several software reliability growth models (SRGMs) have been investigated. Different from hardwares, softwares' failure mechanisms follow the basic rules of logic, behavior, and psychology rather than physical laws. Consequently, software testing phase embodies lots of epistemic uncertainties, which are not suitable to be modeled by probability theory-based SRGMs. In addition, fuzzy theory-based SRGMs may give counterintuitive results. Confronted with these, we proposed a software belief reliability growth model (SBRGM) under the framework of uncertainty theory which is a new mathematics system to deal with epistemic uncertainties. However, testing coverage, a key factor in software testing, has not been considered in SBRGM. Therefore, a novel SBRGM considering testing coverage, named SBRGM with testing coverage (TCSBRGM), is proposed in this paper. Based on belief reliability theory, several essential belief reliability indexes for software such as belief reliability and belief reliable time are considered. Unknown parameters in the proposed TCSBRGM are estimated. Finally, real data analysis using two real-world software testing data is carried out to compare the performance of our proposed model with some representative SRGMs. The results exhibit that the proposed model gives a better fitting and predictive performance.},

Three SIR type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6, and 10 unknown parameters, respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The models are validated using the epidemic data found. Finally, it was confirmed that the basic reproductive ratio is consistent with those previously reported in the literature. We conclude that the proposed optimization method improves computation time with respect to a genetic algorithm or an exhaustive search in the parameter space.},

  abstract     = {In nature, there is no ideal impulse response system. When the input is switched, the output cannot respond to this input instantaneously, which needs some time. This causes a transient oscillation process, which will inevitably affect the control accuracy, produce noise, and even cause fatigue damage. The usually adopted integer mathematical model is an ideal impulse response model and has no memory property. The fractional model has memory property, but the historical information before the switching time is usually lost. The transient oscillation process caused by intermittent control has rarely been reported in the obtained achievements with both the integer model and the fractional model. In this paper, based on the input-output property of a system, we have studied this transient oscillation. First, the impulsive response is approximated as a short memory model according to its decaying property. Second, the intermittent signal is treated as a piece-wise continuous signal to study. The study indicates that the transient oscillation is inevitable. This transient process is affected by the historical information within the memory length, and its duration is equal to the memory length. Different systems have different memory lengths. To optimize the transient oscillation process, we have to study the intermittent control approaches for different systems case by case. These do well with the engineering applications of intermittent control. Some numerical examples verify our theoretical analysis.},

Unlike the traditional approach, which replaces the Fourier kernel with the LCT kernel, this method employs convolution to capture the linear canonical spectrum over limited temporal intervals, constrained by a window function. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also holds significant potential for applications in various scientific and engineering fields. We begin our investigation by examining fundamental properties of the proposed transform, such as the orthogonality relation, inversion formula, and characterization of the range, using tools from LCT and convolution theory. Further, we explore the time-frequency resolution and the uncertainty principles associated with the proposed transform. Additionally, we present several potential applications, including the Poisson summation formula, Paley-Wiener criterion, and a sampling formula. To support our theoretical findings, clear examples are provided throughout the paper.},

Given the mapping between traversal trees and cuts in a graph, we propose to deal with the problem from a new perspective, namely, cut enumeration. The algorithm enumerates the cuts using the depth-first traversal tree, locates the optimal tree per node with the smallest local cut, and compacts them for acceleration. Any node pair can be separated by compacted trees containing only one of them. Its serial implementation is validated to be effective in obtaining the accurate solution for 99.9% or more pairs of vertices in a graph. Its calculation time per pair is as low as a thousandth of that of the most efficient existing method, that is, several microseconds in a graph with tens of millions of edges using an off-shelf computing node, thus serving as an effective heuristic for min-cut approximation.},

Currently, it poses a significant health challenge in various regions, and there is concern that it may evolve into a more severe global threat. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach to modeling an influenza outbreak. The study begins by formulating a mathematical representation that incorporates random fluctuations influencing the disease's progression. We demonstrate that the proposed model guarantees a positive global solution. By utilizing Lyapunov functionals, we investigate specific parametric conditions under which the disease may be eliminated from the population. Additionally, an ergodic stationary distribution is used to demonstrate conditions under which the infection may persist. A threshold quantity is identified, offering insight into key parameters that influence other dynamic aspects of the model. The stochastic model of influenza is further examined through graphical representation for better understanding.},

Furthermore, this model ignores depreciation, inflation, fluctuating market prices, and market saturation. With these assumptions, the question of when the company can afford to scale and purchase the next unit is directly related to the payback period and the harmonic number. This work describes a novel growth function called the harmonic growth function based on harmonic numbers. This function is related to the standard ROI. The harmonic growth function is explained and applied to a micro combined heat and power (mCHP) station, a biomass company expanding the number of biorefineries, and biochar retort kilns for biochar production.},

  abstract     = {Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major public health concern worldwide, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality. Managing co-infection between HIV and HBV presents additional challenges in clinical treatment and patient outcomes. In this article, we developed a comprehensive co-infection model to explore the complex transmission dynamics between HIV and HBV in the United States. Our model incorporates crucial factors such as infection through birth or migration, HBV vaccination, and the possibility of reinfection following HBV recovery. Our mathematical analysis started with the analysis of the two non-co-infection submodels, that is, for HIV-only and HBV-only models. We derived the basic reproduction number for each submodel and appliedthe Routh-Hurwitz criterion to assess the local stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium points. Our investigation revealed that the HIV-only submodel is globally asymptotically stable when its basic reproduction number remains below one. Conversely, the HBV-only submodel exhibits a backward bifurcation, meaning that both disease-free and endemic equilibrium states can coexist even when the reproduction number falls below one. This phenomenon complicates HBV control strategies under such conditions. However, in the absence of reinfection, the HBV-only model reaches global stability at the disease-free equilibrium whenever its reproduction number is below one. Using center manifold theory, we further demonstrated that the full HIV-HBV co-infection model also undergoes backward bifurcation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the basic reproduction numbers of HIV and HBV to identify critical parameters influencing the transmission dynamics of both infections. Our results indicate a positive correlation between the spread of one infection and the prevalence of the other. Additionally, we validated the model by fitting it to annual cumulative data on new HIV cases and reported acute HBV infections in the United States. Numerical simulations suggest that increasing condom use adherence, enhancing treatment coverage for both infections, and boosting HBV vaccination rates can substantially reduce the prevalence of HIV, HBV, and their co-infection.},

While effectively identifying regularly shaped clusters (e.g., ellipsoidal or spherical) within regular domains, traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with irregular cluster shapes, heterogeneous densities, noisy inter-cluster boundaries, and datasets spread across complex spatial domains. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Density and Triangulation-based Clustering (DTC) framework, designed to excel in these complex scenarios through three key innovations: (1) density-based separation using an advanced density estimation method tailored for complex domains, (2) Delaunay triangulation-based spatial clustering, effectively managing nonlinear geometries and resolving adjacency issues, and (3) noise mitigation through proximity analysis leveraging nearest neighbors. The DTC framework uniquely integrates graph-based methods with robust density estimation methods, enabling it to handle cases where traditional algorithms fail. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate its superior capability to identify nested and contiguous clusters with heterogeneous densities, even in the presence of noise and over complex domains. These findings underscore the practical applicability and versatility of DTC in extracting meaningful insights from challenging datasets.},

This method is neither as dependent on all data as cross-validation nor as computationally intensive as existing online selection methods.

  abstract     = {The study of compositional microbiome data is critical for exploring the functional roles of microbial communities in human health and disease. Recent advances have shifted from traditional log-ratio transformations of compositional covariates to zero constraint on the sum of the corresponding coefficients. Various approaches, including penalized regression and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, have been extended to enforce this sum-to-zero constraint. However, these methods exhibit limitations: penalized regression yields only point estimates, limiting uncertainty assessment, while MCMC methods, although reliable, are computationally intensive, particularly in high-dimensional data settings. To address the challenges posed by existing methods, we proposed Bayesian generalized linear models for analyzing compositional and sub-compositional microbiome data. Our model employs a spike-and-slab double-exponential prior on the microbiome coefficients, inducing weak shrinkage on large coefficients and strong shrinkage on irrelevant ones, making it ideal for high-dimensional microbiome data. The sum-to-zero constraint is handled through soft-centers by applying prior distribution on the sum of compositional or subcompositional coefficients. To alleviate computational intensity, we have developed a fast and stable algorithm incorporating expectation–maximization (EM) steps into the routine iteratively weighted least squares (IWLS) algorithm for fitting GLMs. The performance of the proposed method was assessed by extensive simulation studies. The simulation results show that our approach outperforms existing methods with higher accuracy of coefficient estimates and lower prediction error. We also applied the proposed method to one microbiome study to find microorganisms linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The methods have been implemented in a freely available R package BhGLM https://github.com/nyiuab/BhGLM .},

  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of dementia in the elderly, and investigations on the impact of risk factors on neurocognitive performance are crucial in preventative treatment. While existing statistical regression models, such as single-index models, have proven effective tools for uncovering the relationship between the neurocognitive scores and covariates of interest such as demographic information, clinical variables, and neuroimaging features, limited research has explored scenarios where jump discontinuities exist in the regression patterns and the covariates are unobservable but measured with errors, which are common in real applications. To address these challenges, we propose a single-index measurement error jump regression model (SMEJRM) that can handle both jump discontinuities and measurement errors in image covariates introduced by different image processing software. This development is motivated by data from 168 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We establish both the estimation procedure and the corresponding asymptotic results. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of our SMEJRM and the estimation procedure. The real application reveals that jump discontinuities do exist in the relationship between neurocognitive scores and some covariates of interest in this study.},

  abstract     = {Healthy foods are essential for a healthy life, but accessing healthy food can be more challenging for some people than others. This disparity in food access may lead to disparities in well-being, potentially with disproportionate rates of diseases in communities that face more challenges in accessing healthy food (i.e., low-access communities). Identifying low-access, high-risk communities for targeted interventions is a public health priority, but current methods to quantify food access rely on distance measures that are either computationally simple (like the length of the shortest straight-line route) or accurate (like the length of the shortest map-based driving route), but not both. We propose a multiple imputation approach to combine these distance measures, allowing researchers to harness the computational ease of one with the accuracy of the other. The approach incorporates straight-line distances for all neighborhoods and map-based distances for just a subset, offering comparable estimates to the “gold standard” model using map-based distances for all neighborhoods and improved efficiency over the “complete case” model using map-based distances for just the subset. Through the adoption of a measurement error framework, information from the straight-line distances can be leveraged to compute informative placeholders (i.e., impute) for any neighborhoods without map-based distances. Using simulations and data for the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina, we quantify and compare the associations between two health outcomes (diabetes and obesity) and neighborhood-level access to healthy foods. The imputation procedure also makes it possible to predict the full landscape of food access in an area without requiring map-based measurements for all neighborhoods.},

  abstract     = {We are interested in the relationship between the large values of a real random variable and its associated multidimensional covariate, in the context where the conditional distribution is heavy-tailed. Estimating the positive conditional tail index of a heavy-tailed conditional distribution is a crucial step for statistical inference, but the task becomes increasingly challenging as the covariate dimension increases. In this work, we assume the existence of a lower-dimensional linear subspace such that the conditional tail index depends on the covariate only through its projection onto this subspace. We propose a method to estimate this dimension reduction subspace and establish its consistency. Additionally, we introduce an estimator of the conditional tail index that leverages this dimension reduction and prove its consistency. We illustrate the benefits of this dimension reduction approach for estimating the conditional tail index through simulations and an application to real-world data.},

However, existing Fréchet regression literature focuses on the classical setting where the predictor dimension is fixed, and the sample size goes to infinity. This paper proposes sparse Fréchet sufficient dimension reduction with graphical structure among high-dimensional Euclidean predictors. In particular, we propose a convex optimization problem that leverages the graphical information among predictors and avoids inverting the high-dimensional covariance matrix. We also provide the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Theoretically, the proposed method achieves subspace estimation and variable selection consistency under suitable conditions. Extensive simulations and a real data analysis are carried out to illustrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Equality-constrained models naturally arise in problems in which the measurements are taken at different levels of resolution. The challenge in this setting is that the models usually induce a joint distribution which is intractable. Resorting to instead sampling from the joint distribution by means of a Monte Carlo approach is also challenging. For example, a naive rejection sampler does not work when the probability mass of the constraint is zero. A typical example of such constrained problems is to learn energy consumption for a higher resolution level based on data at a lower resolution, for example, to decompose a daily reading into readings at a finer level. We introduce a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm based on Langevin diffusions and rejection sampling to solve the problem of sampling from equality-constrained models. Our method has the advantage of being exact for linear constraints and naturally deals with multimodal distributions on arbitrary constraints. We test our method on statistical disaggregation problems for electricity consumption datasets, and our approach provides better uncertainty estimation and accuracy in data imputation compared with other naive/unconstrained methods.},

The proposed statistics enable testing of relevant hypotheses in one-sample, two-sample, and single or multiple change points problems, and exhibit oracle efficiency, meaning that developed procedures are asymptotically indistinguishable from those with true trajectories.

The adjustment minimizes the Wasserstein distance to a null-approximating continuous distribution, tackling some fundamental challenges inherent in combining statistical significances derived from discrete distributions. The related theory justifies Lancaster's mid-p and mean-value chi-squared statistics for Fisher's combination as special cases. To counter the conservative nature of Lancaster's testing procedures, we propose an updated null-approximating distribution. It is achieved by further minimizing the Wasserstein distance to the adjusted statistics within an appropriate distribution family. Specifically, in the context of Fisher's combination, we propose an optimal gamma distribution as a substitute for the traditionally used chi-squared distribution. This new approach yields an asymptotically consistent test that significantly improves Type I error control and enhances statistical power.},

These designs exhibit attractive low-dimensional stratification properties and perform well in terms of column correlation. Additionally, the size of each design can be flexibly chosen based on the trade-off between the experimental budget and estimation accuracy. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design method exhibits significant superiority in terms of design metrics and estimation accuracy.

  abstract     = {Factor models are indispensable tools in economics and finance, providing valuable insights into the latent structures underlying complex datasets. Nevertheless, the prevalence of heavy-tailed macroeconomic and financial data, often characterized by extreme values and greater skewness than that found in a normal distribution, presents significant analytical challenges. This article introduces mode-adaptive factor models (MAFM) for robust factor analysis in high-dimensional panel data, inspired by the equivalence between conventional principal component analysis and the constrained least squares method in factor models. Unlike traditional factor models that concentrate on mean estimation, MAFM leverage the mode to capture central tendencies more effectively, particularly in the presence of skewed and heavy-tailed distributions. To facilitate MAFM for factor analysis, we develop an iterative mode regression algorithm that integrates the expectation-maximization procedure, ensuring convergence to a stationary solution. We establish the theoretical properties of the MAFM estimators without imposing moment constraints on idiosyncratic errors and propose a mode information criterion for consistent factor number selection. We also suggest a data-dependent bandwidth selection procedure to enhance the flexibility of MAFM. The simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of MAFM across diverse distributional settings. An empirical application to macroeconomic forecasting further highlights the practical advantages of MAFM, showcasing their robustness and efficacy in real-world analyses.},

Its stochastic properties, including stationarity and geometric ergodicity, are studied. Particular attention is given to a generalization of the INAR( p ) model which parallels the extension of the INARCH( p ) to the INGARCH( p , q ) model. For inference, we consider maximum likelihood, Gaussian quasi-likelihood, and moment-based approaches, along with likelihood ratio tests to distinguish between selected instances of our class. Models from the proposed class have a natural interpretation as stochastic epidemic processes, which throughout the article is used to illustrate our arguments.

The functional θ measures a location or stochastic tendency effect between two distributions. A limitation of is its inability to capture scale differences. If differences of this nature are to be detected, specific tests for scale or omnibus tests need to be employed. However, the latter often suffer from low power, and they do not yield interpretable effect measures. In this article, we extend by additionally incorporating the recently introduced distribution overlap index (nonparametric dispersion measure) that can be expressed in terms of the quantile process. We derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the respective estimators of and and construct confidence regions. Extending the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, we introduce a new test based on the joint use of these functionals. It results in much larger consistency regions while maintaining competitive power to the rank sum test for situations in which alone would suffice. Compared with classical omnibus tests, the simulated power is much improved. Additionally, the newly proposed inference method yields effect measures whose interpretation is surprisingly straightforward.},

Key to the accuracy of this estimate is the choice of bandwidth. Too large or small a bandwidth can lead to features in the intensity being lost or to the introduction of artefacts. There are many available methods of bandwidth selection for spatial point patterns, but no consensus on the best option. Popular methods and software default options lead to very different intensity estimates and contrasting conclusions about the data that can be difficult to reconcile. In response, we propose new bandwidth selectors with more stable and consistent performance. These are adapted from popular plug-in and cross-validation techniques developed for general multivariate density estimation. The theoretical and practical performance of these proposed methods is explored and compared with other available methods in both simulated and real-data scenarios. We find that our proposed methods perform consistently well across a range of different intensity patterns.

Breaking down silos between law, social sciences, and natural sciences is critical for all processes of disaster risk reduction. It is essential to explore how AI enhances understanding of legal frameworks and environmental management, while also examining how legal and environmental factors may limit AI's role in society. From a co-production review perspective, drawing on insights from lawyers, social scientists, and environmental scientists, principles for responsible data mining are proposed based on safety, transparency, fairness, accountability, and contestability. This discussion offers a blueprint for interdisciplinary collaboration to create adaptive law systems based on AI integration of knowledge from environmental and social sciences. When social networks are useful for mitigating disaster risks based on AI, the legal implications related to privacy and liability of the outcomes of disaster management must be considered. Fair and accountable principles emphasize environmental considerations and foster socioeconomic discussions related to public engagement. AI also has an important role to play in education, bringing together the next generations of law, social sciences, and natural sciences to work on interdisciplinary solutions in harmony. Although emerging AI approaches can be powerful tools for disaster management, they must be implemented with ethical considerations and safeguards to address concerns about bias, transparency, and privacy.
