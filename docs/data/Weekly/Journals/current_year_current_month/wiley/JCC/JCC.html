  abstract     = {Ab initio and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to investigate LiH:nNH 3 ( n = 1–4) cluster complexes. The nature of the interactions is analyzed using molecular electrostatic potential maps, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, delocalization indices, and electron density difference maps. In the presence of LiH, NH 3 molecules engage in several types of noncovalent interactions, namely, hydrogen bonding (HB), lithium bonding (LB), and dihydrogen bonding (DHB). The LiH:NH 3 dimer is stabilized primarily through Li···N interactions. The role of these noncovalent interactions in complexes having more than one NH 3 molecule, for example, hetero-trimer, tetramer, and pentamer structures, is also examined. Increasing the number of NH 3 molecules enhances the number of HB sites. Additionally, the strengths of LB and DHB interactions associated with HB-bonded NH 3 molecules increase. Interaction energy estimates and many-body energy decomposition analysis suggest that increasing NH 3 molecules increases cooperativity, approaching ~10% of the total interaction's energy in the case of tetramers and pentamers.},

  abstract     = {Residue interaction networks determine various characteristics of proteins, such as the folding rate, thermostability, and allosteric process. The interactions between residues can be described by distances or energies. The former is simple but less rigorous. The latter is complicated but more precise, especially when considering the solvent effect. In this work, we apply an existing energy decomposition method based on the Poisson–Boltzmann equation solver. The calculation is especially accelerated on GPU for higher performance. In four formal applications, the constructed interaction energy (IE) network shows good results. First, it is found that the protein folding rate has a stronger correlation with the energy-based contact order than the distance-based contact order. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is 0.839 versus 0.784 on a dataset of non-two-state proteins. Second, we find that most thermophilic proteins have lower IEs than mesophilic proteins. The IE in solvent acts as an indicator to evaluate the thermostabilities of proteins. Third, we use the IE network to predict the key residues in the formation of the insulin dimer. Most key residues are in agreement with the findings in previous alanine-scanning experiments. Lastly, we propose a novel method (called APFN) to predict the allosteric pathway based on the IE network. The method gives the same allosteric pathway for CheY protein as in previous nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments. On the whole, the IE network in the solvent has been demonstrated to be reliable in describing the characteristics embedded in protein structures.},

  abstract     = {The carbon and oxygen atoms of tetrahydropyran form the common substructure of pyranose monosaccharides in vertebrate glycans. This substructure can assume various ring puckering chair and skew-boat conformations, and can thereby impact glycan conformations relevant for biomolecular structure and signaling. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) provides a wealth of experimental glycan structural biology data that can be useful in the development and validation of molecular mechanics force fields for these molecules. However, these experimental data are typically from solvent-depleted crystalline environments at very low temperatures, in contrast to biological conditions that are aqueous and near ambient temperature, which is the regime targeted by biomolecular force fields. To determine if these PDB X-ray crystal data can be of utility as references for carbohydrate force fields, we compared ring puckering conformations from these experimental data to both vacuum and explicit aqueous solvent puckering free energy data from extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) molecular dynamics simulations using the previously validated CHARMM36 force field. We found that, for monosaccharides that are not charged (glucose, N -acetylglucosamine, galactose, N -acetylgalactosamine, mannose, xylose, and fucose), both the vacuum and aqueous simulation puckering preferences strongly correlate with PDB data, and therefore with each other. In contrast, all charged monosaccharides that were considered (the conjugate bases of N -acetylneuraminic acid, glucuronic acid, and iduronic acid) had puckering preferences correlating with PDB data only in aqueous simulations and not in vacuum simulations. These results suggest that comparing puckering preferences from aqueous simulations to PDB X-ray crystal puckering conformation data can be a valid and useful component of carbohydrate force field development and validation.},

  abstract     = {Molecular properties in combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations have been shown to be dependent on the size of the quantum mechanical (QM) region and the amount of conformational sampling. Previous studies have largely focused on enzymatic systems, which have made it difficult to distinguish the effects of QM region size and conformational sampling from other factors including QM-MM boundary artifacts and the boundary effects. This study uses the difference-based adaptive solvation QM/MM method to investigate the tautomerization reactions of alanine and aspartate in explicit solvent. The choice of computationally tractable systems enables the decoupling of QM region size effects from other factors and a direct comparison of free energy surfaces with potential energy surfaces (PESs). The results show that (1) it is crucial to properly account for thermal fluctuations along the reaction pathways, and (2) free energy surfaces converge rapidly with increasing QM region size, whereas charge transfer requires a slightly larger QM region to achieve convergence. These findings are expected to guide future studies of enzymatic systems and other complex systems where QM/MM methods are applied.},

  abstract     = {Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is an integral membrane protein that uses acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) and diacylglycerol (DAG) to catalyze the formation of triacylglycerides (TAGs). The acyl transfer reaction occurs between the activated carboxylate group of the fatty acid and the free hydroxyl group on the glycerol backbone of DAG. However, how the two substrates enter DGAT1's catalytic reaction chamber and interact with DGAT1 remains elusive. This study aims to explore the structural basis of DGAT1's substrate recognition by investigating each substrate's pathway to the reaction chamber. Using a human DGAT1 cryo-EM structure in complex with an oleoyl-CoA substrate, we designed two different all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation systems: DGAT1 away (both acyl-CoA and DAG away from the reaction chamber) and DGAT1 bound (acyl-CoA bound in and DAG away from the reaction chamber). Our DGAT1 away simulations reveal that acyl-CoA approaches the reaction chamber via interactions with positively charged residues in transmembrane helix 7. DGAT1 bound simulations show DAGs entering into the reaction chamber from the cytosol leaflet. The bound acyl-CoA's fatty acid lines up with the headgroup of DAG, which appears to be competent to TAG formation. We then converted them into TAG and coenzyme (CoA) and used adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations to explore the egress pathways of the products. We identify their escape routes, which are aligned with their respective entry pathways. Visualization of the substrate and product pathways and their interactions with DGAT1 is expected to guide future experimental design to better understand DGAT1 structure and function.},
