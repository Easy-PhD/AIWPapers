  abstract     = {Degradable polymers hold promise for their recyclability and their potential to facilitate the transition toward a circular economy of plastics. As such, a consecutive di-SN2 reaction between dithiols and polyhalogenated compounds was used to produce degradable polymers with tunable amounts of redox-enabled dithioacetal and disulfide linkages. The reaction employed bases of varying strengths and different thiol types, allowing for control over molecular weights ranging from <1 kDa to 16 kDa, with tunable degrees of polymerization ranging from 3 to over 75. The ratio of dithioacetals to disulfides was adjusted by manipulating the concentration of the methylene source, enabling the formation of polymers with up to 100% disulfide linkages or up to 93% dithioacetal linkages. This tunability resulted in polymers with multiple redox degradation pathways, capable of being degraded by either reduction or oxidation. Vinyl ether functionalized, telechelic oligomers were used as crosslinkers in network formation, yielding materials with multiple degradation pathways. This di-SN2 approach provides a promising and straightforward method for creating materials with tailored degradation characteristics.},

  abstract     = {One-step purification of ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) from the ternary mixtures of acetylene/carbon dioxide/ethylene (C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 ) is a critical industrial challenge due to their similar physical and chemical properties. Herein, we reported a cage engineering strategy in anion-pillared metal-organic frameworks (APMOFs) for efficient C 2 H 2 and CO 2 capture simultaneously. Specifically, two stable ZrF 6 2− anion-pillared cage-type MOFs (ZNU-17 and ZNU-27) are prepared with both ultramicroporous (∼4 Å) and microporous (>7 Å) cages but featuring different shapes. While ZNU-17 allows the efficient binary C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 separation, ZNU-27 enables the benchmark ternary C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 separation by increasing the adsorption affinity toward CO 2 . Notably, remarkably increased C 2 H 2 (170.1 cm 3 g −1 versus 120.1 cm 3 g −1 ) and CO 2 (91.8 cm 3 g −1 versus 64.5 cm 3 g −1 ) adsorption capacities are achieved in ZNU-27, and the IAST selectivity of ZNU-27 for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 is 4.3 times as high as that of ZNU-17 (6.5 versus 1.5). The C 2 H 2 , CO 2 and C 2 H 4 binding sites in ZNU-27 are studied by gas loaded in situ single crystal structure and density functional theory (DFT) calculation, which revealed that the unique fluorinated 8.5 Å spherical cages provide strong hydrogen binding or electrostatic interactions for C 2 H 2 and CO 2 . Dynamic breakthrough tests show that from a C 2 H 2 /CO 2 /C 2 H 4 (1/9/90) mixture, polymer-grade C 2 H 4 (≥99.99%) can be obtained in ZNU-27 with a high productivity of 12.04 mol kg −1 .},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a sustainable platform in constructing C─N bonds for amino acid production. Glycine, a particularly valuable target compound, continues to experience escalating global demand, yet achieving simultaneous high efficiency and operational stability remains a persistent challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a CO 2 -mediated strategy for glycine electrosynthesis using oxalic acid and N 2 /nitrate as feedstocks. By using Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 -CO 2 catalytic system, a very high glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.8% with durable stability over 120 h could be achieved. Moreover, when using nonthermal plasma-activated N 2 as the nitrogen source, the glycine production rate could maintain at 94.4 µmol h −1 cm −2 with N-selectivity as high as 93.2%. Mechanistic investigations combining experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that CO 2 undergoes facile protonation on the Pb/Pb 7 Bi 3 heterointerfaces to form * OCOH intermediate, which donates hydrogen for the reduction of oxalic acid and nitrate into glyoxylic acid and NH 2 OH, respectively, while CO 2 is simultaneously regenerated. Notably, hydrogenation via the * OCOH intermediate significantly lowers the energy barriers compared to direct protonation, thereby promoting the subsequent spontaneous C─N bond formation and enabling highly efficient electrosynthesis of glycine.},

  abstract     = {Scheelite-type oxides have been extensively investigated in diverse inorganic systems due to their exceptional structural versatility and promising multifunctional properties, ranging from luminescence to ionic conduction. However, despite decades of research, borates have remained conspicuously absent from this important structural family. This exclusion stems from a fundamental synthetic and structure chemistry challenge: the difficulty in achieving the essential zero-dimensional anionic framework composed of isolated tetrahedral units, a defining characteristic of scheelite-type materials. In this work, we break this long-standing barrier by reporting the first successful isolation of [BO 2 F 2 ] tetrahedra in a crystalline solid. This breakthrough was enabled by employing Sb's stereochemically active lone pair electrons to stabilize these discrete [BO 2 F 2 ] units, ultimately leading to the discovery of SbBO 2 F 2 —the first borate compound adopting a scheelite-type structure. Through a combination of single-crystal X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic techniques, and first-principles calculations, we unequivocally confirm the scheelite-type framework of SbBO 2 F 2 and demonstrate its remarkable multifunctional properties, including anisotropic thermal expansion, ionic conductivity, and large birefringence. This work not only expands the structural chemistry of scheelite-type oxides with borates but also opens new avenues for designing multifunctional materials through targeted anionic group isolation.},

  abstract     = {β-Amino acids are essential building blocks in bioactive molecules, offering unique properties and potential in peptide and drug synthesis. Among them, β 2,2,3 -amino acids—characterized by a contiguous quaternary and tertiary stereocenter—represent a structurally unique subclass with promising biological potential. However, their broader application has been hampered by the scarcity of general and efficient synthetic methods. To address these challenges, we have developed a visible-light-driven radical-radical coupling strategy enabled by chiral phosphoric acid (CPA) catalysis. In this synergistic dual catalytic system, β-keto esters are activated by CPA and undergo single-electron oxidation to generate tertiary carbon radicals, while redox-active NHPI esters derived from α-amino acids are reduced via SET to form α-amino alkyl radicals. Under the chiral environment provided by CPA, these radicals engage in highly selective cross-coupling to afford β 2,2,3 -amino esters in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivity. This strategy provides a mild, modular approach for the stereo-controlled assembly of structurally complex β 2,2,3 -amino esters, overcoming long-standing limitations in substrate scope and reaction efficiency.

  abstract     = {Bulk water serves as an inert environment for lignin linkages, resulting in their natural half-lives that extend over centuries. In this study, we present the striking results of the spontaneous and ultrafast C─O/C─C bond cleavage of various lignin models in water microdroplets, yielding value-added aromatic chemicals. The β-O-4 linkages, the most abundant interunit linkages in natural lignin, were selectively cleaved at C β ─O bonds, producing phenols in yields exceeding 70%. Mechanistic studies elucidated that the cleavage of β-O-4 linkages is derived from the unique alkaline environment at the air–water interface of a negatively charged water microdroplet, even in the absence of extra alkalis. The challenging cleavage of the highly stable C α ─C β bonds in β-O-4 and β-1 lignin linkages was also accomplished, yielding valuable benzoic acid product. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the oxidation of the substrates by molecular oxygen is the key step for the C α ─C β bond cleavage. Notably, all intermediates, including the fragile peroxide intermediates, were identified using mass spectrometry. Accompanied by evidence from radical scavenging and 18 O labeling, the mechanisms for the selective C─O/C─C bond cleavages have been unambiguously characterized, paving a new and green way for the cleavage of lignin linkages.},

  abstract     = {Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are Cu-containing enzymes that play a crucial role in lignocellulosic biomass degradation for use in biofuel production. These enzymes carry out the selective oxidation of C─H bonds in the sugar units, leading to the cleavage of the glycosidic bond. Creating LPMO mimics facilitates the study of the mechanism of action, the characterisation of the reactive species responsible for the C─H bond activation and the potential scale up for industrial application. Here, we report the design, structural and functional characterisation of two novel Cu-binding β-hairpin peptides, called HisPins, that mimic the Histidine-brace site of LPMOs. Activity assays were conducted with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (PNPG) and demonstrate that the Cu-HisPins show LPMO-like activity on the model substrate. Furthermore, the Cu-HisPins can also perform light-driven oxidation of phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC) in the presence of melanin, similarly to some LPMO enzymes. Hence, the Cu-HisPins represent the first structural and functional LPMO mimics based on short, folded peptide sequences and show a light-stimulated melanin-mediated oxidative activity, which is unreported for any LPMO mimic characterised so far. Thus, this work paves the way to further exploration of LPMO mechanism, structure-activity relationship and substrate scope expansion.},

  abstract     = {Superstructures assembled from nanoscale polyoxometalates (POMs) attract considerable interest due to their well-defined architectures and outstanding physicochemical properties. However, the targeted synthesis of self-assembled POM-based superstructures with high-efficiency electrocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and construction of three POM-based superstructures with ultrathin graphene-like morphologies and well-organized frameworks via a simple self-assembled method, in which transition metals (TMs) bridge POMs into graphene-like planes, while cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) serves as an intercalation agent, endowing the structures with high surface area and enhanced electronic conductivity. Among the resulting materials (denote as POM-CTAB-TM, TM═Co, Ni, or Cu), POM-CTAB-Co exhibits the highest catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving a low overpotential of 292 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 . In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations underscore that the Co atoms within the POM serve as active sites and facilitate the rate-determining step of *OOH formation. Moreover, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer employing POM-CTAB-Co as the anode and Pt/C as the cathode demonstrates exceptional performance, delivering a current density of 2 A cm −2 at a cell voltage of 2.247 V, along with remarkable durability exceeding 2000 h at an industrial-grade current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This study develops a simple and efficient method for synthesizing supramolecular POM-based nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical upcycling of organic pollutants in wastewater into value-added chemicals presents a dual solution for water treatment and sustainable synthesis, yet achieving high Faradaic and energy efficiencies remains challenging. Here we, for the first time, report the paired electrolysis strategy to produce valuable cyclohexanol and para -benzoquinone ( p -BQ) simultaneously from phenol in wastewater. More importantly, to address the dilemma of mismatched operation conditions between cathodic hydrogenation and anodic oxidation, we propose a pulse current strategy with alternating high-/low-current periods, which ensures the reduction kinetics of phenol at the cathode while effectively preventing the over-oxidation of generated p -BQ at the anode. By using tailored PdRu/C and NiRu/C as the cathode and anode, the paired pulse system realizes 84.9% phenol conversion and 83.9% cyclohexanol yield at the cathode, alongside 100% phenol conversion and 68.5% p -BQ yield at the anode, with an exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 114.5% and ultra-low energy consumption of 0.064 kWh mol −1 . Carbon emission accounting and techno-economic analysis highlight its environmental benefits and economic feasibility (US$1.36 profit per kg phenol).

However, constructing effective Na + diffusion channels in these materials is very challenging. To address this issue, we design a new organic molecule, N,N ’-bis(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenediimide (NDI-DTMA), containing a donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) structure. The D–A–D architecture significantly enhances π-conjugation extent of single organic material while narrowing its bandgap, facilitating electron transportation along the NDI-DTMA skeletons. Moreover, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl groups not only suppress dissolution issue but also enlarge the intermolecular planar spacing for Na + mobility through constructing efficient transport channels. As an electrode material for SIBs, NDI-DTMA achieves a reversible capacity of 200 mAh g −1 after 2000 cycles at 1 A g −1 owing to its fast Na + kinetics. Through systematic investigation on the anomalous capacity increase and the dynamic evolution of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), we have elucidated the fundamental mechanisms that the distinctive NDI-DTMA architecture enables exceptional energy storage performance. This work pioneers a design paradigm of organic small molecules that simultaneously address low solubility, high conductivity, and rapid ion transport, thereby providing a transformative strategy for SIBs.},

The method operates under continuous flow electrochemical conditions, avoiding the need for divided cells, strong chemical oxidants, or homogeneous transition-metal catalysts. The broad substrate scope includes a wide range of electron-rich, electron-deficient, and halogenated arenes, as well as heterocycles, demonstrating excellent functional group tolerance. Furthermore, the process is readily scalable, as shown by a 4-day continuous operation in parallel microreactors, producing over 100 grams of aniline product with high efficiency.

TUB41 demonstrates remarkable chemical stability across a wide pH range (1–11) and retains its structural integrity after 2 years of repeated adsorption cycles and activation at 80 °C under ambient humidity. Cryogenic adsorption experiments reveal that TUB41's pores selectively exclude gases with larger kinetic diameters, such as N 2 and Ar, while accommodating smaller molecules like CO 2 and H 2 O at elevated temperatures. The enthalpies of adsorption for CO 2 at a loading 0.01 mmol g −1 and H 2 O at a loading of 0.7 mmol g −1 are −41 and −38 kJ mol −1 , respectively, reflecting their strongly attractive interactions with TUB41 under different conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that CO 2 molecules adopt ordered arrangements in the central hydrophobic regions of the pores, guided by strong nonbonding interactions, while H 2 O molecules preferentially bind to the hydrophilic secondary building units. Mean-squared displacement analyses confirm that both gases remain spatially constrained within the pores. These findings highlight TUB41 as a chemically robust and highly selective MOF, with potential for applications in gas separation, photocatalytic water splitting, and CO 2 reduction under challenging conditions.},

However, limited by the large synthetic difficulties, functional biisoquinoline-containing polymers (BCPs) have rarely been reported. Furthermore, the construction of optically active BCPs via asymmetric catalytic polymerization have not been achieved so far. Herein, we developed a multicomponent cascade C─H activation/annulation polymerization (CAAP) strategy that can facilely convert readily available benzil derivatives, internal diynes, and ammonium acetate into structurally diverse BCPs via successive C─H activation and N -annulation processes in a one-pot and one-step operation. The rhodium-catalyzed CAAP reactions proceed efficiently under air, affording a variety of multisubstituted BCPs with high molecular weights ( M w up to 49900 g mol −1 ) in good yields. Benefiting from the unique structures, the resulting BCPs exhibit excellent solubility, good film-forming capability, and readily tunable luminescent properties. The luminescent thin films of a photosensitive BCP can be applied for the generation of multiscale fluorescent photopatterns with high resolution. Moreover, by using different chiral cyclopentadienyl rhodium catalysts, a series of optically active BCPs and BCP–metal complex with stable axially chiral configurations are in situ generated from the asymmetric CAAP reactions.},

Open-shell luminescent diradicals, featuring two unpaired and synthetically tunable spins, offer a molecular platform to achieve such control. However, previous studies have been restricted to symmetric systems, where spin interactions occur between two identical, luminescent radicals. Here, we demonstrate that a non-luminescent (dark) radical can effectively modulate the spin and photophysical behavior of a luminescent (bright) radical within an asymmetric diradical framework. The resulting molecule exhibits a unique three-stage magnetoluminescence (ML) response at low temperatures, arising from hyperfine coupling (HFC) ( B < 0.05 T), the Δg -induced spin mixing (0.05–0.8 T), and spin polarization (0.8–7 T). Notably, the system exhibits pronounced ML enhancement (>14%) under ultra-low magnetic fields ( B < 0.05 T), a previously unreported phenomenon in molecular spin-optical systems. These findings establish asymmetric bright–dark diradicals as a powerful new motif for spin-photon interface design, providing fresh insights into the fundamental photophysics of open-shell systems.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes with water at nearly industrial current densities is highly important. However, a low interfacial alkyne–water ratio leads to severe hydrogen evolution, making it extremely challenging to obtain alkenes with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE). Here, a strategy involving fluorine···π interaction-induced alkyne concentration and orderly arranged sulfonate-repelled interfacial water-cation is developed over commercial Nafion-modified palladium nanotips, enabling electrolysis of 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBE) with up to 83% FE under −100 mA cm −2 . The fluorine···π effect concentrates the alkyne via its adsorption enhancement, promotes electron transfer, and lowers the activation energy, thus accelerating hydrogenation kinetics. Under the bias potential, the side chain of Nafion undergoing rearrangement from disordered to nearly ordered significantly decreases the interfacial free water coverage and activity, thereby reducing the amount of in situ-generated surface-active hydrogen, which contributes to suppressing hydrogen evolution and improving the FE. An 82% FE and 18.9 mmol h −1 reaction rate of MBE is achieved in a 10 h continuous electrosynthesis at 1.25 A, demonstrating potential utility. Furthermore, the hydrogenation and deuteration of different alkynes with improved Faradaic efficiencies at −100 mA cm −2 rationalize the design concept.},

  abstract     = {Although solvatochromic materials provide visual function to differentiate solvents, they fail to precisely monitor complex solvent environments where solvent composition varies dynamically, because of an insensitive absorptional shift in these environments. Relatively, their fluorescence signal change, which should be more sensitive, has always been inefficient, resulting from inherent challenges in excited-state dynamics. Here, we present a charge-rearrangement averaged dye design, instead of traditional donor-acceptor structures, to enable a high locally excited or twisted intramolecular charge transfer emission efficiency. A ratiometric dual-fluorescence behavior can be observed along with a solvent-dependent emission trade-off rather than complete quenching. In this case, the dyes can not only precisely visualize various mixed solvents but also enable heterogeneous detection with over hundreds of reuse cycles after being integrated into a crosslinked polymer. The leading portable material achieves a self-calibrated visual tracking of ethanol content (error<0.2%) with a robust working curve ( R 2 = 0.9992) while applied to E10 ethanol gasoline, operable via user-friendly software analysis through mobile phone photography.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-bromine (Zn-Br 2 ) batteries have emerged as promising candidates for grid-scale energy storage due to their intrinsic safety and low cost. However, their practical deployment is hindered by the dissolution of polybromide species at the cathode and their subsequent shuttling and corrosive reactions at the zinc anode, which severely limit areal capacity and cycling stability. Herein, a Taiji-inspired dual-electrode stabilization strategy is developed to synergistically regulate interfacial chemistry at both electrodes, enabling durable high-areal-capacity Zn-Br 2 batteries. This design leverages the dynamic balance of opposing yet complementary electrostatic interactions, facilitating targeted attraction (Yin) and repulsion (Yang) of polybromides at cathode/anode interfaces, respectively. At the cathode, positively charged quaternary ammonium groups in poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) enable strong electrostatic binding to polybromides, effectively confining them within the cathode and preventing diffusion into the electrolyte. Simultaneously, a lotus-leaf-biomimetic interphase with high electronegativity and hydrophobicity is constructed on Zn anode to repel polybromides and suppress parasitic reactions. Theoretical calculations and in situ spectroscopic analyses confirm the effective suppression of polybromide shuttling and Zn corrosion. Consequently, the optimized KB-PDDA//Zn@ZnO-PFNA cell achieves a high areal capacity of 5.5 mAh cm −2 and exceptional cycling stability exceeding 20000 cycles, highlighting the critical importance of dual-interface engineering for advancing practical Zn-Br 2 battery technologies.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 R) offers a promising pathway to convert CO 2 into value-added products. While catalyst advances remain crucial, gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) architecture is equally vital in CO 2 electrolyzer design. Most ECO 2 R studies use pure CO 2 feeds, whereas industrial sources like flue gas contain ∼15% CO 2 , requiring costly purification. Eliminating this step demands electrolyzers that directly process impure streams via in situ separation. Here, we introduce a composite GDE (CGDE) featuring a thin CO 2 -selective interlayer of intrinsically microporous polymer (PIM-1) reinforced with the CO 2 -philic ionic liquid [Emim][BF 4 ]. This layer selectively adsorbs CO 2 and suppresses N 2 /O 2 existence at the catalyst interface. In simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 , 5% O 2 in N 2 ), the CGDE with 20 wt% [Emim][BF 4 ]/PIM-1 achieved >70% CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) at 100 mA cm − 2 , versus ∼20% FE for a pristine GDE. Multiphysics simulations confirmed effective CO 2 delivery through the selective layer, with minimal O 2 permeation. Cost estimation analysis indicates around 25% reduction in CO's minimum selling price using the integrated design and >50% under ideal performance metrics by eliminating compression/transport. These results demonstrate that advanced electrode design with CO 2 -selective interlayer enables direct mixed-gas ECO 2 R, establishes key design criteria for selective layers, and significantly improves process economics.},

We determined the SEC parameter | T xyz | to be 2.04(16) × 10 −10 m · V −1 , two orders of magnitude larger than the effective value directly extracted from comparing the signal intensity, as validated by our electric-field-modulated (EFM) continuous-wave EPR experiments and simulation program. The coherence time of this Ce(III) qubit is 24.1(13) µs at 5 K with dynamical decoupling and the electric control efficiency is approaching 0.1 Hz · m · V −1 .

However, there is a general concern on the dissolution of Cr 2 O 3 , calling for the development of environment-friendly metal oxides. Here, we employ phenylphosphonic acid (PPOA) as a model surface modifier to decorate the model Rh@CeO 2 cocatalysts and demonstrate the critical role of organic surface passivation in H 2 evolution catalysis. We identify a “surface passivation effect” in photocatalysis, wherein the PPOA modification on CeO 2 overlayers not only suppress the adsorption and activation of oxygen but exhibit strong resistance to hydrogen reduction during POWS. This dual functionality effectively suppresses the reverse reactions by blocking the redox cycle of exposed Rh sites and defective CeO 2 overlayers, resulting in significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability. Importantly, this strategy is not limited to Rh@CeO 2 -PPOA systems; it also improves POWS performance in systems where other reducible oxides-organophosphonic acids structure are used as passivation layers on other noble metal cocatalysts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the universal principles of surface passivation in photocatalysis and offer a practical framework for regulating the reverse reactions and provide guidance for optimizing POWS through targeted surface organic modification.},

  abstract     = {Electroplating technology is crucial for interfacial engineering due to its flexible controllability and excellent protective performance. However, electroplated coatings often exhibit uneven deposition morphology due to the uncontrollable nucleation and growth of metal grains, which results in degraded coating performance. Here, we propose ligand coordination equilibria (LCE) that creates a dense coating by simultaneously modulating the solvation structure and optimizing the reduction process, exemplified by Al/Zr alloy electroplating. Multiscale calculations revealed that Cl − coordination with AlCl 3 and ZrCl 4 forms a dynamic equilibrium between active ionic species Al 2 Cl 7 − and ZrCl 5 − , which is predominantly governed by AlCl 3 due to its stronger Lewis acidity. This coordination mechanism was directly validated by Raman spectroscopy. The dynamic equilibrium between Al 2 Cl 7 − , which dominates nucleation density and growth rate, and ZrCl 5 − , which increases the interfacial diffusion barrier, synergistically promotes the small-sized alloy grain. The resulting compact microstructure significantly enhanced the hardness (268 HV) and corrosion resistance (−0.78 V versus SCE) of the coating, far surpassing that of conventional aluminum alloys coatings. This work highlights the innovative use of LCE for interfacial engineering by tailoring the dynamic equilibrium of active ionic species, providing new insights for the industrial electroplating of high-performance alloys.},

However, the impact of high-entropy component compatibility on electrodes’ lattice stress and kinetics remains underexplored. Herein, a series of high-entropy PBAs are served as cathode materials for SIBs. The tailoring Na 2 Mn 0.2 Fe 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 [Fe(CN) 6 ] (HE-Cu) with superior mechanochemical compatibility shows superior phase stability without obvious lattice stress and faster electron/ion transfer kinetics.

Serious Jahn–Teller structural distortion and unstable octahedron, observed in Na 2 Mn[Fe(CN) 6 ] with complicated Na-ion storage phase evolution (monoclinic ↔ cubic ↔ tetragonal), can be entirely suppressed by high-entropy effect, appearing a zero-strain solid-solution reaction mechanism for HE-Cu employing Mn, Fe, and Co-ions as redox centers to involve in charge compensation. Consequently, HE-Cu presents high initial specific capacity of 120.4 mAh·g −1 , superior rate capability and outstanding cyclability with ultra-long cycling life of 9000 cycles with the lowest capacity-decay-rate of 0.0042% per cycle.

Here, we introduce a pioneering slurry-based strategy leveraging Hofmeister “salting-in” effect to disperse binders in a poor-solvent environment, dramatically expanding the applicable binder spectrum. The copolymer poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) (PVTC) was uniformly dispersed in tetrahydrofuran via Li-salts mediation, reducing chain aggregate to hundreds of nanometers. PVTC with reduced size was homo-dispersed in the Li 6 PS 5 Cl slurry, enabling the film-formation of SSE/ PVTC composite electrolytes (SCEs) with an ultra-low resistance of 0.69 Ω cm −2 , synchronously facilitating the formation of continuous polymer networks to provide mechanical cushioning that stabilizes interfaces during cycling. The high dielectric PVTC enhances Li-salts dissociation, eradicating conduction barriers and establishing efficient Li + -pathways. Notably, the excellent thermal transfer capability of SCEs enables direct lamination onto electrodes, enabling industrial manufacturing. ASSBs featuring LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 cathodes and silicon-based anodes exhibited energy densities exceeding 380 Wh kg −1 and retained 80% capacity over 750 cycles.

The modified electronic structure electrostatically inhibits Cl − corrosion as well as promotes H 3 O + adsorption, creating a local acidic microenvironment in the natural seawater, neutralizing OH − and effectively avoiding Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ deposition. In situ spectroscopy and local pH monitoring confirm the pivotal role of the microenvironment in regulating reaction kinetics and stability.

  abstract     = {Selective proteolysis remains a significant challenge with relevance to industrial and pharmaceutical applications, motivating development of chemical strategies emulating the specificity of natural proteases. Here, we report that the discrete Zr-oxo nanocluster-based solid, [Zr 17 O 8 (OH) 24 (OH 2 ) 12 (HCO 2 ) 12 (SO 4 ) 8 ] · 6 HCl · 30 H 2 O (Zr 17 ) serves as an efficient, recyclable heterogeneous catalyst for site-selective proteolysis with tunable fragment selectivity. A combination of solution- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy highlighted the importance of the ligand environment of solid Zr 17 for enabling efficient protein-cluster interaction and controlling reactivity. We demonstrate that Zr 17 achieves a proteolytic performance comparable to natural enzymes while allowing fine modulation of peptide product profiles by adjusting reaction parameters. Substrate adsorption and product desorption were found to be governed by the net charge of both catalyst and substrate, as well as rapid reorganization of the cluster's capping ligands, according to UV-Vis/IR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Crucially, the insoluble nature and excellent stability of Zr 17 , evidenced by pair distribution function analysis, allowed reuse across multiple catalytic cycles, overcoming a major limitation of proteolytic systems. This study reveals how cluster surface chemistry governs substrate interaction and catalysis, guiding rational design of next-generation cluster-based catalysts, including hybrid materials such as metal-organic frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Due to the presence of residual tensile strain, as well as the inherent brittleness and film quality of the perovskite, flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) face ongoing challenges in stability. To address these issues, this study introduces a multi-hydroxyl regulated stress management strategy for f-PSCs. Three hydroxyl-substituted phenylacetic acids (p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)acetic acid) are incorporated into the perovskite films to investigate the significance of their interaction modes with perovskite in regulating f-PSC performance. These multi-hydroxyl molecules, through their progressively enhanced synergistic interactions with the perovskite, effectively promote greater energy dissipation during stress deformation, reducing the Young's modulus of the perovskite by 11.1% and decreasing the thermal expansion coefficient of perovskite film by 38.5%, thereby improving the mechanical strength of the f-PSCs. Additionally, the multi-hydroxyl molecules regulate the excess PbI 2 during the fabrication process of perovskite, enhancing the film quality and optimizing the energy level alignment. As a result, the inverted f-PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.01%. These devices demonstrated excellent mechanical and thermal stability, retaining 90% of their original PCE after 3000 bending cycles, and maintaining 83% of their initial PCE after continuous heating at 85 °C for 1000 h.},

Herein, we introduce a “Hydrogen-Bond-Directed Modular Assembly” strategy for the rational construction of ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals. In this strategy, programmable hydrogen-bonding schemes serve as a predictive handle to propagate local asymmetry into a macroscopic polar network. Using an explicit modular design algorithm, we selected three building units—C 3 H 3 O 4 − , C 4 H 5 O 4 − , and C(NH 2 ) 3 + —and assembled them into two one-dimensional polar chain modules, [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 ] ∞ and [C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 ] ∞ . These modules crystallize as two new UV NLO materials, C(NH 2 ) 3 C 3 H 3 O 4 and C(NH 2 ) 3 C 4 H 5 O 4 , which exhibit excellent linear and nonlinear optical properties. By shifting the synthetic focus from serendipitous screening to hydrogen-bond-guided, module-level engineering, our strategy establishes a predictive framework for the a priori design of NCS structures with tailored properties.},

In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking photoredox-catalyzed radical relay process that accomplishes direct C─N bond cleavage in unstrained cyclic amines, thereby enabling the efficient construction of highly functionalized 9–11-membered lactams adorned with a Z-olefin moiety. Remarkably, our methodology exhibits exceptional compatibility with a broad spectrum of acids, encompassing α-amino acids, peptides, and carboxylic acids, thus facilitating the ring expansion of readily accessible propiolamides. Control experiments and computational investigations provide compelling evidence that the ring expansion mechanism is initiated via a reductive radical-polar-crossover-induced C─N bond cleavage, offering profound insights into the underlying reaction dynamics. This advancement not only broadens the synthetic methodology for medium-ring lactam construction but also paves the way for future explorations in complex molecule synthesis and drug discovery.},

In this study, a tandem-triggered transition system is presented that enables the transformation of single-phase coacervates into multiphase structures through the sequential application of two external stimuli: pH and salt concentration. A polyanion containing acid-labile amide bond is incorporated into the membrane-less coacervates. Upon exposure to an acidic pH, hydrolysis of the amide bond induces charge reversal from polyanion to polycation, triggering the first transition from single-phase to nested multiphase coacervates. This transformation alters the spatial redistribution and viscosity of coacervate components and influences sequestration behavior toward various (macro) molecules. Subsequently, the introduction of hypertonic environment as secondary stimulus induces selective dissociation and structural reconfiguration of nested multiphase coacervates into vesicular-like multiphase coacervates, further altering the coacervate components' fluidity and partitioning properties. Notably, the diverse inherent properties of coacervates among this tandem-triggered transition enables the variation of spatial organization for enzymatic reactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate a strategy for the sequential control of coacervate structural reconfiguration through dual stimuli, providing a versatile platform for the development of programable and adaptive coacervate-based protocells.},

Here, we report the exploration of the synergy between the concave π-extended tetrathiafulvalene (exTTF) and the curved CPP scaffold for constructing the rigid, conjugated nanohoop exTTF[10]CPP . X-ray analysis reveals a unique spherical packing arrangement in which six adjacent nanohoops interlock through concave and convex interactions. Interestingly, fluorescence studies revealed that exTTF[10]CPP exhibited unexpected anti-Kasha emissions originating from higher excited states, along with Kasha emission from S 1 excited state in toluene and THF. However, in a PMMA film, it displayed a redshifted Kasha emission. The unique Kasha/anti-Kasha dual-emission behavior represents a rarely explored photophysical phenomenon within exTTF derivatives and nanocarbon-based systems. Ultraviolet-Visible (UV–vis) absorption investigations showed that exTTF[10]CPP demonstrated reversible redox responsiveness with tunable binding affinity for C 60 up to 1.92 × 10 6 M −1 . Notably, femtosecond transient absorption measurements further revealed a prolonged lifetime of the charge-separated state, C 60 •− /exTTF[10]CPP •+ , which provides sufficient time for charge utilization. This exceptional charge-transfer property enhances the photocurrent in C 60 ⊂exTTF[10]CPP -based cast film, which is 2.43 times higher than that of exTTF[10]CPP alone, highlighting its potential in photoelectronic device.},

In response to these issues, here we report a copper-catalyzed asymmetric BER of azaarene-derived 1,2-diketones with simple alcohols to give diverse α-azaaryl-α-hydroxy esters. It is proposed that the azaarene nitrogen and the adjacent carbonyl group chelate copper to form a five-membered metallacycle, initiating the subsequent stereoselective 1,2-nucleophilic addition step. Meanwhile, enantiocontrol over vicinal diketones was achieved by a tailored bisoxazoline (BOX) ligand with two rigid, long, and terminally bulky sidearms. This study overcomes the incompatibility between azaarenes and BOX ligands, and also unlocks asymmetric catalytic 1,2-azaarene migrations.},

This system employs a dual-lock mechanism—combining tetrazine quenching and twisted intramolecular charge shuttle (TICS) dynamics—to maintain an ultra-low fluorescence background in the precursor state, even under aggregating conditions. Upon bioorthogonal reactions and molecular aggregation, the resulting AIEgens exhibit tunable emission peaks ranging from 605 to 665 nm, large Stokes shifts (up to 201 nm), and an exceptional fluorescence enhancement (up to 1033-fold). Their high biocompatibility and spatial precision allow for multiplexed, simultaneous labeling of intracellular targets. Compared to conventional fluorogenic and bioorthogonal probes, these AIEgens exhibit a sigmoidal amplification response, enabling the sensitive discrimination of subtle biomarker expression differences and the effective identification of injured cells during disease progression.

DFT calculations reveal that the adsorption capacity of *CO varies under different interfacial electric field intensities for the Cu, Ag/Cu, Pd/Cu, and Au/Cu models. Accordingly, we design three kinds of self-evolution tandem catalysts and investigate the adsorption and migration behaviors of *CO under interfacial electric fields. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction test results indicate that the higher CO selectivity of Au/Cu is attributed to its weak *CO adsorption capacity, confirmed by in situ attenuated total reflection-infrared and in situ Raman. The low C 2+ selectivity of Pd/Cu is owing to its high reaction energy barrier and low catalytic activity. In contrast, Ag/Cu achieves a high FE C2+ of 89.2% and a partial current density (j c2+ ) of 553.9 mA cm −2 thanks to the low reaction energy barrier and moderate *CO adsorption capacity. COMSOL multiphysics simulations reveal that the effect of the interfacial electric field on *CO external migration could be neglected in the nanometer range. Although a strong interfacial electric field increases the energy barrier for internal migration of *CO, the enhanced adsorption capacity of *CO still dominates C–C coupling in the *CO-rich microenvironment over tandem catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide capture and functionalization sequesters carbon dioxide in more robust products and offers a viable route to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We present herein a unique molecular Ti III oxo anion that reversibly binds CO 2 to allow both its sequestration and functionalization. The reduction of [(PN) 2 Ti═O] ( 1 ) [PN = (2-P i i Pr 2 -4-methylphenyl)(mesityl)amide] with KC 8 and 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) resulted in formation of [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti═O] ( 2 ), which was fully characterized and shown to contain a Ti-centered radical. Complex 2 reacts with Al(CH 3 ) 3 to form [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti{O(Al(CH 3 ) 3 }] ( 3 ), which can be independently prepared from [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti(OCP)] and Al(CH 3 ) 3 . Whereas 1 does not react with CO 2 , 2 rapidly captures the gas (1 atm, 25 °C) to produce a Ti III carbonate [K(crypt)][(PN) 2 Ti(κ 2 -O 2 C═O)] ( 4 ). Chemical and electrochemical oxidation of 4 releases CO 2 to regenerate 1 while a soluble organic carbonate [Me 3 SiOC(O)OSiMe 3 , Me = CH 3 ] is obtained from reaction of 4 with ClSiMe 3 .},

Its substrate scope has progressively expanded to include internal disubstituted and, more recently, gem -disubstituted alkenes. Herein, we report the first examples of Wacker-type oxidation of trisubstituted alkenes under Pd(II)/Pd(IV) catalysis. In the presence of Selectfluor (2.3 equiv) and a catalytic amount of Pd(MeCN) 4 (BF 4 ) 2 (10 mol%), exocyclic trisubstituted α , β -unsaturated carbonyl compounds undergo a fluorinative one-carbon ring expansion to deliver 2-fluoro-1,3-dicarbonyl compounds in good yields. The reaction displays broad functional group tolerance, including alkyl halide, aryl halide, alkyl tosylate, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, ester, secondary amide, ketone, cyano, and N -phthalimide. While a semi-pinacol rearrangement of the Pd(IV) intermediate is a plausible mechanistic pathway given the excellent nucleofugality of the Pd(IV) atom, preliminary studies suggest that a 1,2-alkyl/Pd(IV) dyotropic rearrangement is operative in product formation.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous zinc-ion batteries suffer from electrolyte-induced degradation despite their inherent safety advantages. While localized high-concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) mitigate interfacial instability, the excessive cation–anion association elevate ionic transport barriers, resulting in sluggish migration kinetics. Herein, ion-decoupled LHCE (ID-LHCE) are proposed using amphiphilic 2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propanol (TFP) as anion-affinity diluent. The TFP-mediated anion-diluent matrix (ADM) liberates anion OTF − from Zn 2+ solvation sheaths, which maintains Zn 2+ -enriched nanodomains while significantly reducing ionic transport barriers with an elevated Zn 2+ transference number of 0.72. ADM decouples aqueous networks into biphasic H 2 O-rich/poor nanodomains, establishing a localized environment with attenuated water activity that suppresses hydrogen evolution reaction. Concurrently generated water-deficient interfaces and dehydrated OTF − coordination environment synergistically facilitate the construction of dense gradient heterogeneous SEI: an inner ZnF 2 -ZnS inorganic layer and an outer oligomer layer, enabling dendrite-free zinc deposition with ultralong cyclability (3,000 h at 1 mA cm −2 ) and 99.88% coulombic efficiency. Full cells paired with NaV 3 O 8 ·1.5H 2 O cathodes retain 72.5% capacity retention after 2,000 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 . Practical viability is demonstrated by the stable operation of high mass loading ampere-hour-level pouch cells (1.04 Ah). By correlating molecular interactions, nanoscale phase separation, and macroscopic ion migration, this work establishes a multiscale design paradigm for electrolyte nanostructure.},

In this work, we successfully develop a novel electrolyte by effectively modulating the competitive solvation process in LMBs. In this formulation, the C─O─C motifs of glymes are competitively substituted by other anions and solvents to achieve single oxygen site coordination, thereby facilitating a weak solvation effect. At an apparent concentration of 1.25 M, a solvated sheath enriched with anions and single oxygen-bound complexes is formed, which significantly enhances lithium metal compatibility and promotes rapid desolvation kinetics. The designed electrolyte using weakly solvated structures exhibits remarkable stability at both 25° and 80 °C, enabling the lithium iron phosphate (LFP)||Li cell to achieve over 2000 cycles (capacity retention: 90%) and 500 cycles (capacity retention: 96%), respectively. Interestingly, the low N/P ratio LFP||Li (N/P = 1.8) full battery maintains a stable capacity over 50 cycles, and the commercial 1.1 Ah LFP||Li pouch cell shows a great stability (capacity retention: 91.0%, CE: 99.82%) over 20 cycles.

HDAC6 is involved in multiple cellular processes, yet its protein interaction network remains poorly understood. To uncover novel HDAC6 substrates, we performed an acetylome analysis of HDAC6 knockdown cells, which served as a basis for the design of an HDAC6-trapping peptide library containing hydroxamic acids. Most probes enriched HDAC6 from cell lysates stronger than HDAC1. Proteomic profiling of the trapping probes revealed a preferential enrichment of HDAC6 and resulted in the identification of novel putative HDAC6 interaction partners. Among those were several components of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB that were independently confirmed as HDAC6 binders. Mechanistically, HDAC6 counteracted NF-κB activity induced upon p300-catalyzed acetylation of NF-κB p50. These findings indicate a potential anti-inflammatory function of HDAC6 in NF-κB signaling.},

FLipA-HIPS is essentially nonfluorescent but reacts with aldehydes to give an environmentally sensitive fluorophore with a higher quantum yield in SDS micelles as compared to aqueous buffer alone. FLipA-HIPS reacts with lipidic aldehydes to give 10- to 25-fold higher fluorescence intensities than reactions containing either short-chain aliphatic or aromatic aldehydes in aqueous buffer. Confocal microscopy shows that live cells pretreated with potassium bromate or the aldehydic phospholipid “POVPC” display rapid and selective FLipA-HIPS staining that co-localizes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), consistent with the ER's known role in accumulating lipidic aldehydes.

While current research primarily targets more reactive catalytic lysines buried in the ATP-binding pocket, no systematic rational strategy has yet been developed for selectively engaging surface-exposed lysines. Herein, we present a versatile strategy for developing cell-active covalent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) by selectively targeting unique surface-exposed lysines using squarate chemistry. By using Aurora A (AURKA) as a proof-of-concept, we systematically evaluated this approach against other well-known lysine-reactive warheads (e.g., EBA, SO 2 F, and OSO 2 F) and demonstrated, for the first time, squarates’ superior efficacy in engaging these challenging low-reactivity lysines. Amongst various AURKA CKIs, AL8 emerged as the first-in-class squarate-based, cell-active inhibitor, exhibiting excellent selectivity in both biochemical and cellular assays with long-residence time in covalently engaging endogenous AURKA. Detailed investigation of effects of leaving groups on squaric esters provided valuable insights for future development of lysine-reactive CKIs. Our finding has established squarate-containing ligands as a unique and readily tunable platform for covalent modification of surface-exposed, non-catalytic lysines in targeted kinase drug discovery.},

Within this context, quasi[8]circulenes and indenofluorenes (IFs) have gained considerable attention due to their rich chiroptical, optoelectronic, supramolecular, and redox properties. However, their combined integration into a single molecular framework has not yet been realized. This work demonstrates that curved indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes are easily accessible through an intramolecular cyclization of a readily available helicene diketone. The cyclization is high yielding and accompanied by an unexpected regioselective triflation that—alongside both ketones—allows orthogonal functionalization. This synthetic utility offers great potential for incorporating 8-membered rings and formally antiaromatic as -indacene moieties into complex architectures. Herein, a series of fully conjugated antiaromatic indeno[2,1- c ]fluorene quasi[8]circulenes were synthesized and studied spectroscopically and electrochemically, showcasing the rich properties of these rare, purely carbon-based quasi[8]circulenes. It is shown that the studied compounds display multiple accessible redox states at mild potentials, which can be significantly altered through adequate substituents. These substituents additionally induce unprecedented aggregation behavior for one of the compounds. Furthermore, the studied IFs exhibit chirality arising from the curved structure of the quasi[8]circulenes, which allowed studying chiroptical properties for one of the structures.},

However, the inherent contradiction between the fluctuating nature of renewable energy and the need for stable operation in electrochemical processes significantly hinders their development and implementation. To mitigate this, we propose a robust two-electron oxygen reduction reaction system using O-coordinated Co single-atom catalysts for the electrosynthesis of environmentally friendly hydrogen peroxide. It excels in stability and efficiency across various operating conditions, including steady-state, start−stop cycles, and fluctuating power inputs. At a current density of −50 mA cm −2 , the system sustains over 55 stable start−stop cycles with an average Faradic efficiency above 96%. The high selectivity and durability are attributed to the reservoir-containing O-coordinated Co single-atom sites and the self-healing capability of gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore, we evaluate its practicality under simulated photovoltaic power supply scenarios in the field of smart agriculture, particularly for integrated fertilization, disinfection, and irrigation.

  abstract     = {Porous materials are important for many technologies, but the measurement of porosity by gas adsorption isotherms is slow, taking around one day per sample using a single-port gas sorption analyzer, even when using a “quick” analysis method with relatively few data points. With the increased use of automated platforms for material generation, porosity analysis is now frequently the bottleneck in the discovery of new porous materials. Here, we present a semiautomated pre-screening strategy that uses dye adsorption to create a colorimetric array that is combined with computer vision analysis for porosity screening. By using a six-dye multichannel array and a defined porosity threshold, our method rapidly screened 50 candidate materials that spanned molecular solids, polymers, and metal–organic frameworks. The method showed a 98–100% classification accuracy compared with gas uptake measurements. While this method is more qualitative than quantitative, it is more than 30 times faster than conventional gas sorption measurements, and it has the scope to be made much faster with greater parallelization and automation. This makes this colorimetric method suitable for pre-screening arrays of materials to choose samples that merit more detailed conventional porosity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Degradation of synthetic polymers inevitably leads to the formation of nanoplastics (NPs), and recent studies associate health risks with NPs. Therefore, catching and degrading NPs are important to manage environmental and human health risks. In this study, we developed a biohybrid catalyst system with two functionalities to capture (Hook) and degrade (Decay) NPs. The biohybrid catalyst is composed of a Grubbs-Hoveyda (GH) type cofactor conjugated to the material-binding peptide LCI_F16C, which immobilizes the GH-cofactor onto superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The anchored biohybrid catalyst initiates a ring-opening metathesis polymerization to generate a hydrophobic polynorbornene film around iron oxide core, which enables to efficiently capture and remove a broad spectrum of hydrophobic NPs, including polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene (PS), poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), with hydrophobic interaction as the main driving force. This hydrophobic coating facilitated rapid adsorption of PS-COOH 500 nm NPs within 10 min, reaching an impressive adsorption capacity of 5.53 ± 0.29 g/g on PS NPs, and demonstrated a high recovery efficiency of 99% for SBR NPs. Notably, the embedded GH-cofactor preserved its ethenolysis activity, cleaving internal C═C bonds of SBR and resulting in 6.5% degradation, thereby validating the concept of simultaneous nanoplastic capture and catalytic breakdown.},

We, herein, report a nickela-electrocatalyzed approach for the expedient synthesis of β -arylated pyrroles via a unique multiple dehydrogenative C─H activation approach. Hence, direct C─C bond formation between pyrroles and arenes was enabled, obviating the need for prefunctionalized substrates. The reaction proceeded under electrochemical conditions in a user-friendly undivided cell, utilizing electricity as a traceless oxidant. Mechanistic studies, including cyclic voltammetry, provided support for a nickel(II/III/IV) regime, wherein anodic oxidation facilitates the dehydrogenation and C─H activation paired with the valuable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our findings highlight the potential of electrocatalysis to unlock distinct reaction manifolds and provides a sustainable platform for accessing complex heteroaryl frameworks.},

Two proof-of-concept emitters, m-Cz-DABNA and tBu-Cz-DABNA , were synthesized via high-yield, lithium-free borylation. These emitters exhibit pure-blue emissions at 453 and 463 nm with narrow full-width at half-maximums (FWHMs) of 24 and 21 nm in solution and high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 88% and 95%, respectively. OLED devices based on m-Cz-DABNA and tBu-Cz-DABNA show emissions at 456 nm (FWHM 24 nm, EQE max 23%, CIEy 0.06) and 467 nm (FWHM 24 nm, EQE max 26%, CIEy 0.10), respectively, holding among the highest efficiencies for blue OLEDs without sensitizers. Notably, the tBu-Cz-DABNA -based device shows an LT 90 of ∼81 h at 1000 cd m − 2 (EQE 8.95%), representing one of the longest operational lifetimes for blue fluorescent OLEDs with CIEy ≤ 0.10.

Rh-NS/Rh-NR, characterized by a high density of unsaturated coordination sites and a large specific surface area, greatly enhances the adsorption capacity of NO 2 − and crucial intermediates and lowers the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NOH formation from *NO. Consequently, Rh-NS/Rh-NR exhibits satisfactory Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.7% and a remarkable NH 3 yield rate of 44.3 mg mg cat −1 h −1 for NO 2 RR at high reduction potential (0.00 V). Using Rh-NS/Rh-NR as cathode, the assembled zinc–nitrite battery delivers excellent discharge performance (24.2 mW cm −2 ) and promising NH 3 synthesis capacity (5.96 mg mg cat −1 h −1 ).

This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), we developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target-recognizing molecules with NDM-1, and designed click chemistry-reactive, substrate-caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes. Programmed NDM-1 activity enabled in situ protein-specific imaging of glycans via proximity-dependent activation within various biological specimens. Within a unified enzymatic framework, we successfully quantified distinct glycans of individual proteins and established the principle of protein-specific glycosylation stoichiometry analysis. Our work provides a powerful tool for developing glycoprotein-based disease biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and diagnostic approaches, offering new possibilities for precision medicine research.},

This dual-functional synergy yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.11% in our best device.

Although extensive research has focused on stabilizing the carbon-related intermediates, limited attention has been paid to investigating the local regulations of H 2 O molecules at molecular level. Considering the electrocatalytic interface, H 2 O is critical during CO 2 RR process, as H 2 O molecules are directly involved in CO 2 reduction process or indirectly modify the solid–liquid interfacial structure, thereby impacting the reaction process. In this study, we use a model copper-based catalyst containing palladium and indium dopants that have different hydrogen and oxygen adsorption capabilities to investigate the influence of H 2 O molecules on CO 2 electroreduction selectivity. We find, by enhancing the participation of isolated H 2 O molecules, instead of asymmetric H-bonded H 2 O or ice-like H 2 O, in the local electrocatalytic microenvironment during CO 2 reduction process, that the cathodic products remarkably change from 95% C 1 FE to 70% C 2 FE. We unveil, via in situ ATR-SEIRAS measurement, that the H 2 O microenvironment regulation can promote the formation of key intermediates, thus tuning the CO 2 reduction pathways.},

Despite longstanding interest in reprogramming these systems for metabolic engineering and biosynthetic chemistry, the mechanisms underlying their reaction order remain poorly understood and difficult to control. Here we describe a β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase from Pseudomonas putida ( Pp FabG4) with an unusual selectivity for medium chains and use it to explore the molecular basis of substrate specificity in enzymes that pull intermediates from fatty acid synthesis, a common route to specialized products. X-ray crystallography shows no obvious barriers to short-chain binding. Molecular simulations and supporting mutational analyses indicate that substrate preference arises instead from a weak enzyme–ACP interaction that is stabilized by medium acyl chains but not by short chains. Indeed, mutations that strengthen this interaction for Pp FabG4 or weaken it for Ec FabG, an Escherichia coli β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase with a broad substrate specificity, can enhance or reduce activity on short-chain substrates by over 100-fold. Our findings show how the stability of enzyme-ACP interactions can control substrate scope in promiscuous enzymes and guide the exchange of intermediates between (and within) assembly-line systems.},

  abstract     = {The synthesis of sterically hindered α-tertiary and β-quaternary (neopentylic) ethers has long been constrained by the limitations of traditional S N 2 and related S N 1 approaches, namely low or inexistent reactivity arising from severe steric hindrance or competitive elimination/rearrangement pathways diverting the reaction outcome. Herein, we describe a general solution to the synthesis of sterically hindered ethers via an iridium-catalyzed reductive deoxygenation reaction of readily available ester and lactone starting materials. Employing commercially available, bench-stable IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 as a precatalyst at 1 mol% loading with 4 equivalents of tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDS) as the terminal reductant at room temperature, this practical synthetic approach to hindered ethers features a simple, mix-and-stir, single-vessel protocol under ambient conditions and produces a diverse range of both acyclic and cyclic ether products in good to excellent yields. Control experiments demonstrated that the IrCl(CO)(P[OCH(CF 3 ) 2 ] 3 ) 2 /TMDS catalytic system could not only rapidly hydrosilylate esters to mixed silyl/alkyl hemiacetal intermediates but also catalyze the reduction of acetals directly to ethers, revealing the Lewis acidic and hydridic properties required for this deoxygenative transformation.},

  abstract     = {The duality of nitrate is nowhere better exemplified than in human physiology—a detrimental pollutant but also a protective nutrient—particularly as connected to nitric oxide. Aside from limited insights into nitrate uptake and storage, foundational nitrate biology has lagged. Genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors can address this gap with real-time imaging, but such technologies for mammalian cell applications remain rare. Here, we designed and engineered a biosensor fusing the green fluorescent protein EGFP and the nitrate recognition domain NreA from Staphylococcus carnosus . Seven rounds of directed evolution and 15 mutations resulted in NitrOFF. NitrOFF has a high degree of allosteric communication between the domains reflected in a turn-off intensiometric response ( K d ≈ 9 µM). This was further reinforced by X-ray crystal structures of apo and nitrate-bound NitrOFF, which revealed a large-scale conformational rearrangement changing the relative positioning of the domains by 68.4°. This dramatic difference was triggered by the formation of a long helix at the engineered linker connecting the two domains, peeling the β7 strand off the EGFP and thus extinguishing the fluorescence upon nitrate binding. Finally, we highlighted the utility of NitrOFF to monitor exogenous nitrate uptake and modulation in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line.},

  abstract     = {Ammonia from nitrate-containing wastewater demands the catalysts with high activity, stability, and selectivity toward acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction owing to the corrosion effect of the catalyst and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we synthesized single Ag atoms induced Ag-N/O bonds on one-dimensional WO 3 nanowires for highly efficient and stable electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia under acidic conditions. The resultant catalyst achieved a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ammonia exceeding ∼90% over a potential range of −0.6 to −0.2 V RHE with a maximum FE approaching 100% at −0.4 V RHE and a maximum NH 3 yield at −0.55 V RHE . Importantly, the catalyst maintained a current density at 480 mA cm −2 over 1100 h with a stable FE of ∼94%. By integrating the catalyst into a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), we succeeded in obtaining an NH 3 production rate of 12.75 mmol h −1 at −4 V and maintained the stability for over 30 h with FE > 90%. Experimental and theoretical analysis have demonstrated that the formation of Ag-N/O bonds enhanced nitrate adsorption and lowered the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of *NO→*NHO, thereby considerably improving the efficiency of ammonia synthesis and inhibiting HER at amperometric current densities. This work provides insights into acidic nitrate reduction for ammonia electrosynthesis, which develops corrosion-resistant electrocatalysts for energy conversion.},

  abstract     = {Cysteine dioxygenase (CDO) catalyzes the conversion of cysteine with dioxygen to yield cysteine sulfinic acid, which lies at the branching point of cysteine catabolism. Despite many years of research there are still many questions related to its functioning. Thus, CDO is inactive with selenocysteine (Sec) or when the central iron ion is replaced by cobalt. In this context, we report here biomimetic CDO models with bound selenocysteamine substrate ligands, namely [Tp Mes Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] and [Tp Mes* Fe(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )] (with Tp Mes = hydrotris(3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate, Tp Mes* = hydrobis((3-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)(5-mesitylpyrazol-1-yl)borate) and in addition a cobalt-analogue [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Upon treatment of the Fe/Se homologues with O 2 – as in case of the parent cysteamine-bound complexes – the dioxygenation of the chalcogen atoms was observed. This suggests that the lack in reactivity of CDO-Sec toward O 2 does not originate in the electronic situation but in the surrounding protein matrix. Subsequent DFT calculations indeed showed lower initial barriers for selenocysteamine than for cysteamine in support of the experimental work. The complex [Tp Mes Co(Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )], where Fe is formally replaced by Co, also reacts with dioxygen – more slowly but selectively – to give [Tp Mes Co(O 2 Se-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 )]. Hence, this is an experimental observation of a dioxygenation with O 2 mediated by a cobalt center in a molecular compound, which is so far without precedence.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular polymerization of π-extended compounds with hydrogen-bonding sites remains challenging, especially at high concentrations, due to their limited solubility in nonpolar solvents. Herein, we report a novel method incorporating a thermal precursor approach for the supramolecular polymerization of a poorly soluble tetrabenzoporphyrin (BP) derivative with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites and chiral cholesterol groups ( BP Chol ). Polymerization in the nonpolar solvent tetralin is induced by the retro-Diels–Alder reaction of the highly soluble precursor ( CP Chol ) to BP Chol in the hot solution and subsequent natural cooling, as confirmed by monitoring absorption spectra. The emergence of circular dichroism signals corroborates the formation of aggregates with supramolecular chirality, as the first chiroptical characterization of BP aggregates. Detailed structural analysis using high-resolution microscopies reveals a unique pyramidal multilayer structure with a spiral nature. Additionally, faster cooling produces monolayer nanosheets, which differ from the multilayer structures formed upon natural cooling. This is due to a different nucleation process in the cooperative polymerization. By using the nanosheets as seeds, seed-induced polymerization is achieved, resulting in extended sheets. Notably, the indirect precursor method using CP Chol enables outstanding polymerization at high concentrations (mM level) to afford micro-sized pyramids, which cannot be realized by a direct method using BP Chol .},

  abstract     = {Peptide-based biosensors are widely used for in vitro detection of protease activity but often suffer from the limited sensitivity, poor accuracy, and incompatibility with point-of-care testing (POCT) devices. Herein, we developed a versatile deoxyribozyme (DNAzyme)-amplified protease-sensing (DP) platform that integrates the positively charged oligopeptides with a negatively charged DNAzyme biocatalyst for highly-sensitive protease detection. The system leverages the electrostatic peptide–DNAzyme interactions to inhibit DNAzyme catalytic activity, which is reactivated upon the protease-triggered peptide hydrolysis, thus enabling an efficient signal amplification via the successive cleavage of DNAzyme substrate. Compared to conventional peptide-based sensing platform, our DP system offers an enhanced sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio and is highly modular for detecting various clinically relevant proteases through a simple replacement of the peptide blocker. By introducing a dual-enzyme recognition mechanism, we developed a dual-protease-triggered DP platform for enabling the accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteases in saliva. We also applied the DP platform to differentiate between normal and cancerous colon cells and tissues by detecting colorectal cancer (CRC)-associated proteases. Overall, this work introduces a universal and scalable biosensing strategy for activity-based protease detection with potential applications in both infectious disease diagnostics and cancer classification, advancing the field of DNAzyme-based POCT technologies.},

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) shows promise for detecting structurally similar analogs but faces challenges like subtle receptor signal changes and distortion with weakly adsorbing plasticizer analytes. We address these limitations by integrating direct and indirect SERS to capture intrinsic Raman signals and receptor-analyte interactions, achieving 100% classification accuracy eight plasticizer analogs and multiplex quantification of three major plasticizers extracted from canola oil with < 5% predictive errors at a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mg L −1 , despite interference from other lipophilic contaminants such as adipates. Experimental SERS data and interaction energy calculations affirm that direct SERS detects alkyl chains, while indirect SERS identifies aromatic rings and carboxyl groups in eight plasticizer analogs with varying alkyl structures. A hybrid direct-indirect superspectrum was constructed, enabling the differentiation of eight analogs via Partial-Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) and further analysis using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) reveals equal contribution from all platforms, which highlights their complementary roles. These findings pave the way for broader applications in rapid, on-site detection of complex contaminants across industries.},

Here, we report on two iodocuprate hybrids (HO 2 C(CH 2 ) n -1 NH 3 )CuI 2 ( n = 3, 4) exhibiting excitation-wavelength-dependent emission. The thermodynamically stable n = 4 compound (2D-C4) is based on a rare 2D iodocuprate network, while a more common 1D network of edge-sharing tetrahedra is found both in the n = 3 compound (1D-C3) and in the metastable n = 4 (1D-C4) hybrid. Depending on the excitation wavelength, 2D-C4 and 1D-C3 hybrids exhibit yellow emission, red emission, or white light emission—resulting from the emission of both components,—while 1D-C4 does not emit in the red region. The description of the electronic structure based on density functional theory (DFT) indicates two different origins for the emissions of 2D-C4 and 1D-C3, in particular from iodide vacancies (red emission), which involve mid-gap states. The emission of 2D-C4 can also be modulated from red to yellow depending on applied pressure. 2D-C4 also has an exceptionally low congruent melting temperature of 110 °C, allowing the solvent-free preparation of thin films. Finally, phosphor-converted-LED based on 2D-C4 have been prepared, showing that either pink or nearly white emission is produced.},

  abstract     = {Electronic structures fundamentally influence material properties, with electron spin playing a pivotal role in defining catalytic activity and reaction pathways. However, the precise spin-mediated mechanisms of adsorption energies and nitrogen–nitrogen transition states on the catalyst surface, remain unclear due to the complexity of spin-mediated promotion factors. Herein, we demonstrate that tuning the spin state of single iron (Fe) sites on TiO 2 can significantly enhance photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Our theoretical predictions reveal that low spin states of single Fe sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and intermediate formation, thereby activating more catalytic sites on TiO 2 for efficient nitrogen fixation. By manipulating the crystal phase and incorporating fluorine dopants, we systematically modulate the spin states of Fe sites, achieving optimized N 2 adsorption and desorption kinetics and suppressing charge recombination. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that these modifications reduce the magnetic moment of Fe sites, lower free energy barriers, and strengthen electronic interactions with key intermediates, particularly during N─NH formation. Intriguingly, we find that weakening N 2 adsorption via reduced Fe magnetization enhances catalytic performance, challenging conventional assumptions that stronger N─N bond activation necessarily improves NRR efficiency. Our experimental results corroborate these findings, showing a remarkable 72-fold increase in ammonia production rate compared to pristine TiO 2 . This work highlights the crucial role of electron spin engineering in designing highly efficient NRR catalysts and provides a new paradigm for rational catalyst design.},

Here, we present ATPlug, a self-assembling protein platform that integrates three crucial functional modules: a trimerization domain to enhance avidity, a SpyCatcher module for efficient conjugation, and an albumin-binding domain to optimize pharmacokinetics and tissue selectivity. This rational design facilitates the modular assembly of multivalent artificial antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), demonstrating remarkable versatility through the successful incorporation of diverse therapeutic modules targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The trivalent constructs exhibited up to 30-fold enhancement in target binding avidity and extended plasma half-life via endogenous albumin hitchhiking. Notably, the ATPlug-customized modular ADCs achieved binding affinities of 1.8 nM for EGFR and exhibited selective cytotoxicity toward EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells, resulting in potent tumor suppression efficacy. This plug-and-play strategy provides a framework for next-generation therapeutics combining customized multivalency with multidrug synergies.},

  abstract     = {Water transport across biological membranes is essential for life, facilitated by water channel proteins like aquaporins (AQPs). Drawing inspiration from these natural systems, artificial water channels (AWCs) have emerged as transformative tools for advancing industrial and environmental applications. Herein, we report the design and comprehensive characterization of a groundbreaking class of AWCs, derived from unprecedented butterfly-shaped aromatic folding synthons, carefully engineered to emulate the functional attributes of natural AQPs. These foldamers, with their intricate helical architectures, exhibit exceptional water transport performance. Remarkably, the highest-performing AWC achieves an ultrafast water transport rate of 2.6 × 10 10 H 2 O s −1 per channel—2.4 times the efficiency of AQP1—without the need for lipid anchors to preserve its functional orientation within phospholipid bilayers, while effectively excluding salts such as NaCl and KCl, along with protons. This work presents an ideal bio-inspired, high-performance artificial alternative to natural systems, demonstrating the remarkable potential of foldamer-based AWCs as next-generation solutions for tackling critical challenges in water purification and desalination.},

  abstract     = {Controlling product selectivity in electrochemical CO 2 reduction (eCO 2 R) is critical for efficient CO 2 conversion. However, the dynamic structural changes of Cu-based catalysts during operation complicate mechanistic understanding. Here, we investigate fluorine-modified copper pre-catalysts with varying doping levels and reveal how their structural evolution governs eCO 2 R activity and selectivity. Through operando spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical simulations, we show that fluorine leaches rapidly during electrolysis, transforming Cu 2 ⁺ precursors into metallic Cu⁰ with distinct local structures. Cu-F-4, with the lowest coordination number, exhibits high eCO 2 R activity and favors CO formation with a Faradaic efficiency (FE CO ) of 81% at −0.45 V. In contrast, Cu-F-1, enriched in grain boundaries and Cu(100) facets, achieves a high FE C2+ of 80% at −0.65 V. Differences in local pH, *OH coverage, and *CO binding energies further modulate catalytic pathways. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic catalyst reconstruction in steering product selectivity and offer design principles for advancing CO 2 -to-chemicals conversion.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into syngas is a promising approach to solving energy and environmental challenges. However, the current studies are mainly conducted by using neat CO 2 where CO 2 enrichment and purification is an energy-intensive process. Herein, we report a Co-COOH-COF with an asymmetric tridentate ligand for syngas synthesis from different contents of CO 2 . The nanosheets of the resulting champion catalyst, Co 17.7 -COOH-COF enable an outstanding syngas production rate of 151.1 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 180.5 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under visible light, while it is up to 112.3 mmol g −1 h −1 from neat CO 2 and 116.0 mmol g −1 h −1 from 40 vol% CO 2 under natural sunlight, which surpasses most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. Impressively, the catalyst also exhibits a widely and continuously adjustable CO/H 2 molar ratio from 4:1 to 1:21. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the asymmetric tridentate ligand with carboxyl groups increases Co loading in the covalent organic frame (COF) by the formation of atomically dispersed N–Co–O 4 sites and enhances dissociation of water and CO 2 adsorption by hydrogen bonding, thus facilitating CO 2 transformation and hydrogen evolution. This work presents a new pathway for the design of high-performance catalysts for the photoreduction of CO 2 to syngas.},

  abstract     = {Photoenzymatic catalysis facilitates stereoselective new-to-nature chemistry under mild conditions. In addition to the rational design of artificial photoenzymes, naturally occurring redox enzymes can be repurposed to promote photoredox catalysis in the chiral protein environment. Here, we show that enzymes utilizing the pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) cofactor expand the toolbox of photobiocatalysis. PQQ absorbs visible light and is capable of single-electron transfer. It thus exhibits mechanistic similarities to flavin cofactors, which are widely used for photoenzymatic approaches. First, we established the trimethyl ester PQQMe 3 as a stand-alone photoredox catalyst in pure organic solvent. Upon excitation, PQQMe 3 enables the redox-neutral radical cyclization of an N -(bromoalkyl)-substituted indole. We then tested a panel of PQQ-dependent sugar and alcohol dehydrogenases for photoenzymatic catalysis in aqueous buffer, focusing on a redox-neutral radical reaction to form oxindoles. Under optimized reaction conditions, we obtained a 69% yield and an 82:18 enantiomeric ratio. Our work thus demonstrates that PQQ enzymes are capable of stereoselective photoredox catalysis. Future enzyme engineering efforts based on computational modeling and directed evolution will fully unlock their synthetic potential.},

  abstract     = {Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes (SICPEs) are designed by covalently bonding anions to the polymers, which is attractive for mitigating anion aggregation-derived polarization. However, one major challenge for developing SICPEs with higher ambient ionic conductivity comes at the expense of structural robustness. Here, boron ion-centered lithium salt (LiT4PAB) with symmetric cross structure and terminal functional C═C was proposed as a units, and then 3D coordination electrolyte (LiPHB) was constructed via chemical cross-linking of LiT4PAB with poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP). The boron ion-centered units catenated by single bonds show the abundant conformation transitions, enabling the deformable architecture of LiPHB with the aid of electrostatic interactions of diphenylsulfonimide. Therefore, LiPHB undergoes adaptive deformation when subjected to impact, achieving good ductility with elastic moduli of 1.4 GPa and a maximum elongation of 447.4%. Moreover, LiPHB demonstrates 3D single lithium-ion transport channels to guide the homogeneous lithium deposition. As a results, lithium symmetric cells exhibit stable plating/stripping cycle for over 1500 h at 0.1 mA cm −2 at 30 °C. Li/LiPHB SICPEs/NCM811 solid-state batteries deliver a capacity retention of 90.3% in 150 cycles at 30 °C and 0.2 C. Our study shed light on the design strategies of the dynamic single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes for solid-state batteries.},

  abstract     = {Existing binders fail to integrate all designed functionalities, including the polysulfide shuttle effect, sluggish kinetic transformation, electrode volume variation, slow Li⁺ transfer, and flammable characteristics. Herein, the microwave irradiation method is used to prepare deep eutectic solvent (DES) binder; with the rapid conduction and full utilization of energy, citric acid and betaine (CB) binder is formed in a flash. Intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds between C and B provide robust adhesion, self-healing capability, and flame-retardant properties. More importantly, Li⁺ flux is directly improved by hydrogen bond acceptor (B) of DES rather than introducing additional segments or chemical treatment; then the redox kinetics are significantly promoted and the polysulfide shuttle is further suppressed. The types and dynamics of the hydrogen bonds are observed via Raman and dynamic mechanical analysis, while effective LiPS adsorption capability is confirmed through theoretical calculations and in situ Raman measurements. Furthermore, rapid LiPS conversion is verified by nucleation/dissolution experiments of Li 2 S and distribution of relaxation times (DRTs) analysis, and nucleation transformation ratio ( NTR ) calculation shows the similar result. Benefiting from the superior merits of the DES binder, lithium–sulfur (Li─S) battery presents stable cycling at 5 C with 61.3% capacity retention after 300 cycles.},

  abstract     = {Chiral ferroelectrics are attracting tremendous interest because of their unique intrinsic chirality and various intriguing optical properties, such as natural circular dichroism (NCD) effects. However, the magnetic CD (MCD), a kind of important magneto-optical effect, has never been explored in chiral ferroelectrics. Herein, through implementing a homochiral strategy on organic radical charge-transfer complexes, we designed a pair of chiral organic radical ferroelectric crystals, R- and S- [TBSQ][TCNQ] (TBSQ = 3-(( tert -butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)quinuclidine, TCNQ = tetracyanoquinodimethane), which show both paramagnetism and ferroelectricity at room temperature. Notably, the chiral transfer from homochiral R/S- TBSQ + to TCNQ• − radical makes R- and S- [TBSQ][TCNQ] can produce remarkable NCD signal in the absorbance region of TCNQ• − radical. More importantly, the CD signal can be modulated and reversed by an external magnetic field of 1.6 T, showing a remarkable magneto-optical response. The magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) effect is further demonstrated with the strength g MCD being ∼1 × 10 −4 T −1 at about 600 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on chiral ferroelectrics with MCD effect. Our findings shed light on the exploration of magneto-optical effects in chiral ferroelectrics and stimulate further study on the chemical design of chiral radical ferroelectrics.},

However, prior studies have predominantly focused on through-bond charge-transfer (TBCT) mechanisms. In this work, we report the first examples of luminescent radicals based on TTM (tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical) with through-space charge-transfer (TSCT) excited states, represented by TPA-FR-TTM and CZP-FR-TTM. Spatial separation and non-bonding character between the donor and radical units minimizes electron-vibrational coupling and effectively suppresses non-radiative decay. As a result, CZP-FR-TTM exhibits an outstanding photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 64.3% and an ultralow non-radiative decay rate of 1.3 × 10 6 s −1 , among the lowest ever reported for luminescent radicals. Furthermore, the reduced electronic coupling leads to non-Aufbau electronic structures, enhancing radical stability. These findings establish TSCT as a powerful design strategy for high-performance and stable luminescent radicals, opening new avenues for open-shell optoelectronic materials.},

In this work, we combine chromatographic isolation, spectroscopic characterization, and synthetic validation to identify key molecular intermediates in the early stages of CND formation from arginine (Arg) and ethylenediamine (EDA) under hydrothermal conditions. Using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, 1 H/ 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry, we isolate and structurally confirm multiple reaction intermediates, including species arising from Arg cyclization and EDA-derived condensation products. Each proposed intermediate was validated via direct synthesis and comparative analysis. Fully formed CNDs were then isolated and extensively characterized through several techniques. Multi-detection gel permeation chromatography enabled the determination of absolute number average molecular weight ( M n = 4,400 ± 458 g mol −1 ), dispersity ( Đ = 1.34), and hydrodynamic diameter (2.8 ± 0.2 nm). Quantification of amine functionalities using Kaiser test and 19 F NMR, upon condensation with a fluorinated aldehyde probe, established the presence of 6–7 amines per particle. Together, this systematic approach not only elucidates the mechanistic origin of CND formation but also establishes a robust framework for molecular-level CND design and functionalization.},

While several metal complexes have shown promise as ICD inducers, conjugates containing more than one metal center remain to be explored for ICD. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a tri-metallic Au I -Pt IV -Ru II prodrug ( 5 ) that codelivers oxaliplatin (Type I ICD inducer), Ru II arene 2-pyridinecarbothioamides (Type I), and Au(I) bis-N-heterocyclic (Type II) using a single scaffold. Upon reduction, complex 5 releases all three cytotoxic species, resulting in enhanced inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1&2), elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and in vitro DAMP release. In vivo studies of complex 5 in a colorectal cancer mouse model demonstrated tumor growth suppression, reduced off-target metal accumulation, and improved immune memory in a tumor challenge study compared to a 1:1:1 mixture of the constituent agents. Furthermore, peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profiling revealed that complex 5 activates both the innate and adaptive immune compartments. This study demonstrates an integrated chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy that unifies multiple ICD triggers within a single prodrug framework. It thus highlights a promising approach to the creation of metal-based multimodal anticancer therapies.},

While this property has been extensively exploited for probing of homomultivalent interactions, there has been comparatively little attention paid to the exploration of heteromultivalent interactions. In this study, we investigated the use of readily assemblable DNA duplexes for programming bispecific targeting of specific cell types. In contrast to previous bispecific agents, we leverage the potential of peptide-based high-affinity binders of cell surface proteins used in diagnostics/therapeutics. Systematic spatial screening revealed the optimal distance between two (cyclo)peptides required for selectively recognizing cells expressing unique combinations of receptors. The VGFR2/α V β 3 receptor system on HUVECs was tolerant to changes of the distance between two cyclopeptides (L and cyclo(-RGDf( N -Me)K-)) and required that the distance exceeded the equivalent of 20 nucleotides distance. A different distance-affinity landscape was observed for recognition of EGFR and MET on A549 cells (through GE11 and bicyclic peptide GE-137). The DNA-programmed bispecific binders demonstrated specificity and efficient internalization into target cells. Auristatin-loaded DNA enabled a selective targeting of cytotoxic payload. Of note, the distance-optimized bispecific DNA-peptide probes have much lower molecular weight than previously used agents based on DNA nanostructures or antibodies.},

  abstract     = {Reducing costs while maintaining efficiency in photocatalytic systems remains a major pursuit in the field of solar photocatalysis. Herein, we explore a universal strategy for regulating electronic transfer by employing earth-abundant polyoxometalates (POMs) as electron sponges, dramatically promoting electron shuttling between photosensitizers (PSs) and substrates. This approach enables highly efficient photooxidative hydroxylation of arylboronic acids while significantly reducing the usage of noble-metal PSs. Typically, replacing 90% PS [Ir(bpy)(coumarin6) 2 ] + ( Ir-2 ) with an earth-abundant Co 7 POM ([{(B-α-PW 9 O 34 )Co 3 (OH)(H 2 O) 2 (O 3 PC(O)(C 3 H 6 NH 3 )PO 3 )} 2 Co] 14− ) can efficiently boost photo-oxidation efficiency, achieving complete substrate conversion within 3 h in air, ∼3.2 or 5.6 times higher than the system with 100% or 10% Ir-2 , respectively. Notably, this strategy exhibits excellent compatibility with a wide range of substrates and POMs. Systematic kinetic studies and unique “heteropoly blue” characteristic of POMs clearly demonstrated their excellent capabilities for electron accepting, storing, and releasing in these photo-oxidation systems. These properties can significantly promote electron transfer and stabilize reduced PSs, resulting in over five-fold increase in O 2 •− generation under weak visible-light irradiation ( λ > 420 nm, 50 mW cm −2 ) compared to POM-free systems. This work not only opens an avenue for efficient photochemical synthesis but also highlights a promising new direction for POM application.},

The Si─O─Al bonds in DSB exhibit high reactivity toward the deleterious species in the electrolyte, resulting in the formation of deposits on the surface of hard carbon.

  abstract     = {The photocatalytic activation of inert aromatic C─H bonds under mild conditions remains a major challenge due to the inherent stability of sp 2 C─H bonds and the lack of efficient, selective heterogeneous photocatalysts. Herein, by strategically balancing the solubility of aniline-functionalized arsenic polyoxomolybdate (AsPOM) with the organic linker of 1,4-bi(3-dimethylamino-1-oxoprop-2-enyl)benzene (BDOEB), a new 3D covalent AsPOM-organic polymer, termed POF-2, was successfully prepared. Its short- to medium-range ordered structure was resolved using the advanced total scattering atomic pair distribution function (PDF). The unique architecture of POF-2 synergistically combines the strong oxidative capability of AsPOM with the tunable light absorption and oxygen activation ability of organic monomers, narrowing the bandgap from 3.13 eV (AsPOM) to 2.28 eV (POF-2) and extending light absorption to 575 nm. Under ambient conditions with low-energy visible-light irradiation (10 W LED), POF-2 exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance in aromatic C─H bromination and [3+2] cycloaddition reactions, achieving >99% conversion and >99% selectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that the well-defined donor–acceptor (D–A) structure of POF-2 facilitates rapid hole (h + )-mediated C─H activation on AsPOM nodes and selective 1 O 2 generation on BDOEB linkers, avoiding nonproductive substrate mineralization. This work not only demonstrates a new 3D covalent AsPOM-organic polymer for C─H functionalization but also provides a blueprint for designing molecularly precise, multifunctional photocatalysts for sustainable organic synthesis.},

This engineered interface reaction represents a novel method for preparing high-quality deep-blue CsPb(Br/Cl) 3 films. By incorporating lithium salicylate (SAL) as a reaction initiator into the perovskite precursor, a proton exchange is triggered between PEDOT:PSS and SAL, resulting in the formation of a multifunctional PSS-Li interfacial layer. This layer modulates perovskite nucleation and growth, producing compact, uniform, and small-grained deep-blue perovskite films with reduced trap densities and enhanced quantum confinement. Combined with optimized charge dynamics, the resulting spectrally stable deep-blue PeLEDs achieve a record external quantum efficiency of 16.3% at 468 nm. This approach facilitates the successful integration of uniform and high-clarity active-matrix displays on thin-film transistor circuit substrates.},

  abstract     = {A rationally designed, bifunctional ammonia-oxidation catalyst spatially decouples NH 3 activation and *OH adsorption to overcome the intrinsic trade-off of single-component systems. Atomically dispersed Zn single atoms in an N,O-doped carbon support (Zn 1 /NOC) serve as dedicated *OH-adsorption sites, while Ir-modulated Pt(100) nanocubes selectively activate NH 3 . Comprehensive structural characterization (AC HAADF-STEM, XPS, XANES, EXAFS) confirms Zn-N 3 O 3 coordination and atomically isolated Zn centers. Electrochemical-kinetic analysis, mechanistic spectroscopy, and DFT calculations reveal that Zn 1 /NOC lowers the *OH-adsorption energy by 0.84 eV (to −0.98 eV versus −0.14 eV on Pt), facilitating the dehydrogenation steps and reducing surface poisoning. Simultaneously, traces of stabilized Ir 4+ -decorated Pt cubes enhance NH 3 dissociation kinetics to form N 2 . The catalyst demonstrates a specific activity of 3.80 mA cm −2 PGMs , exceeding the state-of-the-art benchmarks. When deployed in a membrane-electrode-assembly direct ammonia fuel cell, the catalyst achieves a maximum current density of 200 mA cm −2 and a peak power density of 18 mW cm −2 , representing a significant improvement over previously reported systems, with ∼250% increase over Pt np –C || Pt/C and more than double monofunctional systems. This work demonstrates a generalizable strategy for engineering spatially decoupled active sites in multistep electrochemical reactions, paving the way for high-performance ammonia fuel cells and beyond.},

The microenvironment influences the activity of adsorption site by modulating the orbital interaction between the active site and adsorbate.

As a model system, through hydrothermal processing in a solution of aluminum ions, polyacrylamide hydrogels show dramatically enhanced mechanical properties with tensile strength and elastic modulus up to 12.8 and 75.1 MPa, respectively, and very impressively, they also exhibit excellent RTP properties with long lifetime up to 169.7 ms and very interesting reversible UV-activated RTP emission. The UV-activated and persistent RTP emission enable innovative applications of the hydrogels in self-erasing encryption and ultrasensitive antibiotic sensing. The hydrothermal processing strategy can be applied to preparing other RTP hydrogels by using different polymeric matrices and metal ions. This work establishes a universal paradigm for developing multifunctional RTP hydrogels through metal ion coordination and provides a basis for their practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic CO 2 reduction into solar fuels presents a promising strategy for carbon mitigation and sustainable energy conversion. However, single-component photocatalysts suffer from inefficient charge separation, while binary heterojunctions—even with cocatalysts assistance—often undergo rapid Coulombic recombination due to timescale mismatches between ultrafast charge transfer and slower surface reaction kinetics. To overcome these limitations, a spatially engineered Nb 2 C/Nb 2 O 5 /ZnO ternary heterostructure is developed by anchoring ZnO quantum dots (QDs) onto Nb 2 O 5 nanorods grown in situ from Nb 2 C MXene. This architecture integrates an Nb 2 O 5 /ZnO S-scheme heterojunction and an Nb 2 C/Nb 2 O 5 Schottky junction, sharing Nb 2 O 5 as a central mediator, thereby establishing bidirectional interfacial electric fields (IEFs) that direct photogenerated electrons toward ZnO and holes toward Nb 2 C. In situ irradiated X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) reveal interface-specific electronic interactions and time-resolved carrier dynamics, confirming efficient and spatially resolved charge migration across the decoupled interfaces. This spatial charge separation effectively suppresses Coulombic recombination and prolongs carrier lifetimes. Additionally, the photothermal effect of Nb 2 C MXene enhances CO 2 chemisorption and activation at defective ZnO QDs. These synergistic effects collectively enable high-efficiency CO 2 photoreduction without molecular cocatalysts or sacrificial agents, providing a mechanistically distinct and scalable approach for artificial photosynthesis.},

While the static structure–activity relationship of catalysts is well explored, how the evolution of electronic structure dynamically affects the ROS generation remains poorly understood. This study fabricated carbon nanolayer-supported Co x Ni y alloys (Co x Ni y @CNT) with preset atomic Ni/Co ratio ( x / y = 1:3, 2:2, 3:1) to probe the dynamic evolution of electronic structure and its subsequent role for the generation of non-radical ROS. During catalytic PMS activation, the paired electrons of O 2p in PMS fill the corresponding hybrid orbitals of Co to form coordinative Co—O endowed with paired/unpaired electrons. The carbon nanolayer support, as in situ formed with controllable lattice distance, exhibits the unique electron buffering effect to replenish electron to Co 1 Ni 3 or accept electron from Co 3 Ni 1 , thereby driving selective generation of surface PMS* or free 1 O 2 respectively. Further, the specific reaction preferences of PMS * and 1 O 2 toward different organic contaminants were elucidated, and a combined process integrating both alloys was proposed to efficiently treat actual hospital wastewater. Overall, this study offers a molecule-level design of bimetallic alloys with tunable electronic structure for sustainable water purification.},

Light, as an ideal fuel form, offers remote control, spatiotemporal precision, and no chemical waste. However, the energy dissipating mechanism behind current light-driven system hinges on photoisomerization. This strategy has to trade off the slow, incomplete tautomerization against the needs of rapid, dynamic material response. Here, we report a non-isomerized, light-fueled dissipative self-assembly system based on photoexcited radicalization mechanism. Light can activate dipeptide-modified naphthalene diimide (NDI-GV) into high-energy radical anion NDI-GV ●− , thus disrupting the initial π-stacked ribbon architecture and triggering a reconfiguration into homochiral helical nanofibers through spin-spin interactions among the resulted radicals. In turn, ambient air spontaneously oxidizes NDI-GV ●− to the ground state for resetting the system, during which an unusual solvent-involved feedback pathway sustaining the dissipative cycle is uncovered. Shifting light parameters or solvents to tune the kinetics of radical generation and deactivation enables temporal control of the assembly period and lifetime (>10 h). Combining the tunability of phase transition with the photochromism of NDIs, this system can be used for light-programmed information encryption and spatiotemporal patterning, which would inspire a non-photoisomerized paradigm of light-powered dissipative self-assembly and extend the boundaries of systems chemistry.},

A-site cation engineering idealized the perovskite lattice and improved the crystal quality, e.g., the multication (BA) 2 Cs 0.7 MA 0.4 EA 0.5 GA 0.4 Sn 3 I 10 (MA + : methylammonium, EA + : ethylammonium, GA + : guanidinium) achieves a long carrier lifetime (15.1 ns), nearly three times that of containing single A-site, and then increases diffusion length to >1 µm.

  abstract     = {Sodium (Na) storage in hard carbon (HC) is a fundamental electrochemical process for sodium-ion batteries, where adsorption energy critically influences charge/discharge rates and storage capacity. Accurate prediction of this energy is essential for designing of high-performance HC. Traditional quantum mechanical simulations often neglect charge effects from electrochemical potentials, leading to inaccurate adsorption energies and discrepancies with experiments. Here, we demonstrate that potential-driven charge effects play a pivotal role in governing Na storage under realistic conditions. To address this, we develop a charge-dependent computational model (CDM) that explicitly incorporates potential-induced charge dynamics. Using flat carbon layers as a model, we show that charge effects significantly influence the identification of active Na-storage sites and induce sodiation/desodiation voltage shifts exceeding 1.1 V relative to conventional charge-neutral models. These effects originate from distinct chemical reactivities between neutral and charged carbon. When extended to curved and defect-rich carbon—hallmarks of HC—CDM accurately predicts storage sites and voltage-capacity profiles that closely match experimental data. This work resolves long-standing theory-experiment inconsistencies and provides a powerful framework for designing next-generation sodium-ion batteries.},

The closed-shell singlet ( 1 A) state is highly distorted and lies >4 kcal mol −1 above the ground state. This unique aryl carbenium ion exhibits a ∼40 kcal mol −1 higher hydride affinity (HA) as compared to the parent phenyl cation, explaining its high reactivity and elusive character. In addition, the radical's reactivity was investigated upon hydrogen abstraction and unimolecular decomposition, forming tetrafluoro ortho -benzyne as well as smaller fluorinated species.},

  abstract     = {This study presents the successful synthesis of a series of stable iminium diradical(oid)s. CNR1 + OTf − , CNR2 + OTf − , and CNR3 + OTf − can be readily prepared by treating their corresponding methoxy precursors with triflate acid. Remarkably, they all display excellent stability under light and ambient conditions. CNR1 + exhibits a closed shell electronic feature, whereas CNR2 + features an open shell singlet ground state. CNR3 + OTf − possess triplet ground electronic state, as evidenced by ESR and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. Through meticulous fitting of the SQUID data, a singlet-triplet energy gaps (∆ E S-T ) of +1.04 kcal mol −1 along with intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions ( θ ) of -28 K were obtained. In comparison to CNR1 + , both the open shell CNR2 + and CNR3 + display distinctively red shifted long wavelength absorption bands that extend up to approximately 2400 nm. Such long wavelength absorption characteristics are quite scarce among organic materials. This research offers a novel approach for the design and synthesis of iminium diradical(oid)s, which feature tunable ground states and exhibit intense absorption in the second near infrared (NIR-II) region, opening up new possibilities in the field of organic materials research.},

  abstract     = {Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskites have garnered significant attention owing to their extensive applicability in tandem photovoltaic devices. However, the conventional post-treatment strategy utilizing phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) frequently results in the formation of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite structures with mixed n-values and the phase evolution under operating conditions, thereby constraining further enhancement of device performance and deteriorating the operation stability. Through intermolecular interactions and localized polarity modulation, this method facilitates cation exchange reactions between phenethylammonium (PEA + ) and formamidinium (FA + ) ions, enabling the formation of homogenized 2D perovskite layer with n = 2 on WBG perovskite surface. Benefiting from the precisely defined 2D passivation layer, the WBG single-junction device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.98%, while the 2-terminal (2T) all-perovskite tandem device based on this strategy attains a PCE of 28.35%. This research underscores the benefits of bimolecular synergy in surface phase regulation and provides a promising pathway for advancing high-performance, stable perovskite photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {Glycation is a nonenzymatic posttranslational modification associated with aging and disease. Because it occurs spontaneously, it is extremely difficult to control the extent of glycation at distinct sites within target proteins, especially in cellular systems. Here, we report a chemical approach, referred to as “dialAGE”, that enables the site-specific control of protein glycation. This unique tool requires the introduction of just a single point mutation that modulates the glycation susceptibility of a nearby arginine. As proof-of-concept, extensive mass spectrometry analysis was performed to confirm that dialAGE can modulate site-specific glycation levels at multiple arginine residues in ubiquitin in vitro, enabling both enhanced and diminished glycation. Introduction of dialAGE point mutations and/or glycation with the biologically relevant glycating agent methylglyoxal did not affect polyubiquitin chain formation using in vitro ubiquitination assays. Furthermore, we show that dialAGE can be used to modulate ubiquitin glycation levels in living mammalian cells. We, therefore, anticipate that this method will be particularly useful for enabling the study of glycation as a genuine, functional, and posttranslational modification.},

The herein presented nanospheres undergo quantitative PAM with a variety of aniline derivatives, allowing the creation of hydrophobic, chiral, catalytic, and other confined spaces. As the parent spheres can be easily characterized before PAM, this methodology not only allows for the preparation of highly desirable multifunctional confined spaces but also serves with its post modulation possibilities as a fast and efficient tool for screening secondary interactions and confined spaces on probes of interest.},

Herein, we develop a Pd SAs+NPs /PTI catalyst by co-anchoring atomic and nanoparticulate Pd species on poly(triazine imide) crystals, which exhibits high activity, selectivity, and stability for CO 2 reduction to CO using H 2 O as the reductant. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the dual Pd species synergistically enhance charge separation and transfer while promoting CO 2 activation, CO desorption, and H 2 O dissociation. Photo-stimulated electrons migrate to Pd nanoparticles to reduce CO 2 , and holes oxidize Pd 2+ sites to Pd 4+ species that catalyze H 2 O splitting to OH* and H*. The resulting H* spills onto adjacent Pd nanoparticles to support proton-coupled CO 2 reduction, whereas OH* is oxidized by Pd 4+ to evolve O 2 , regenerating Pd 2+ , and closing the catalysis cycle. Importantly, the photoinduced Pd 4+ sites dynamically modulate the local adsorption environment, weakening *CO binding on nearby Pd nanoparticles. This facilitates *CO desorption and hampers its hydrogenation to CH 4 , enabling high CO selectivity. The optimal catalyst achieves a CO yield rate of 22.2 mmol g Pd −1 h −1 with 95.7% selectivity, stably operating over 30 h.},

However, it remains a major challenge to design nanochannels with efficient selectivity and fast transport for target ions. Here, inspired by biological membranes, we reported a Janus graphene oxide membrane (JGOM) with an asymmetric structure that exhibits diode-like ion transport behavior and achieves high-efficiency Li + /Mg 2 ⁺ separation for lithium extraction applications. During the forward transport of ions, the nGO nanochannels modified by sulfonate groups (SO 3 − ) with precise size provide hopping recognition sites and additional electrostatic attraction for the fast transport of Li + , while imposed Mg 2+ dehydration and exposure to a stronger positive charge. The continuous pGO nanochannels modified by amino groups (NH 3 + ) further prevent the passage of dehydrated Mg 2+ by enhanced electrostatic repulsion while allowing Li + to transfer. Under the synergy of the two nanochannels, the JGOM demonstrates robust Li + /Mg 2+ separation performance, outperforming symmetrical structure GO membranes and other reported membranes, which was further confirmed by simulation results. This study provides a new insight into the rational design of ion sieving membranes.},

Herein, we convert spent LiCoO 2 (LCO) into nanosized disordered rocksalt-phase (DS) coating material, which exhibits considerable Li + conductivity and high lattice-coherent compatibility with LCO. Subsequently, using a facile and scalable high-speed mechanofusion technology, we construct a continuous, uniform, and tightly bound DS coating layer onto LCO, denoted as DS@LCO cathode. Benefiting from the nucleophilic reaction between fluorinated electrolyte and reactive oxygen released from DS coating layer, a stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) film is achieved, with an outer LiF-rich protective shield and inner flexible fluorinated polymer. Coupled with the lattice-coherent DS coating layer and reinforced CEI film, the hybrid surface architecture synergistically enhances the interfacial stability, thermal safety, and electrochemical performance of DS@LCO cathode. As a result, a stable operation of DS@LCO half-cell is achieved at 4.6 V (90.1% capacity retention after 250 cycles). Long-life and high-energy-density (1032 Wh L −1 ) pouch cells are harvested, retaining over 86% capacity after 1000 cycles.

Both experimental and theoretical results revealed the key role of the intermetal bias between Pt and Rh amplified by the rectifying contact with nitrogen-doped carbons support in accelerating the pre-enrichment of protons on Rh sites, diffusion of H species from Rh to Pt sites, and final H dissociation from Pt sites. Consequently, the optimized Pt 3 Rh 2 /NC cathode with the most pronounced intermetal bias gives a record-high mass activity of 282 A mg Pt+Rh −1 at a cell voltage of 1.8 V in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Moreover, the Pt 3 Rh 2 /NC cathode can reduce the proton diffusion resistance from 0.95 Ω of Pt/C to 0.69 Ω at a cell voltage of 1.5 V due to the promoted hydrogen species diffusion on catalyst surface, largely decreasing the cell voltage and extending the lifespan by 3.2 times.},

These anilines can subsequently serve as versatile intermediates for accessing a variety of heterocyclic structures, thereby facilitating the rapid synthesis of novel bioactive analogs.

Herein, we report a gold (Au) decorated niobium pentoxide (Nb 2 O 5 ) featuring unsaturated Nb centers and photoinduced oxygen vacancies (O V ), which achieved a CH 4 conversion rate of 3.21 mmol g −1 h −1 with a selectivity of ∼98.1% toward C 2+ hydrocarbons ( λ = 320−780 nm, 300 mW cm −2 ), outperforming the selectivity of previously reported photocatalysts. Operando characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that the unsaturated Nb centers play a crucial role in promoting methane activation and facilitating the transfer of methyl (*CH 3 ) intermediates to the Au cocatalyst, thereby boosting the C─C coupling pathway while suppressing undesired overoxidation. Concurrently, the photoinduced O V sites enable the timely release of H 2 O from the lattice oxygen, thus enhancing O 2 activation and improving the lattice oxygen looping efficiency.

These apertures closely match the dimensions of PX and EB, enabling kinetic sieving. As a result, Ni-HDB exhibits high selectivity for PX and EB, moderate selectivity for MX, and exclusion of OX under ambient conditions. It achieves record liquid-phase selectivities for EB/OX (1943), PX/OX (951), and MX/OX (158), along with high PX and MX adsorption capacities. Comparative studies with isoreticular analogues confirm that DABCO-driven confinement is key to enhancing size-based selectivity. Density functional theory calculations indicate kinetic preference for PX and EB, thermodynamic favorability for MX, and exclusion of OX. Ni-HDB also shows excellent thermal and structural stability, with no performance loss over ten cycles. These results highlight the importance of channel geometry in MOFs and provide a framework for developing next-generation adsorbents for energy-efficient hydrocarbon separations.},

  abstract     = {High-capacity Co-free Ni-rich layered oxides are promising cathode materials for lithium-based batteries, but they suffer from chemo–electro–mechanical instabilities. While single-crystal morphologies reduce these issues, slipping, and microcracking persist during extended cycling, and the degradation mechanisms remain inadequately understood. Herein, we report on multi-directional planar slipping and microcracking along the (003) and (100) planes in a single-crystal LiNi 0.75 Mn 0.25 O 2 (LNM) cathode. According to the Darken–Gurry theory and formation energy in LNM, magnesium (Mg 2+ ) has been selected as the best pillaring element to strengthen the structural integrity and improve cycling stability. Notably, Li 0.99 Mg 0.01 Ni 0.75 Mn 0.25 O 2 (LMNM) achieves a capacity retention of 91% after 1000 cycles at 4.3 V operation against graphite by alleviating instability issues. We systematically unravel the pillaring effect, for the first time, from the quantum scale to the lattice level and from the microscale to the macroscopic level of the cathode particles, providing an in-depth understanding of chemo–electro–mechanical degradation.},

As unraveled by in situ spectral investigations and theoretical calculations, the core@satellites microstructure enables the tandem ECO 2 RR pathway to happen at the interfaced Ag and AgCu sites to facilitate C 2 H 5 OH formation, with Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C 2 H 5 OH reaching 61.4% at −100 mA cm −2 . Under light, an intensive localized electric field could be excited in the near-surface region of Ag@AgCu core@satellites, contributing to the increased surface *CO coverage, lowered *COCOH formation barrier and deceased *CHCOH-to-C 2 H 5 OH conversion free energy.

However, the sluggish hydroxyl oxidation kinetics inhibit the HMFOR efficiency. In this study, CuO x H y is grown on Cu foam as a model electrocatalyst to investigate the active phases of the Cu-based catalyst in the HMFOR, elucidate their oxidation mechanisms and adsorption behaviors at varying potentials, and ultimately to reveal the potential-regulated selectivity of the Cu-based catalyst. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Cu III ─OOH, generated from CuO at high potentials, exhibits enhanced catalytic activity, enabling HMFOR to proceed via an indirect oxidation process that favors aldehyde oxidation. A further increase in potential activates the direct oxidation process of Cu III ─OOH, selectively oxidizing hydroxyl groups owing to the increased substrate coverage on the catalyst, which hinders aldehyde adsorption. This study offers a new strategy for enhancing the selectivity towards the oxidation of specific functional groups in value-added biomass conversion processes.},

  abstract     = {The incomplete conversion of sulfur species, particularly the pivotal intermediate solid Li 2 S 2 during redox processes, poses a significant limitation on the cyclability of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a synergistic modulation strategy of ion-/dipole–dipole interactions that tailors the solvation sheath configuration and activates the electrochemical reactivity of Li 2 S 2 is initially proposed for accelerating kinetics. As a proof of concept, the molybdenum nitride quantum dots located on nitrogen-doped carbon (MoNQDs/NC) were designed. Advanced in situ/ex situ characterizations combined with theoretical calculations reveal that MoNQDs/NC effectively weaken the ion-dipole interactions within Li(solvent) x + species, thereby facilitating the desolvation process. Furthermore, the robust dipole–dipole interactions between polar domains of MoNQDs and Li 2 S 2 are realized to generate localized tensile strain fields to destabilize the S─S/Li─S bonds network. Consequently, the optimal cells maintain a high areal capacity (>5.0 mAh cm −2 ) after 50 cycles at high sulfur loading (4.4–9.1 mg cm −2 ) over a wide temperature range (0–60 °C). Furthermore, the pouch cell with a sulfur loading of 1.5 g retained a capacity of 1.79 Ah after 15 cycles, highlighting the potential of this ion-dipole modulation strategy for commercializing LSBs.},

Despite recent advances in biocatalysis, recombinant expression systems for hemoproteins leave much room for improvement due to the strict regulation of heme biosynthesis in the host organism. To develop an efficient cofactor supplementation system for the expression of active holohemoproteins, we describe metabolic engineering of the heme biosynthetic pathway in E. coli . Through incorporation of a heterogeneous C4 pathway involving 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase of Paracoccus denitrificans , it was found that the concentrations of 5-aminolevulinic acid and heme in the engineered cells are increased during cultivation, and the expression level of the holohemoproteins is significantly improved. Notably, the heme content in the engineered cells is even higher than that produced by conventional cultivation methods, which add 5-aminolevulinic acid into the culture medium. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the application of this engineered E. coli cells in whole-cell and lysate-based biocatalysis using various types of heme-dependent enzymes. Considering the recent demand for biocatalysis, the system developed in this study will serve as a new practical and versatile platform for hemoprotein-based biocatalysis.},

Here, we describe a mild, atom-economical, samarium diiodide (Sml 2 )-catalyzed fragmentation and coupling of alkyl and aryl housane ketones with alkenes that grants access to functionalized norbornane structural motifs, not easily accessible by classical cycloaddition approaches, and with considerable potential for further manipulation.},

The Au(I) platform has been useful for the synthesis of isolable transition-metal complexes bearing reactive ligands. Herein we utilize reactions of difluorocarbene with organogold(I) complexes, analogous to reactions of difluorocarbene with organic substrates, to access novel examples of gem -difluoromethylene organometallics. First, difluorocarbene insertion into the R─Au(I) bond of organogold(I) species with free difluorocarbene was demonstrated for the first time, forming alkyl-CF 2 -Au(I) and aryl-CF 2 -Au(I) species. Second, via a difluorocarbene cycloaddition reaction we isolate for the first time a κ 1 -difluorocyclopropenyl-transition metal complex, formed by reaction of alkynylAu(I) complex with free difluorocarbene. Subsequent study of these reaction systems by density functional theory calculations facilitated study of the difluorocarbene insertion reactions, and a comparison of difluorocarbene insertion and cycloaddition pathways in the reaction of difluorocarbene and alkynylAu(I).},

  abstract     = {Fullerene (C 60 ) was considered as a catalyst promoter in various electrochemical reactions, yet its catalytic role in enhancing catalytic performance beyond electron transfer remains a puzzle to chemists. Traditional simulations imply C 60 ’s inertness in CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) due to weak interaction with COOH* intermediates. Here, according to a pH-field coupled microkinetic model at reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, we demonstrate that C 60 acts as molecular active sites to facilitate the CO 2 RR toward CO through a strong binding to COOH* in the electrochemical conditions. This binding is mainly due to the unique structure of C 60 that induces large dipole moment changes to stabilize COOH* intermediates across different pH conditions. By detailed comparison of experimental CO 2 RR observations and quantitative pH-dependent modeling, this work provides new insights on C 60 -based catalysts, highlighting the large dipole moment change upon adsorption at curved surfaces should not be dismissed when analyzing the pH-dependent binding strength and electrocatalytic activity.},

Here, we present a modular and programmable DNA nanocage strategy for constructing stable and adaptive synthetic organelle networks. Using extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a model, we anchored tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDNs) on the EV surface and assembled a mechanically reinforced biomimetic DNA nanocage via palindromic hybridization chain reaction (PHCR), thereby significantly enhancing vesicle stability and effectively preventing membrane fusion upon contact. The modular design enables the integration of logic-gated DNA elements as dynamic contact sites, allowing environment-responsive reconfiguration of inter-artificial-organelle spatial organization and signaling.

The exact olefin geometry, side chain chemotype, and ancillary β-carbon substituents play a significant role. Unfortunately, general approaches to install these motifs into peptides are lacking, complicated by the instability of unsaturated residues during traditional amide-bond coupling and failure of divergent protocols, such as oxidative Heck and Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons, to accommodate a complete range of substrate classes. Herein, we conceive and interrogate an original bioorthogonal reagent, β-sulfonyldehydroamino acid (ΔSulf), that can be site-specifically encoded into standard peptides through solid- or liquid-phase synthesis. When combined with an aqueous flavin photocatalyst, myriad boronic acids and 525 nm light—a more biologically benign portion of the flavin visible absorption spectra that has not previously been exploited for flavin photoredox catalysis,—this latent residue becomes one of several ( Z )-ΔAA variants (aromatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic) via stereoretentive radical conjugate addition and β-scission. The importance of green light is established through mechanistic studies showing that it tempers radical formation and discourages flavin-catalyzed isomerization, controlling product selectivity. We apply our original reagent and catalytic platform in a brief medicinal chemistry campaign to discover tetrapeptides that modulate Aβ42 aggregation for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract     = {Achieving long-term cycling stability in high-temperature lithium metal batteries (LMBs) demands both efficient ion transport and stable electrode interfaces. However, the molecular polarity and strong ionic interactions of conventional electrolytes hinder ion mobility and compromise interfacial stability. In this study, we developed a deep eutectic electrolyte based on Li-bond (Li-DEE) comprising tetraethylammonium nitrate and lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, which is different from the traditional hydrogen bonding or lithium ionic bonding electrolyte. The Li-bond network within the Li-DEE enables rapid lithium-ion transport (6.5 × 10 − 3 S cm −1 at 100 °C) while forming a stable electrode interface rich in Li 3 N and LiF. As a result, the Li-DEE enables an LMB to deliver a high capacity retention of 80% over 635 cycles at 0.5 C and a capacity of 84.4 mAh g −1 after 1500 cycles at 2 C and 100 °C. This study provides valuable insights for designing next-generation electrolytes that function under extreme operating conditions.},

  abstract     = {Electrophilic halogenation is a fundamentally useful transformation, and Lewis basic selenium catalysts together with N -haloimides are known to promote the reaction under mild conditions. Selenourea is a frequently used platform for the Lewis base catalyst design. In literature, it is generally believed that the Lewis basic selenium can form a Lewis adduct with the halogen as the active halogenating species. Herein, we report our recent finding that unveils an alternative mechanism of this type of reaction. It was found that the Lewis basic selenourea is first oxidized by the halogen source to give a benchtop stable and non-hygroscopic imidazolium hypervalent selenium dibromide compound that acts as the actual catalyst. The negative charge in the hypervalent selenium compound is stabilized by the electronegative bromide, leading to the site-isolated and unoccupied imidazolium cationic moiety. Mechanistic studies suggest that the electropositive C–Hs of the imidazolium cation can act as a strong hydrogen bond donor to activate the N -haloimide reagent for efficient halogenation reaction, including late-stage halogenation of drug molecules, with low catalyst loading. Further study revealed that hypervalent imidazolium selenium dibromide can generally be applied to other mechanistically unrelated hydrogen bond-catalyzed reactions.},

Here, we report a formal cyclopropylation of imines with cyclopropanols, enabling the construction of previously inaccessible cyclopropane-embedded γ-amino alcohols. This transformation leverages the unique reactivity of enolized zinc homoenolates, which effectively act as a β-hydroxycyclopropyl anions and engage imines through a sequence of Mannich addition and ring closure. The key to this reactivity lies in the use of bulky N -heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, which promote efficient coupling with N -sulfonyl aldimines as well as chiral N -sulfinyl trifluoromethyl-ketimines while ensuring excellent diastereocontrol over three contiguous stereocenters. Furthermore, the resulting γ-amino alcohols can be transformed into β- or γ-aminofunctionalized ketones via homoenolate or β-keto radical intermediates, offering versatile platforms for downstream derivatization.},

  abstract     = {The micromorphology of composite cathodes is known to play a vital role in determining all-solid-state battery (ASSB) performance. However, much of our current understanding is derived from empirical observations, lacking a deeper mechanistic foundation. The “rocking chair” concept of battery chemistry requires maintaining charge neutrality, emphasizing the necessity of examining electrode micromorphology from the perspective of conductive networks. This study systematically investigates the microscopic electrochemical impacts of conductive network micromorphology by varying the Li + -to-e − channel ratio in cathodes comprising LiNbO 3 -coated LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 , Li 6 PS 5 Cl, and carbon fibers. Utilizing multiscale synchrotron-based spectro-microscopy, we unravel that unbalanced Li + and e − conducting channels intensify charge polarization within active cathode particles and accelerate their degradation. A further model system with X-ray nano-tomography resolved e − and Li + channels indicates that spatially uniform and well-paired Li + and e − conducting channels are highly desirable as they could promote more uniform lithiation/delithiation, mitigating microscopic electrochemical polarization. Electrode-scale X-ray holotomography analysis reveals that the impact of conductive networks is particle-size-dependent, with smaller cathode particles being more significantly affected. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the interplay between conductive networks and all-solid-state battery operation, laying the groundwork for rational design and optimization of cathode architectures in future solid-state battery technologies.},

  abstract     = {All the objects that surround us can be seen as combinations of elementary shapes like spheres, rods, and squares that perform complex tasks when connected in a well-defined manner. While making a device by assembling those shapes remains relatively easy at the human scale, it is extremely challenging to do so at the nanoscale, due to the difficulty to covalently attach at a defined position a nano-object with a given shape to another one of different geometry. To circumvent this hurdle, here, we introduce an innovative approach that consists in performing polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) onto core-crystalline micelles prepared by crystallization-driven self-assembly (CDSA). Because of the intrinsic properties of CDSA, one can construct one- or two-dimensional substrates to initiate PISA at very specific locations. Performing CDSA- substrated -PISA (CDSA- s -PISA) onto triblock co-micelles where only the central block was PISA active, led to the formation of elongated structures bearing one or two beads on their central parts, while CDSA- s -PISA on entirely PISA active micelles and in presence of free macro-CTA, allowed the preparation of uniform elongated micelles fully decorated with beads. These results offer a sneak peek of what the next generation of multitasks polymeric assemblies will be.},

In the trans -state, azobenzene enables unhindered sliding of macrocycles along the polymer backbone, yielding a softer, more ductile material. UV-induced switching to the sterically demanding cis -configuration restricts ring mobility, thereby increasing the Young's modulus by two-fold while reducing toughness. Control experiments with noninterlocked analogs revealed the opposite mechanical response—light-induced softening—highlighting the pivotal role of topology in property regulation. Furthermore, the azobenzene linkage confers controlled degradability under mild conditions. This work establishes a versatile strategy for post-synthetic topological control via molecular photoswitches, enabling the design of adaptive polymers with stimuli-responsive mechanical properties for applications in smart materials.},

Conventional biological and chemical synthetic approaches suffer from low efficiency and elevated energy demands. While emerging thermocatalysis and photocatalysis strategies offer promising alternatives, their environmental sustainability is substantially constrained by their reliance on Haber–Bosch-derived ammonia as a nitrogen source, which contributes to a significant carbon footprint. Here we developed a hybrid thermochemical-plasma-electrochemical system for sustainable alanine synthesis directly from end-of-life polylactic acid (PLA) plastic using atmospheric nitrogen as a nitrogen source. The synthetic pathway for alanine production initiates with the thermocatalytic oxidative depolymerization of PLA to pyruvic acid (PA) in aqueous medium under mild conditions (140 °C, 1 MPa air), utilizing a Pt/SiO 2 catalyst with high impurity tolerance. Concurrently, a nitrate-enriched solution is generated through plasma-mediated activation of air and water under ambient conditions. Subsequently, the PA and nitrate solutions are mixed and directly introduced to the electrochemical reactor. We employ a strain-engineered CuBi alloy electrocatalyst capable of stably catalyzing alanine production via co-electrolysis of PA and nitrate. This integrated process establishes a sustainable pathway to valorize low-cost feedstocks into high-value commodity chemicals using renewable energy while mitigating plastic pollution.},

The key features of this chemistry include 1) stereoselective addition of the difluoro(sulfoximidoyl)methyl anion to C═C bonds, although it was considered to be highly unfavorable from the view of hard–soft acid–base (HSAB) theory; 2) intriguing neighboring group participation of the oxygen from the nitro group that was found to play a crucial role in controlling the stereoselectivity and efficiency of the transformation and was supported by mechanistic experiments and DFT calculations. This method has been applied to the late-stage modification of several complex molecules and the preparation of enantioenriched bioactive γ-fluorinated amines, such as a phytopathogenic fungi inhibitor, TRPC6 and CDK11 inhibitors, and even monofluorinated lorcaserin, which further demonstrated the significance and potential of this approach.},

Electrolyte additives, especially organic molecule additives, provide an effective and cost-efficient strategy to address these issues. To efficiently screen a large number of organic molecules for developing new electrolyte additives, we employ an artificial intelligence-driven approach, using graph neural network to analyze 75 024 organic molecules based on three key properties, including adsorption energies on Zn(002) surface, redox potentials, and water solubility. We identified 48 promising candidate molecules by this high-throughput screening method, among which cyanoacetamide (CA) and hydantoin (HN) were experimentally validated as novel electrolyte additives for AZIBs that have not been reported previously. The experimental and calculation results demonstrate that CA and HN preferentially adsorb onto the surface of the zinc anode, resulting in the enhanced interfacial stability of zinc anodes. This behavior effectively mitigates zinc dendrite formation, contributing to the improved stability and reversibility of the zinc electrode. It is believed that our work combines AI-assisted high-throughput research, experimental validation, and theoretical calculations, providing a scalable framework for selecting and developing new electrolyte additive molecules.},

Different acetylation patterns of CP5 create microheterogeneous polymers, carrying partial zwitterionic character, which may be important for immunological activity. We here report on the assembly of a set of conjugation-ready CP5 oligosaccharides, ranging in length from trisaccharides to nonasaccharides. The developed protecting group strategy has allowed the incorporation of N- acetyl, -NH 3 + and O -acetyl groups. The reported syntheses offer solutions for the construction of the challenging cis -glycosidic linkages, the incorporation of many different functional groups and the installation of an appropriate linker for future conjugation purposes. Conformational analysis of the O -acetylated oligomers has revealed a distinctive linear conformation with the repeating units (RUs) being flipped ∼180° with respect to the flanking RUs. Binding studies with CP5-antibodies revealed the trisaccharide to be too short for relevant binding, while the hexa- and nonasaccharides exhibited strong binding.

We find that sticky-end LNA modifications decrease base-pair spacing and enhance base-stacking energy, which synergistically improves interstrand affinity and accelerates hybridization rate constants, as revealed by strand displacement kinetics, molecular dynamics simulations, and small-angle X-ray scattering analysis. This LNA-based base-stacking engineering strategy can finely tune base-stacking energy landscapes to drive anisotropic growth and morphological control in self-assembled DNA crystal. We further establish a quantitative framework for probing structure–energy relationships in base-stacking interactions, which not only paves the way for better control of structural DNA nanotechnology but also provides mechanistic insights for developing dynamic DNA nanosystems.},

  abstract     = {The selective separation of hydrocarbons such as styrene ( ST ) and ethylbenzene ( EB ) remains a formidable challenge in the petrochemical industry due to their nearly identical molecular structures and physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a robust, water-soluble, metal-free tetracationic cyclophane ( B ) capable of achieving >99% selective extraction of ST from EB in aqueous media with excellent recyclability. B features a hydrophobic, conformationally adaptive cavity (∼6.5 Å × 14.3 Å) that selectively recognizes planar over nonplanar guests in aqueous medium. Solution-state and solid-state analyses confirm that the preferential binding of ST is driven by favorable interactions with its vinyl group and induced planarization of the host. B also distinguishes phenanthrene ( P ) from 9,10-dihydroanthracene ( DHA ), further validating its precision in shape-selective molecular recognition. Our findings demonstrate a unique aqueous separation of ST from EB employing a metal-free receptor that advances the design of selective host–guest systems and supports greener alternatives for hydrocarbon purification.},

However, the selective functionalization of molecules where multiple acetalization reactions can occur typically involves multiple protection/deprotection steps. Here, we show that zeolites can be used to size-selectively acetalize sugars and polyols in a single step, and we demonstrate the potential of this approach for producing functional chemicals and materials. We show that high selectivity is dependent on effective pore confinement, which is achieved by a careful pairing of the substrate size and the zeolite morphology. This zeolite-catalyzed strategy exhibited consistently good-to-excellent yields (70%–95%) of novel polyol/sugar monoacetals, notably offering an easy route to bio-based amphiphiles. These resulting xylose-based surfactants exhibited similar or superior surface activity and, remarkably, hard-water resistance compared to their nonrenewable ethoxylated analogues, which illustrates the potential for practical applications of this approach.},

Here, we demonstrate a transformative approach by converting CO poisoning into a beneficial strategy to achieve high activity and selectivity in urea electrosynthesis. We designed a multiscale and multisite nanoreactor composed of copper–carbon dots (Cu-CDs) and bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4 ), which exploits CO-poisoned iron sites as anchors to facilitate efficient multi-species integration. This nanoreactor configuration delivers an unprecedented C urea - selectivity of 100%, a high urea yield rate of 1131.84 µg h −1 mg cat −1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 42.35% at an ultra-low potential. Consequently, the catalyst achieves exceptional dual benefits of a high yield rate and low energy consumption of 31.18 kWh kg urea −1 , outperforming all previously reported earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between Fe and *CO, coupled with spatially separated yet adjacent Fe, Cu 1 , and Cu 2 sites, enables stepwise conversion from *CO to *CONH 2 and subsequently to *CO(NH 2 ) 2 within the nano-confined space dominated by Cu-CDs. This work provides a groundbreaking catalyst design strategy by effectively harnessing CO poisoning for enhanced electrocatalytic performance.},

However, the practical application of COFs for scalable solar-to-hydrogen conversion remains limited due to their insufficient photocatalytic efficiencies. Herein, we achieved an exceptionally high hydrogen evolution rate of 364 mmol g −1 h −1 using HCl-protonated COF-920 under ultraviolet-visible light, as confirmed by water-drainage and gas-gathering experiments, exceeding most previously reported COF-based photocatalysts. Three series of isoreticular COFs were synthesized, incorporating benzene, biphenyl, and triphenyl linkers, along with their structural isomers featuring reversed imine bond orientations, to systematically investigate the collaborative influences of linker length, structural isomerism, and protonation on the photocatalytic performance. Experimental results revealed that COFs employing biphenyl-based linkers exhibited superior photocatalytic activity compared to those with benzene or triphenyl linkers. Moreover, the performance difference resulting from variations in imine orientation decreases with increasing linker length, supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealing narrower energy differences between units connected by imine bonds (─C═N─). Our findings not only provide new insights into structure–activity relationships in COF photocatalysts but also highlight the potential of COF materials for sustainable solar-to-fuel conversion.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to formate offers a sustainable pathway for carbon-neutral fuel production, yet achieving high selectivity and activity remains challenging due to competing hydrogen evolution. While grain boundaries (GBs) enhance catalytic performance, the impact of GB density, uniformity, and twisting angles remains unclear. Here, we engineer SnS nanoplates with high-density GBs via cation exchange (CE), preserving sulfur frameworks while inducing strain-driven domain segmentation. The GB-SnS catalyst achieves a formate Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.9% at −1.0 V RHE , with a partial current density of 204.6 mA cm −2 at −1.2 V RHE , surpassing single-crystalline (SC) SnS by 3.5-fold. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) reveal high-angle GBs lower *OCHO stabilization barriers while suppressing *H adsorption. Counterintuitively, small-angle GBs raise the *OCHO barrier, impairing CO 2 RR—a finding that challenges the assumption that all GBs benefit catalysis. DFT further predicts out-of-plane rotational GBs similarly enhance stabilization, guiding future 3D defect engineering. The catalyst demonstrates industrial viability in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), sustaining >80% FE at 200 mA cm −2 for 150 h. Statistical analysis of >200 GBs correlates twisting angles with adsorption strength, establishing an angle-dependent design principle. This work decouples geometric/electronic GB effects and pioneers solution-phase CE for scalable defect-rich catalysts, advancing sustainable CO 2 utilization.},

  abstract     = {Na 3 Zr 2 Si 2 PO 12 (NZSP) has stimulated considerable attention due to its remarkable ionic conductivity and exceptional chemical/electrochemical stability. However, an unstable electrolyte/electrode interface and large interface resistance severely restricted its practical application. To settle this issue, an interface-targeting integrated sandwich-like NZSP composite electrolyte was constructed by designing an artificial interface layer on both the anode and cathode sides. The uniformly deposited SbF 3 layer on the anode side of NZSP instantly formed a Na x Sb/NaF-rich conductive layer during discharging, which effectively suppressed the growth of Na dendrites. The flexible PVDF layer on the cathode side of NZSP mitigated volume expansion/contraction and thus enhanced the poor solid–solid interfacial contact. Befitting the unique interface design, the Na/SbF 3 -NZSP-SbF 3 /Na symmetric cells demonstrated a critical current density of up to 1.9 mA cm −2 and achieved ultra-stable plating/stripping cycling over 2600 h at 0.1 and 0.2 mA cm −2 , respectively. Noticeably, the Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /PVDF-NZSP-SbF 3 /Na full cells attained a high capacity retention of 90.0% after 2100 cycles at 0.5 C. Even for a high mass loading of 10.33 mg cm −2 , Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 /PVDF-NZSP-SbF 3 /Na has no capacity attenuation over 50 cycles at 0.1 C. This bilateral interface design strategy promotes the utilization of NZSP electrolytes and offers an avenue for the development of solid-state sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).},

  abstract     = {Rational molecular design at the perovskite/hole transport layer (HTL) interface presents a viable strategy to suppress nonradiative recombination in CsPbI 3-x Br x -based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, simultaneously achieving efficient defect passivation and rapid charge extraction with a single molecular modifier remains challenging. Herein, we employ a planar conjugated molecule, 1,8-naphthyridin-2-amine (2-NA), as a multifunctional interfacial modifier that concurrently enhances charge extraction and suppresses interfacial recombination in CsPbI 3-x Br x PSCs. Combined density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental analyses reveal that 2-NA forms a dense protective layer via noncovalent interactions (e.g., π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding), effectively passivating undercoordinated Pb 2+ while inhibiting ion migration. Remarkably, 2-NA incorporation facilitates hot-carrier extraction, reducing the carrier cooling time from 515 to 240 fs and quadrupling the carrier diffusion length, thereby improving charge transport. As a result, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.49%, the highest reported value for this class of PSCs to date. Furthermore, the device retains 93.6% of its initial PCE after 1008 h under ambient conditions, demonstrating exceptional stability. This work offers a promising molecular engineering approach for enhancing the performance and durability of inorganic PSCs through interfacial modification.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the environmental persistence of plastics requires the development of next-generation polymers that combine high performance with enhanced degradability. Progress toward this grand challenge has been impeded, in part, by the absence of a general blueprint for the macromolecular design of such materials. Herein, we introduce a “macroisostere” design strategy, where the carbonyl group (–CO–) in polyurethanes (PUs) is replaced with a sulfonyl group (–SO 2 –), resulting in a virtually unknown family of polymers called polysulfamates. This approach, inspired by the use of bioisosteres in drug discovery, aims to preserve key interchain interactions that contribute to thermomechanical performance while enhancing the hydrolytic lability of the polymer backbone. The optimization of a Sulfur(VI) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) polymerization allowed the synthesis of ten polysulfamates structurally analogous to common PUs. Comparative analysis of one PU and its polysulfamate analog showed that this isosteric substitution increases thermal stability, slightly lowers the glass transition temperature, and retains similar hardness and reduced Young's modulus. Notably, the S(VI)-based polysulfamate demonstrated significantly enhanced hydrolytic degradability. These results highlight the potential of the “macroisostere” approach as a generalizable strategy for designing high-performance, degradable alternatives to traditional plastics.},

Herein, we proposed a novel strategy by integration of metallosalen (M-Salen) active sites and Zr-MOF, to promote the selective production of syngas through photocatalytic CO 2 and H 2 O reduction. A series of M-Salen (Co, Co 2 , Cu, Cu 2 ) with carboxylic groups were embedded into a Zr-MOF (NKM-908) by replacing the terminal coordinated -OH - /H 2 O on the Zr 6 clusters. The integration of M-Salen and NKM-908 significantly accelerate the transfer dynamics of photogenerated charge and promote CO 2 enrichment around the M-Salen active sites. The M-Salen sites played a crucial role in enhancing CO production. Specifically, the mononuclear Co-Salen exhibits stronger CO 2 adsorption and activation capabilities than the binuclear Co 2 -Salen, with enhanced *CO 2 coverage. In addition, the Co-based salen catalyst exhibits a lower energy barrier for *CO desorption—the rate-determining step—compared to its Cu-based counterpart. As a result, the Co-NKM-908 exhibited optimal performance in photocatalytic CO 2 and H 2 O conversion, achieving a high CO production rate of 1.92 mmol g −1 h −1 and a H 2 production rate of 1.52 mmol g −1 h −1 with a standard syngas CO/H 2 ratio of 1.3/1.},

Luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) are frequently combined with fluorescent dyes or proteins in FRET. However, their use in inter-NP FRET with luminescent NPs as both donor and acceptor remains less common due to the inherent size constraints that can limit FRET efficiencies. This review critically examines the early advances and current state-of-the-art of inter-NP FRET with a focus on the most commonly used NPs, namely quantum dots (QDs), upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), and fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs). We show how NP sizes, surface shells, and coatings increase FRET-distances; propose how these drawbacks can be overcome or outcompeted by the unique photophysical properties of the NPs; and discuss representative examples of inter-NP FRET for biosensing. High luminescence brightness, outstanding photostability, near-infrared excitation and emission, spectral and temporal multiplexing, and large surfaces for multifunctional bioconjugation are only some of the features that make luminescent NPs very attractive for biosensing, and FRET efficiencies up to 90% have demonstrated their potential for successful translation into bioanalytical applications.},

To investigate chirality-driven self-assembly, two classes of chiral building blocks, photo-responsive (cinnamic glutamide derivative, L/D-CG) and fluorescent molecules (dansyl glutamide derivative, L/D-DNSG), were designed and integrated into homochiral systems (L-CG/L-DNSG or D-CG/D-DNSG) and heterochiral systems (L-CG/D-DNSG or D-CG/L-DNSG). Either homo- or heterochiral systems could form organogels with fibrous structures. Upon photoirradiation, the homochiral systems remained stable, whereas the heterochiral systems underwent a significant transformation from uniform organogels to suspensions, in which nanokebab structures appeared. The results demonstrate that social self-sorting dominates in the homochiral systems while narcissistic self-sorting prevails in the heterochiral systems. Remarkably, the difference between homochiral and heterochiral systems is magnified through photodimerization. Various characterizations and simulations unveil the underlying homo- and heterochiral interactions that drive narcissistic self-sorting from the molecular to hierarchical nanoscale levels. This work decrypts the narcissistic or social self-sorting behavior in chirality-driven supramolecular systems through photoirradiation and provides a new perspective for understanding the regulation of chiral-driven functions in biological or material systems.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state artificial photosystems need precise control over their singlet or triplet excited states to enable desired photochemical transformations. While persistent triplets are often selected to drive chemical bond formation or spin-specific photoreactions, singlets can allow for ambient applications. Among different heterogeneous systems, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) offer a solution-stable platform with many benefits, including large chemically accessible interior surfaces where excitons can be transferred from their original formation sites. Porphyrins demonstrate high intersystem crossing efficiency, with QY ISC ≈ 80% for free-base (FB) cores, which can be increased to about 92% for palladium-metalated cores. This study shows that framework assembly prevents ISC in FB-MOFs; whereas, ISC is enhanced in Pd-MOFs compared to monomeric linkers. The MOF topology influences the excited state dynamics, resulting in short-lived triplets with τ 0.5 ≲10 ps in microporous MOFs. This extensive control over QY ISC (from 0 to approximately 100%) and triplet behavior through framework assembly offers new design principles for creating artificial photosystems that operate exclusively in their singlet or triplet states manifold.},

Here we disclose that a bioinspired peptide-phosphonium salt (PPS) catalytic system successfully enables precise desymmetrization of phosphinic acids through synergistic ion-pairing and hydrogen-bonding interactions. This strategy affords multifunctional platform molecules bearing P(V)-stereocenters with excellent enantiocontrol and broad compatibility (43 examples, up to 92% yield, up to >99% ee) at very low catalyst loading (1 mol%). Furthermore, the P(V)-chiral building blocks undergo stereospecific derivatization to access structurally diverse phosphinates (27 examples, up to 75% yield, up to >99% ee) and tertiary phosphine oxides (10 examples). Mechanistic studies reveal that the stereochemical origin is from a semi-enclosed chiral cavity, where dynamic electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions synergistically orchestrate the stereodetermining transition state. The two-stage desymmetrization–derivatization process establishes a versatile platform for modular synthesis of valuable P(V)-stereogenic pharmaceuticals and functional molecules.},

The optimized Co 3 O 4 @CuO catalyst exhibits a superb nitrate reduction performance, including a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 93.4 % at an ampere-level current density of approximately 2500 mA cm −2 .

Herein, we demonstrate a chlorine-modified ZrO 2 supported Pd catalyst (Pd-Cl/ZrO 2 ) efficiently converting lignin to cyclohexanones under optimized reaction conditions, based on poplar RCF (reductive catalytic fractionation) lignin oil. Notably, the addition of trace HCl enables the catalytic process to proceed under milder conditions (200 °C), achieving a cyclohexanones yield of 34.3 wt% (relative to lignin content in poplar biomass). The acidity (H⁺) from HCl promotes dehydroxylation of lignin oil. Moreover, studies on model compound guaiacol reveal that Cl species may partially block Pd to suppress aromatic ring hydrogenation and promote electron transfer from Pd to the ZrO 2 support, collectively promoting ketone yield. This study presents a novel catalytic approach for the efficient and selective conversion of lignin, advancing biorefineries toward the direct synthesis of ketone derivatives.},

However, metal/semimetal anodes contributing to high theoretical capacity are prone to creep at high temperatures, which raises significant concerns about battery safety and cycling performance. Here, we identify the generation of Li-rich phases at anodes that leads to the sustained degradation of high-temperature batteries. The non-conformal interface between anode and electrolyte constricts lithiation in local contact areas, resulting in extremely low chemical potential and subsequent evolution of high temperature unstable Li-rich phases. We therefore designed a heat-resistant anode featuring a Zintl-like phase core and an ion-electron co-conducting conformal coating, which releases local constriction while inhibiting high-temperature interfacial deactivation. Consequently, solid-state battery (SSB) assembled with this designed anode can stably cycle over 1,000 cycles at 120 °C (2C, pouch cell-340 Wh kg −1 ). Particularly distinguishing itself from molten salt high-temperature batteries, the SSB exhibits outstanding temperature adaptability in full-temperature dynamic tests (−40–150 °C).},

Controlling the reversible uptake of functional molecules, however, remains a major challenge. To address this, we developed a novel aniline-type diarylethene (DAE) crosslinker and prepared a series of corresponding poly( N -vinylcaprolactam)-based microgels with varying degrees of DAE crosslinker. Upon UV light irradiation, the aniline (and thus enamine) motif of the DAE is converted to its imine form, thus allowing for reversible exchange with primary amines. Irradiating the DAE with blue light covalently locks the equilibrium and traps the amine in the microgels. The light-controlled covalent binding of fluorinated, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic amine derivatives was proven by dynamic light scattering and 19 F NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, the impact of photoisomerization and amine binding on microgel properties was investigated and we were able to remotely control size as well as temperature and pH responsiveness by light. Overall, this study demonstrates optically gated uptake and release of functional amines in multi-responsive microgels and highlights their potential biological applications.},

This study reports a simple metallaphotoredox-catalyzed C(sp 2 )─C(sp 3 ) cross-electrophile coupling (XEC) method for the selective coupling of a broad range of aryl chlorides and alkyl halides. By design, this methodology exploits the enabling interplay of a bidentate 2-(1 H -imidazol-2-yl)pyridine ligand, incorporating the strong σ-donor capacity of a 1 H -imidazole moiety with the moderate π-acceptor capacity of a pyridine unit. The synergy provided by these modular components allowed for the electronic requirements of elementary steps to be accommodated, such as the synchronous integration of alkyl radical generation (typically relatively fast) and oxidative addition of low valent nickel species to aryl chlorides (often relatively slow). This protocol enabled the efficient late-stage diversification of the drugs Me -fenofibrate, indomethacin, and etoricoxib to enhance their sp 3 -rich complexity.

In this study, we provide a solution to this long-lasting problem by introducing a new concept, asymmetric dynamic bond mediated polymerization (ADBP). In this case, the polymerization between asymmetric and reversibly deactivated AA’-type dielectrophiles and B 2 -type dinucleophiles has a preferential reaction pathway between the functionality A’ of the asymmetric AA’ monomer with B 2 . We observe that this polymerization allows us to achieve better control of the step-growth process where in the first stage only well-defined trimers and dimers are primarily formed up to conversion ( p ) ≤ 0.6, followed by their polymerization stage ( p ≥ 0.6). This leads to polymers with reduced Đ (<1.5), in comparison to traditional SGP, and improved molar mass control. Such technique is further exploited to prepare polyurethanes with Đ = 1.2, which exhibit the ability to form microphase-separated domains with higher ordering, giving rise to polyurethane thermosets with superior mechanical properties compared to a traditional SGP analog.},

However, recent advances have highlighted the significance of Au(I)/Au(III) redox transitions, unlocking new catalytic pathways.

Despite its potential, the electrochemical properties of key gold complexes remain largely underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate the oxidative behavior of a series of gold complexes using cyclic voltammetry. A comprehensive electrochemical scale is established, revealing that N -heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-based gold complexes are among the least prone to oxidation, whereas phosphorylated ligands significantly enhance oxidizability. Within triphenylphosphine gold complexes, the nature of the X-type anionic ligand plays a crucial role in determining oxidative behavior, a trend rationalized through density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Additionally, hemilabile P^N ligands dramatically facilitate oxidation, correlating with their ability to promote oxidative addition. These findings provide fundamental insights into the redox properties of gold complexes, offering valuable guidelines for the design of new gold-catalyzed transformations.},

  abstract     = {The modification of interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to achieve mitigation of carrier transport barriers and suppression of non-radiative recombination is essential for enhancing PSC efficiency and stability. In this study, two small dipole-functionalized molecules, 1,4-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzene and 1,4-di(thiazol-2-yl)benzene, were synthesized and effectively anchored onto perovskite surfaces via Lewis acid-base interactions to improve the quality of perovskite grain boundaries and reduce non-radiative recombination. The dual-passivation-site dipole-functionalized molecules strategically modulate the interfaces, establishing a gradient energy level alignment, that facilitates carrier extraction and transport. As a result, the optimal n-i-p PSC achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.85% alongside enhanced operational stability under simulated 1-sun illumination over 1200 h. A large-area device with an area of 1 cm 2 also exhibited a PCE of 24.79%. Our study provides fundamental insights into the role of dipole molecules in defect passivation for further development of interfacial engineering strategies for high-performance perovskite optoelectronic devices.},

This study applies an innovative membrane-free silicon nanodialysis (ND) probe coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze the extracellular neuropeptidome in the mouse S1 with spatial resolution down to 100 µm. Localized in vivo sampling identified extracellular peptides from secretogranin-1, ProSAAS, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and others. Minimal tissue damage, enabled by probe dimensions of 75 × 15 µm 2 , resulted in an absence of structural peptides in the dialysate indicating low intracellular contamination. Many detected secretory peptides correlated with strong local mRNA expression; however, the detection of POMC-derived peptides, despite negligible local expression, suggests long-distance peptide transport or extracellular processing. To expand peptide identification, a discovery-to-targeted peptidomic approach was developed, revealing 46 peptides from 24 proteins in dialysate samples, including 10 proteins with low local expression. Complementary S1 tissue analysis confirmed POMC peptides and showed that 17% of 304 prohormone-derived peptides had low local expression. These results uncover a complex extracellular peptide landscape shaped by both local and long-distance signaling. By overcoming the limitations of traditional microdialysis, this approach advances the understanding of neuropeptide signaling in cortical function.},

Unlike the well-known Au, Ag and Cu nanoparticles (NPs), in which hot carriers are directly formed by absorption of visible light, Pt NPs still have limited hot carriers photogeneration ability. Nonetheless, Pt's unique d-band structure permits a high density of electronic states near Fermi energy. It should have exhibited photoenhanced catalysis. Here, guided by finite-different-time-domain (FDTD) calculations, we take advantage of Pt electronic structure by designing a sub-100 nm colloidosome (Cs) consisted of ultrasmall (≤ 5 nm) Pt NPs with broadband absorption from visible to near-infrared (NIR) band. The ultrasmall Pt NPs in the Cs efficiently generated hot electrons even under excitation with the low-energy electromagnetic radiation. The key for realization of Cs is the exploitation of laser-generated, grain boundaries (GBs) enriched Mn 3 O 4 NPs as scaffolds for the efficient and homogeneous loading of ultrasmall Pt NPs. These Pt Cs show outstanding performances as catalase (CAT) and oxidase (OXD) mimics under NIR band irradiation, allowing their use for photocatalysis of oxidation reactions. Besides, the in vivo exploitation of Pt Cs for tumor photodynamic therapy allowed unprecedented efficacy and caused tumor growth suppression.},

This dependency introduces stability challenges and complicates device fabrication due to the traditional air-oxidation doping process, which is time-consuming, unpredictable, and requires continuous monitoring of device variability. Here, we propose two triphenyl sulfonium (TPS) salts as UV-light-triggered radical-generating dopants for 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis [ N,N -di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene(spiro-OMeTAD). These dopants eliminate the need for air-based oxidation, thereby simplifying fabrication while enhancing the electrical properties of spiro-OMeTAD through efficient p-type doping. Using this approach, we achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 25.18%, surpassing the performance of traditional doping methods. Notably, PSCs incorporating TPS dopants and cost-effective silver top-electrodes demonstrated exceptional stability under various operational conditions. This work presents a scalable, cost-effective doping strategy that addresses critical stability-efficiency trade-offs in PSCs, positioning them as viable contenders for commercial renewable energy applications.},

Innovatively, an n-type 2D perovskite functional layer featuring a distinctive edge/corner-sharing (E/C-sharing) [PbI 6 ] 4− octahedral framework is constructed on a 3D film surface by utilizing N -methylethylenediamine cations (MEDA 2+ ) to regulate the connection modes of [PbI 6 ] 4− octahedral units. Specifically, the 2D-MEDAPb 2 I 6 with the E/C-sharing octahedra yields the narrowest interlayer spacing recorded to date (8.39 Å) among 2D perovskites, thus boosting the octahedral interlayer coupling effect and weakening the quantum and dielectric confinement effect to improve carrier mobility. Additionally, the 2D capping layer reinforces surface lattice stability by inducing a compressive stress field and increasing defect formation energy. The resulting type-II 3D/2D heterojunction significantly lowers the interfacial energy barriers for electron transfer and reduces the carrier recombination losses. Consequently, the inverted PSCs achieve an optimal efficiency of 26.43% (certified at 26.10%) and maintain over 94% of their initial efficiency after operating for 1200 hours under simulated AM 1.5G illumination. This research provides a unique perspective for developing novel 2D perovskites in perovskite-based photovoltaics.},

Due to the increased torsion degree of the helicene backbone and the improved helical chiral molecular self-consistency, P and M enantiomers of A7HPA molecules tend to stack in an alternating pattern similar to “gear mesh,” leading to reinforced intermolecular π–π interactions and conjugation effect to rigidify the hole transport layer. Consequently, the A7HPA-based single-junction wide bandgap PSC and perovskite-silicon tandem solar cell exhibited impressive long-term stability under both damp-heat and light-thermal synergetic stress tests and provided 23.41% and 33.06% (certified as 32.57%) power conversion efficiencies, respectively.},

So, we propose an encapsulation-confined strategy, by which a poriferous Ni(OH) 2 on Pt nanocages (thereafter Pt/Ni(OH) 2 ) was spatially wrapped to regulate charge transfer. As the heterogeneous interface enables spreading the surface electric field, the wrapped Ni(OH) 2 layer not only optimizes the proton-coupled electron dynamics but also stabilizes the Pt sites via undifferentiated adsorption of solvent molecules in the IHP, as demonstrated by using identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM). Consequently, the Pt/Ni(OH) 2 (11.85 mA/mg Pt at an overpotential of 70 mV) achieves an excellent mass activity of 12.74 times higher than the commercial Pt/C and long-term durability in 1 M KOH.

  abstract     = {Cascade metathesis polymerization (CMP) offers a powerful route to complex yet precise polymer microstructures. However, achieving both high cascade selectivity and polymerization efficiency remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report our efforts to enhance cascade efficiency (CE) in CMP of various dicycloalkenes and explore their closed-loop chemical recycling. A comprehensive investigation revealed that second-generation Grubbs catalysts ( G2 and DIPP-G2 ) exhibited superior cascade selectivity (CE up to >99%) and polymerization efficiency (turnover numbers up to 3550) compared to first-generation Grubbs catalyst ( G1 ). This is attributed to a preferred intramolecular cascade pathway that suppresses competing ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). Polymers with high CE showed markedly improved glass transition temperatures ( T g ), by up to 47 °C. Remarkably, in-depth studies on sulfonamide-based dicycloalkenes uncovered an unexpected intramolecular cascade transformation, forming new bicyclic monomers, which underwent ROMP and yielded highmolecular-weight polymers ( M n up to 141 kDa). Importantly, these well-defined polymers underwent selective and complete depolymerization into small molecules via reverse CMP or ROMP, which then were repolymerized thereby achieving closed-loop recycling. Computational studies explained how these small molecules were preferentially formed. Overall, this work underscores the potential of our insights (understanding the detailed mechanistic pathways of CMP transformation depending on catalysts and monomer structures) toward sustainable chemical recycling.},

While silicon-based anodes are in industrial use, commercial alloying-type anodes still suffer from excessive volume expansion and inadequate cycle life. Even incorporating silicon-carbon composites within graphite (typically <20% in commercial products) fails to resolve these limitations. Herein, we report a novel SrGe 2 O 4 S anode for ultralong-cycling lithium storage. An oxysulfide matrix (Li₂O/SrS) was in situ formed around Ge nanodomains. Enabled by the strong covalency of soft S 2 ⁻ anions and the pinning effect of large Sr 2 ⁺ ions, this synergistic matrix has demonstrated capabilities to enhance interfacial compatibility with Ge, facilitate efficient Li⁺ transport, suppress agglomeration of Ge nanoparticles and buffer volume expansion, as evidenced by in/ex situ characterizations, density functional theory calculations, and finite element analysis simulations. The anode harvests a low charging medium voltage of 0.42 V and reversible capacity of 587 mA h g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 after 800 cycles (8300 h) with 93.2% capacity retention. The LiCoO 2 ||SrGe 2 O 4 S full cell delivers a high capacity of 142 mA h g −1 and energy density of 482 Wh kg −1 . This work sheds light on constructing functional matrix to relieve volume expansion and particle agglomeration of high-capacity ultralong-cycling alloying-type anodes.},

  abstract     = {Scintillators can convert high-energy ionizing radiation, such as X-ray, into low-energy ultraviolet-visible photons, and they have been widely used in various fields. However, like most luminogens, the emission intensity of a scintillator is usually influenced by the environmental temperature, increasing the temperature results in extreme decreases in radioluminescence. Here, a temperature-inert coinage metal cluster scintillator of Cu 4 S was prepared, and it exhibited not only intense radioluminescence at room temperature but also minimal fluctuations from 80 to 450 K. Mechanism study revealed that Cu 4 S is a typical thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) luminogen. Owing to the strong C─H··· π interactions between the clusters, the geometric relaxation of Cu 4 S was restricted during the spin crossover process, leading to an exceptionally small reorganization energy. This induced intersystem crossing within the Marcus inverted region, resulting in temperature-independent luminescence behavior. More importantly, Cu 4 S metal cluster has excellent water‒oxygen stability and thermal stability and can be used to prepare flexible scintillator screen with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). On the basis of these features, temperature-independent high-resolution X-ray imaging with the Cu 4 S -PDMS scintillator screen was achieved, and the resolution at different temperatures was maintained above 20 LP mm −1 .},

This difficulty primarily stems from the spontaneous generation of planar chirality-induced stereoisomer mixtures during synthetic procedures, which considerably complicates the isolation process. In this study, we introduce a social chiral self-sorting strategy utilizing a triangular gold complex, enabling the stereochemically controlled synthesis of [9]cycloparaphenylene-pillar[5]arene trimers ( [9]CPP-3P[5]A ). Diverging from conventional synthetic approaches that typically yield four stereoisomers of pillararene trimers ( pSSS , pRRR , pSSR , and pRRS ), our methodology demonstrates selectivity, predominantly generating pSSR and pRRS isomers of [9]CPP-3P[5]A , with only trace amounts of pSSS and pRRR isomers. This stereoselectivity, as elucidated by crystallographic analysis, arises from the dynamic reorganization of Au─C σ -bonds during the assembly of the hexagold(I) complex, synergistically combined with specific phosphine ligand conformations and inter-pillararene interactions. The resulting chiral trimers exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties, which facilitates the fabrication of CPL-active supramolecular polymers by leveraging the superior host–guest complexation capability of the pillar[5]arene units, opening new avenues for the development of chiral functional materials.},

Nevertheless, the issues of limited ionic conductivity and insufficient solid–solid contact interfaces significantly impede their practical applications. In this study, an intrinsically safe QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) in high flash point tetraglyme (G4)-based electrolyte is developed. Owing to the coordination between carbonyl oxygen atoms within the polymer matrix and Li + , solvation cage caused by the “chelating” effect between Li + and solvent molecules is disrupted. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that a solvated structure predominantly characterized by the contact ion pair is formed. Therefore, a robust solid electrolyte interface enriched with anion-derived LiF- and B-species is constructed. As a result, matched with a commercial-level loading LiFePO 4 cathode, a capacity retention of 92.7% is obtained even after 200 cycles. These results elucidate the polymer matrix's pivotal role in QSEs, offering novel pathway for designing advanced quasi-solid-state batteries, such as Li/Na/K/Mg/Ca et al.},

Aiming at novel concepts for tailoring the property profile of synthetic rubber in post-polymerization reactions, we introduce the thioether-containing 6-methylthio-hexa-1,3-diene (MTHD) as a diene monomer derived from the biobased methional. The obtained isomeric cis-/trans-mixture was successfully polymerized via anionic techniques. In situ 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) kinetics revealed different reactivities of the trans - and cis -isomer and dispersities of Ɖ = 1.21–1.35. Copolymerization with isoprene afforded a series of well-defined statistical copolymers with molar masses up to 50 kg mol −1 , permitting precise adjustment of MTHD content from 2% to 10%. These copolymers exhibited moderate to narrow distributions (Ɖ < 1.19). Targeting the thioether groups via post-polymerization modifications (i.e., alkoxylation and alkylation) permitted tailoring of the properties of the diene-based copolymers. The respective sulfoxide was obtained selectively by mild oxidation and represents an internal antioxidant group.

A promising strategy is to inhibit the protein-protein interaction between Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and Nrf2 using noncovalent compounds that target the Keap1 Kelch domain. These compounds may be more specific than covalent Keap1-reacting Nrf2 activators. However, the development of drug-like noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors faces challenges due to the size and polarity of the Kelch binding pocket. Here, we present a new series of noncovalent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibitors developed from a weak fragment hit identified by crystallographic screening. A two-step growing strategy and optimization guided by several X-ray cocrystal structures led to compounds with low nanomolar affinities and complete selectivity for Keap1 in a panel of homologous Kelch domains. In cells, compounds 24 and 28 potently activated the expression of Nrf2-controlled genes and showed anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating NLRP3 inflammasome and STING signalling activation. RNA sequencing revealed activation of cytoprotective pathways and a different profile from typical covalent Nrf2 activators.

In this study, we introduced an efficient electrochemical strategy to convert polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-derived ethylene glycol (EG) into organosulfur compounds with high yields. A specially designed iron single-atom catalyst (SAC) supported on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon spheres (NHCS), which feature high catalytic activity of the Fe-N 3 motifs, was employed, which facilitates the C─C bond cleavage during EG oxidation, and generates formaldehyde (CH 2 O) species. These intermediates subsequently react with S-containing nucleophiles, that is, SO 3 2− , to form hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS) via C─S bond formation. Our method achieves a remarkable faradaic efficiency of over 60% and an unprecedented production rate of 1800 µmol cm −2 h −1 for HMS. Additionally, we validate the use of PET as feedstock for C─S bond formation, achieving a considerable faradaic efficiency of over 25% and an unprecedented production rate of 900 µmol cm −2 h −1 .

  abstract     = {Freshwater scarcity and nitrate contamination in water sources are critical environmental sustainability challenges. We address these two challenges by coupling seawater desalination with electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO 3 RR) via bimetallic Fe/Zn polyphthalocyanine frameworks. They serve as high-performance catalysts for NO 3 RR toward ammonia (NH 3 ) production. The efficient NO 3 RR is integrated into an electrocatalytic desalination device, enabling the production of freshwater from seawater and the removal of nitrate from contaminated water. In situ spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations show that Zn-N 4 units incorporated into the Fe polyphthalocyanine framework modulate Fe-N 4 sites’ d-band center to enhance the adsorption of NO 3 − and the generation of *H, resulting in 3.22 times higher turnover frequency and highly selective reduction toward NH 3 . The optimized Fe 8 Zn 1 PPc delivered NH 3 Faradic efficiency (>97% over a wide potential range (−0.55 to −0.95 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), the NH 3 yield rate of 2.68 mmol h −1 cm −2 at −0.85 V versus RHE, and over 120 h of stable operation, outperforming previously reported Fe-based catalysts for NO 3 RR. The desalination device achieves the highest salt removal rates (1326.92 µg cm −2 min −1 ) among various desalination methods. Ten cycles of natural seawater desalination to drinking water are demonstrated with 99% ion removal. This work presents an innovative solution for addressing sustainable water challenges.},

  abstract     = {Although polyoxovanadates (POVs) and their silver nanocluster composites have attracted significant research attention owing to their remarkable structural diversity and multifunctional properties, the mechanistic interplay between their dual chemical roles—serving simultaneously as host matrices in supramolecular architectures and as structural templates directing silver nanocluster (Ag NC) assembly—remains insufficiently understood. Herein, we systematically optimized the condensation of {VO x } ( x = 4, 5) tetrahedra or square pyramids around simple anions (S 2− and SO 4 2− ) to tailor two distinct host–guest cyclodextrin-like POV supermolecules: [S@V 16 O 48 ] 18− and [SO 4 @V 14 O 42 ] 16− . Remarkably, these two cyclic POVs were generated in situ and have never been observed before, either in vanadate chemistry or in silver nanoclusters, representing a new category of POV condensation species. These two host–guest supramolecular anions function as templates, inducing the formation of the POV-bearing Ag 0/I NCs, dubbed as Ag78 and Ag68 . Furthermore, the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of Ag68 and Ag78 is comprehensively discussed and the excellent PCE is attributed to the nonradiation transition process, encompassing the fast deactivation of the excited charge transfer (CT) state and the slow recombination of CT state, as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work not only optimizes the condensation of {VO x } ( x = 4, 5) polyhedral building units to tailor novel host–guest POV supermolecules but also offers a new perspective on supramolecular anion templates in guiding the assembly of silver NCs.},

  abstract     = {Advanced membrane technology for the separation and purification of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) requires improvement in both membrane materials and manufacturing processes to achieve the high rejection of macromolecular solutes combined with high permeance for organic solvents in pharmaceutical industry. Here, we report a novel approach to preparing aromatic polyamide membranes (PAMs) with tunable microporosity and micropore size via modulator-assisted interfacial polymerization. Enhanced microporosity, increased micropore size, and higher pore interconnectivity of PAMs are achieved by adding ethanol to the aqueous phase to regulate interfacial polymerization, which can be demonstrated through experiments and molecular simulations. The resulting optimal membrane achieves a methanol permeance of 11.9 L m − 2 h −1 bar −1 , representing a impressive 19.8-fold increase compared to commercial benchmark membrane (0.6 L m −2 h −1 bar −1 ) at the same molecular weight cut-off (∼460 g mol −1 ). For practical applications, the optimal membrane demonstrates exceptional capability in the separation of high-value APIs such as dipyridamole, achieving not only accelerated ethanol permeance but also a 6-fold enrichment factor relative to commercial membranes. This work demonstrates the significant potential of phenolphthalein-based microporous polyamide membrane in advancing API separation technologies. It provides valuable insights into the development of next-generation membrane systems tailored for pharmaceutical applications.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-linker-based multivariate metal-organic frameworks (MTV-MOFs) recently received considerable research effort because they exhibit tailored physicochemical properties that are often not possessed by single-linker MOFs and therefore find unique applications. Relative to the pristine linker, the incorporated linkers may tend to form different topologies, bringing about lattice mismatch and structural disorder. This leads to a low mixed-linker incorporation limit, and further increasing the linker incorporation rate may disrupt the crystallinity of the parent MOF, resulting in amorphous products or other topologies. Therefore, increasing the linker incorporation rate without changing the structure of the parent MOF represents a challenge. Herein, for the first time, an MTV-MOF of imidazole-incorporated zeolitic imidazolate framework ZIF-7 is constructed by 60 Co gamma ray radiation. Both experiments and theoretic calculations demonstrate that the distinct radiation-induced activation of the synthesis reaction gives rise to a much higher mixed-linker incorporation limit in ZIF-7, up to twice that synthesized by the solvothermal process, further leading to increased flexibility of aperture, higher specific surface area, and notably enhanced separation performances for Kr and Xe. These observations suggest that radiation synthesis may emerge as a general route to a series of MTV-MOFs with significantly enhanced linker mixing limit and physicochemical properties.},

  abstract     = {Single-molecule protein profiling offers unparalleled sensitivity for detecting rare biomarkers, with significant potential for early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Nanopore sensors enable the detection of proteins in solution and are well-suited for clinical applications due to their high sensitivity and throughput. Here, we introduce a nanopore-based detection strategy utilising an aptamer-protein-aptamer sandwich structure to enhance protein detection further. The aptamer probe is extended with a double-stranded DNA carrier to enhance protein transport and detection efficiency. Upon protein binding, dimerization of the DNA carriers occurs, allowing charge-based classification of bound versus unbound states. Additionally, the sandwich complex produces a characteristic subpeak within individual nanopore events, with subpeak height correlating to protein size. This approach enables selective detection of dimeric proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with sub-picomolar detection limits. In principle, it can be adapted for any protein with two distinct aptamer-binding sites, as demonstrated with thrombin. This method also facilitates real-time monitoring of ligand-induced receptor dimerization in complex biological fluids, offering a powerful tool for potential single-molecule-based diagnostics.},

Here, a steric presubstitution strategy is devised using tert -butylphenyl-functionalized indolo[3,2- b ]carbazole as a bridge to extend MR skeletons, not only steering regioselective Bora–Friedel–Crafts borylation but also suppressing intermolecular interactions in films. The targeted greenish emitter, therefore, achieves a small electroluminescence FWHM of only 22 nm in device, matching the intrinsic photoluminescence one of 21 nm in dilute toluene. The extended skeleton also enhances the horizontal orientation of emitting dipole moment with a ratio of 90%, leading to a remarkable high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 41.0% and power efficiency of 106.5 lm W −1 . The efficiency roll-off remains remarkably low with EQEs sustaining at 35.0% and 30.6% at luminance of 1000 cd m −2 and 5000 cd m −2 , respectively.

Although high-temperature redispersion offers a potential solution, this strategy remains restricted to reducible support materials, severely limiting the selection of catalyst supports with versatile compositions and tunable functionalities. Here, we engineer cationic vacancies at Al 2 O 3 -La 2 O 3 interface via strong oxide-support interaction (SOSI)—driven interfacial reconstruction during calcination. The vacancy-mediated confinement effect dynamically intercepts migrating Pt species, enabling the construction of Al 2 O 3 -Pt 1 -La 2 O 3 structure with precisely defined coordination environments. The resulting catalyst achieves complete CO conversion at 145 °C and maintains stability with minimal decline after a 6-h treatment at 1100 °C in air with 10% steam. This interfacial engineering strategy proves universal, as demonstrated by ZrO 2 -La 2 O 3 counterparts. Our findings break the reducibility dependency in traditional single-atom catalysts (SACs) stabilization by establishing oxide–oxide interface as universal anchoring platforms, which expands the design space of industrial-grade SACs beyond conventional reducible oxides.},

Catalysts can efficiently improve the flash intensity but scarcely achieve persistent enhancement due to their catalytic limitation on CL reaction. Herein, a medium-entropy (ME) nanozyme with trinuclear configuration and a classical Prussian blue analogue (PBA) structure was designed to break the catalytic limitation. The ME PBA showed favorable enhancement on both flash and persistent CL emission of luminol-H 2 O 2 system due to the recycling generation of catalytic center Co(II) through quick electron transfer among metal sites within framework, which provided a relatively stable CL emission enhanced by over two orders of magnitude in 1 h, achieving the transformation of CL from flash to glow. The CL enhancement and active valence cycle mechanism via intrareticular electron transfer were revealed by both experiments and density functional theory calculations. A facile CL imaging method was proposed to evaluate the bacterial motility, which demonstrated the application potential of the ME PBA. This work offers a new avenue to transform CL from flash to glow by breaking the catalytic limitation of nanozymes, which will conveniently expand their application in bioanalysis.},

  abstract     = {Inverse-electron demand cycloaddition reactions of tetrazines are widely used in bioorthogonal chemistry, but the opposing effects of substituents on reactivity and stability make optimizing tetrazines for chemical biology applications challenging. Building on the discovery that bulky substituents can unexpectedly enhance both the stability of tetrazines and their reactivity toward isonitriles, we hypothesized that substituents that are both bulky and electron-withdrawing could yield tetrazines with desirable properties. We synthesized a series of tetrazines designed to explore these kinetic properties. A novel computational method quantifying intermolecular atomic contributions to dispersion forces supported the analysis substituent effects on tetrazine reactivity. Study results indicate that tetrazine reactivity is governed by an interplay of frontier-orbital levels, dispersion forces, and conformational preferences. These insights were apparent in the form of a “bromo effect,” where bromine atoms enhanced tetrazine reactivity by influencing frontier-orbital levels and increasing dispersion forces. Notably, 3,6-bis(2-bromopropan-2-yl)-1,2,4,5-tetrazine exhibited a ∼80-fold increase in reactivity to isonitriles compared to dimethyltetrazine with high orthogonality to other dienophiles. The 2-bromoprop-2-yl group could also be incorporated into asymmetric tetrazines for tuning reactivity properties. In addition to introducing novel tetrazines for bioorthogonal chemistry, this work provides valuable insights into the role of dispersion forces in the transition states of cycloaddition reactions.},

Directed evolution was performed on Ao HMS to provide evolved variants that could utilize O -pivaloylhydroxylamine triflic acid as the nitrene precursor and produced various primary aminoazidation products with up to 44% yield, 44 total turnover number (TTN), and 98.5:1.5 enantiomeric ratio (e.r.). Mechanistic studies indicated that this new biocatalytic transformation proceeds through a stepwise radical addition and azide recombination pathway.

Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper-catalyzed asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3-b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.},

Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric-hindrance-directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6-fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow-green solid-state fluorescence and high-contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli-responsive materials for interesting applications.},

Herein, we reported the design and in-situ synthesis of A′-site cations with oxygen–phosphorus–nitrogen–carbon (O─P─N─C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P─Cl and P═O functional groups. The P─Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA + ) and phenethylammonium (PEA + ) cations, yielding large A′-site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin-coating. Concurrently, P═O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual-functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non-radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low-defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi-2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A′-site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high-performance PeLEDs.},

Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt 4 ] 4 [Fe 6 C(CO) 15 ] ( 1 ) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa-iron carbide clusters [NEt 4 ] 3 [Fe 6 C(CO) 14 (SR)] (R = CH 3 , 2 ; C 6 H 5 , 3 ; p -C 6 H 4 CH 3 , 4 ; L -cysteine, L - 5 ; D -cysteine, D - 5 ). Compounds 2–5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2–4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). The chirality of the L -5 and D -5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the ν CO region of both L -5 and D -5 . This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH 2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.},

Here, we report coronene-derived ( CoDe ) luminophores exhibiting ultra-narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM = 11.2 nm) with a 1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low-frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high-power excitation, the CoDe -PhB further exhibits organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40 min (FWHM = 14.7 nm), governed by a two-photon ionization-induced charge-separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt-casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high-color-purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low-frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi-resonance-based designs.},

High-entropy composition and [Li─O─K] configuration coupled with Cu─O covalency and local CuO 6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic–cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid-solution mechanism benefited from high-entropy stabilization, and “cocktail” effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn–Teller (J–T) lattice distortion, O─O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K + /vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL 0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8 Wh kg −1 , superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.},

However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full-width at half-maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H with InCl 3 , leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near-unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48 nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III-V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {Full-Stokes polarization detection, enabling the acquisition of complete polarization information, is crucial across various fields such as target identification, robotic perception, and 3D reconstruction. Nevertheless, achieving efficient multiple polarization state detection simultaneously with high recognition accuracy in a compact device remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA 2 EA 2 Pb 3 Br 10 ( 1 , where OA is n-octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self-driven full-Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1 , simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in-plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full-Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%–5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self-driven, filterless full-Stokes polarization detection.},

In this work, incorporation of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (H 4 edta) into the main chain backbone of flexible, linear polymers results in substantial modulation of mechanical properties via conformational changes in the imbedded ligand within the polymer backbone induced by metal ion binding. Upon the addition of metal ions, these polymers transform from viscous liquids into solids with improved elastic characteristics. Polymer strength and toughness are significantly enhanced without the need for extensive polymer crosslinking.

Herein, we design conjugated polymer-based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu–N 4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7 Å) to optimize CO 2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0 Å-spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc-4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0 mmol h −1 g −1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at −1.3 V (versus RHE), outperforming wider-spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0 Å cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5 Å), thereby enhancing C–N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball-milling treatment increases single-atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%. This work demonstrates a multidimensional catalyst design integrating atomic precision and molecular confinement for sustainable electrosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Electro-Fenton treatment through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) offers an effective approach for degrading persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water; however, aeration is always required to overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water, ensuring adequate oxygen availability for the 2e − ORR to generate H 2 O 2 and facilitate its transport for activation into hydroxyl radicals. The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration-free dual-cathode system featuring a natural oxygen-harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode-generated oxygen for H 2 O 2 synthesis (957.1 mg g cat −1 ) without external aeration. By decoupling H 2 O 2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90 h continuous use. By eliminating energy-intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen-bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework, HOF-FJU-119 , constructed from an anthracene-core, that exhibits multimode guest-responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF-FJU-119a undergoes distinct gate-opening transformations in response to CO 2 at 196 K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene-loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C≡N⋯H─C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60 nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real-time visual tracking capabilities.},

Several quinary multicomponent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc) 2 ·2H 2 O with adenine and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC incorporates three distinct zinc-based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN 2 (O 2 C─) 2 ], a dinuclear [Zn 2 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 2 ], and a hexanuclear [Zn 6 N 3 ( μ -H 2 O) 3 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 6 ], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage-like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson─Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single-step ethylene purification from trinary C 2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost-effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.},

Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high-efficiency oxygen-bridged cyclized boron-based MR-TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D–A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited-state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin-flip, and thus achieving near-unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7 × 10 5 s −1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR-TADF OLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR-TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited-state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.},

  abstract     = {We report on the metal-free active template synthesis of crown ether–peptide rotaxanes. A 24-crown-8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether–tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N- and C-termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide–axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.},

Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis-boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2-metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation-borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo- and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors.

  abstract     = {Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette-shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen-bonding moieties. An all-atom molecular-dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various “conformations” due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real-time high-speed atomic-force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.},

  abstract     = {Organic spin-state photoswitches represent an emerging class of molecular systems capable of reversibly modulating electronic spin states using light. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin-polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox-active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light-induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations. By exploring design principles and technological implications, this review underscores the unique position of all-organic spin-state photoswitches at the intersection of photochemistry, magnetism, and quantum materials development.},

To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium-copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover-mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100 h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0 ± 119.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2 ± 1.6%) at record-low energy consumption (3.55 kWh kg ethylamine −1 ).

Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring-expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C─H sites with tunable site-selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

The In 3+ /In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO 2 two-electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl − anions restructure the In 3+ solvation, forming stable chloro-complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO 4 2− -rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO 2 crystallization and MnO 2 /Mn 2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl − /SO 4 2− ratios and an anion-decoupled dual-electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at ∼1.7 V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode-less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying-driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4 mA cm −2 (2 mAh cm −2 ), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5 Wh kg −1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm −2 .

Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C( sp 3 )─H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C( sp 3 )─H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane-associated copper-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four-helix coiled coil, and C-terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x) n HxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen-dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper-dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.},

However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl-bridged triphenylamine (TPA)-based chromophores via metal-free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.},

However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3–30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli-responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.},

Herein, we report an ultra-low Ir anode, consisting of Re-doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrO x during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high-surface-area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three-electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts.

Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN-MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN-PyPt and DPABN-PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN-PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605 nm with a small full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 35 nm/0.118 eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2 µs (compared to 7.6 µs for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield ( Φ PL ) of 75% in doped films–representing a 4.4-fold enhancement over PhPyPt ( Φ PL = 17%).

  abstract     = {The reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction presents an industrial promise for carbon dioxide valorization. In this work, a dual-site Ru-RuO 2 cocatalyst anchored on Si-supported GaN nanowires (NWs) is developed for solar-powered CO 2 -to-CO conversion. The assembled Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89 mmol·cm −2 ·h −1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5 W·cm −2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28 × 10 5 h −1 . The temperature-programmed desorption, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and DFT calculations collectively reveal that the Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 enables simultaneous activation of CO 2 and H 2 . Moreover, the synergy between Ru-RuO 2 and GaN substantially reduces the reaction energy barrier from 0.83 to 0.64 eV via the key *COOH intermediate, thereby establishing a new benchmark for light-driven RWGS efficiency. This work provides a strategic design for high-performance CO 2 -to-CO conversion and opens avenues for downstream synthetic applications.},

Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs ( RuSe , OsSe , RuIP , OsIP ) containing triadic electrophilic centers (─N(δ − )─X(δ + )─N(δ − )─). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7-transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the π-cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.},

However, the structure–performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination-mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional-group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn 2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H 2 O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight-chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)-facet-dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000 h and subzero-temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

However, due to the lack of two-electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of β -diketiminate-supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (L Nacnac - κ 2 N , N′ )RE(III)(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 1-RE , RE = Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; L Nacnac = {[(2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 )NCMe] 2 CH} − ) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N′ )RE(III)( η 2 - cis -PhNNPh −• ) 2 (THF) ( 2-RE ) and 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene ( I ) via a reductive elimination-powered pathway. The key intermediate (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N' )Lu(III)(PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C )(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) ( 3-Lu ), which is formed via ortho -H deprotonation in azobenzene by the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group in 1-Lu , was isolated and structurally identified. The computational studies indicate that the subsequent η 2 -coordination of a cis -azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C group, consequently enabling the C─C cross-coupling that affords product I . In this elementary process, the two N═N π *-orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e-reductions of RE centers.},

Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system-level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge-separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge-separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron-rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF 6 − ) on the electron-deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic-rich SEI containing fluorine- and phosphorus-based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li-ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li-ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast-charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra-stable cycling performance over 50 000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g −1 with negligible capacity decay.},

However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion-torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion-torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non-planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion-torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D > 3D > 2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in-plane and out-of-plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.},

Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg-C 3 N 4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (>93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen-mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes. This study provides a green and sustainable technology for both petrochemical (ethylene purification) and coal-chemical (ethylene production) industries.},

We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time-efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.},

However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self-healing cationic high-entropy gel (CHEG) G-FeCN 4−/3− -K + -Na + -Li + -Gdm + -Cs + in a multi-ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41 mV K −1 with 2.3 mV K −1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3 mW m −2 K −2 and an energy density of 4.5 J m −2 K −2 . In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13 mW m −2 K −2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B.

Herein, we report the single-site metal-nonmetal microenvironment regulation of copper nanoclusters based on structurally comparable Cu 10 and Cu 11 nanoclusters with the same skeleton but different vacancy-filling elements. The quantum-size effects endow Cu 10 and Cu 11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non-radiative decay rate and weaker electron-phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu 11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu 11 -based film demonstrated effective X-ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster-based nanomaterials for X-ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different-attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic-level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster-based nanomaterials.},

  abstract     = {P-type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd-vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl-based polymeric backbone and π−π stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation-driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox-active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long-term cycling stability but also enables high-capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10-diaryl-5,10-dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual-mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated π-electron redox activation.},

  abstract     = {The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro-conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single-atom Pt-doped Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high-valence Cu sites (CuO-MOF-Pt 1 ), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the –CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron-withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu 3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C─C bond scission over CuO-MOF-Pt 1 , and a stable Cu 3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO-MOF-Pt 1 delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587 mA mM −1 cm −2 , a low detection limit of 0.93 µM, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO-MOF-Pt 1 -based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.},

  abstract     = {We report a series of shape-persistent molecular nanotubes with top rim connectivity traversing from an all- meta - ( m 4 ) to an all- para -phenylene ( p 4 ) bridged species, including all possible members in between them. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta -phenylenes relative to para -phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m 4 (∼31 kcal mol −1 ) to p 4 (∼90 kcal mol −1 ). Structural transitions from m 4 to p 4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394 nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546 nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time-dependent (TD)-DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S 1’ ) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para -phenylenes are introduced into m 4 en route to p 4 , while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased π-conjugation within the nanotube's top-segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.},

Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out-of-equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct. Comparative studies with simpler analogues further highlight the importance of macrocyclic preorganization and non-covalent interactions in governing this reversible reactivity.},

In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor-acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid-liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi-axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non-radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink-free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.},

In this work, we demonstrate the transmutation of a Ni-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF), composed of one-dimensional Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains interconnected by 1,4-ndc linker, into catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . This top-down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4-ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra-low-dimensional (thickness ∼ 1.5–2.6 nm), defect-rich β -Ni(OH) 2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm −2 , surpassing commercial IrO 2 . In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH- and potential-dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni─O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89 Å under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni 2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high-performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.},

However, designing photocatalytic systems based on earth-abundant metals while gaining precise control over their excited-state reactivity remains a significant challenge. Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr₃(O)(OH)₃ nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O─H and C─H bonds (70–100 kcal mol⁻ 1 ). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground-state, pre-association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system. Collectively, these findings establish an unprecedented ambipolar PCET mechanism with a new class of photocatalytic mediators based on an earth abundant metal.},

ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (-OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H 2 O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H-bonding between the -OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN-g-CN, generating proton-rich interfaces and local H-bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH 4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN-g-CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH 4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85 µmol g −1 h −1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction. Furthermore, the MPB/CN-g-CN/ECE membrane demonstrates exceptional recyclability through a re-crosslinking membrane formation process, effectively reactivating proton-supply sites while maintaining superior CH 4 selectivity across multiple operational cycles.},

In this context, space-confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement-enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in-situ/ operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D-3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in-situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)-guided design and structure–property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in-situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.},

In this work, we proposed a strategy for the construction of solvation structures dominated by compact ion-pair aggregates (CIPAs) through weak lithium-solvent interactions design, which significantly improved the lithium-ion transference number and reduced the de-solvation energy barrier.

However, the formation of carbon–sulfur (C─S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C─S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur-induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single-atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C─S cross-coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-atom-sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites.

  abstract     = {In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long-wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of -extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri -anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all-red and near-infrared addressability. The excited-state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady-state and time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the -system and peri -connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid-based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.},

Despite of these benefits, the exploration of new solid bases remains challenging and is an underdeveloped area of research. In this work, we report the discovery of the inherent basicity of hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid-base neutralization reaction through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity. This study enriches the solid-base family by introducing a type of materials featured with high porosity, high crystallinity, and modular structure.},

  abstract     = {Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi-field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one-pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4-difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4-difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 /(4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light -ultrasonic activation. Under dual-field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26 mmol g −1 h −1 , outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 and (4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy-level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high-efficiency piezo-photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next-generation solar-driven catalysts.},

We develop a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) nanogenerator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1 O 2 -cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1 O 2 -generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1 O 2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single-molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.},

The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.},

However, achieving stable and reversible high-voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high-voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t 2g state of V and the e g state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na 3.5 MnV 0.5 Ti 0.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high-voltage Mn 4+/3+ and V 5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh g −1 . This strategy opens new paths for developing high-energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.},

  abstract     = {While birefringence phase-matching (PM) remains the most practical approach for nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion, conventional phosphate crystals suffer from intrinsically low birefringence (Δ n < 0.05) that hinders PM behavior in the solar-blind ultraviolet (UV) region ( λ < 280 nm). Herein, we demonstrate a π-conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite-based NLO crystals: (C 2 N 4 OH 7 )H 2 PO 3 (GUPO) and C(NH 2 ) 3 H 2 PO 3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of π-conjugated guanidinium cations and [H 2 PO 3 ]⁻ anions enables record-breaking optical anisotropy (Δ n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full-wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 × KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 × β -BBO at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented π–π interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes π-conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.},

Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li + within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC-based weakly-solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic-dominated cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4 V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li + -PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8–4.4 V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at −20 °C, surpassing conventional EC-based electrolytes.

We report on the successful synthesis of a soluble polymer and a series of monodisperse oligomers of BP-PPV type. Our structural and photophysical investigations, supported by in-depth DFT calculations, evidence effective π-conjugation along their backbone, which is similary pronounced as in their previously reported BN congeners.

  abstract     = {Alkyl organoboron compounds are versatile synthons in organic synthesis, enabling rapid access to a variety of carbon─carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. As such, strategies to efficiently access carbon-boron bonds from simple chemical feedstocks are highly desirable. The radical borylation of alkyl bromides presents an attractive approach. However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition-metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal-free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen-atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs. Mechanistic and computational studies support a radical-chain pathway involving a silyl radical-mediated halogen-atom transfer.},

We synthesized biomimetic tryptophan–flavin diads with varying linker lengths composed of conformationally rigid oligoproline units. The predominant polyproline II (PPII) helical structure ensures consistent donor–acceptor distances. Photo-CIDNP NMR experiments revealed significant hyperpolarization effects, particularly in diads with six proline units, mimicking the spatial arrangement found in natural photoactive proteins. Our findings highlight the potential of these biomimetic diads to enhance nuclear hyperpolarization in NMR spectroscopy.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high-temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (∼1 nm) Ir-based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub-nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub-IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm - 2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO 2 . Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub-nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.},

Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature-responsive reversible polymerization-dissociation dynamics and remarkable long-wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl-functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity-triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer‒π dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near-infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted π dimer absorption band centered at 960 nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin-μ (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh-brightness fluorescence imaging-guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.},

Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a key bacterial secondary messenger involved in growth, biofilm formation, virulence gene expression and others. The activation mechanisms of c-di-AMP receptors like the trimeric P II -like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger-bound forms of the 44 kDa homotrimeric P II -like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural-biology understanding.},

Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co-doped Fe 2 O 3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co-doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co-catalyst promotes the cleavage of C─C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)-NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of ∼1.9 mA cm −2 with continuously operation of 100 h. The bias-free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683 µmol cm −2 , representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high-value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization.

Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D–A dyads from U-shaped to V-shaped configurations yields 3 CT-RTP with both long τ Ph (150–220 ms) and high (13%–25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D–A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin-orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V-shaped D–A dyad can potentially reduce the non-radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons ( k nr,T ), thereby facilitating the attainment of long τ Ph and high .},

  abstract     = {As electronic devices miniaturize to the nanometer scale, molecular junctions, including single and monolayer molecules, are gaining attention for applications in logic, storage, and sensing. However, comparative studies of charge transport in these two junction types are limited. Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single-molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature-independent coherent tunneling to temperature-dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration-mediated transport, while vibration-suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple-reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl-phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using Cu I -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO-reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody-conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2-step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine-labeling with bicyclo-[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) or trans -cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO-rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2 + cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl-phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl-ditriazolyl-phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single-reagent peptide-cyclization-bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide-protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide-cyclization and peptide-protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.},

In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671 nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type-I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity-sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis-driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis-mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis-based cancer immunotherapy.},

Besides near-quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co-translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase-psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.},

However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA 3 SbCl 6 , PA 6 InCl 9 , PMA 4 InCl 7 , PEA 2 InCl 5 ·H 2 O and PPA 4 InCl 7 . Tunable self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678 nm originated from [SbCl n ] 3-n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb 3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb 3+ -doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red-shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non-radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi-emission centers are constructed in Sb 3+ /Bi 3+ -doped PMA 4 InCl 7 , achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi-color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi-color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi-color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns 2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low-dimensional OIMHs.},

Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self-assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left- and right-handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)-esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant – a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self-assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.},

By utilizing GPT-4o, molecular groups such as ─SiR 3 , ─PR 2 , ─SH, and ═NH that interact effectively with BP were identified and a high-throughput workflow employing graph neural networks (GNNs) models was developed to successfully predict and screen 662 promising candidates from over 117 million molecules. These candidates were validated by density functional theory (DFT) simulations and experiments, with synthesis protocols guided by GPT-4o, achieving great interfacial stabilization of BP for up to 24 days under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a new synergistic molecular engineering strategy was proposed by incorporating functional head, linker, and tail groups of molecules to even enable the use of hydrophilic molecules to stabilize BP surface, overcoming traditional design limitations.

In this study, we demonstrate the rational, mechanism-guided design of molecular glue degraders using gluing moieties. Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin-dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high-molecular-weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader. We also showcase that attaching a cysteine-reactive warhead to a bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) inhibitor converts it into a degrader by recruiting the DDB1 and CUL4-associated factor 16 (DCAF16) E3 ligase.},

  abstract     = {Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition-metal-based electrodes is crucial to designing high-performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co 4 N, CoO, and Co 4 N–CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH − and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co 4 N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH − species. The one-sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co 4 N and CoO. Constructing Co 4 N–CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one-sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH − and glycerol adsorptions on Co 4 N–CoO, the OH − was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high-valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co 4 N–CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co 4 N–CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178 mV dec −1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40 mmol cm −2 h −1 . Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120-h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co-adsorptions of OH − and organics on Co 4 N–CoO interfaces.},

The cage features a large cavity and wide gaps between its faces, enabling the simultaneous binding of anionic guests centrally and peripherally.

The apertures of Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 act as secondary binding sites for accommodating tetraarylborate guests or for providing access to the included Mo 8 O 26 4− for catalyzing reactions. Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within 1 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo 8 O 26 4− for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo 8 O 26 4− .},

Herein, we developed a series of V-shaped emitters comprising electron-deficient benzothiadiazole and electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet-triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long-wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single-molecule and aggregate states. The V-shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited-state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single-molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V-shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation-caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate-state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration-independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment.

  abstract     = {Organic molecules exhibiting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional solid-state luminescent properties. Understanding the AIE mechanism has been a focal point of both theoretical and experimental research. While conical intersection (CI) dynamics on potential energy surfaces (PESs) have emerged as a key factor in elucidating the AIE mechanism, modulating the accessibility to CI to regulate the non-radiative decay pathways remains a substantial challenge. Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE-incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo / exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE-CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo -TPE-CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo -TPE-CPPs do not, opposite to strain-free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo -TPE-CPPs and Exo -TPE-CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited-state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.},

Despite their potential, performance limitations arising from high solution viscosity at high concentrations of active material and rapid degradation due to active material crossover continue to pose challenges. Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox-active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer-independent control over self-condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well-defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox-active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox-active HBCs exhibited long-term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer-based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high-precision electrolyte design.},

Herein, we report a chromium-catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem -dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio-, enantio-, diastereo-, and Z/E -selectivity. This radical-polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z -alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E -alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium-mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway. This work establishes a versatile platform for constructing stereochemically defined homoallylic alcohols and expands the synthetic utility of allyl gem -dichlorides in asymmetric catalysis.},

Among them, Iron-Chromium RFBs (Fe-Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous-based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low-cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K 3 [Cr(CN) 6 ]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe-Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long-term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91 Wh L −1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%–77%.

The resulting polymer exhibits potential as a transparent and vibration-damping coating. Electrochemical oxidation was the key step for initiating the rapidly polymerization and could completely circumvent the use of chemical initiators or harsh conditions. Cyclic voltammetry experiments identified the oxidation of TA at anode accompanying with an absorption-controlled one-electron transfer process. Together with density functional theory calculations, we proposed a cationic radical-initiated polymerization process.

Under FCC conditions, we predict an ensemble of acid sites with diverse local structures and a spectrum of acid strengths, including zeolite-like bridging Brønsted acid sites (BAS) and pseudo-bridging silanol BAS. This distribution is influenced by surface structure, Si coverage, and extent of hydroxylation, shaped by synthesis methods and reaction conditions. Experiments using a model Si-stabilized alumina catalyst confirm that Brønsted acidity increases with Si content, peaking at an optimal value before declining.

Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the ─CF 2 H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li─F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated ─CF 2 CF 2 H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li + ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual-layer interface featuring a LiF-rich inner phase and a Li 2 CO 3 -dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO 2 cells (2.5 mAh cm −2 ) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140-mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles.

With CO 2 levels at 427 ppm (50% above pre-industrial levels), deploying energy-efficient carbon capture technologies is crucial. Electrochemical carbon capture processes that have been touted to have the potential to meet these needs rely on the applied cell voltage, and electron utilization (CO 2 molecules separated per electron), which has generally been asserted to have a theoretical limit of one. Here, we introduce an electron-leveraging strategy to enhance electron utilization beyond this limit to 1.43 by employing Fe-EDDHA, a redox-active coordination complex having a ligand with multiple hemi-labile coordination sites. The reversibility and robustness of the system were enabled by the efficient prevention of CO 2 reduction upon the introduction of nicotinamide as a guardian of the iron(2+) center. The proof-of-concept cyclic system exhibits a minimum operational energy of 22.6 kJ e mol −1 and an average of 63.7 kJ e mol −1 over 29 cycles, using a simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 ). Our electron-leveraging strategy holds promise for advancing energy-efficient electrochemical carbon capture technologies, and offers an alternative to prevalent redox potential shifting methods proposed to mitigate undesired electron transfer reactions in redox-active materials across diverse operational conditions.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non-antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4′s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.},

  abstract     = {Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro-)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange-correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open- and closed-shell CO 2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.},

  abstract     = {Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its abundance, cost-effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging-donor-ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA − ), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal-ion battery electrolytes.},

The conventional Haber–Bosch process relies heavily on fossil fuels, making ammonia synthesis a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we show a carbon-negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces ammonia from the air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO 2 (DAC). This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80 °C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co-produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO 2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4 mmol CO 2 /g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high-purity gaseous CO 2 . This proof-of-concept of ammonia production from air coupled with DAC paves a new way for the development of sustainable and negative-emission technologies.},

The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self-sorting of L into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right-handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.},

The construction of pseudo-dimers often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Dearomatization reactions represent an ideal method to transform planar aromatics into 3D skeletons, which has attracted increasing interest in medicinal chemistry and total synthesis. Herein, we present a dearomative dimerization of N -heteroarenes under mild photochemical conditions. Through additive regulation, the catalytic dearomative cross-coupling of two distinct quinolines could also be achieved. With aromatic compounds as coupling partners, this strategy provides a straightforward avenue to pseudo-dimers of N -heteroarenes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal the intertwined EnT/SET nature and offered guidelines for synthesizing novel bridged polycycles. In addition, this strategy provides an effective approach for constructing functional polymers with high atom economy and environmental benefits via metal-free, one-pot polymerization. Furthermore, the synthetic transformations offer a complementary route to access formal crossed products that were previously inaccessible.},

Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late-stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high-yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross-couplings.},

  abstract     = {Tin-based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two-dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out-of-plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi-epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced π-conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)-dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI 2 to pre-form NEA 2 SnI 4 , which subsequently converts to NEA 2 FASn 2 I 7 and ultimately FASnI 3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long-term stability. Consequently, the NEAI-based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04 cm 2 ) and 12.44% (1 cm 2 ), representing the record performance for two-step deposited tin-based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin-based perovskite films, paving the way for high-performance lead-free perovskite photovoltaics.},

Herein, we report a hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF-TDBB) which exhibits statically as well as dynamically preferential hydrofluoroethanes (CF 3 CH 2 F and CF 3 CHF 2 ) adsorption and achieves efficient one-step C 2 F 6 purification from CF 3 CH 2 F/CF 3 CHF 2 /C 2 F 6 mixture. At 298 K, 11.7 mol kg −1 of high-purity C 2 F 6 can be obtained by HOF-TDBB from 5/5/90 CF 3 CH 2 F/CF 3 CHF 2 /C 2 F 6 mixture. Additionally, excellent stability endows HOF-TDBB with good separation ability under various harsh conditions. For example, the separation performance can be well maintained within the dozens of consecutive separation experiments. Even at 338 K, 5.7 mol kg −1 of pure C 2 F 6 can also be collected. More importantly, this material can be rapidly synthesized with a large scale by simple rotary evaporation. Combined with excellent separation performance, high stability and scalable synthesis, HOF-TDBB has unlocked its great potential in this challenging industrial separation.},

  abstract     = {CO 2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C 2+ ) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single-pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO 2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong-polarized layer-covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen ( sp 3 -N)-enriched azulene-based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO 2 -diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84% C 2 Faradaic efficiency at 200 mA cm −2 , and demonstrates long-term stability over 40 h, which is the record for CO 2 RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene-polarized sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment can increase the local CO 2 /H 2 O ratio at electric double-layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop-bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong-polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C–C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion-reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO 2 RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong-polarized polymers.},

  abstract     = {Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity ( λ ) of 0.1∼0.5 W/(m·K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high-power flexible electronic devices. This study proposes a molecular level design strategy for side-chain azobenzene-containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and recyclability. By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen-bond network along the polymer chain through controlled radical polymerization, a thermal conduction network featuring “high-efficiency conduction within crystal domains and low-resistance interfacial connections” was constructed. Azobenzene moieties self-assemble into highly oriented crystalline domains through π–π stacking, where their dense packing significantly enhances phonon coupling efficiency and increases phonon mean free paths. Concurrently, the dynamic reversibility of hydrogen bonds guides domain-boundary molecular chains to form gradual phase transitions, suppressing phonon scattering at amorphous-crystalline interfaces and improving phonon transport efficiency. The film of random copolymer with 35 azobenzene units achieves an outstanding highest intrinsic λ of 2.01 W/(m·K), representing a substantial improvement over its block copolymer counterpart (with a higher crystallinity) and traditional polymers. Additionally, the photoisomerization property of azobenzene endows the material with light-controlled dynamic deformation capabilities. Meanwhile, the noncrosslinked polymer films feature easy recyclability/reprocessability.},

Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here, we present a rotaxane-based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a β-lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.},

  abstract     = {The application of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly drives the enhancement in the efficiency of perovskite solar cell (PSC). However, the transition mechanism of SAM molecules from colloidal solutions to films remains unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the SAM precursor solutions and the crystallization quality of the resulting SAM and perovskite films. Fibrous micelles of about 460 nm are found in the pristine SAMs solution, leading to nonuniform and low coverage distribution of films. Strong dipole molecules are employed to establish supramolecular interactions with SAMs, enabling the formation of highly monodisperse cubic micelles in solution (160 nm) and uniform SAM films. The contact at buried interface is determined by the balance between dipole moment and steric hindrance. Consequently, the regulated SAMs based inverted PSCs (0.09 cm 2 ) and mini-module (aperture area of 14.40 cm 2 ) achieves efficiency of 26.58% (certificated 25.81%) and 22.95%, respectively. The optimized devices retain more than 96.30% of the initial efficiency for 5,100 h under the ISOS-D-1 condition with a linear fitting extrapolation to T 90 of 11,259 h and 98.30% efficiency for 2,660 h under the ISOS-L-2 condition.

Herein, we develop an electrochemical approach for late-stage trideuteromethyl incorporation of thioether by using stoichiometric methanol- d 4 as the trideuteromethyl isotopic source via a sulfide alkyl displacement. This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram-scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in-situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate. A series of control experiments reveals that alkanes as the departing moiety are the key to alkyl displacement and precise late-stage trideuteration.},

Control of the energy level of the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open-shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron-poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of –5.7 to –3.9 eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one-electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO ≤ -4.5 eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X-ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled-cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open-shell species.},

Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low-cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced “quinoidal” thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended π-delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.},

  abstract     = {Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic ß -fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF 3 , HF as well as PF 5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer-sphere fluorination of the metal-bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF 3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.},

  abstract     = {While polymeric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) offer scalable solutions for gas separations, their performance is fundamentally limited by the permeance-selectivity tradeoff and imprecise microporosity regulation. Herein, we propose a surface fluorination strategy using carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4 ) plasma to engineer a sub-10 nm fluorinated and crosslinked layer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated Matrimid ® HFMs. Through precise modulation of plasma parameters, we achieved controlled substitution of PDMS methyl groups/methyl hydrogen atoms with fluorine species (up to 27.7 mol% F content), 5.3-fold enhanced chain rigidity via fluorine-induced interchain interactions and steric hindrance, as well as narrowed pore size distribution with preferential ultra-micropore filling. The optimized HFM-50W-65Pa-500s membrane exhibits record-breaking He/N 2 and He/CH 4 selectivities of 1202 ± 13 and 1790 ± 12 with 170 ± 2 GPU He permeance, surpassing perfluoropolymer upper bounds and outperforming previously reported polymeric HFMs. Remarkably, it demonstrates molecular discrimination precision (α(He/CO 2 ) = 56 ± 2.2, α(He/H 2 ) = 4.1 ± 0.2) for pure-gas and attractive ternary He/(CO 2 +CH 4 ) selectivity of 1005 ± 20 under 40-bar mixed-gas conditions while maintaining 720-h operational stability. This plasma-engineered fluorination paradigm combines nanoscale precision with industrial scalability, opening new avenues for advanced membrane design.},

Herein, a novel Zn-MOF {[Zn 5 (tz) 6 (HCOO) 4 ]·2H 2 O} n ( 1 , Htz = 1,2,3-triazole) was prepared, exhibiting excellent stability in 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte for 16 weeks. 1 could maintain crystalline structure even after exposure to 9 M HCl and 2 M NaOH solutions. 1 achieved high selectivity for the electroreduction of CO 2 to CO with a maximum faradaic efficiency (FE CO ) of 94.4% under −1.5 V in artificial seawater electrolyte and 91.1% FE CO in treated natural seawater under −0.8 V, maintaining performance over 20 h. The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H 2 O in [Na(H 2 O) 5 ] + to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram-scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g −1 , showing promising industrial potential in CO 2 RR. This work addresses a critical challenge of the strongly competitive HER in Na-based electrolytes during electrochemical CO 2 RR, offering a feasible strategy for designing stable, efficient, and economical catalysts for sustainable energy applications.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage devices due to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they suffer from some issues in Zn anodes, including dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction, and byproducts. Herein, an organic-riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode by introducing sodium anthraquinone-1-sulfonate (AQS) into the aqueous electrolyte with ethylene glycol (EG). In such an electrolyte, the zincophilic -SO 3 − groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anodes, and stable chemical bonds are achieved between them. After that, the low-polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone group in the AQS layer tends to repel H 2 O molecules. Simultaneously, more AQS and EG molecules are attracted and migrate toward AQS layer due to polar compatibility, constructing the AQS/EG-riched layer on the Zn anode by the interlocking effect among them. When Zn 2+ solvated structures migrate through the ORP layer on Zn anode surface, AQS and EG molecules enter Zn 2+ solvated structures, and thus, the solvated H 2 O molecules are removed. As a result, hydrogen evolution and side reactions were significantly suppressed, and the Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes during plating/stripping process reached 99.56%. To illustrate the feasibility of the ORP layer, Zn||V 2 O 5 full cells were assembled and exhibited superior cycling performance.},

  abstract     = {Main goals of contemporary research in chemistry are to create new materials with unique properties and to understand the chemical bonding in them, especially between metal atoms in larger structures. The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non-standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In 2 Bi 11 ) 2 Bi 2 ] 6− and the complex [La(C 5 Me 4 H) 3 ] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)─Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron-rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X-ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe–Salpeter-equation ( GW -BSE) calculations.},

The new design strategy focuses on constructing excited states with multipathway charge transfer characteristics—including multiresonance, through-bond, and through-space charge transfer—by precisely tuning the relative electron-donating strengths of the D 1 and D 2 units. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the optimized emitter, BO-BTC, achieves a well-balanced trade-off among emission efficiency, color purity, singlet–triplet energy gap, and horizontal dipole orientation ratio. Consequently, OLEDs using BO-BTC as the terminal emitter or as the sensitizer for ν -DABNA achieve high-efficiency deep-blue electroluminescence, with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.7% and 37.9%, Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage-y values of 0.038 and 0.106, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid-state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion-transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X═Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL-100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF-HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5–1 nm) of MIL-100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size-selective sieving but also enable continuous Li⁺ transport through tunable host–guest interactions between the Lewis-acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI-embedded composite (E-LiI) exhibits a high Li⁺ transference number (0.88 at 25 °C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li⁺ plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen-dependent desolvation energetics and Li + transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E-LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention ∼100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high-voltage cathodes and wide-temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi-scale ion-conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high-energy-density solid-state battery systems.},

However, the absence of molecular-level insights into ion transport behavior in sub-nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit-for-purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross-linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom-scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual-coagulation bath-induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion–pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub-nanometer channels. Based on “dehydration–diffusion” mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion–pore wall interactions facilitate low-energy-barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc–iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8 mW cm −2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 . Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub-nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next-generation ion-selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.},

The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations.

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates the use of cooperative photoredox and N -heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis for sp 2 C─H acylation of allenes. The cascade comprises oxidative generation of an allene radical cation from an allene, its nucleophilic trapping to the corresponding allyl radical and highly regioselective cross coupling by a concomitantly reductively generated NHC-derived ketyl type radical. Ionic fragmentation of both the NHC and nucleophile ultimately yields the desired substituted allene. The organic photocatalyst, 4CzIPN, is highly effective in promoting both oxidative and reductive electron transfer steps.

Mechanistic studies—including radical trapping, acylazolium reactions, and Stern–Volmer quenching—support the proposed mechanism.

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic production of H 2 O 2 in pure water holds great potential for sustainable industry. However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H 2 O 2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5 µmol g −1 h −1 , surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent-reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron-rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O 2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, its Ag single-atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H 2 O 2 into ·OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.},

We provide insight into how electronic and structural perturbations of the Ag(II)–O 2 CCF 2 X core are manifested in the LMCT quantum efficiency. With this information in hand, Ag(II)-mediated electrophotocatalytic CF 2 X functionalization is carried out on a range of (hetero)arenes.

Mechanistic studies reveal a reductive cleavage of RSSR to RS⁻ intermediates, which subsequently form surface nickel sulfide (NiS x ) species through R─S bond cleavage. In situ and ex situ characterizations confirm the NiS x formation and its role in reducing alkene adsorption, thereby suppressing its overreduction. This strategy demonstrates broad applicability across terminal and internal alkynes, as well as aromatic and aliphatic disulfides, furnishing 30 diverse examples of D-labeled vinyl sulfides.},

Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)–silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster-assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology-dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (±)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited-state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light-emitting materials.},

Combining spectroscopic and crystallographic studies with computational bonding analysis, key insights into its constitution and stability have been gained. Expanding its synthetic potential, supporting neopentyl sodium with Lewis donor PMDETA ( N,N,N′,N″,N″ -pentamethyldiethylenetriamine) allows for the direct metalation of challenging non-activated arenes and alkenes, including the regioselective meta -functionalisation of selected 1,3-disubstituted alkyl arenes.

Herein, we report an ion exchange strategy to precisely construct ordered Cu triangular atomic sites loaded on poly(heptazine imide) (Cu TAS/PHI), achieving a methane Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.5% at 400 mA cm −2 and >60% across 100–800 mA cm −2 . Remarkably, it enables CO 2 deuteration to high-value methane- d 4 with an FE of 75.1% at 700 mA cm −2 and an estimated annual return on investment of 425.35%. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations demonstrate that Cu triangular atomic sites enable strengthened adsorption and activation of CO 2 , as well as balanced proton supply via self-regulated adsorption of reactants, thus favoring CO 2 deep hydrogenation over hydrogen evolution. Moreover, Cu TAS/PHI unlocks an energetically favorable *C(OH) 2 pathway, circumventing the conventional *CO pathway that typically yields diverse CO 2 RR products. This work demonstrates a strategy to construct ordered multiatomic sites for highly selective CO 2 RR at industrial-grade current density and highlights the extraordinary financial potential of electrocatalytic CO 2 RR to produce high-value deuterated chemicals.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass-derived hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 into CO are two highly investigated areas. Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO 2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high-value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial-engineered CoS/Co─N─C n─n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built-in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record-low onset potential of 1.12 V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO 2 ─to─CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO 2 RR, which outperform the previously reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO 2 RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50 h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co─N 4 electron-deficient and Co─S electron-rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi-electron CO 2 reduction via charge accumulation. This work establishes a blueprint for developing multi-functional catalytic architectures that address the thermodynamic and kinetic challenges in coupled electrochemical systems, advancing the frontier of sustainable electrosynthesis technologies.},

We report the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides I 3 H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C-terminal histidine-based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self-assemble into β-sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH-dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in β-sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel β-sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong π-π stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel β-sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of β-strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH-dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I 3 GH assembly maintaining this effect while I 3 GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual β-sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side-chain interactions.},

Transition metal hydroxide (TMOH), utilized in various electrocatalysis, yet is clumsy in SOR due to overstrong adsorption toward S-containing intermediates from unsuitable electronic structure. Herein we report, for the first time, that the SOR performance of TMOH can be awakened by intercalation chemistry. Take Co(OH) 2 as a proof-of-concept demonstration, MoO 4 2− intercalated Co(OH) 2 2D nanosheet array is engineered, and presents remarkably enhanced SOR behavior with an ultralow potential of 0.29 V versus RHE to attain 100 mA cm −2 , a record Tafel slope of 27.7 mV dec −1 , and stable operation for 192 h without appreciable deterioration. The experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO 4 2− -intercalated nanoarray is advantageous for active site exposure, and boosting mass transport with enhanced sulfion enrichment and superhydrophilicity. Impressively, MoO 4 2− intercalation can manipulate electronic structure of Co(OH) 2 with downshift of d-band center, thereby weakening binding strength with HS − and S 8 , and decreasing the |ΔG s* |, eventually enhancing both activity and stability. Notably, such intercalation wake-up strategy for the SOR is general and can be extended to other oxometallate intercalated TMOH systems. This contribution provides a new paradigm to evoke TMOH for SOR electrocatalysis via elegant intercalation tactic.},

  abstract     = {NeuO is an intriguing molecular probe capable of selectively labeling live neurons within a heterogeneous population of brain cells. The precise mechanism responsible for this neuronal labeling has remained a longstanding enigma. We investigated four potential mechanisms underlying NeuO's fluorescence, including its interaction with neuronal proteins, transportation into neurons, export from glial cells, and structural alterations within neurons. Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.},

  abstract     = {Enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) has garnered considerable interest in plastic recycling efforts. However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase-catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid-liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade-off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET-binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid-liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic-degrading enzymes.},

At low electric fields, p -phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules exhibit a high-conductance state, which transitions successively to two distinct low-conductance states as the external electric field strength increases. This precise control of supramolecular junctions through electric field manipulation achieved an on/off ratio G H /G L of ∼1.25×10 3 , which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the intrinsic mechanism for the observation, i.e ., electric field promoting the formation of trimer supramolecular junctions leads to the striking on/off ratio. These findings provide new insights into the design of molecular circuits with tunable conductance, paving a way for the design of molecular computation, memory devices, and sensors.},

  abstract     = {Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4-membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro-[2 + 2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and β-lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.},

Solar-driven photocatalytic technology depending on photocatalysts with matched energy band structure for simultaneously driving both O 2 reduction and water oxidation half-reactions, without necessary use of any sacrificial agent, enables green H 2 O 2 synthesis from O 2 and/or H 2 O, offering a low-energy and simple-operation process without secondary pollution while avoiding safety and environmental risk of conventional methods. Herein, a novel acylhydrazone-linked 2D COF, COF-S-OH , was prepared from benzo[1,2- b :3,4- b ':5,6- b '']trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde and 2,3-dihydroxysuccinohydrazide. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that introduction of benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups enhances the electron donor-acceptor effect in COF-S-OH , optimizes the light-harvesting and adsorption capacities to O 2 and H 2 O, and particularly enables efficient proton transfer, thereby synergistically improving photogenerated charge carrier separation and surface reaction efficiency. Consequently, COF-S-OH achieves an exceptional H 2 O 2 production rate of 10.2 mmol g −1 h −1 with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 2.1%, superior to all the thus far reported photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 synthesis. This work underscores the critical importance of carrier separation, active site, and proton supply in photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation, providing guidance for designing and fabricating next-generation photocatalysts.},

However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in-depth understanding of structural insights into P′2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn-valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P′2–P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ∼40 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ∼93 mAh g −1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%.

  abstract     = {Porous organic salts (POSs) are an emerging class of materials with ordered ionic architectures, offering excellent proton transfer and water uptake properties. However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid–base neutralization (e.g., ─SO₃H and ─NH₂) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water-lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra-substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single-crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation–anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water-lean conditions is confirmed by X-ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C–F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites. The approach developed herein further pushes the boundary of POS materials to withstand both aqueous and water-lean conditions.},

Here, we report for the first time a low-cost, high-performance Ni-based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C 5+ OH) in the cross-condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three-coordinated Ni─Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross-condensation to C 5+ OH.},

This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The biohybrid algae-based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all-synthetic equivalents. These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.},

  abstract     = {1,4-Dihydropyridines (DHPs) are valuable compounds in medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. The most straightforward pathway for preparing 1,4-DHPs is the direct 1,4-reduction of pyridines and quinolines. However, existing strategies are not effective for pyridines with electron-withdrawing substituents at the C2 position. To address this long-standing issue, a new strategy has been developed that utilizes underexplored carbodications as the Lewis acids to activate pyridines. For the first time, pyridines with -CN and -ester substituents at the C2 position have been successfully converted to 1,4-DHPs through direct reductive dearomatization in exclusive C4 selectivity. The potential utility of this 1,4-DHP synthetic protocol is demonstrated with C5-bromination, C5-trifluoromethylation, C5-deuteration, and C4-deuteration of pyridines using the in situ generated 1,4-DHPs as key intermediates.},

  abstract     = {Transition metal (oxy)hydroxides serve as efficient aqueous cathode materials but suffer from the challenge of structure degradation during long-term cycling applications. Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100 000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium-entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium-entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p-band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual-cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As-incorporated Co vacancies favor the β-to-γ phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (∼1.9 nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485 C g −1 was achieved after 150 000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state-of-the-art NiCo-based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.},

  abstract     = {To prevent a global water shortage crisis, we must innovate to desalinate seawater. Hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI), an energy-efficient desalination method, depends on electrode materials. Removing chloride ions (Cl − ), a key salinity factor, is vital for balanced electrode capacity. Yet, efforts focus mainly on cathode materials for Na + capture, limiting the progress of electrochemical desalination. Herein, we have developed a covalent organic framework (COF)-based redox-active anode material with excellent chemical stability and unique pseudocapacitive behavior. In the HCDI cell, the rationally designed material showed a remarkable chloride ion removal capacity (Cl-RC) of 71.5 mg g −1 in 1300 ppm saline solution with a noteworthy removal capacity rate (Cl − RCR) of 1.85 mg g −1 min −1 , while maintaining 98.7% capacity retention over 30 cycles. Under optimized conditions, the COF electrode displayed a high selectivity toward Cl − over other anions present in real-seawater samples with Cl-RC of 89 mg g −1 , implying its practical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a purposefully functionalized COF serving as an anode in HCDI, highlighting the promising role of COFs in advancing capacitive deionization technologies.},

The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF.

By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT). The configuration-functionality relationship was comprehensively investigated through theoretical and experimental analyses. The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep-level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT-modified n-i-p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS-L-2 protocol.

  abstract     = {Accelerating the sluggish sulfur redox kinetics through electrocatalysis has been regarded as one of the key factors to achieve Li–S batteries of cell-level energy densities exceeding 600 Wh kg −1 . Though single-atom catalysts (SACs), typically with symmetric M-N 4 coordination structures have demonstrated attractive electrocatalytic performance in Li–S batteries, herein we discovered that an asymmetric-coordinated metal center distinctly shifts sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics—from first-order (concentration-dependent) behavior in the symmetric-coordinated SACs—to zero-order (surface-saturated) kinetics, highlighting fundamentally altered reaction pathways, leading to a concurrent polysulfide conversion. Experimental and theoretical studies on the Ni atom-based SACs showed that symmetry breaking raises the Ni d-band center, enabling a monodentate-to-bidentate Li 2 S 4 adsorption transition, which strengthens polysulfide adsorption and shifts the rate-limiting step from sluggish solid-solid transformation (Li 2 S 2 → Li 2 S) to a more favorable liquid–solid conversion (Li 2 S 4 → Li 2 S 2 ), effectively lowering the overall energy barrier of the SRR process. Consequently, Li–S cells employing Ni-NPG, a SACs with asymmetric Ni-N 3 P 1 coordination, achieved a specific capacity of 877 mAh g −1 at 4 C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm −2 , the cell retained 92% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, outperforming conventional SACs with symmetric coordination structures.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic alkyne semi-hydrogenation (EASH) powered by renewable electricity using water as a hydrogen donor provides a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalysis. However, the current EASH systems predominantly follow hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways, which are prone to over-hydrogenation and at the same time compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we report a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism enabled on Cu(111) surface for highly efficient and selective EASH. Well-defined two-dimensional Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) facets achieve > 98% selectivity for electrochemical semi-hydrogenation of 4-aminophenylacetylene to 4-vinylphenylamine in a membrane electrode assembly reactor. The Cu nanosheets can also efficiently remove 1%–8% alkyne impurities in alkene and exhibit broad substrate scope, stereoselectivity, as well as operational stability. In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, during the PCET-mediated EASH, the covalent adsorption of alkynes and their conversion to weakly bound planar intermediates facilitate the EASH process and suppress over-hydrogenation. Interfacial K + -structured and linearly hydrogen-bonded water species further enhance EASH selectivity via proton supply and steric modulation. Radical scavenging and kinetic isotope effect studies, along with theoretical calculations, corroborate a PCET-dominated mechanism on Cu(111) surface. This work establishes a PCET-driven paradigm for selective hydrogenation beyond the conventional HAT pathways.},

Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue–green monomer-dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress–strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge-like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.},

Our findings indicate that the MS exhibits high proton transport activity (EC 50 of 0.31 mol%, relative to lipids) and significant selectivity for protons, with selectivity values of 160.3 for K + , 90.5 for Na + , and 3.5 for Cl ⁻ .

  abstract     = {The imperative to minimize iridium usage in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) process presents a pivotal challenge for hydrogen economy deployment, while inherent destabilization of iridium (Ir) active sites under corrosive operational conditions, originating from insufficient Ir bonding strength, remains a fundamental barrier. Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface-engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb-TiO 2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic-scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir─O support bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity-stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrO x /m-Nb-TiO 2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mg Ir cm −2 ), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72 V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm −2 , coupled with unprecedented durability with <1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.},

  abstract     = {Developing high specific energy seawater electrolyte-based zinc–air batteries (SZABs) is crucial for marine energy supply systems. However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl − in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon-supported Fe single-atom catalyst [Fe-SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe-SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential ( E onset ) and halfwave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 1.174 and 0.907 V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (E onset : 0.972 V, E 1/2 : 0.848 V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 800 mAh g −1 , surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl − adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.},

This study introduces an efficient synthesis of amidine-containing peptides by a copper-catalyzed, solid-phase-compatible multicomponent reaction (MCR), leveraging ketenimine intermediates that are generated in situ. Through the reaction of sulfonyl azides with terminal alkynes and a wide variety of amines, we establish the robust on-resin synthesis of δ/ε-amidine amino acids, arginine isologues, fluorescently labeled peptides, drug-peptide hybrids, and PEGylated derivatives. This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform. Our results underscore the synthetic versatility and functional applicability of ketenimine-based MCRs for advanced peptide modification, expanding the chemical space of peptide medicinal chemistry and therapeutics.},

Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR-free SDM method that uses DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double-stranded DNA, we employed single-stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single-stranded DNA-assisted double-stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double-stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target-specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR-incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost-effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA-cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.},

Herein, we present a novel strategy for constructing hydrogen-bonding traps in a small-pore RHO zeolite by embedding carbon dots (CDs), thereby to regulate pore microenvironment and enhance the separation ability of CO 2 /N 2 . The incorporation of CDs into the RHO zeolite is realized via a straightforward calcination process, which endows the zeolite with the defect sites rich in hydroxyl groups that easily form hydrogen bonds with CDs. Along with 1 H- 1 H DQ-SQ experiments, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations, the unique hydrogen-bonding traps are unraveled, which can selectively capture and concentrate CO 2 . As a result, the CDs-containing zeolite (R-500) showcases exceptional performance in terms of both CO 2 adsorption (90.40 cm 3 g −1 at 298K and 1 bar) and CO 2 /N 2 (15/85) separation (IAST selectivity of 1063.6). Strikingly, a superior CO 2 adsorption with a capacity of 42.9 cm 3 g −1 is achieved in the dynamic separation process (CO 2 /N 2 15/85). The facile synthesis and impressive separation performance of R-500 provides a promising solution for industrial scale CO 2 /N 2 separation in flue gas.},

Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self-sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8 mg L −1 . Additionally, we established a dual-cell factory co-expressing engineered hMAT2A-TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7 mg L −1 . Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant Escherichia coli system's scalability, producing 430 mg indolactam V, 170 mg teleocidin A1, and 300 mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.},

Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (Z F ) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al-rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (Z P ). Remarkably, ∼60% of the framework channels’ Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections’ Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Brønsted acid sites (BAS), Z F exhibits a 1.8-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Z P during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site-specific 31 P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h −1 , which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h −1 ). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to Z P . These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high-performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite-based catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The preparation of peptidic molecules is a mainstay of synthesis, creating new tools that advance chemical biology, catalysis, and drug discovery. Despite the wide adoption of methods for amide synthesis based on electrophilic acyl transfer reactions, significant limitations remain that restrict access to chemical space and plague accessible peptides with imperfect conservation of stereochemical information. These problems persist in key applications (i.e., solid phase peptide synthesis) where reagent excess can be used to drive maximal yield. As a general tactic, however, use of excess coupling agents that are often hazardous is unsustainable. Here we report the synthesis of the antiviral tridecapeptide feglymycin where half of the amides are formed using umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS) to replace conventional amide synthesis. Reliance on UmAS further allowed the enantioselective synthesis of each noncanonical residue from an inexpensive aldehyde. As a result, the most process-intensive components were simplified to a chiral Brønsted acid organocatalyst and potassium iodide/urea·hydrogen peroxide (KI/UHP). This solution-phase total synthesis illustrates the harmonious, strategic application of complementary amide synthesis methods, and it serves as a touchstone for the green synthesis of peptides composed of noncanonical amino amides.},

  abstract     = {Metal–organic cages with polyoxometalate (POM) clusters as nodes are an emerging frontier of coordination-driven self-assembly, but they have been limited to homoleptic cages, which are composed of only one type of organic ligands. We show here that, in the construction of POM–organic cages with Keggin-type {SiW 9 Ni 4 } cluster nodes, introducing a secondary ligand may change the self-assembly processes in two distinct ways: by coordination or as supramolecular templates. The use of a tetracarboxylate panel L C , in complementary to a bent dicarboxylate linker (L A or L B ), allows the integrative self-sorting to give heteroleptic coordination cages POM 8 L A/B 4 L C 4 ( 3 or 4 ) that are otherwise not accessible through either ligand alone. The aromatic L C can also alter the outcome of the self-assembly process by acting as a non-coordinating template, transforming a coordinatively frustrated, homoleptic cage POM 8 L D 6 ( 5 ) to POM 8 L D 5 ( 6 ). These octa-Keggin cages were all shown to be efficient molecular catalysts for visible-light-driven hydrogen production; for 4 , in particular, an apparent turnover number of 4910 was achieved in 5 h under minimally optimized conditions. Mechanistic studies confirmed the existence of both reductive and oxidative quenching processes, with the former being dominant.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of high-performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light-driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light-driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible-light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light-driven nanomotors. Among them, the m -aminophenol-formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine-quinoid structure with a low HOMO–LUMO gap (1.90 eV). These nanomotors feature broad-spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H 2 O 2 concentration, enabling precise control over in-plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO 2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light-driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Defect structures within the carbon matrix play a crucial role in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Fe single atom and nitrogen-doped catalysts (Fe-N-C SACs). However, overlooking the O 2 pre-adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe-N-C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe-N v -C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O 2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe-N v -C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe-N-C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules results in the d-band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules on Fe single-atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.},

Here we present the synthesis, electronic structure analysis, photophysical characterization, and initial demonstration of water-soluble amphiphilic molecular wires, consisting of a rosamine, as a fluorescent PET acceptor, and a PET donor consisting of a conjugated bridge terminated by dimethylaniline (DMA). The rosamine moiety is extended by several carboxylates or polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups, which render the probes highly water-soluble and facilitate labeling of phospholipid membranes, positioning molecules in proper orientation. The probes produced functional responses in electrically stimulated mouse cardiomyocytes and as well as in intact neurohypophysis, and in glucose-stimulated murine islets of Langerhans.

Here we report atomically dispersed manganese‒sulfur (Mn─S) catalytic pairs with strong electronic coupling that integratively drive enzymatic catalysis, in which the S atom not only modulates the electronic structure of the adjacent Mn site to promote substrate adsorption and activation, but also functions as the secondary catalytic site for stabilizing oxygenated intermediates and facilitating product desorption. Consequently, this metal‒nonmetal dual-site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity. As a potential application, the Mn─S catalytic pairs with coupled catalase-, peroxidase-, and oxidase-mimicking activities are successfully demonstrated for synergistic tumor catalytic therapy.

And now, the host–guest-doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host–guest-doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the “strong assisting weak” effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79 s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5 s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long-lived RTP materials.},

By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH 3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first-principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity.

However, the investigation of solid-state LOBs is limited with little understanding of their discharge and charge processes. In this work, a polymer-based solid-state LOB is used to investigate the effect of discharge rate on lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ) formation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and cycle performance. Notably, we observe a counterintuitive trend: Li 2 O 2 particle size increases with increasing discharge current density, in contrast to liquid systems. This behavior arises from inherent space charge layers that restrict Li⁺ transport under high current, and spatially heterogeneous active sites at the solid electrolyte–cathode interface, directly evidenced by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which govern nucleation accessibility and promote site-selective Li 2 O 2 growth. Furthermore, higher current densities improve ORR and OER efficiency but accelerate anode degradation, while lower currents promote side reactions. These opposing effects result in a trade-off that defines an optimal discharge rate (0.1 mA cm⁻ 2 ) for maximizing cycle life. This study provides a new mechanistic perspective on discharge-driven processes in solid-state LOBs and offers practical guidelines for performance optimization in future high-energy battery systems.},

However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic-based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 (4Br2FBZ = 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine-π, which achieves a stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection.

This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48 µC cm −2 and a high Curie temperature of 408 K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self-powered X-ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 ), and exceptional detection stability.

  abstract     = {In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple-phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well-defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple-phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen-enriched transport channels. Under low-platinum loading conditions (−0.05 mg Pt cm −2 ) in a H 2 ─O 2 PEMFC, the COF-modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55 W cm −2 , 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high-performance low-platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.},

  abstract     = {In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual-functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni–DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn 2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn 2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni–DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g −1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g −1 , respectively after 10 000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni–DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni–DAPTO cathodes and Ni–DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g −1 . These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high-performance and long-lasting aqueous secondary batteries.},

  abstract     = {Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single-structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm-eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV-induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6 (MC)⊂CB[8], a self-assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day–night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 µg mL −1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%). This work establishes a paradigm for developing light-responsive supramolecular agrochemicals that combine structural dynamism with enhanced functionality, offering sustainable solutions against plant pathogens.},

  abstract     = {Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro- and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid-state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three-armed diazo crosslinker ( 3G ) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C─H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18 mJ cm −2 , in stark contrast to 200–500 mJ cm −2 for diazirine-based crosslinkers) required for sufficient crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G , and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G -based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi-layer structures for dual-mode anti-counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system-level devices.},

  abstract     = {Structural, chemical, and extrinsic modifications of graphene-based nanostructures enable bandgap tuning, optoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum materials design. A well-known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp 2 -hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone-Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene-based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional SW-based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible-light-induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW-based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8 eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene-bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon-based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next-generation optoelectronic devices.},

While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process-specific phase diagrams to model A-element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti 3 AlC 2 , V 2 AlC, and Ti 2 AlN in ZnCl 2 molten salt, we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials—defined here by the Al-to-Zn exchange—of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis. Beyond MXenes, our methodology lays the groundwork for identifying new 2D materials accessible through molten salt etching.},

Although selective and iterative substitutions at silicon have achieved notable achievements, methods for fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes are still lacking. Herein, we established the key dephenylative etherification reaction coupling phenylsilanes and alcohols to alkoxysilanes and then developed triphenylchlorosilane (Ph 3 SiCl) as the surrogate to tetrachlorosilane for the iterative and controllable ligation of four different alcohols to one silicon center as fully heteroleptic tetraalkoxysilanes.

Recently a promising family of photoswitches based on the rhodanine motif was described. Here, the photophysics of a typical example are investigated by ultrafast UV and IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, the photophysics are very different to and more complex than those of closely related monomethine photoswitches, which relax by ultrafast internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the rhodanine photoswitch, the allowed Franck–Condon excited state also relaxes on a sub-picosecond timescale, but the ground state is repopulated only after several hundred picoseconds. Instead, the Franck–Condon state relaxes through (at least) two intermediate states. These states are characterized by transient spectroscopy, and the reaction pathway is modeled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggests that a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is rapidly populated via coupling of a nearly degenerate nπ * state populated by ultrafast internal conversion from the bright ππ * state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has important implications for the synthesis, analysis, and application of rhodanine photoswitches.},

Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high-entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B-site elements (Pb 2+ , Sr 2 ⁺, Ca 2 ⁺, Cd 2 ⁺, and Mg 2 ⁺). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr 3 NCs (∼7 nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band-edge shallow states. We show that these HEA-induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.},

However, simultaneously increasing the electron density, improving the electron transfer, CO 2 capture, and catalytic efficiency within nanopores remains a challenge for optimizing the performance of such nanoreactors. Here, micro- and mesoporous triazine-COFs were in situ grown on amino-modified BiVO 4 nanosheets (BVO), respectively, obtaining two-dimensional heterojunctions. A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf 2 ]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL-confined COF mesopore-nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38-fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH 4 in pure water under UV-vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z-scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi-hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM] + cations, ii) promoted CO 2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO 2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM] + cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.},

Herein, we report the directional depolymerization of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) to ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) under solution conditions through innovative design of catalyst structure. The (BisSalen)Al catalysts, featuring a confined cavity, demonstrated exceptional performance, enabling highly selective depolymerization of PCL with excellent monomer selectivity (>99%) and yield (93%). The mechanism of selective depolymerization was further investigated in detail through controlled NMR experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work reveals the correlation between catalyst structure and depolymerization selectivity, providing theoretical guidance for the design of directional depolymerization catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH * desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH * desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn 3 O 4 , in which Ru clusters are decorated on Mn 3 O 4 via Ru─O─Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn 3 O 4 facilitates the water dissociation, whereas the formed heterointerface can efficiently desorb OH * via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec −1 , surpassing recently reported Ru-based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 increase about 11- and 8-fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high-performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.},

Genetic manipulation of the lipid metabolic network or supplementation of a high-fat diet/oleic acid (OA) are the traditional routes for voluntarily triggering LD formation in cells and animals to study the role of LDs in disease biology. We developed a new screening platform for identifying small molecule-based LD inducers, which identified linoleic acid (LOA, diunsaturated fatty acid) as a better tool than OA (monounsaturated fatty acid) in promoting LD formation in cells. Subsequent screening and validation discovered a novel heterocyclic compound and respective iron complex for promoting a rapid organization of endogenous lipids into droplets by mimicking desaturase function and modulating oxidative lipid metabolism. Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H 2 S from CO 2 , another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H 2 S from CH 4 , the selective removal of H 2 S from CO 2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H 2 S, departing from conventional acid-base interaction-based liquid-phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H 2 S. Dispersion-corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H 2 S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H 2 S into [HS]⁻ species. The unique cascade H 2 S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H 2 S, endowing the [6ca]-derived ILs with unprecedented high H 2 S capacities and record-breaking H 2 S/CO 2 selectivities (67–89 at 1.0 bar and 229–319 at 0.1 bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy-efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H 2 S/CO 2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.},

Particularly, the β-turn conformation, which is prevalent in proteins, has not been reported in synthetic polymers due to its unclear formation mechanism and extremely poor stability. Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-decorated poly(L-cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic-aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from β-sheet to β-turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual-modal approach to real-time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors. Such conformation-mediated structural and functional transformations hold significant potential for specific drug delivery and theragnosis of diseases such as cancer.},

Here, we report a facile yet effective biomineralization strategy to construct nanovaccine (OVA-ATV@MnO₂) that co-delivers ovalbumin (OVA) and atorvastatin (ATV) within MnO₂ matrix. The ATV-mediated nanovaccine reprograms endosomal trafficking by inhibiting the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thereby delaying endosomal maturation and preventing antigen diversion to degradative lysosomes. This intervention significantly enhances antigen preservation and MHC-I presentation in DCs. Simultaneously, the MnO₂ framework not only stabilizes the vaccine nanostructure but also releases Mn 2 ⁺ ions as an adjuvant to potently activate the cGAS-STING pathway, amplifying DC maturation and antitumor T-cell priming. In vivo studies demonstrate that the nanovaccine induces robust tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable prophylactic immunity. By synergistically rewiring intracellular antigen trafficking and amplifying STING-mediated immune activation, this mineralized vaccine platform provides a transformative strategy for precise cancer immunotherapy.},

Here, we found that a highly conserved G-rich region surrounding transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of Sox2 gene can form G-quadruplex (Sox2G4) both in vitro and in cells. More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) rather than Λ-f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that Δ-f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that targeting G-quadruplexes of pluripotency genes can regulate the fates of CSCs.

Their counteranions often stand aside from the catalytic cycle or occasionally participate in the catalytic cycle as a Brønsted base due to their nucleophilic character. Herein, we developed a stable yet Lewis-acidic anion, BBcat , based on tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and featuring Lewis-acidic catechol borane moieties and applied it to transition-metal catalysis to recognize Lewis-basic substrates. Upon admixture with Bu 4 N – BBcat , 31 P NMR chemical shift of O═PEt 3 significantly lower-shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX-BBcat exhibited an 8.2-fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX-BArF consisting of the non-coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis-basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis-basic sites, located at remote positions to the C─H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis-basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition-metal center and the counteranion.},

  abstract     = {Protein-based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and the ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood–brain-barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled-coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of the targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7-fold increase in doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulation compared to TRAP and demonstrates a 1.3-fold improvement in uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near-infrared (NIR) dye-labelled TMPA (NIR-TMPA) is intravenously administered to mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and to control mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model reveals a significantly prolonged distribution-phase (short-phase) half-life in tumor-bearing mice compared to control, while the elimination-phase (slow-phase) half-life remains comparable between groups. This suggests altered early-phase kinetics likely due to tumor-associated sequestration or retention. The resulting increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in tumor-bearing mice supports enhanced accumulation or slower clearance. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs and 3D reconstructions of whole mouse heads further corroboratesa preferential localization of NIR-TMPA in tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of TMPA and its future derivatives for targeted GBM therapy.},

This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500–800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1–100 copies per well. A PEGNAB-based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost-effectiveness, and ultra-high sensitivity. In a double-blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

Ethanol and methanol on Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC are electro-oxidized to acetate ion and CO 2 as the final product, respectively. Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC exhibits long-term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate.

  abstract     = {Transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydroboration of alkenes is one of the most straightforward methods for the synthesis of chiral organoboron compounds and has been well-established. While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom-substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here, we disclose a cobalt-catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac) 2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2-, 4,1-, 1,4-, and 4,3-hydroboration products in good yields and high regio- and enantioselectivities (up to >99%). Mechanistic studies, including deuterium-labeling, kinetic, and UV–vis experiments, suggest the involvement of Co–H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late-stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.},

  abstract     = {The periphery surrounding oxide-supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal-oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO 2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface-to-surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15 nm. Operando modulation–excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface-bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO 2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal-specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal-oxide interfaces.},

This was used as a model reaction to investigate the mechanism of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) in our previously reported asymmetric [3+2] photocycloaddition. They proposed a new electron transfer pathway in which the electron from the excited state of the radical anion 4DPAPN* •− solvated in acetonitrile. This article replies to their Correspondence, including: the experimental and theoretical analysis on the driving force of electron transfer and a series of new experiments conducted with purer reagents under more stringent conditions, which suggest that the process of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) followed by ConPET cannot be excluded, as proposed in our previous publication. Yet, Ceroni et al.’s efforts to study organic photochemical reactions using time-resolved spectroscopy remain worthwhile, and their proposed mechanism also led us to consider other possible pathways for the reaction. This article concludes with a series of constructive suggestions for further studying the ConPET mechanism using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and other techniques.},

A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO) 4 ] – anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PN H P ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(–I) centers. Then, the PhSiH 2 group at the Co(–I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + cation, regenerating the [Co(CO) 4 ] – species. [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H 2 and the corresponding silyl ether. Alternative reaction pathways, including alternative ionic mechanisms or NH-assisted bifunctional mechanisms, result in higher activation energies.},

  abstract     = {Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV-transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade-off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual-sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly-shaped UV organic–inorganic hybrid crystals—(C 6 H 4 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (PCSF) and (C 10 H 6 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (QCSF)—in which planar π-conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb 3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense π–π stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record-high birefringence of Δ n = 0.87 at 546 nm, surpassing all previously reported lone-pair-containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN 2 O 2 F] coordination geometry, near-planar molecular configuration, and extended π-electron delocalization. First-principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the π-conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next-generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.},

  abstract     = {Sub-Ångstrom pore engineering offers a new paradigm for molecular separations. Here, we report sucrose-derived carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) with precisely tailored sub-Ångstrom slit pores that enable diffusion-gated kinetic sieving for the challenging separation of alkenes from alkanes. The optimized materials, C-Suc-650 and C-Suc-750, set new industry-leading standards for the kinetic separation of C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 and C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 , respectively. Through a combination of breakthrough experiments, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) modeling, we demonstrate that these sieves consistently achieve >99.9% alkene purity, with outstanding selectivity, rapid uptake kinetics, and remarkably low energy consumption. Mechanistic studies reveal that slit pore architecture uniquely enhances alkene diffusion while hindering alkane movement, establishing a clear design principle for next-generation, energy-efficient gas separations. These results provide a blueprint for exploiting diffusion-gated kinetic sieving at the sub-Ångstrom scale to address longstanding challenges in industrial gas purification.},

  abstract     = {Privileged chiral catalysts have transformed asymmetric synthesis, conferring generality to processes that are routinely leveraged in the construction of societally important functional small molecules. Operating in the ground state, these catalysts are conspicuous in their ability to simultaneously regulate reactivity and translate chiral information, often with broad substrate tolerance: this technology continues to expedite chemical space exploration. In stark contrast to the specificity of many enzymatic transformations, this promiscuity affords remarkable latitude for creative endeavour in synthesis. Given the transformative impact that stereoselective photocatalysis has had over the last decade, identifying privileged chiral catalysts that permit reactivity and enantioselectivity to be regulated in excited-state scenarios has emerged as an attractive but challenging frontier. Providing solutions to address this paradox will require the reactivity/selectivity divide to be reconciled through the validation of chiral scaffolds that effectively operate in non-ground state environments. Inspired by the venerable treatment by Yoon and Jacobsen entitled “ Privileged chiral catalysts ” ( Science 2003 , 299 , 1691–1693), this mini-review is intended to survey the conception and evolution of privileged chiral photocatalyst scaffolds, and offer a perspective on emerging contenders.},

  abstract     = {Donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymeric mixed ionic–electronic conductors (PMIECs) have been widely used in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) due to their structural diversity and the tunability of their frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels. However, the slower development of n-type materials compared to p-type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene-based donor building block, 2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)fumaronitrile ( DTFMCN ), for D–A conjugated n-type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one-step process. The DTFMCN-based D–A conjugated polymers, S-DTFMCN and B-DTFMCN , exhibit extremely low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n-type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra-low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high µ C* values of 13.49 and 13.57 F cm −1 V −1 s −1 , respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n-type OECT devices reported to date. This study highlights the effectiveness of DTFMCN in improving the operational stability of n-type OECT devices, offering promising potential for applications in bioelectronics.},

  abstract     = {The development of high-performance elastomers for additive manufacturing requires overcoming complex property trade-offs that challenge conventional material discovery pipelines. Here, a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress–strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi-component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (>10 MPa) and high strain at break (>200%). Analysis of the high-performing materials revealed structure-property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine-guided, human-augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi-objective materials optimization.},

While combinations of Ni pre-catalysts and Al additives are known for site-selective C─H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD) 2 ] and [(BDI)AlH 2 ] ( 1 ; BDI = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl-β-methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni–Al heterometallic complex [( η 4 -COD)Ni{( μ -H) 2 Al(BDI)}] ( 2 ; COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp 2 )─H activation of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H 2 evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy 3 . The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1 st order in PCy 3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9–1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C─H oxidative addition and H 2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.},

  abstract     = {Partial fluorination of oxides has positioned oxyfluorides as a promising class of nonlinear optical (NLO) materials owing to their balanced optical properties. However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chain-based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors , namely, the ∠(O─Nb─O′) bond angle, χ [F,Nb,Nb′,F′] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO 2 F 4 ] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating π-conjugated biuret (C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 ) molecules with optimally aligned 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chains, we synthesized (H 3 O)(Biu) 2 (NbOF 4 ) (Biu = biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record-breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH 2 PO 4 , among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (Δ n = 0.062 @1064 nm) and wide band gap ( E g = 4.50 eV) further support its potential as a high-performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material. These results highlight the power of structural fingerprint optimization in fully activating polar chains and offer a new strategy for designing next-generation UV NLO crystals with enhanced SHG performance.},

We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically-controlled higher-order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase-separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.},

Extending the device durability is still very challengeable for these emitters. Deuteration of emitters to slow down their degradation and lengthen device lifespan is a promising strategy. However, how to access deuterated high-order MR-TADF emitters remains to be explored. Herein, a synthetic protocol of high-order B/N products is proposed using deuterated starting materials and sequential borylation. Combining with fine-tuning electronic effect through adjusting position of tert -butyl ( t Bu) substituents, we successfully obtained deuterated triboron MR-TADF material ω’-DABNA-D that delivers precisely tuned pure-green emission with close-to-unity quantum yield and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The resulting binary OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% at maximum and 30.7% at 1000 cd m −2 . Additionally, an Ir(ppy) 3 -sensitized device shows excellent operational stability, with an extrapolated lifetime (LT 80 ) of 6078 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 .

Here, we report the first-in-class mitochondria-targeting anion channels derived from a structurally simple tetrabenzylphosphonium framework, in stark contrast to its phenyl-based counterpart, which lacks anion transport activity. Structural and computational analyses underscore the critical role of the methylene (CH 2 ) linkers in the benzyl groups. These CH 2 units reduce positive charge delocalization to enhance σ-hole–anion interactions, while also enabling H-atoms from both the CH 2 linkers and aromatic rings to cooperatively form multiple C─H⋯anion H─bonds. In further conjunction with the rigid benzene rings, they help create sufficient spatial voids to accommodate anion translocation, collectively facilitating and energizing the anion transport process. Among the series studied, those bearing methyl and tert -butyl substituents exhibit the highest transport activity via a channel mechanism, with a conductance value as high as 26.5 ± 0.8 pS. Furthermore, leveraging the cationic nature of the quaternary phosphonium center, this family of anion channels readily achieves targeted mitochondrial localization, demonstrating potent anticancer activity, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.42 to 3.04 µM across three cancer cell lines.},

  abstract     = {Surface grafted organozirconium catalyzes C─H/Et─Al exchange reactions, involving saturated hydrocarbons and AlEt 3 , to afford organoaluminum compounds and ethane. The Zr(O t Bu) 3 @SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3–700 ( 1 ) catalyst contains monopodal ≡SiO─Zr(O t Bu) 3 and only a few residual silanols (<5%). Nonetheless, these silanols are the Achille's heel of 1 , providing a pathway for surface and catalyst degradation during catalysis, limiting the alkylaluminum yield and catalyst turnover. Support degradation, involving the cleavage of Si─O bonds by activated surface organometallics, is inhibited by capping silanols with ─SiMe 3 . Residual silanols in 1 react with allyltrimethylsilane, as determined by solid-state 13 C and 29 Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and reaction stoichiometry, to form Zr(O t Bu) 3 /SiMe 3 @SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3–700 ( 2 ), which is resistant to degradation by AlEt 3 . C─H alumination of dodecane catalyzed by 2 produces higher yields of the 1-dodecylaluminum product in comparison to 1 , and in >95% selectivity. Additionally, methane undergoes 2 -catalyzed C─H alumination, providing a route to AlMe 3 .},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE-5d, TPE-10d, and TPE-20d), combined with steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter-mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE-20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure–property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.},

However, most conventional systems suffered poor thermal stability of chiral configurations and low luminescent dissymmetry factors. Herein, we reported a pair of triptycene-bridged enantiomers with a point chirality and a donor–acceptor architecture. Robust point chirality, originating from quaternary bridgehead-carbons, prevented the common racemization during thermal sublimation. Thanks to the reduced electric transition dipole moment (µ e ) in donor–acceptor architecture, tuned parallel alignment between the further reduced µ e and magnetic transition dipole moment (µ m ) in the exciplex emitter, and the utilized chiral exciplex host for energy transfer to phosphor, the corresponding dissymmetry factors of emitters were sequentially amplified from 3.3 × 10 −4 to 4.5 × 10 −3 , and to 8.1 × 10 −3 . Remarkably, the CP-OLED device simultaneously achieved outstanding electroluminescence performance with a high external quantum efficiency of 31.8% and a large dissymmetry factor of 2.2 × 10 −2 . This work provided a viable pathway for developing high-performance CP-OLED materials through synergistic structural, material, and device engineering.},

Given the challenges of traditional chemical synthesis, which relies on precious metals and complex synthetic ligands, our approach utilizes base metals derived from natural metalloenzymes for transfer hydrogenation and employs protein scaffolds to achieve stereochemical control. Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H-dependent C═N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H-dependent cellular functions.

Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene-protected Cu(I)-alkynide cluster, {NaCu 35 (TC4A) 4 (Ph-C≡C) 20 } ( Cu 35 ), which exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. This metastable cluster can grow into a Cu 36 species via ion substitution or undergo thermal-induced fragmentation to form a smaller Cu 14 cluster. Under thermal etching by Ag + ion, structural reconstruction is triggered, leading to the formation of the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 and Cu 40 Ag 16 clusters. The structural reorganization significantly alters the catalytic outcomes in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Although the monometallic Cu 35 and Cu 14 favor gaseous CH 4 /C 2 H 4 production, the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 demonstrates remarkable selectivity for ethanol synthesis. Notably, Cu 14 Ag 6 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 49.27% for ethanol production, alongside a high partial current density of −67.94 mA cm −2 . This marks the highest ethanol selectivity reported to date for atomically precise cluster catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, compared to homometallic Cu⋯Cu dual sites (which typically favor C 2 H 4 ), the unique Ag⋯Cu⋯Cu trimetallic microstructure in Cu 14 Ag 6 is more thermodynamically favorable for asymmetric C─C coupling between *CHO and *OCH 2 , facilitating the formation of the key *CHO−*OCH 2 intermediate, which drives the ethanol-selective pathway.},

  abstract     = {The independent regulation of multiple intermediates is critically important for optimizing the electronic structure of nickel (Ni), thereby improving its catalytic performance in the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer–Nørskov d-band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold-twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high j k,m value of 106.6 mA mg Ni −1 , which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold-twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW cm −2 with H 2 /O 2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. Furthermore, the catalyst also exhibits excellent long-term cycling performance, taking a giant step forward toward the commercialization of platinum group metal (PGM)-free HEMFCs.},

Traditional heavy-metal-based and crystalline systems are often toxic and environmentally sensitive, while strategies involving host–guest doping and encapsulation frequently suffer from phase separation and limited controllability—ultimately resulting in poor repeatability and restricted applications. Here, we developed a novel polyphenol-mediated molecular splicing and ring-locking strategy to incorporate benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BZT) into polyphenol molecules, yielding a range of eco-friendly and processable amorphous single-component systems with a lifetime of up to 124 ms. Experimental and calculational analyses confirm that phosphorescence arises from synergistic interactions between polyphenol and BZT. Furthermore, phosphorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via nanoprecipitation in tetrahydrofuran with 30% water content. These well-dispersed, metal-free NPs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, facilitating time-resolved luminescence imaging with minimal background fluorescence interference both in vitro and in vivo. This research establishes a versatile and sustainable design strategy for developing high-performance amorphous RTP materials using plant polyphenols, offering promising prospects for advanced biomedical applications.},

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1α-target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PS B -BCB-04 stabilized HIF1α under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC ( k i =  7.9 ± 1.3 nM) and preventing VHL-mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a sevenfold difference in its EloBC-binding capacity. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1α degradation enabled isomer-specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1α and provided a new toolbox for on-demand photocontrol over the HIF-signaling pathway as well as VHL-mediated degradation.},

Although Li 2 MnO 3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox-active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural-engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel-layered heterostructures (designated as LMO-SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O 2− ) and molecular oxygen (O 2 ) – the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese-based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li + diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO-based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high-capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single-atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high-activity candidates. High-throughput screening of 261 transition metal single-atom-doped metal oxides (M SA -MO x ) identified nine top-performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential < 0.5 V), including Mn SA -RuO 2 and Fe SA -TiO 2 (theoretical overpotential < 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant-potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of Mn SA -RuO 2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, ML prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO 2 cathode in high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO 2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high-efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr 2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO 4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO 4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de-solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self-optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr-MnO 2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), better rate capability (115 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g −1 , when compared with pure δ-MnO 2 electrode. This study provides a new insight on understanding the functions of ion intercalation engineering to design robust layered cathode for high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries and beyond.},

The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding α-chloro-β-keto esters, showing high D- syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar = 2-furyl) and simotaxel (Ar = 2-thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross-coupling chemistries performed on the p -bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti- conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an ( S )-configured C─Cl bond, in addition to the D-facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short-chain dehydrogenase enzyme.},

The methodology enables selective halide exchange, broad functional group compatibility, and late-stage diversification of eight bioactive molecules and nine pharmaceutical motifs. Furthermore, a gram-scale reaction with batch and continuous flow conditions underscores its scalability and synthetic utility. The catalyst is robust and recycled five times without any loss of catalytic activity, reaching a total turnover number >850.

Herein, a 2D c- MOF single crystal (Cu-TBP) with dual active centers was synthesized using an octahydroxyl tetrabenzophenazine (8OH-TBP) ligand. Three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) analysis reveals the atomic-level crystal structure of Cu-TBP, characterized by a planar 2D rhombus network and a unique slipped AA layer-stacking. Cu-TBP exhibits typical semiconducting behavior with a high electrical conductivity (7.69 × 10 −3 S m −1 at 298 K) and a low thermal activation energy. Owing to its abundant redox-active sites and superb electrical conductivity, Cu-TBP shows remarkable electrochemical performance as a SIB anode, achieving a high reversible capacity of 369.7 mAh g −1 at 0.25 A g −1 , exceptional rate capability, and extraordinary cyclability (82.6% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 0.25 A g −1 ).

This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe-cMOFs) that enable efficient NO 3 RR via an unconventional [6 + 2] electron-transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2 + 6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO 3− to *NH 2 OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO 2− and guarantees selective NH 3 production. The CoFe-cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH 3 -producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h −1 cm −2 in neutral electrolyte. The Zn-NO 3 − battery prototype incorporating CoFe-cMOFs exhibits 3.6 mW cm −2 peak power density with stable NH 3 production.

These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity but also exhibit excellent physicochemical stability and contain abundant redox-active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT-COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (<0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 .

In the bond rotation transition state, these electrophilic groups form close contact with an electronegative C═O oxygen. Thus, strong electrophilic groups significantly lowered the rotational barrier. As a result, the rotational barriers were inversely correlated with the strengths of the electrophiles. The rotational barriers were measured by dynamic NMR (EXSY), enabling the quantification across a wide range of types of electrophiles. Computational analysis confirmed that the observed variations arose from intramolecular interactions in the transition state, where the C═O oxygen served as a probe of both the electrophilic group's electrostatic potential and steric accessibility. By simultaneously capturing attractive and repulsive transition state interactions, E RB provides an effective means of predicting electrophilicity and reactivity trends across a broad range of electrophiles and reaction types. The utility of E RB was initially validated using a series of rotors containing Michael addition electrophiles, followed by broader application to a diverse array of reactions involving sp 3 and sp 2 electrophiles, including S N 2, S N Ar, Pd-oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions.},

Three new crystal structures are identified: a three-dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated Ca 2+ complexes for x = 1, a molecular structure of neutral complexes for x = 4, and a structure of cationic complexes for x = 6. The thermal stability generally decreases with increasing CH 3 NH 2 content, and samples with x > 2 slowly release CH 3 NH 2 in “open” atmosphere at room temperature, but are stabilized in “closed” environments, e.g. capillaries. The ionic conductivity increases with CH 3 NH 2 content and correlates with increased void space and structural flexibility, reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 5.0·10 −5 S cm −1 at 60 °C for x = 4. Moreover, the effect of nanocomposite formation provides mechanical stability and a doubling of the ionic conductivity for Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ·4CH 3 NH 2 − MgO (50 wt%), reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 1.3·10 −4 S cm −1 at 60 °C.

Conventional sequential treatments for their simultaneous removal face major issues of catalyst deactivation and byproduct generation. Here, we develop a subtle strategy using light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis with Fe(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-Feᴵᴵ) to achieve redox-coupled conversion of NO and SO 2 mixtures. LMCT excitation in EDTA-Fe II induces directional charge separation under irradiation, routing photogenerated electrons (e⁻) to Feᴵᴵ for driving selective NO-to-N 2 conversion (selectivity: 99.89%), while photogenerated holes (h + ) oxidize SO 2 to SO 4 2 ⁻ (selectivity: 96.34%). This spatial segregation of redox pathways suppresses N 2 O generation, enabling continuous operation with 90.3% NO and nearly 100% SO 2 removal efficiency. Mechanism studies reveal the LMCT-enhanced charge transfer from carboxyl/amino groups to Fe centers, while in situ EPR confirms the •SO 3 2 ⁻ radical-mediated h + scavenging that accelerates charge separation and utilization.

  abstract     = {Glycerophospholipids (GPLs) play important roles in cellular compartmentalization and signaling. Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL-mediated signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution-processable, n-doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n-PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, an efficient, scalable and cost-effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n-PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone-mediated or copper-catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO 2 -catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 )-catalyzed polymerization of n-PBDF. Remarkably, MoO 3 at parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations achieves near-quantitative monomer conversion (>99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain-growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high-quality n-PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO 3 mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This innovation not only provides a scalable, low-cost route to high-quality n-PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.},

These fungi are distinguished by a distinctive cell wall architecture further reinforced by two virulence-associated layers, melanin and capsule, rendering them insensitive to antifungal agents targeting the cell wall, such as echinocandins. The molecular interplay between these three biomolecular layers remains poorly understood. Here, we employ solid-state NMR spectroscopy to examine intact cells of both wild-type and capsule-deficient strains of C. neoformans , along with melanized cells. High-resolution 13 C and 1 H data revealed five distinct structural forms of α-1,3-glucans that play versatile roles in forming the rigid cell wall scaffold by interacting with chitin microfibrils and chitosan, and in stabilizing the mobile matrix by associating with β-1,6-glucan and a small fraction of β-1,3-glucan. Two primary forms of α-1,3-glucans were distributed throughout the wall, capable of hosting melanin deposition in the inner domain and capsule attachment on the cell surface. These findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding the cryptococcal cell wall and its interaction with two key virulence factors on opposite sides, raising critical biochemical questions that could inform the development of more effective antifungal treatments for cryptococcosis.},

However, their costly synthesis and the vague understanding of their mechanical property hinder extensive progress. Herein, the supramolecular complexation approach is developed for the feasible construction of MGMs with hierarchical structures, while in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is applied to monitor the mechanical deformation of MGMs for microscopic understanding. Amphiphilic oligomers are assembled from the ionic attraction of 1 nm molecular clusters and further pack into ordered hexagonal phases (HEX1) driven by hydrophobic interaction. Interestingly, stretching can induce structural orientation, and thus triggering the transformation of HEX1 to another hexagonal phase (HEX2) with denser packing, accounting for the tensile yield behavior of the MGMs. The supramolecular structure endows hierarchical structure relaxation dynamics, enabling their unique viscoelasticity with a resilient rubbery plateau even at high temperatures. Their flexibility renders the capability to facilely process the MGMs into highly oriented films and coatings with anisotropic properties for potential applications in optical device fabrications.},

  abstract     = {High-performance solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are crucial for advancing all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain-boundary-free nature, which facilitates intimate solid-to-solid contact and uniform lithium-ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen–chlorine dual-anion framework, formulated as Li 3 x +0.1 ZrN x Cl 4.1 , for high-voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li 2 ZrCl 6 with a triclinic structure, increased N 3− substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 ), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li + conductivity from 0.46 to 3.01 mS cm −1 , alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8 V. This dual-anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high-energy LiNi 0.83 Co 0.06 Mn 0.11 O 2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g −1 at 4.5 V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long-term cycling stability exceeding 3000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50  °C) and higher cut-off voltages (up to 4.8 V). These results highlight the promise of dual-anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next-generation SSEs beyond traditional single-anion systems.},

  abstract     = {n -type lead chalcogenides showing high thermoelectric performance are rare due to the larger energy offset between the two lowest energy conduction bands minima, leaving ample opportunity to modulate electronic structure for improving their thermoelectric performance. Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ∼1.8 at 873 K in n -type PbSe doped with MoCl 5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl 5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4 d orbital hybridized with the Se 4 p -Pb 6 p . This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n -type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (σS 2 ) of ∼21 µW cm −1 K −2 at 873 K for PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 . When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano-heterostructures (5-30 nm) of PbSe-MoSe 2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano-heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κ lat ) of 0.20 W m −1 K −1 at ∼725 K in PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 sample.},

In this work, we report a generalizable solution for selective alkylation chemistry that combines the selectivity of enzyme catalysis with the reactivity of off-the-shelf alkylation reagents. We employ engineered transferases in a modular cyclic cascade and use functionalized N -heteroarenes as challenging proof-of-concept substrates. This catalytic alkylation approach is mild, highly chemo- and regioselective, proceeds on gram-scale, provides rapid access to important N -alkylated heterocyclic building blocks and enables challenging late-stage alkylations. This study demonstrates a generalizable strategy to streamline synthetic routes to many pharmaceutically important compounds by selective biocatalytic alkylation of polyfunctional molecules and ambident nucleophiles.},

Although Zn (100) exhibits faster Zn electroplating/stripping kinetics than Zn (002), its high chemical reactivity results in susceptibility to water-induced side reactions. Herein, a two-pronged electrolyte engineering strategy is proposed to enhance the reversibility of Zn anodes, that is, modulating vertically oriented Zn (100) plating while simultaneously constructing a water-poor electrical double layer (EDL). Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB − ) anions of sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) function as a Zn 2+ trapping agent at the inner Helmholtz layer, displacing active water molecules and inducing the preferential deposition of Zn on the Zn (100) crystal facets, thus effectively inhibiting both side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, a symmetrical cell with the ZnSO 4 /NaDFOB electrolyte exhibited a long lifetime of over 950 h under severe conditions of 10 mA cm −2 and 5 mAh cm −2 . Furthermore, a practical Zn||NH 4 V 4 O 10 pouch cell could achieves a high capacity of 156 mAh at industrial-level mass loading of 16.6 mg cm −2 .

The composite showcases outstanding CO 2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FE formate ) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of −0.5 V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long-term stability over 150 h.

  abstract     = {Integrating different polymer types into a unified system in a thoughtful manner leverages their complementary advantages, providing a promising strategy for developing high-performance materials. Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs), characterized by their unique spatial entanglement, exhibit distinctive performance advantages, yet their potential to expand material properties through rational integration with other polymer architectures presents substantial opportunities for continued investigation. Herein, we report a coherent integration of covalent polymers (CPs) and mechanically interlocked polymers through sequential orthogonal polymerizations, developing a novel synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP) featuring both structural stability and force-induced dynamics. Compared to its structurally similar but noninterlocked control sample, CMIP demonstrates markedly enhanced thermomechanical stability and performance recovery, achieving a 93.4% recovery efficiency at 100% strain after just 5 min of rest, in contrast to 59.7% for the control. This remarkable stability and recovery result from the synergistic interplay between the covalent polymer framework and the interlocked structure, which work in tandem to preserve network integrity and enable rapid host−guest reformation. Notably, despite this significant improvement, CMIP retains a comparable damping capacity (91% versus 87%) and material toughness (14.8 versus 15.1 MJ m −3 ), owing to the efficient energy dissipation mechanisms enabled by host−guest dissociation and subsequent sliding motion. This strategy imparts CMIP with unique characteristics, offering a prospective pathway for the development of a diverse array of advanced synergistic materials with enhanced, multifaceted properties.},

However, achieving both high sequence fidelity and structural diversity remains a significant challenge using conventional synthetic protocols. To address this issue, we introduce a versatile halide-pair-driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy that enables the library synthesis of sequence-controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs). By optimizing halide pairing in conjunction with a rationally designed Buchwald ligand–Pd system featuring catalyst-transfer capability, we achieved efficient sequential cascade aminations, thereby enabling the MCP. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated through the synthesis of a library of sequence-controlled PTAAs, including dendronized variants, underscoring its potential as a general platform for functional semiconducting material discovery.},

  abstract     = {The first stable heavy carbene homologues, the heavy tetrylenes, were reported in 1973 by Lappert and coworkers. These tetrylenes were extensively investigated with respect to ground state reactivity, such as small molecule activation, insertion into σ-bonds, coordination chemistry, materials chemistry, or catalysis. Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that the bright yellow-colored diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature-dependent time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time-dependent) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed, involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second-order Jahn–Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights toward a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long-lived emissive excited states, with Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 being the prototype.},

Chirality, a fundamental characteristic governing biological recognition and signal transduction, remains underexplored in stannate clusters compared to extensively studied precious metal clusters. Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin-oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C─H···π interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non-chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor ( g lum ) of 1.5 × 10 −2 . Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin-oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect. This supramolecular chirality induction paradigm offers new insights into the rational design of multifunctional optical materials.},

As a prominent class of reactions, transition-metal-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C─H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92%, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (>99%). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor, which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule-substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in-solution and on-surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.},

An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni–O 2 –Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof-of-concept strategy with S, Co co-doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron-withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co–O 2 –Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000-h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm −3 H 2 @ 4000 A m −2 .

Here, we report the decoration of PdCo alloy on self-supporting carbon cloth with N-doped carbon arrays (PdCo-NC/CC) for efficient photothermal catalytic methanation. In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3 d -4 d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz 2 -5 σ and dyz -2 π* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation. Specifically, the self-supporting substrate provides highly dispersed metal sites for CO 2 methanation while serving as a photo-to-heat converter to improve the temperature of the reaction system. As a result, PdCo-NC/CC exhibits unprecedented photothermal performance toward CO 2 methanation, delivering a CH 4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol g metal −1 h −1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source. Moreover, the continuous flow photothermal reaction can be smoothly proceeded over 100 h, demonstrating the high stability of PdCo-NC/CC in CO 2 hydrogenation.},

Although post-treatment of InP cores with zinc compounds is a common approach to alleviate interface strain, conventional synthesis methods often fail to achieve effective doping, typically leaving zinc on the core surface rather than within the lattice. Herein, we present a dual-mode strain relief strategy using the small-molecule precursor Zn(Ac) 2 . Its ionic bonding character and low steric hindrance enable efficient Zn doping into the InP core and promote uniform epitaxial shell growth, leading to a 50% reduction in interfacial strain and a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield in InP QDs. This approach simultaneously addresses two major sources of strain: lattice mismatch between the core and shell and steric hindrance from bulky surface ligands. The fabricated green InP-based QLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 26.3% and a current efficiency of 108.3 cd A −1 . We believe this strategy provides a general and scalable strain engineering platform for QDs, with broad applicability across various material systems.},

Carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) have emerged as promising candidates; however, achieving precise sub-Angstrom micropore control and ensuring structural stability remain significant challenges. Here, we introduce a dual cross-linked strategy to engineer microporosity of the resulting CMSMs by utilizing a decarbonylated 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (DABA)-induced rigid network ( Type A ) in conjunction with a sulfur bond-induced flexible network ( Type B ). The 6F-D-S-CMS membrane exhibits a record-high H 2 permeability of 3464 Barrer with H 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 3807, surpassing the Robeson upper bound. Upon pyrolysis at 850 °C, the 6F-D-S-CMS-850 membrane achieves exceptional selectivity values: H 2 /CH 4 at 6538, H 2 /N 2 at 1634, and H 2 /CO 2 at 149—outperforming most reported CMS membranes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Type B network suppressed CH 4 adsorption (3.6 cm 3 g −1 versus 6.2 cm 3 g −1 ) and significantly enhanced the small pore volume ratio ( V H2 / V CH4 : 10.3 versus 2.1) during carbonization, thereby eliminating non-selective pathways and reducing inter-skeletal spacing (4.09 Å versus 3.78 Å), which enables precise molecular sieving. This rigid-flexible cross-linked strategy for CMSMs establishes a scalable blueprint for next-generation hydrogen production.},

Enhancing the exciton diffusion length ( L D ) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [Δ G (r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium-MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended L D and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ-based all-polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in J SC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record-breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco-friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8-BO) with small-area devices (0.0621 cm 2 ), whereas large-area modules (23.60 cm 2 ) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.},

  abstract     = {In photoactive metal complexes the localization of photoexcited charges dictates the site of chemical reactivity, but few studies measure the charge redistribution in these systems with spatial precision. Herein, we track the inter- and intra-ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light-driven charge separation in the well-studied “molecular lightswitch” [Ru(bpy) 2 dppz] 2+ (aqueous [Ruthenium II (2,2′-bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine)] 2+ [Cl − ] 2 ) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real-time using ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. Sub-70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra-ligand electron transfer following Ru-to-dppz metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time-resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter-ligand electron “hopping” between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru-to-bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well-studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light-driven electron transfer chemistry.},

Hypotheses on how it does this have been proposed, but open questions remain regarding the importance of the polarity of the reaction mechanism and of intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), among other factors. We propose the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed-width cavities and UV–vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C═C bond. In all cases, no substantial changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.},

Although “dual-locked” probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan-cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy-H-NTR , a cascaded-activation, doubly quenched NIR-II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity—universal tumor hallmarks—it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan-cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem-locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan-tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR-II emission and “activation–retention” mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9-fold higher tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan-cancer models, it enabled high-contrast imaging (T/N ∼7.8) and precise resection with sub-2 mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem-locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR-II imaging capabilities, and activation-retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan-cancer identification and surgical navigation.},

Herein, we propose the strategy aimed at adjusting electronic properties of Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs through constructing oxygen vacancies on Ce/WO x , thereby fostering SCR activity. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs not only provide more Ce 3+ sites for promoting the reactivity of adsorbed NO, but also accelerate the reaction between NH 3 and gaseous NO owing to the generation of W 5+ species with superior surface acidity, which enhance Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanisms, respectively. Consequently, the designed catalysts achieve over 90% NO x conversion above 250 °C and exhibit higher activity than normal Ce/WO 3 and V/W-TiO 2 commercial catalysts, with anti-poisoning of SO 2 and H 2 O under harsh working conditions, expecting to provide the guidance for promoting de-NO x industrial application.},

The strongly electron-withdrawing N-functional groups of Bpy •− radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na + from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF-rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g −1 , and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high-capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles.

However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors ( g lum ) in Cu(I)-based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared 1D chiral ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 (where MPZ is 2-methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular–tetrahedral configuration in the noncentrosymmetric cubic P 1 2 11 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH 2 PO 4 . Additionally, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and g THG-CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG-based CPL detection in Cu(I)-based metal halides. The self-powered CPL photodetectors based on ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0 V and further achieve self-powered X-ray detection with excellent low-dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure–performance relationship in chiral organic–inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) provides a promising strategy for producing high-value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high-performance photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen-coordinated metal-organic cages (MOCs) (Ni 8 L 12 X 4 , X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate-limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO 2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni 8 L 12 I 4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 µ mol g −1 h −1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl- and Br-coordinated Ni MOC by 200- and 5-fold, respectively. This work opens a new coordination engineering strategy for fabricating efficient photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) synthesis from NO x under ambient conditions presents a sustainable alternative to energy-intensive industrial methods, but its selectivity remains limited by unbalanced active hydrogen (H*) supply and intermediate adsorption. Herein, we develop boron-doped amorphous Bi metallene arrays for efficient nitrate-to-NH 2 OH electroreduction. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B-induced p-sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential-determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH₂OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at −0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts. This work not only proposes a novel catalyst design leveraging amorphous engineering and orbital hybridization but also demonstrates the efficacy of pulsed electrolysis in steering reaction pathways for electrosynthesis.},

We contribute here to this field with the development of a unique class of supramolecular polymers that are able to selectively encapsulate guest molecules within their lumen. This is achieved through a rational design of the monomer units, which self-assemble in amphiphilic cyclic entities that then stack into lipophilic tubular architectures that contain a polar pore. These tailored assemblies are able to host hydrophilic dye molecules that are complementary in size and chemical affinity for the pore coating. Dye extraction is characterized by: (1) the emergence of the dye absorption and emission features in solution, (2) a red shift of the absorption and emission maxima, caused by a confined environment of high viscosity, and (3) an energy transfer process from the monomer at the tube's walls to the included dye guest, which was characterized by photoluminescence (PL), excitation, and transient absorption measurements. When different dyes are co-encapsulated, the tubular supramolecular polymer provides a unidimensional confined chiral environment to promote sequential energy transfer processes between them.},

However, there are often a multitude of factors at play; hence, it can be unclear how operating conditions can be rationally tuned to optimize selectivity. Here, we demonstrate how the identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can control the selectivity of electrochemical C─H chlorination. Specifically, we obtained a 90.3% Faradaic efficiency with KCl as compared to 78.4% with LiCl for the conversion of cyclohexane to chlorocyclohexane at 1000 mA using an IrO x electrode. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments indicate a greater propensity for Cl − oxidation to generate Cl radicals in the order: K + > Na + > Li + . This leads to an increase in the selectivity toward the chlorination of cyclohexane and a concomitant decrease in competitive Cl 2 formation. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments indicate that this is likely due to a decrease in *Cl binding energy on IrO x in the presence of K + . These findings highlight the important role of alkali metal cations, which can be a key consideration for designing electrochemical organic synthesis systems.},

Although homocysteine (Hcy) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring amino acid, it was excluded from the universal genetic code. Hcy is very interesting, yet mostly unexplored, for probing protein active sites because of its subtle structural and electronic differences from cysteine and serine, which are widespread catalytic residues in enzymes. We report the genetic encoding of a new protected Hcy precursor, HcyX, that can be conveniently deprotected by chemical reductants or bioorthogonal reagents. We find varying and sometimes remarkable levels of activity for different purified enzymes with Hcy at catalytic positions. By exploiting partial intracellular deprotection to Hcy, we show that two proteins rendered Hcy-dependent, an intein and thymidylate synthase, can rescue growth of Escherichia coli by catalyzing a reaction essential for cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples in which cell growth is linked to a genetically incorporated ncAA directly involved in catalysis. We further demonstrate that Hcy-based disulfide bonds are chemically more stable than cysteine disulfides. Together, these findings open new paths for the experimental evolution of the genetic code.},

However, overcoming the inherent incompatibility between metal and enzyme catalysts and optimizing their stability and activity to achieve effective synergy, remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an enzyme-assisted, confined synthesis of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) within the nanochannels of covalent organic frameworks (COFs), to construct efficient enzyme-metal hybrid catalysts for cascade reactions. The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co-encapsulation and dual-optimization of both components. Using Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) and Pd nanoparticles as a model system, Pd/CALB@COF exhibits an 8.2-fold higher yield in the kinetic resolution (KR) of racemic 1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA), and a 2.7-fold enhancement in racemization conversion, compared to counterparts without COF. Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers 91% yield, >98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines. This strategy has been validated across different metal-enzyme systems, establishing a versatile platform for designing efficient enzyme-metal cascade systems.},

Herein, an ingenious design of a high-performance Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms (Ni SAs) and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin-like TiO 2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73 µmol g cat. −1 h −1 . Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and activation, generating *N 2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO 2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N 2 to form a “tower-like” urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual-active-site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high-value products.},

In this study, we used a solvothermal method to synthesize a sub-1 nm copper oxide-phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CuO-PMA) for ultrasound (US)-controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to induce pyroptosis. Owing to the narrow bandgap of CuO-PMA, the electron holes are rapidly separated under US irradiation, then quickly migrate through the sub-nanosheet structure to the surface to catalyze the formation of singlet oxygen (¹O₂) and superoxide anions (•O₂⁻), while simultaneously consuming glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, leveraging electron delocalization properties, US triggered the directional migration of electrons in CuO-PMA, facilitating the Cu(II)-to-Cu(I) transition to enhance hydroxyl radical (•OH) production. The ROS burst together with ions and h + -mediated GSH exhaustion synergistically provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating the caspase-1/GSDMD axis to induce pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CuO-PMA significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed excellent antitumor immunotherapeutic effects. This sub-nanosheet amplifies ROS generation in response to the electronic delocalization characteristics of the US, which provides a new strategy for the ultrasound-controlled pyroptosis activation (sonopyroptosis) and tumor immunotherapy.},

However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small-molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein-targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR-ABL, BRD4, EGFR L858R , and EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S . Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the “pan-kinase” inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK-3β, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide-containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.},

Here, we report that a rationally designed flexible metal–organic framework (FMOF), featuring a specifically engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality, can promote the efficient one-step separation of C 2 H 4 from a ternary mixture. Adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough tests provide experimental evidence confirming the selective adsorption of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 over C 2 H 4 on such a FMOF, as well as its ability to separate C 2 H 4 from a CO 2 /C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 ternary mixture. Theoretical calculations and simulations provide critical insights into the flexible adsorption process and the separation mechanism of the FMOF. The bifunctionality incorporated in FMOF provides exceptionally strong binding of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 but inhibition of C 2 H 4 , which, in turn, enables high adsorption selectivity for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 .

Herein, we report a facile chemical platform for the synthesis of photodegradable and thermo-reversible, model hydrogels consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the elastic strands and dithioacetal moieties at the cross-link points. The gels were synthesized via an acid-catalyzed step-growth reaction of a difunctional PEG-thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross-linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross−links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water-swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV ( λ = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm −1 ), and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating were investigated by dynamic shear rheology. Mechanistic insights for the photodegradation mechanism of the system were gained by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and kinetic studies on a model dithioacetal compound.},

  abstract     = {Anion-π + type photosensitizers with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature have demonstrated promising potential in photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer. However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the π + core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion-π + type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion-π + type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF-Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE-PEG 2000 to obtain NPs (named DF-TB X or DF-FTB X , X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF-Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X = 8 in DF-TB 8 and DF-FTB 8 , resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF-FTB 8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion-π + type photosensitizers.},

Comprehensive experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated their distinct configurational preferences: Q5H exclusively adopted the meso ( P , P , M , M ) configuration, while Q6H produced only the ( P , P , P , P )/( M , M , M , M ) enantiomeric pair. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction unambiguously confirmed the unique “four-bladed propeller” structure of ( P , P , M , M )- Q5H .

Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between nonzero and zero values in both second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ (2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second-harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported. Herein, for the first time, we reported homochiral metal halide ferroelectrics ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 (BTA = 3-bromo-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium), which exhibits a 432 F 2 ferroelectric phase transition at 362 K, accompanied by the switchable matrix elements between nonzero (for point group 2) and zero (for point group 432) values in both χ (2) and d matrices. They show strong SHG-CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432 F 2 phase transition enables ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG-CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG-CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG-CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase.

Although, their transformation into valuable products has attracted great attention, efficient and selective transformations remain challenging. In this work, we report a catalytic system composed of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) stabilized by poly(ionic liquids) (Ru@PIL), that enables the selective chemo-divergent hydrogenation of EC into either EtOH and CO 2 or EG and CH 4 , under solvent-free conditions. Those transformations relied on the multi-task ability of poly(ionic liquids) (PILs), which provides efficient electro-steric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates, and organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter-anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I − , triggers the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation-hydrogenation process. Conversely, in the presence of non-nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically a spectator, yielding to the “direct hydrogenation” of EC by the RuNPs.},

Here, based on the donor-acceptor molecular backbone, an oligoether chain is introduced with different chain lengths to endow two novel SAMs, namely, EPA and MEPA, with good capability of bottom-up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiO x with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain-containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization, and importantly well-matched energy level alignment at the top surface, especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiO x /MEPA-based PSCs along with good device stability, which can maintain 90% of the initial efficiency under ISOS-L-1 conditions over 1260 h.},

  abstract     = {Integrating solar-driven CO 2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic-ferroelectric heterojunction (WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 ), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO 3-x and ferroelectric polarization in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 , thereby not only promoting energetic hot-carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot-electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K 4 Nb 6 O 17 surface for CO 2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO 3-x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76 µmol g −1 h −1 ), which is 9.87 and 6.27-folds higher than that of K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C─C coupling for directed production of more value-added hydrobenzoin (313.15 µmol g −1 h −1 ). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar-to-fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.},

In this study, we investigate 9,9′,10,10′-tetraphenyl-2,2′-bianthracene ( TPBA ) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn - and anti -TPBA . To address the “Janus-type” photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation-wavelength-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn - and anti -TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge-transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment-dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in-depth study of the Janus-like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.},

  abstract     = {Cyclodextrin-based slide-ring gels (SRGs) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross-links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light-responsive SRGs based on azobenzene-containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) macrocycles. By using UV–Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that α-CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E to Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.},

  abstract     = {Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs) are highly phosphorylated signaling molecules that regulate diverse cellular processes, including phosphate homeostasis and energy metabolism across species. Despite extensive research on well-characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP-InsPs, such as 5-PP-InsP 5 (5-InsP 7 ) and 1,5-(PP) 2 -InsP 4 (1,5-InsP 8 ), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5-PP-InsP 4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31 P-NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18 O-labeled PP-InsP 4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), enabling the assignment of PP-InsP 4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation-induced root-specific PP-InsP 4 isomer does not match any 5-PP-InsP 4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6-OH]-InsP 5 and [3-OH]-InsP 5 at the 5-position, while other InsP 5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP-InsP 4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP-InsP 4 , providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.},

The development of nanofluidic devices necessitates the integrated solid-state nanochannels/nanopores with versatile surface modification strategies using precise nanofabrication techniques. This review systematically summarizes the development of the solid-state nanochannels and nanopores, nanofabrication methods, sensing principles, transport characteristics, and the strategies employed to perceive molecules and physical stimuli. The discussion also emphasizes promising research directions and explores how the interaction between interface chemistry influenced by molecular recognition and physical stimuli, in conjunction with the exceptional ion transport properties of nanofluidic devices, significantly impacts the sensing performance of the nanofluidics. Lastly, we present the vision for the future prospects of biomimetic nanofluidic devices in ionic sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi-domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication-mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co-occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis -COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis -COM domain within an E-COM-C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity-dependent photo-crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis - and trans -COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.},

Therefore, designing high-molecular-weight acceptors with well-defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene-tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g mol −1 and a well-defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8-IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8-BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state-of-the-art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature ( T g ), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high-performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Most record-efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin-coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent-bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent-antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in-situ crystallization monitoring via time-resolved UV–Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%–50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256 h storage in N 2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra-wide processing window (10 s–10 min bathing duration, >2 min post-bathing delay tolerance).},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage. However, their application is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low-temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with the desolvation kinetics of Zn 2+ . We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3-butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable glass-forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen-bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid–liquid transition temperature from −16.4 to −101 °C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn 2 ⁺ to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by-reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long-term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at −40 °C under 0.1 mA cm −2 /0.1 mAh cm −2 , and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (−40 °C to 60 °C).

However, their selective synthesis remains a considerable challenge in catalysis. Regioselective hydration of non-activated C─C double bonds is typically hindered by poor selectivity and low atom efficiency in conventional methods. In this study, we harness the underexplored potential of the acyclic carotenoid 1,2-hydratase from Rubrivivax gelatinosus IL144, employing it as a whole-cell biocatalyst for cofactor-independent terminal hydration of a diverse range of terpenes. This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C 12 ─C 20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high-yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations. These findings highlight the biocatalytic potential of acyclic carotenoid hydratase, offering a green and efficient route to the production of valuable tertiary alcohols.},

  abstract     = {The direct conversion of methane-to-methanol remains a critical challenge in methane valorization. In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO 2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd 0.3 Au 0.7 /CeO 2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (∼80%) at 500 K with a 1:1 methane-to-water ratio. While Pd/CeO 2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over-reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO 2 composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine-tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO 2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.},

  abstract     = {High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug-protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging-based HCS and bio-orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof-of-concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide-alkyne (TL-alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe-labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio-orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.},

Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn-SAM) strategy through blending a non-planar molecule 3,3-(4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)-dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me-4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi-device compatibility. The single-junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn-SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm 2 ) for 1.56  and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively.

We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA-binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA-binding activity of a mtDNA-packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.},

  abstract     = {Covalent organic framework materials have recently garnered significant interest from the scientific community due to their fascinating properties that include highly ordered porosity, structural versatility, high chemical and thermal stabilities, and facile surface modification. Herein, for the first time, we present the design and fabrication of a self-powered blue-light photodetector based on boronate-ester-linked 2D covalent organic framework (COF-5) film, synthesized using hexahydroxytriphenylene and 1,4-phenylenediboronic acid organic linkers. Specifically, we have developed a COF-5/n-Si photodetector that exhibits an ultra-short rise response time of 41 µs and a decay response time of 222 µs under 0 V bias. Our work integrated rapid response times and the distinctive benefit of self-powering, setting it apart from existing COF-based photodetectors.},

  abstract     = {Zero-dimensional metal halides have emerged as a versatile platform for the development of light-emitting materials, but achieving tunable or even multicolor emission from a material containing a single type of metal has proven highly challenging. Here, we leverage the “structural tolerance” of recently-developed polymeric metal halides to integrate two distinct coordination units of a single metal into a material, thereby achieving highly tunable optical properties in single-phase metal halides. By manipulating the steric hindrance of polycations, facilely adjustable green, red or bicolor emission can be realized in manganese bromides, which originates from controllable transformation from manganese-bromine tetrahedra into octahedra. This design principle is further extended to polymeric copper halides, wherein broad self-trapped exciton emissions derived from distinct copper-iodine polyhedrons allow the emission colors to be linearly tunable from blue to yellow, encompassing pure white light, by tailoring the composition, excitation wavelength, or temperature. This study opens avenues for facile and precise modulation of the optical properties of metal halides by exploiting the intrinsic coordinative diversity of metal elements.},

  abstract     = {The stress-responsive up-regulation process is a sophisticated biological response to maintain cellular homeostasis. In intracellular anti-oxidant systems, the expression level of oxidoreductases is up-regulated under oxidative stress, mitigating oxidative damage on biomolecules and enhancing protein folding capacity. Herein, inspired by the biological system, we developed a synthetic folding promotor whose reactivity is up-regulated under stress conditions. We conjugated two metal-binding 1,4,7,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligands and a redox-active disulfide to obtain cyclam-SS, whose reactivity can be enhanced under metal-induced stress. Metal coordination increased the redox potential of cyclam-SS, activating it as an oxidant. While Cu II ions severely hampered the oxidative folding of substrate polypeptides, cyclam-SS exhibited bifunctional folding-promoting properties, i) suppressing Cu II -mediated misfolding and aggregation, and ii) harnessing Cu II to enhance oxidative folding. Cyclam-SS was also useful for disulfide-bond formation to promote oxidative folding of pharmaceutical and pathological proteins, as demonstrated with proinsulin and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, cyclam-SS protected cultured cells from copper-induced stress. Thus, we demonstrated the induction of the stress-responsive up-regulation process by a bifunctional folding promotor controlling the folding status of biologically important proteins under metal-induced stress. The strategy of “stress-responsive up-regulation” could aid the development of novel synthetic materials for treating intracellular stress and related disorders.},

  abstract     = {In solid-state lithium-ion batteries, the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current collector as in lithium-ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando charge and mass transport. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on simplified models. Herein, we build digital-twin electrodes with digital-space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital model-driven simulation, we find an “lithium trapping” effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next-generation energy storage.},
