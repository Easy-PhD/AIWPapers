  abstract     = {Catalytic asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes represents an efficient and atom-economical strategy for the assembly of valuable chiral cyclic targets in a single step. However, this strategy traditionally relies on the cyclometallation process. Moreover, there are no versatile asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition methods for diynes that are compatible with C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds. Here, we disclose a copper-catalyzed asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition of diynes via vinyl cations. This universal [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition is suitable for the asymmetric cycloaddition of diynes with various C─C double/triple bonds and C─X double bonds, leading to a range of valuable chiral hexahydropyrrolocarbazoles, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazoles, and tetrahydropyran[4,3-b]indoles in generally excellent yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Importantly, this protocol features the first asymmetric [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition via vinyl cations, and constitutes the first construction of carbon stereocenters in triyne cyclization.},

Here, we report a hexatopic fluorescent building block with triangular antiprismatic geometry, developed via steric-hindrance-directed conformational control and the integration of triphenylamine units. Its imine condensation with linear diamines afforded two crystalline 3D COFs with unambiguously resolved 6-fold Class IIa interpenetrated pcu topology, as determined by continuous rotation electron diffraction. Interestingly, both COFs exhibit yellow-green solid-state fluorescence and high-contrast piezofluorochromism under hydrostatic conditions. This work introduces a new class of fluorescent polyhedral nodes to expand the structural diversity of fluorescent 3D COFs and highlights their potential as stimuli-responsive materials for interesting applications.},

  abstract     = {Despite quasi-2D perovskite light-emitting diodes (quasi-2D PeLEDs) having shown great potential in the fields of light emission and display, the uncontrollable crystallization processes and substantial defects of perovskite emissive layer still limit their further development. Herein, we reported the design and in-situ synthesis of A′-site cations with oxygen–phosphorus–nitrogen–carbon (O─P─N─C) frameworks in perovskite precursor solutions by incorporating diphenylphosphinic chloride (DPCl), a bifunctional molecule containing both P─Cl and P═O functional groups. The P─Cl groups undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions with the ammonium terminals of formamidinium (FA + ) and phenethylammonium (PEA + ) cations, yielding large A′-site cations that regulate crystallization kinetics during spin-coating. Concurrently, P═O groups coordinate with undercoordinated Pb 2+ ions at grain boundaries, passivating defects. This dual-functional mechanism synergistically optimized crystallization dynamic and suppressed non-radiative recombination, resulting in compact, low-defect perovskite films. Owing to their synergistic enhancement on device efficiency, the quasi-2D PeLEDs modified with DPCl exhibited a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.07%. This study provides a new strategy for tailoring perovskite materials through A′-site engineering, offering significant insights into the development of high-performance PeLEDs.},

Reaction of the reduced cluster [NEt 4 ] 4 [Fe 6 C(CO) 15 ] ( 1 ) with thiols (RSH) or disulfides (RSSR) affords novel functionalized hexa-iron carbide clusters [NEt 4 ] 3 [Fe 6 C(CO) 14 (SR)] (R = CH 3 , 2 ; C 6 H 5 , 3 ; p -C 6 H 4 CH 3 , 4 ; L -cysteine, L - 5 ; D -cysteine, D - 5 ). Compounds 2–5 have been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), 1 H and 13 C{ 1 H} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and the molecular structures of 2–4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD). The chirality of the L -5 and D -5 enantiomers has been investigated by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and this represents the first VCD study of chiral metal carbonyl clusters. Combined analyses of VCD and calculated density functional theory (DFT) spectra clearly point out the occurrence of chirality transfer from the chiral organosulfur ligand to the CO ligands, as indicated by the presence of VCD bands in the ν CO region of both L -5 and D -5 . This unprecedented transfer of chirality among different ligands arises from close interactions between the CH 2 and CH hydrogens of coordinated cysteine and the CO shell of the clusters.},

  abstract     = {Narrowband organic room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) remains rare due to significant high-frequency vibronic coupling in T 1 →S 0 electronic transition, where T 1 and S 0 represent the lowest triplet excited state and ground state, respectively. Here, we report coronene-derived ( CoDe ) luminophores exhibiting ultra-narrowband RTP (full width at half maximum FWHM = 11.2 nm) with a 1.5 s lifetime and 38% afterglow efficiency in a phenyl benzoate (PhB) matrix. The narrow emission arises from enhanced coupling with low-frequency vibrational modes in localized excitation (LE) states, as supported by vibronic simulations. Under high-power excitation, the CoDe -PhB further exhibits organic long-persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 40 min (FWHM = 14.7 nm), governed by a two-photon ionization-induced charge-separation mechanism. The materials are processable via melt-casting and excitable by ambient or white light, offering practical utility for high-color-purity afterglow display and lighting applications. This work establishes low-frequency vibronic engineering as a new route to narrowband RTP and OLPL emitters beyond conventional multi-resonance-based designs.},

  abstract     = {To address the inherent limitations of layered cathodes in terms of stability, kinetics, and energy density, a high-entropy superlattice layered oxide (K 0.7 Mn 0.4 Li 0.1 Co 0.125 Ni 0.125 Fe 0.125 Cu 0.125 O 2 , KMNCFCL 0.1 ) is proposed as a cathode for K-ion storage. High-entropy composition and [Li─O─K] configuration coupled with Cu─O covalency and local CuO 6 distortion trigger and stabilize lattice oxygen redox through the anionic–cationic redox inversion, essentially a premature ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), thereby alleviating potential issues of severe voltage hysteresis and capacity fade by restraining oxygen release and cation migration. Superior phase stability and strain tolerance with a solid-solution mechanism benefited from high-entropy stabilization, and “cocktail” effects can be successfully achieved by eliminating serious structural evolutions induced by Jahn–Teller (J–T) lattice distortion, O─O repulsion, and intercalation of electrolyte molecules. Furthermore, the enlarged interlayer spacing and disrupted K + /vacancy ordering facilitate rapid K-ion migration with a low diffusion barrier. Therefore, KMNCFCL 0.1 delivers a high energy density of 327.8 Wh kg −1 , superior cyclic stability with a long lifespan of over 300 cycles, and excellent rate capability. This research opens up new possibilities for achieving groundbreaking cathodic functionality in potassium layered oxides.},

  abstract     = {Aminophosphines have emerged as promising phosphorus candidates for the synthesis of InP quantum dots (QDs), offering an alternative to traditional tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine. However, the relatively low reactivity of conventional aminophosphines has led to broader size distribution, resulting in higher full-width at half-maximum (FHWM) with lower photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Here, we introduce a new aminosphosphine, bis(bis(trimethylsilyl)amino) phosphine (P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H), to address this issue. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate the direct nucleophilic activation of the P[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 H with InCl 3 , leading to the rapid nucleation of InP QDs at a relatively lower synthesis temperature. This enabled to achieve InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs with near-unity PLQY and a FWHM of 48 nm. These findings suggest a new chemistry for the synthesis of InP QDs, and could be extended to other III-V QDs for advanced optoelectronic applications.},

Herein, for the first time, we report an optically active ferroelectric OA 2 EA 2 Pb 3 Br 10 ( 1 , where OA is n-octylammonium, EA is ethylammonium), capable of realizing a self-driven full-Stokes polarization detection. Utilizing the bulk photovoltaic effect in 1 , simultaneous detection of both linearly and circularly polarized light can be achieved without requiring an external bias. The in-plane photodetection configuration exhibits a high linear polarization ratio of 2.7 and a circular polarization anisotropy factor of 0.46. More importantly, the full-Stokes polarization detection achieves low average measurement errors for the Stokes parameters of 3.2%–5.3%. This study establishes a new paradigm for the rational design of ferroelectric materials that enable self-driven, filterless full-Stokes polarization detection.},

Herein, we design conjugated polymer-based molecular reactors featuring interlayer diatomic Cu–N 4 sites and precisely tunable spacings (4.0, 4.6, and 5.7 Å) to optimize CO 2 and nitrate coupling. The 4.0 Å-spaced copper polyphthalocyanine (CuPPc-4.0) delivers a remarkable urea yield rate of 460.0 mmol h −1 g −1 with 26.1% Faradaic efficiency at −1.3 V (versus RHE), outperforming wider-spaced analogs. The optimal 4.0 Å cavity spatially confines reactants and intermediates, matching urea's molecular dimensions (3.5 Å), thereby enhancing C–N coupling and urea synthesis activity, while the layered AA stacking structure stabilizes unbonded diatomic Cu configurations, preventing aggregation and ensuring durability. Mechanistic studies reveal that while ball-milling treatment increases single-atom exposure, it disrupts the layered architecture and eliminates interlayer diatomic sites, reducing activity by about 50%.

  abstract     = {Electro-Fenton treatment through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e − ORR) offers an effective approach for degrading persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in water; however, aeration is always required to overcome the low solubility of oxygen in water, ensuring adequate oxygen availability for the 2e − ORR to generate H 2 O 2 and facilitate its transport for activation into hydroxyl radicals. The aeration energy consumption can reach tens of times higher than the energy required for the electrochemical reactions themselves. To address this, we developed an aeration-free dual-cathode system featuring a natural oxygen-harvesting electrode (NOHE). The NOHE's superhydrophobic and microporous structure effectively captures and utilizes anode-generated oxygen for H 2 O 2 synthesis (957.1 mg g cat −1 ) without external aeration. By decoupling H 2 O 2 generation and activation into separate cathodes, the system optimizes both processes independently, achieving superior efficiency. This design demonstrated rapid removal of bisphenol AF (BPAF) in saline environments, achieving 98% mineralization and exhibiting excellent operational stability over 90 h continuous use. By eliminating energy-intensive aeration, our approach may open the avenue for a scalable, sustainable solution for in situ water remediation, with broad applicability in diverse aquatic environments.},

  abstract     = {Flexibility is considered one of the most critical features of framework materials, playing a vital role in applications such as adsorption and separation. Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) exhibit unique flexibility derived from their weak, reversible hydrogen-bonding interactions; however, realizing controlled and functional flexible behavior in HOFs remains a synthetic challenge. Herein, we report a flexible hydrogen-bonded organic framework, HOF-FJU-119 , constructed from an anthracene-core, that exhibits multimode guest-responsive behavior. Upon activation, HOF-FJU-119a undergoes distinct gate-opening transformations in response to CO 2 at 196 K and benzene vapor at room temperature. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and vapor adsorption isotherms reveal the emergence of new adsorption sites in the benzene-loaded phase, driven by strong interactions and the flexibility of C≡N⋯H─C hydrogen bonds, enabling selective benzene/cyclohexane separation. Notably, the adsorption of benzene induces a visible color change in fluorescence emission and a red shift of approximately 60 nm. Structural and density functional theory (DFT) analyses confirm increased molecular planarity, extended conjugation, and a narrowed bandgap. This work demonstrates a rare integration of selective adsorption, molecular recognition, and signal transduction within a single crystalline framework, offering a versatile platform for the development of intelligent porous materials with real-time visual tracking capabilities.},

  abstract     = {The pursuit of advanced adsorbents with exceptional gas adsorption and separation capability represents a highly promising yet challenging research frontier. Several quinary multicomponent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been documented in the literature, however, the construction of quinary MOFs through the synergistic integration of two distinct organic ligands and three different metal clusters remains scarce. Herein, solvothermal reaction of Zn(OAc) 2 ·2H 2 O with adenine and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride afforded a novel MOF of Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC. SCXRD reveals that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC incorporates three distinct zinc-based structural units of a mononuclear [ZnN 2 (O 2 C─) 2 ], a dinuclear [Zn 2 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 2 ], and a hexanuclear [Zn 6 N 3 ( μ -H 2 O) 3 (Ad) 3 (O 2 C─) 6 ], respectively. These units assemble into a novel quinary MOF structure, distinguished as the unusual material constructed from dual ligands and triple clusters. It features three interconnected cage-like cavities replete with uncoordinated carboxylate oxygen atoms and Watson─Crick sites. Gas adsorption investigations indicate that Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC demonstrates notable selectivity toward acetylene, ethane, and propylene adsorption, enabling the single-step ethylene purification from trinary C 2 mixtures and binary MTO products. Computational simulations reveal that preferential adsorptions are facilitated by different supramolecular interaction strengths. Given its cost-effective and readily accessible synthesis precursors, along with excellent thermal and chemical stability, Quin-Zn-Ad-BTC holds great promise for advanced gas adsorption and separation applications.},

Herein, a novel design strategy is reported for realizing high-efficiency oxygen-bridged cyclized boron-based MR-TADF emitters via engineering intermolecular packing mode. Three organic donor–acceptor (D–A) molecules with different molecular configurations are designed and synthesized, which can readily form modulated packing patterns with fastidiously regulating intermolecular charge transfer (CT) in crystalline states. Experimental and theoretical investigations expose that the intermolecular D–A packing modes could be formed in relatively planar molecular architecture, which cannot only fix the intermolecular CT excited-state configuration, but the multiple conversion channels of triplet excitons can also be involved synergistically to accelerate the spin-flip, and thus achieving near-unity PLQY and excellent reverse intersystem crossing rate of 6.7 × 10 5 s −1 in solid states. The optimized OLEDs devices achieve an attractive EQE value of 31.75%, which is at a record high for MR-TADF OLEDs with deep-blue emission. Our strategy boosts the luminescence efficiency of MR-TADF emitters through enabling the participation of multiple triplet states and the confined excited-state conformations induced by intermolecular CT interaction in aggregation state.},

A 24-crown-8 ring is sufficiently small that the side chains of canonical branched amino acids act as barriers that trap the macrocycle on the particular glycine residue used to assemble the rotaxane. The resulting crown ether–tripeptide rotaxane can subsequently be extended from either or both N- and C-termini of the axle. Three distinct positional isomers of a heptapeptide [2]rotaxane containing three glycine units were selectively synthesized, and in each case the unique position of the crown ether on the peptide axle was confirmed by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tandem mass spectrometry. The three positional isomers adopt different conformations in the region adjacent to the trapped macrocycle, and have different chemical stabilities and secondary interactions in comparison to the unthreaded peptide axle. The crown ether does not inhibit enzymatic proteolysis over the entire length of the heptapeptide–axle rotaxanes, but rather provides significant protection from degradation for the three to four residues local to the encapsulated region. The strategy opens a pathway to new analogs of naturally occurring mechanically interlocked peptides.},

  abstract     = {Saturated carbocycles are common motifs in natural products and pharmaceuticals, and so methods for their construction, particularly with high diastereo- and enantiocontrol, are of high importance. Lithiation-borylation has emerged as powerful methodology for the stereocontrolled construction of acyclic carbon chains but has not previously been used for the stereocontrolled synthesis of carbocycles. Herein, we report that benzylic diethylcarbamates with a tethered vicinal bis-boronic ester moiety can be deprotonated with lithium amide bases, resulting in cyclization and 1,2-metallate rearrangement to give carbocycles. This intramolecular lithiation-borylation reaction is completely regioselective and, rather than being stereospecific like the acyclic variants, it is diastereoconvergent. Stereochemistry of the boronic ester is retained but the benzylic stereocenter undergoes epimerization, furnishing carbocycles with high diastereo- and enantiocontrol from easily accessible precursors. Site-selective transformations of the bis-boronic ester products are also demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic polymers are attractive synthetic targets in both polymer chemistry and supramolecular polymer (SP) chemistry; however, there is a gap between these two research fields in terms of the synthetic strategies involved, and achieving a commonality remains elusive. Herein, we describe the formation of two distinct types of cyclic SPs from structurally similar rosette-shaped molecules. The first SP (Type I) is characterized by a uniform diameter and circularity, whereas the other (Type II) has properties reminiscent of flexible cyclic covalent polymers. Remarkably, the only difference in the structures of the two monomers that form these completely distinct cyclic SPs is the absence (Type I) or presence (Type II) of hydrogen-bonding moieties. An all-atom molecular-dynamics simulation suggested that the Type II SP can adopt various “conformations” due to the dynamic nature of its hydrogen bonds, thereby behaving like a flexible covalent polymer. Real-time high-speed atomic-force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the presence of flexibility in the chains of the Type II SP on the observation timescale (several tens of seconds). Our results therefore highlight an example of a similarity between a covalent polymer and a noncovalent SP that should help to bridge the gap between these polymers, leading to new advanced materials.},

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms underlying two principal switching modes: photoconformational and photochemical. Emphasis is placed on their structural design, magnetic behavior, and the methods used for their characterization, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and UV–vis spectroscopy. Selected examples illustrate the ability of these systems to control spin-polarized states, alter magnetic exchange interactions, or switch between singlet and triplet spin states upon photoirradiation. The review also discusses challenges related to thermal stability, bistability, and operation under ambient conditions. Emerging strategies for integrating photoswitches with persistent radicals or redox-active units are highlighted for their potential in molecular electronics and quantum information science. Notably, light-induced diradical species in such systems are gaining recognition as molecular qubits, offering long coherence times and spectroscopic addressability essential for quantum gate operations.

To overcome these challenges, we describe a palladium-copper hybrid catalyst that employs spillover-mediated active hydrogen (H*) redistribution mechanism. Hydrogen spillover from palladium with high H* coverage to copper with low H* coverage creates H* redistribution: reduced H* coverage of Pd mitigates HER while maintaining efficient EAH, and increased H* availability of Cu promotes EAH without activating stagnant HER. Integration of these catalysts into both cathode and anode of a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer enabled efficient ethylamine electrosynthesis and formic acid electrooxidation over 100 h, achieving exceptional ethylamine productivity (6160.0 ± 119.1 mmol g cat −1 h −1 ) and Faradaic efficiency (94.2 ± 1.6%) at record-low energy consumption (3.55 kWh kg ethylamine −1 ).

Combining this approach with engineered P450 catalysts exhibiting divergent regioselectivity enabled the expeditious synthesis of a panel of ring-expanded analogs of various complex natural product substrates. Importantly, the skeletal modification was found to drastically altered the anticancer activity of some of these compounds. By the direct targeting of aliphatic C─H sites with tunable site-selectivity, this strategy provides a powerful tool to rapidly access skeletally edited derivatives of natural products and other bioactive molecules for applications in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

The In 3+ /In redox couple offers a favorable potential that mitigates acidic corrosion while matching the MnO 2 two-electron redox. Systematic investigation of anion effects reveals that concentrated Cl − anions restructure the In 3+ solvation, forming stable chloro-complexes that lower dissociation energy and promote uniform Indium (In) deposition. Conversely, SO 4 2− -rich electrolytes impede In plating but enhance MnO 2 crystallization and MnO 2 /Mn 2+ reversibility. Through tailored Cl − /SO 4 2− ratios and an anion-decoupled dual-electrolyte configuration, the battery operates at ∼1.7 V with 72.3% energy efficiency (EE) and over 1500 cycles at 5 mA cm −2 . Furthermore, we demonstrate an electrode-less IMB using a Bi substrate at the anode, where in situ alloying-driven In deposition enables over 2000 stable cycles at 4 mA cm −2 (2 mAh cm −2 ), delivering a compelling energy density of 484.5 Wh kg −1 and a high cumulative areal capacity of 4120 mAh cm −2 .

Although DUF3328 proteins have long been implicated in diverse modifications of inert C( sp 3 )─H bonds, including halogenation, hydroxylation, and macrocyclization, the biochemical properties and catalytic mechanisms of DUF3328 proteins remain elusive. Here, we report the characterization of the DUF3328 protein CctR, which catalyzes C( sp 3 )─H hydroxylation of fungal cyclic peptide cyclochlorotine. Through AlphaFold modeling, in vitro biochemical characterization, and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CctR is a membrane-associated copper-dependent enzyme that functions as a homodimer. The dimerization of CctR is mediated by its transmembrane helix, a four-helix coiled coil, and C-terminal disulfide bonds. The conserved HxxHC(x) n HxxHC motif, characteristic of the DUF3328 superfamily, is anchored on the dimerization interface and forms a binuclear copper coordination center. Moreover, we show that CctR is dioxygen-dependent and requires electron input for the hydroxylation reaction. Together, these findings define DUF3328 as a previously unrecognized family of binuclear copper-dependent metalloenzymes, capable of catalyzing diverse chemical transformations, and lay the groundwork for future discovery of novel biocatalysts within this widespread enzyme class.},

However, these relationships are difficult to decipher, as the crystal packing affects both the intermolecular interactions and the molecular conformation. Here, we report a divergent synthetic strategy to generate a family of rigid carbonyl-bridged triphenylamine (TPA)-based chromophores via metal-free transformations of the same starting material, and exploit this family to investigate the effects of crystal packing on the solid state RTP properties. The minor bridge modifications lead the TPA derivatives to adopt three distinct crystal packing motifs: parallel columnar stacks, antiparallel zigzags, and nonparallel dimerized arrangements. Despite the nearly identical RTP spectra across the series, the proportion of phosphorescence in their emission and the RTP lifetimes are shown to differ as a result of the different crystal motifs. Computational investigations of dimer models of the solid state reveal that the interplay between fluorescence and triplet formation can be modelled by identifying the aggregate character of dimers in the crystal, but only if pairs in multiple dimensions of the crystal are considered.},

However, in most reported dynamic RTP materials, chromophores serve dual roles as phosphorescent emitters and oxygen sensitizers. This leads to uncontrollable dynamic processes and a reduction in phosphorescence performance. Herein, we present a strategy for achieving controllable dynamic RTP and maintaining the phosphorescent performance by integrating triplet photosensitizers into the RTP polymer. Specifically, by adjusting the concentration of the photosensitizer, the photoactivation time of the copolymers can be accurately controlled within the range of 3–30 s. Notably, after photoactivation, the phosphorescence lifetime of the polymer was prolonged from 558 to 1017 ms, which is longer than that of the polymer lacking a photosensitizer. The versatility of the design strategy was further validated by synthesizing a diverse range of RTP polymers through copolymerization and physical doping, as well as by employing alternative photosensitizers. Given the dynamic RTP feature, we demonstrated potential applications in dynamic intelligent afterglow displays and multilevel information encryption. This work advances the development of controllable dynamic RTP polymers and expands the application scope of stimuli-responsive materials in intelligent optoelectronics.},

Reducing Ir loading while maintaining high performance and durability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anode is critical for the Gigawatt-scale deployment of PEMWEs. Herein, we report an ultra-low Ir anode, consisting of Re-doped Ir nanoparticles anchored on Pt nanowire networks, enabling rational catalyst design at the atomic scale and electrode structure engineering at the nanoscale. The unique doping of Re into Ir was explored as an effective strategy to promote the desirable conversion from metallic Ir to amorphous IrO x during the acidic OER, thus benefiting intrinsic activity and stability enhancements. Notably, the Pt nanowire bundles serve as a support to enhance electrical conductivity and provide a high-surface-area, robust, and interconnected electrode structure, significantly increasing Ir utilization and electron/mass transport at the device level. Three-electrode electrochemical tests revealed that the developed Ir catalyst exhibits a 100% increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and a 160% enhancement in intrinsic OER activity compared to commercial Ir black catalysts. The optimized Ir anode achieved a current density of 3.0 A cm −2 at 1.69 V (0.2 mg Ir cm −2 ) and 1.73 V (0.1 mg Ir cm −2 ) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs), exceeding the US DOE 2026 targets (0.5 mg PGM cm −2 at 1.8 V for 3.0 A cm −2 ).

  abstract     = {Unsaturated phosphorus heterocycles typically exhibit diminished π-aromaticity. A unique entry into metallaphosphirenes featuring σ-aromaticity within an unsaturated framework is reported. Reaction of sodium phosphaethynolate (NaOCP) with cyclic metal carbyne 1 affords phosphorus atom transfer through a formal [1 + 2] cycloaddition pathway. The formation of metallaphosphirene ring was computationally modelled using density functional theory, revealing that [1 + 2] cycloaddition involves direct nucleophilic attack step and, thus, depends on the amphiphilicity of carbyne atom. Comprehensive DFT calculations, including NICS, ACID, GIMIC, EDDB, and NOBD analysis, confirm the predominantly σ-aromatic nature of the metal-based phosphirene system. The reactivity of the metallaphosphirene in cycloaddition reactions is in accord with its σ-aromaticity, which tends to retain the three-membered heterocycle with λ 3 -P atom.},

Herein, we present a design strategy that perpendicularly integrates BN-MR frameworks into a weakly emissive tetradentate Pt(II) complex to achieve efficient narrowband phosphors. Accordingly, we synthesized two novel emitters, BCzBN-PyPt and DPABN-PyPt. The optimized emitter BCzBN-PyPt exhibits exceptional performance characteristics: 1) narrowband red emission at 605 nm with a small full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 35 nm/0.118 eV in toluene, 2) a dramatically shortened exciton lifetime of 1.2 µs (compared to 7.6 µs for the parent complex PhPyPt), and 3) a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield ( Φ PL ) of 75% in doped films–representing a 4.4-fold enhancement over PhPyPt ( Φ PL = 17%). Theoretical investigations reveal that the BN-MR skeleton induces significant electronic perturbation of the singlet state, leading to enhanced transition dipole moments and accelerated radiative decay ( k r = 3.3 × 10 5 s −1 versus 0.1 × 10 5 s −1 for PhPyPt). In optimized OLED devices, BCzBN-PyPt achieves superior red narrowband electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.7%.},

The assembled Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 delivers a considerable CO rate of 57.89 mmol·cm −2 ·h −1 with nearly 100% selectivity under illumination at 5.5 W·cm −2 without external heating, along with a remarkable turnover frequency of 2.28 × 10 5 h −1 . The temperature-programmed desorption, in situ spectroscopic characterization, and DFT calculations collectively reveal that the Si-supported GaN NWs/Ru-RuO 2 enables simultaneous activation of CO 2 and H 2 . Moreover, the synergy between Ru-RuO 2 and GaN substantially reduces the reaction energy barrier from 0.83 to 0.64 eV via the key *COOH intermediate, thereby establishing a new benchmark for light-driven RWGS efficiency.

Currently, only three organic small molecular inhibitors of SMO have been approved for clinically targeted therapy. Herein, we demonstrate a novel strategy to anchor SMO by designing metallodrugs ( RuSe , OsSe , RuIP , OsIP ) containing triadic electrophilic centers (─N(δ − )─X(δ + )─N(δ − )─). In vitro and in vivo experiments validated that the designed triadic electrophilic center drugs could selectively inhibit the activity of SMO, blocking the Hedgehog signaling pathway and effectively killing tumors. Through theoretical calculations combined with experimental data, we verified that the interaction between the protein and drugs increases the polarization of the triadic electrophilic centers. The drugs utilize dual electrophilic centers to fix the binding and use the third electrophilic center insert to the swinging hinge region between TM5 and TM6 of the 7-transmembrane domain of SMO. This strengthens the π-cation lock binding between the transmembrane peptide chains, ultimately inhibiting the mobility of the transmembrane peptide chains and thereby inhibiting SMO activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing SMO specific targeted drugs, offering new hope for clinically targeted therapies.},

However, the structure–performance relationship of additive molecules remains elusive, particularly regarding multisite coordination-mediated synergistic regulation of solvation and interface. Herein, a dynamic configuration reconstruction mechanism that orchestrates the multisite regulation of solvation and interface is unveiled by utilizing a series of polyhydroxy additive prototypes, demonstrating that the increase of functional groups and chain flexibility in multifunctional-group molecules (MGMs) contributes to boosting battery performance. MGM with folded configuration engages in multisite Zn 2+ coordination in the solvation shell, effectively minimizing active H 2 O molecule to suppress parasitic reactions, while its configuration transition to straight-chain architecture enables multisite parallel adsorption on Zn anode interface, thus accelerating desolvation kinetics and steering (002)-facet-dominated Zn deposition. Remarkably, Zn//Zn cells achieve long cycle life of 7000 h and subzero-temperature operation, and Zn//PANI pouch cell maintains nearly 100% capacity retention after 500 cycles.

However, due to the lack of two-electron transfer, rare earth (RE) centers have been considered incapable of promoting reductive elimination, thus limiting the reactivity of RE complexes and their applications in synthetic chemistry. In the presented study, we demonstrated the reactions of β -diketiminate-supported dialkyl RE(III) complexes (L Nacnac - κ 2 N , N′ )RE(III)(CH 2 SiMe 3 ) 2 (THF) ( 1-RE , RE = Y, Er, Yb, and Lu; L Nacnac = {[(2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 )NCMe] 2 CH} − ) with azobenzene at ambient conditions, resulting in the formations of (L Nacnac - κ 2 N,N′ )RE(III)( η 2 - cis -PhNNPh −• ) 2 (THF) ( 2-RE ) and 2-[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]azobenzene ( I ) via a reductive elimination-powered pathway.

The computational studies indicate that the subsequent η 2 -coordination of a cis -azobenzene to the RE(III) centers in this intermediate triggers the reductive elimination between the (trimethylsilyl)methyl group and the neighboring PhNNC 6 H 5 - κ 2 N,C group, consequently enabling the C─C cross-coupling that affords product I . In this elementary process, the two N═N π *-orbitals mainly act as the energetically accessible acceptors for the two electrons being transferred, thereby facilitating the reductive elimination by avoiding the thermodynamically unfavorable 2e-reductions of RE centers.},

Electrolyte additives enhance SEI performance for fast charging and long cycle life but introduce system-level uncertainties, including cathode degradation, safety hazards, and cost escalation. In this study, we prepare a composite electrode (BPQDs/GDYNTs) featuring a charge-separated interface structure to improve the SEI directly without auxiliary additives. The BPQDs/GDYNTs are comprised of graphdiyne tubes (GDYNTs) with black phosphorus quantum dots (BPQDs) distributed on the surface. The charge transfer between BPQDs and GDYNTs creates a charge-separated interface, thereby enabling the efficient adsorption of lithium (Li) ions by the electron-rich state of GDYNTs while promoting the adsorption of hexafluorophosphate anion (PF 6 − ) on the electron-deficient state of BPQDs. That facilitates the in situ formation of a thin and inorganic-rich SEI containing fluorine- and phosphorus-based species, which significantly enhances both the desolvation of Li-ions and their kinetics. When utilized as the anode of Li-ion batteries, the BPQDs/GDYNTs electrode exhibits fast-charging capability and remarkable longevity, demonstrating ultra-stable cycling performance over 50 000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g −1 with negligible capacity decay.},

However, this goal has never been performed simultaneously in one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) COFs, due to the difficulty of dimensional control. Herein, for the first time, we synthesized three novel COFs with different dimensions, from similar composition by manipulating the conformation of the molecular building blocks through repulsion-torsion effect. Impressively, the strong repulsion-torsion effect transformed the planar building block into a non-planar building block, resulting in the construction of 2D and 3D COFs, respectively. Moreover, when we consciously reduced the repulsion-torsion effect, the resulting intramolecular conformation struggled to meet the requirements for the formation of 2D and 3D structures, ultimately generating a rare 1D COF. Further research indicated the charge transfer efficiency and photocatalytic performance of the resulting COFs followed a dimensional order of 1D > 3D > 2D. This phenomenon was attributed to the unique in-plane and out-of-plane double rotational restriction (IODRR) effect in the 1D structure, which stabilized the aromatic framework and thus greatly reduced the carrier recombination probability and energy loss.},

Here, we report a continuous ethylene photosynthesis approach as a new platform technology that enables highly efficient and selective conversion of acetylene to ethylene in liquid under mild conditions. This platform technology is compatible with a wide range of solvents, catalysts, and hydrogen sources. Using Pd/mpg-C 3 N 4 as the model photocatalyst, a complete conversion of acetylene was achieved with high ethylene selectivity (>93%) under the continuous flow of either a pure acetylene stream or a crude ethylene stream containing acetylene impurity. The process performance remained stable for at least 72 h. Physical, theoretical, and in situ spectroscopy investigations showed that the photocatalytic acetylene hydrogenation follows the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and atomic hydrogen-mediated indirect electron transfer pathways with proton as the hydrogen source. The technoeconomic analysis (TEA) demonstrated that this photocatalytic approach has large profitable margins for both ethylene purification and ethylene production processes.

We herein describe an iterative approach based on mathematical modeling and parameter estimation guided by live experimental data to accurately model the oscillating chemical network. Fitting a kinetic model to the whole chemical network proves considerably more effective and time-efficient than determining reaction rates individually and enables quick screening of various parameters. We apply this method to achieve sustained oscillations in flow when changing various aspects of our recently developed oscillating system, demonstrating its potential to facilitate the development and optimization of organic oscillators as well as offering a general framework for analyzing and optimizing complex synthetic CRNs.},

However, ionic thermoelectric performance, including ionic thermopower, output power density, and energy density, needs to be significantly improved to meet practical applications. To date, it still lacks an effective strategy to focus on gels to achieve the overall high performance. Herein, an adhesive and self-healing cationic high-entropy gel (CHEG) G-FeCN 4−/3− -K + -Na + -Li + -Gdm + -Cs + in a multi-ion cooperative chemical environment has been designed by the interaction between multications and anions, improving the entropy change of redox reaction, exchange current density, and ionic conductivity, thereby achieving an overall high ionic thermoelectric performance. The CHEG thermocell using the synergy of thermogalvanic and thermodiffusion effects showed a total ionic thermopower of 41 mV K −1 with 2.3 mV K −1 for the former, and delivered a maximum output power density of 14.3 mW m −2 K −2 and an energy density of 4.5 J m −2 K −2 . In addition, an ultrahigh maximum output power density of 4.13 mW m −2 K −2 was obtained in the CHEG device that was assembled by connecting four thermocells in series, which could realize electrocatalytic degradation of rhodamine B.

The quantum-size effects endow Cu 10 and Cu 11 with distinctly different photophysical properties in terms of their photoluminescence and radioluminescence. Such differences have been rationalized by exploiting the femtosecond transient absorption analysis, demonstrating that the slower non-radiative decay rate and weaker electron-phonon coupling contribute to the superior emission characteristics of the Cu 11 cluster. Accordingly, the Cu 11 -based film demonstrated effective X-ray imaging capabilities, marking the first application of cluster-based nanomaterials for X-ray imaging in the infrared region. This research highlights the potential for regulating different-attribute microenvironments in metal nanoclusters and provides an atomic-level understanding of how to modulate the photophysical properties of cluster-based nanomaterials.},

  abstract     = {P-type organic cathode materials feature multielectron redox activity, structural tunability, and elevated redox potentials, making them promising candidates for battery applications. Nevertheless, their practical deployment remains hindered by inherent challenges, particularly the persistent dissolution issue in conventional electrolytes, leading to rapid capacity fading. To overcome these intrinsic limitations, we propose a biomimetic supramolecular engineering strategy inspired by the hierarchical reinforcement observed in gourd-vine systems, which integrates two synergistic design principles. First, the alkyl-based polymeric backbone and π−π stacking impose steric confinement to suppress solvation-driven degradation. Second, the conjugated aryl groups strategically are positioned on the phenazine scaffold to enhance charge delocalization and activate redox-active nitrogen sites. This approach not only endows the battery system with exceptional long-term cycling stability but also enables high-capacity energy storage with sustained operational durability. The resultant 5,10-diaryl-5,10-dihydrophenazine polymer cathode exemplifies this paradigm, demonstrating outstanding electrochemical performance including an impressive reversible capacity of approximately 120 mAh g −1 at 100 mA g −1 and an excellent capacity retention of 88% over 2000 cycles, representing one of the most robust performances reported for organic cathodes. Comprehensive characterizations combined with theoretical simulations systematically elaborate a dual-mode charge compensation mechanism involving the reversible anion (de)coordination coupled with conjugated π-electron redox activation.},

  abstract     = {The development of effective electrocatalysts for glucose (Glu) electro-conversion is highly desirable for sensing applications; however, is greatly plagued by unstable catalytic active centers during the catalytic process, leading to severe inactivation of active sites and incomplete Glu electrooxidation. Herein, we report a class of single-atom Pt-doped Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with stable high-valence Cu sites (CuO-MOF-Pt 1 ), achieving a complete oxidation of Glu and a milliampere current response toward Glu. We demonstrate that the –CN of MOF and Pt serve as electron-withdrawal sites to induce electron transfer of the Cu site, promoting the electrochemical generation of the stabilized Cu 3+ active center. Using operando spectroscopy and computation, we uncover that a complete glucose electrooxidation reaction (GOR) can be achieved by successive C─C bond scission over CuO-MOF-Pt 1 , and a stable Cu 3+ active center is responsible for its impressive GOR activity. Notably, CuO-MOF-Pt 1 delivers comparable Glu sensing performance with a high sensitivity of 2.587 mA mM −1 cm −2 , a low detection limit of 0.93 µM, and extraordinary durability. We further constructed a miniaturized CuO-MOF-Pt 1 -based sensor, enabling accurate detection of Glu in saliva. This work opens an inspiring avenue to the precise design of stable metal activity centers through electronic structure regulation for boosting Glu electrooxidation.},

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) and microcrystal electron diffraction (MicroED) data show a large torsional angle for meta -phenylenes relative to para -phenylene rings. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental torsional angles and also establish a correlation indicating a gradual increase in strain energy from m 4 (∼31 kcal mol −1 ) to p 4 (∼90 kcal mol −1 ). Structural transitions from m 4 to p 4 lead to additional correlations such as a shift in the lowest absorption wavelength from 330 to 394 nm, a sizeable red shift in the maximum emission wavelength from 444 to 546 nm, and a decrease in fluorescence quantum yield from 0.76 to 0.20, respectively. Time-dependent (TD)-DFT analysis of the relaxed excited state (S 1’ ) geometry shows a progression of exciton delocalization as para -phenylenes are introduced into m 4 en route to p 4 , while the overall molecular size remains constant. This effect is directly related to increased π-conjugation within the nanotube's top-segment and demonstrates how exciton trapping can take place without changing the nanotube's physical size, e.g., diameter and length.},

Acting as a chemical fuel, cyanide transiently drives the formation of this adduct, which can spontaneously regenerate the parent macrocycle under mild conditions, representing a rare demonstration of metastability in a Meisenheimer complex. The dynamic behavior of this system, reminiscent of out-of-equilibrium assemblies, is finely tunable through macrocycle concentration, counterion nature, solvent, and temperature. Detailed crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational analyses reveal that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a key role in stabilizing the adduct.

In this study, we successfully realized the selective modulation of RTP and DF emissions in a donor-acceptor doping system by inducing conformational changes in the donor through solid-liquid transition. In the solid state, the donor adopts a highly twisted quasi-axial conformation, which effectively suppresses non-radiative decay, resulting in efficient green RTP. In contrast, in the liquid state, the donor transitions to a relatively planar conformation, forming the intermolecular charge transfer state with the acceptor, significantly reducing the energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states, thereby facilitating reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) and generating yellow DF. Furthermore, the coexistence of multiple emissive triplet states demonstrates promising applications in information encryption, ink-free rewritable paper, and thermal sensing.},

This top-down reconstruction strategy involves the disintegration of 1,4-ndc linker and transformation of 1D Ni–( μ 3 -OH)/( μ 2 -H 2 O)–Ni chains (which act as precursors), into ultra-low-dimensional (thickness ∼ 1.5–2.6 nm), defect-rich β -Ni(OH) 2 structure. The activated catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 300 mV at 10 mA.cm −2 , surpassing commercial IrO 2 . In situ Raman and powder diffraction studies demonstrate pH- and potential-dependent phase transitions, leading to the formation of catalytically active β -Ni(OH) 2 . In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms progressive structural evolution, with a Ni─O bond contraction from 2.06 to 1.89 Å under catalytic conditions, indicative of dynamic NiOOH phase formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the exposed Ni 2+ centers stabilize OER intermediates and facilitate the adsorbate oxygen evolution mechanism (AEM). The catalyst also demonstrates robust activity at elevated temperatures. This work provides extensive mechanistic insights into catalyst activation and introduces a novel strategy for designing high-performance MOF based OER electrocatalysts.},

Here, deprotonation of the hydroxy ligands in the Zr₃(O)(OH)₃ nodes of a photoactive coordination cage is shown to unlock the photocatalytic oxidation of strong O─H and C─H bonds (70–100 kcal mol⁻ 1 ). Mechanistic investigations reveal that this oxidative process proceeds via a multisite PCET pathway involving ground-state, pre-association followed by a static quenching mechanism. This contrasts with the dynamic quenching mechanism governing the reductive PCET previously reported for the same system.

ECE functions as a novel proton source, with hydroxyl (-OH) groups that are readily oxidized by photogenerated holes, resulting in efficient proton supply compared to H 2 O. Moreover, ECE facilitates membrane assembly via interfacial H-bonding between the -OH moieties of ECE and the modified nitrogen sites of MPB/CN-g-CN, generating proton-rich interfaces and local H-bond microenvironments that synergistically enhance proton supply and CO adsorption, thus steering the reaction toward CH 4 production. As a result, the MPB/CN-g-CN membrane achieves a remarkable increase in CH 4 yield from 0.01 to 35.85 µmol g −1 h −1 and selectivity from 0.4% to 82% compared to the pristine heterojunction.

In this context, space-confined synthesis has emerged as a powerful strategy for engineering high-performance electrocatalysts. Recent studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesized via confinement techniques exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic properties. The confined microenvironment imparts superior electrical conductivity, structural stability, and active site accessibility, while also facilitating elevated catalytic activity and offering potential for scalable production in practical energy applications. In this review, we first present mechanistic insights into nanoconfinement-enhanced water splitting electrocatalysis and characterization techniques including in-situ/ operando analysis for confined electrocatalysts, emphasizing how the confined architectures from one to three dimensions (1D-3D) regulate electronic structures, facilitate reactant adsorption, and reduce energy barriers. We then outline nanoscale confinement strategies, including in-situ and postsynthetic approaches using diverse host materials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and MXenes, along with advanced methods for controlling particle dispersion and size. Next, we summarize recent progress in confined electrocatalysts for water splitting, highlighting density functional theory (DFT)-guided design and structure–property relationships. Finally, we address current challenges and future opportunities in synthesis control, in-situ characterization, and scalable deployment for practical hydrogen production.},

However, at sub-zero temperatures, the operation of LIBs is constrained by degraded electrolyte ion transport performance and severe charge transfer polarization. In this work, we proposed a strategy for the construction of solvation structures dominated by compact ion-pair aggregates (CIPAs) through weak lithium-solvent interactions design, which significantly improved the lithium-ion transference number and reduced the de-solvation energy barrier. Excitingly, this strategy can induce the formation of a robust anion-derived solid electrolyte interface, thereby enabling the rapid transport of lithium ions across the interface even at extremely low temperatures. This electrolyte provides excellent electrochemical performance of practical natural graphite and LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 (NCM811) electrodes. The NCM811||graphite full cell exhibits capacity retention of 84.7% of its room temperature capacity at a high rate of 0.5C at −20 °C, and can be cycled stably for over 200 cycles at −40 °C without obvious capacity degradation.

  abstract     = {Practical aqueous zinc-ion batteries face severe challenges from cathodic dissolution and anodic dendrite growth. Herein, we report a novel electrostatic potential-dominated weakly solvated electrolyte that correlates molecular charge anisotropy with both solvation thermodynamics and interfacial passivation kinetics. By regulating the electrostatic force among Zn 2+ , H 2 O, and weak solvent, the attack ability of free water on vanadium oxide is efficiently reduced, and the vanadium dissolution is effectively prohibited. Simultaneously, the modified solvating structure induces a dense and inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface, promoting uniform zinc deposition and suppressing side reactions. Benefiting from such synergistic optimization, the developed zinc-ion battery achieves a high capacity of 410 mAh g −1 and maintains 80% of the capacity after 650 cycles at 0.5 A g −1 . Stable Ah-level pouch cell with high energy density (138 Wh kg −1 , based on electrode mass; 36.3 Wh kg −1 , based on full cell) is also achieved, paving a promising way for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-heteroatom cross-coupling reactions have become indispensable tools in synthetic chemistry. However, the formation of carbon–sulfur (C─S) bonds, which are essential for producing thioethers used in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, remains significantly underdeveloped. Industrial C─S coupling methods still rely on expensive, homogeneous catalysts that suffer from poor recyclability and are susceptible to sulfur-induced deactivation. In this work, we report a copper single-atom catalyst, where Cu sites are atomically dispersed on mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride, to enable efficient, selective, and recyclable C─S cross-coupling reactions under mild conditions and on a gram scale. The catalyst exhibits excellent resistance to thiol poisoning and maintains high performance over multiple catalytic cycles. Advanced characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected electron microscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and single-atom-sensitive electron energy loss spectroscopy, confirm the atomic dispersion and stable coordination environment of Cu sites. Combined with density functional theory simulations and radical scavenging experiments, our mechanistic investigations support a concerted oxidative addition pathway, which excludes radical intermediates. These results provide key insights into heterogeneous C─S coupling and demonstrate the power of single-atom catalysts in addressing long-standing challenges in sulfur chemistry, paving the way toward greener and more scalable processes for fine chemical and pharmaceutical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, large progress has been made to shift the absorption of photoresponsive molecules into the long-wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum. A breakthrough in this field was the recent development of -extended indigoid photoswitches, i.e., peri -anthracenethioindigo (PAT), exhibiting all-red and near-infrared addressability. The excited-state isomerization mechanisms of this very new addition to the realm of photoswitching are currently not understood at all, prohibiting a rational further development. In this study, we present a combined theoretical and experimental approach, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and second-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(2)) calculations as well as steady-state and time-resolved femtosecond spectroscopy, to explore the isomerization pathways of this photoswitch. Our findings show that photoisomerization on singlet potential energy surfaces (PESs) is highly unfavorable and instead show that photoswitching proceeds on the PES. These insights enable a deep understanding of thioindigoid photochemistry and demonstrate that extension of the -system and peri -connectivity in the heterocycle unlock extremely favorable photoswitching properties along with the desirable red-shift in absorption. Reliable photoswitching from the triplet is achieved because of its favorable energy, which evades undesirable interference of oxygen quenching. These results pave the way for advancing thioindigoid-based photoswitches to improved performance and functionality in a rational way.},

The high crystallinity of HOFs enables us to monitor the precise structure changes and proton transfer process during acid-base neutralization reaction through single-crystal X-ray diffraction. With this information, the origin of basicity and the underlying mechanism can be identified, which further guide us to discover other porous solid bases and unveil the universal characteristic of some anionic HOFs. The practical use of the porous solid bases was demonstrated by base-catalyzed reactions, exhibiting high activity and selectivity.

  abstract     = {Emerging catalytic systems for hydrogen production via solar and mechanical energy conversion often face critical challenges, including band mismatch, interfacial charge recombination, and insufficient charge migration driving forces. To address core issues of low carrier separation efficiency and poor multi-field coupling in molecular ferroelectrics, this study proposes a molecular engineering strategy of dual molecular ferroelectric heterojunctions. We report a facile one-pot solution synthesis of a molecular ferroelectric heterojunction composed of 4,4-difluoropiperidinium lead iodide and 4,4-difluorocyclohexylamine lead iodide ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 /(4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ), tailored for hydrogen iodide (HI) decomposition under simultaneous light -ultrasonic activation. Under dual-field excitation, the heterojunction achieves a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 5.26 mmol g −1 h −1 , outperforming its individual constituents ((4,4-DFPD) 2 PbI 4 and (4,4-DFCHA) 2 PbI 4 ) by factors of 4.5 and 2.4, respectively. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms efficient charge separation at the heterointerface, facilitated by energy-level alignment and polarization coupling. Both experimental and theoretical investigations attribute the enhanced performance to suppressed charge recombination and the synergistic action of ferroelectric and piezoelectric fields, jointly promoting directional charge migration. This work not only introduces a viable molecular ferroelectric strategy for designing high-efficiency piezo-photocatalytic systems but underscores the critical role of interfacial charge dynamics in catalytic optimization, offering theoretical insights and practical guidelines for next-generation solar-driven catalysts.},

We develop a singlet-oxygen activated up-conversion luminescence assay (SOLA) that enables ultrasensitive digital immunometric detection of protein biomarkers in homogenous format with no wash steps. This approach designs a pair of labeled antibodies, one labeled with a singlet-oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) nanogenerator of porphyrin-metal organic framework (pMOF) and the other tagged using an upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) nanoreporter with luminescence caged by 1 O 2 -cleavable quenchers. Formation of sandwiched complex between target protein and antibody pairs mediates close proximity between 1 O 2 -generator and UCNP reporter, enabling efficient diffusion of 1 O 2 around the reporter to activate its luminescence through cleaving off the quenchers. This approach is demonstrated to be capable of activating detectable fluorescence from a single UCNP reporter with a single-molecule protein target. A digital homogeneous immunoassay strategy is also developed for ultrasensitive protein detection, allowing a single-step, no-wash format for digital protein detection with high signal-to-background ratio, wide dynamic range and atto-molar detection limit. The SOLA assay may provide an invaluable paradigm for developing highly accessible and ultrasensitive tools for diagnostics and biomarker discovery.},

The introduction of fundamentally new principles to break symmetry, leading to the formation of a specific enantiomer, is particularly challenging with important implications in numerous scientific fields. Herein we present a helically chiral dynamic molecular switch whose enantiomers are connected via a single symmetric metastable state that can be populated via light or redox stimuli. Relaxation of the prochiral state in the presence of a bound chiral ammonium guest results in the preferential formation of a specific enantiomer through a conceptually unique supramolecular deracemization process. Importantly, the formed host enantiomer is stable even in the absence of guest, enabling reversible and stable chiral information transfer, while oxidation of the host results in an enantioenriched dication that is insensitive to light, allowing orthogonal chiral memory.},

However, achieving stable and reversible high-voltage redox reactions remain challenging due to the inactivation of redox couples during discharge. Herein, we found that coupled redox behavior triggered by orbitals with similar energy levels leads to high-voltage irreversibility and parasitic reactions. To overcome this, we propose a strategy of adjusting the electron cloud topology by altering the electrostatic field, thereby changing the orbital energy gap between the t 2g state of V and the e g state of Mn, effectively decoupling the electrochemical reactions. As a model system, the Na 3.5 MnV 0.5 Ti 0.5 (PO 4 ) 3 (NMVTP) cathode significantly stabilizes the high-voltage Mn 4+/3+ and V 5+/4+ pairs, and increases the reversible capacity from 99.41 to 123.9 mAh g −1 . This strategy opens new paths for developing high-energy density batteries through orbital bandgap modification.},

Herein, we demonstrate a π-conjugated cation engineering strategy to break this limitation, reporting two phosphite-based NLO crystals: (C 2 N 4 OH 7 )H 2 PO 3 (GUPO) and C(NH 2 ) 3 H 2 PO 3 (GPO). The synergistic alignment of π-conjugated guanidinium cations and [H 2 PO 3 ]⁻ anions enables record-breaking optical anisotropy (Δ n = 0.19 @ 589.3 nm for GUPO), surpassing all known inorganic phosphates. Crucially, GUPO is the first phosphate to realize full-wavelength PM, in which the PM wavelength fully covers its optical transparency range down to 215 nm. Concurrently, GUPO exhibits exceptional second-harmonic generation (SHG) response (2.2 × KDP at 1064 nm and 1.0 × β -BBO at 532 nm), which may enable direct 266 nm laser generation. Mechanistic studies reveal that the giant birefringence originates from oriented π–π interactions between cations, while the SHG response stems from the cooperative polarization of cations. This work establishes π-conjugated cation engineering as a paradigm for designing UV NLO materials, with GUPO crystal emerging as a cheap, efficient alternative to conventional UV NLO crystals.},

Although propylene carbonate (PC) demonstrates superior oxidative stability and lower melting temperature than EC, its tendency to cointercalate with Li + within the graphite anode interlayers restricts its applicability in LIBs. We propose a PC-based weakly-solvating electrolyte engineered with difluoroethylene carbonate (DFEC) that resolves interfacial challenges at both electrodes. The PC solvent facilitates oxidative resistance through formation of an inorganic-dominated cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI), effectively mitigating transition metal dissolution at 4.4 V operation. Simultaneously, DFEC disrupts Li + -PC coordination through reduced solvent molecule numbers in the solvation shell, enabling generation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite anodes with minimized interfacial impedance. Implemented in 5 Ah pouch cells, this electrolyte demonstrates 76.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles (2.8–4.4 V) at room temperature (RT) and maintains 91% of its RT capacity at −20 °C, surpassing conventional EC-based electrolytes.

  abstract     = {Gas–liquid–solid triphase reactions are limited by poor gas solubility and mass transfer, especially in water. The low solubility of hydrogen in water severely hinders the hydrogenation, therefore requiring high temperature and pressure to increase the activity, which have safety and cost concerns. Herein, we report a hydrophobic poly(divinylbenzene) polymer-supported Ru nanoparticle catalyst (Ru/PDVB) with both high activity and excellent stability for the hydrogenation of pyridines in water, even at ambient hydrogen pressure (0.1 MPa). The average turnover frequency (ATOF) of the Ru/PDVB (836.8 mol mol Ru −1 h −1 ) is about 6.0 and 768.0-fold higher than those of traditional Ru/C and commercial Raney Ni catalysts under equivalent reaction conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the hydrophobic polymer prevents filling of water in the nanopores of PDVB, allowing hydrogen enrichment to boost the hydrogenation. This work provides an opportunity to improve the efficiency of industrially important reactions that suffer from poor gas solubility and mass transfer.},

As such, strategies to efficiently access carbon-boron bonds from simple chemical feedstocks are highly desirable. The radical borylation of alkyl bromides presents an attractive approach. However, the activation of alkyl bromides typically requires strong reductants or transition-metal catalysts. Herein, we report a metal-free radical borylation strategy of various alkyl bromides utilizing a photoinduced silyl radical to mediate a halogen-atom transfer process. This method demonstrates broad utility and functional group tolerance among various primary, secondary, and tertiary unactivated alkyl bromides and can facilitate the functionalization of pharmaceutically relevant motifs.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical confinement strategy which combines spatial confinement at nanoscale and anchoring confinement at atomic scale, to overcome the size limitations imposed by high-temperature sintering. Using this strategy, a series of uniformly sized (∼1 nm) Ir-based alloy clusters, including IrMn, IrFe, IrCo and IrNi, are successfully fabricated. The synthesized sub-nanoscale IrCo alloy clusters (denoted as sub-IrCo cluster) demonstrate exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, with an ultralow overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm - 2 and a remarkable mass activity 87.5 times greater than that of commercial IrO 2 . Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the incorporation of N enhances the interaction between Ir atoms and the support. This work provides an effective strategy for preventing particle sintering via a hierarchical confinement effect and achieves precise size control at sub-nanoscale, opening a new avenue for the development of efficient noble metal catalysts with high atomic utilization.},

The role of the geminal tether in controlling the transition state conformation and the exo -selectivity is revealed by density functional theory calculations.

Among these, dicyanomethyl radical derivatives stand out as key players in dynamic covalent chemistry, demonstrating exceptional temperature-responsive reversible polymerization-dissociation dynamics and remarkable long-wavelength absorption profiles despite their low molecular weights. In this work, we developed a novel radical system designated CNPJ through the strategic incorporation of julolidine into a dicyanomethyl-functionalized phenoxazine scaffold. The stability and radical nature of CNPJ were first corroborated by nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) calculations. Structural analyses revealed two critical phenomena enabled by efficient spin delocalization and intermolecular charge transfer: i) polarity-triggered radical center redistribution and ii) thermally regulated monomer‒π dimer equilibrium. These distinctive features confer enhanced structural rigidity and an exceptional absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 2.57%, a remarkably high value for near-infrared emitters, accompanied by a bathochromically shifted π dimer absorption band centered at 960 nm. Capitalizing on these attributes, we engineered a theranostic platform by integrating CNPJ with the pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer PEA through pifithrin-μ (PES) inhibitor mediation. This system achieves ultrahigh-brightness fluorescence imaging-guided mild photothermal tumor therapy, yielding promising therapeutic outcomes.},

The activation mechanisms of c-di-AMP receptors like the trimeric P II -like proteins upon messenger binding have, however, remained elusive due the pivotal role of highly flexible protein regions. Here, using solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the interplay between the ordered and disordered structural elements of the apo and messenger-bound forms of the 44 kDa homotrimeric P II -like signal transduction protein A (PstA), we reveal a sensitive modulation of the conformational ensemble of those extended loops thought to bind the downstream interaction partners by messenger association at the receptor core. The orchestration of the spatial properties of the loops, despite their retained internal dynamics, reveals the importance of allosteric effects even for disordered structural elements, whose steerable ensemble properties have long escaped the classical structural-biology understanding.},

The molecular structures of the reduced PLAs, studied by sc-XRD experiments and DFT calculations, show the formation of extended -systems. This -system extends to the Lewis acid functions and reduces their acidity. This allows a controlled release of complexed guest molecules. Oxidation regenerates the original Lewis acidity. Such reduction/oxidation cycles were also applied to an Al─P coordination polymer. sc-XRD shows the connectivity of the coordination polymer to remain unchanged, so that the polymer is stable in the neutral and reduced state. The possibility of switching such dbCOT-based PLAs and their adducts as well as the formed coordination polymers between two states with different structures and electronic compositions is of interest for the development of functional materials in the fields of electronics, optics and magnetism as well as for the development of switchable catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Photoelectrochemical glycerol oxidation reaction (PEC GOR) is considered as one of the promising strategies for obtaining high-value products and transforming solar energy to hydrogen. Herein, we report that a Ge/Zr co-doped Fe 2 O 3 photoanode present an excellent and stable PEC performance for glycerol oxidation to formate (FA) product. The Ge and Zr co-doping synergistically reduce charge carrier recombination and enhance charge transfer kinetics of the photoanode, promoting the selectivity and Faradaic efficiency toward FA chemical. Further the deposition of NiFeB co-catalyst promotes the cleavage of C─C bonds in glycerol molecules while inhibiting oxygen evolution reaction and facilitating FA accumulation. Impressively, the unbiased PEC tandem configuration for glycerol oxidation was established for coupling NiFeB/Ge/Zr-Fe 2 O 3 photoanode with Fe(Pt)-NC cathode, achieving a photocurrent density of ∼1.9 mA cm −2 with continuously operation of 100 h. The bias-free device maintains FA selectivity of above 80% with an accumulation of 1683 µmol cm −2 , representing the best PEC GOR performance toward high-value chemicals reported so far. The reaction mechanism was clarified through in situ characterization. This work provides new avenues for the sustainable solar-powered chemical synthesis of unbiased PEC systems with high selectivity and durability.},

  abstract     = {The realization of long-lived charge-transfer-based organic room-temperature phosphorescence ( 3 CT-RTP, τ Ph = 210 ms) via the construction of U-shaped donor–acceptor (D–A) dyads is impeded by suboptimal phosphorescence efficiency ( = 6%). Herein, we reveal that modifying the skeleton of D–A dyads from U-shaped to V-shaped configurations yields 3 CT-RTP with both long τ Ph (150–220 ms) and high (13%–25%). This improvement stems from preserving a substantial degree of forbiddenness in the radiative transition process of the compound while simultaneously increasing its D–A dihedral angle, which can promote more efficient spin-orbit coupling and thus more rapid intersystem crossing. Additionally, augmenting the framework rigidity of a V-shaped D–A dyad can potentially reduce the non-radiative transition rate constant of triplet excitons ( k nr,T ), thereby facilitating the attainment of long τ Ph and high .},

Here, a highly conjugated pyrene derivative has been engineered to construct both single-molecule and monolayer junctions. The charge transport within these junctions has been examined systematically through theoretical simulations and electrical measurements. These studies demonstrate a distinct transition in a single molecule from temperature-independent coherent tunneling to temperature-dependent incoherent transport, indicating vibration-mediated transport, while vibration-suppressed coherent transport is observed in a densely packed monolayer. Additionally, anisotropic gating experiments reveal that parallel fields relative to the molecular connection modulate energy levels more efficiently in comparison with perpendicular fields. These findings enrich our understanding of molecular electronic transport and pave the way for diverse developments in the field of molecular electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving modular, selective and homogeneous protein modifications is of utmost importance for the design of next generation biopharmaceuticals, especially in the context of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Here, we introduce unsaturated phosphine oxides as versatile triple-reactive reagents, allowing orthogonal chemoselective bioconjugation schemes. Starting from triethynyl-phosphine oxide, a variety of functionalized diethynyl-triazolyl-phosphine oxides (DTPOs) could be accessed by using Cu I -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC). We showcase DTPO-reagents in the fast and selective generation of various highly stable antibody-conjugates via antibody disulfide rebridging. A highlight from this methodology is the synthesis of a DAR 4 ADC following a modular 2-step strategy using bioorthogonal tetrazine-labeling with bicyclo-[6.1.0]non-4-yne (BCN) or trans -cyclooctene (TCO) containing payloads. Notably, the DTPO-rebridged ADC exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Her2 + cancer cells. Moreover, we utilize triethynyl-phosphine oxide to obtain ethynyl-ditriazolyl-phosphine oxides (EDPOs) which enable a unique, single-reagent peptide-cyclization-bioconjugation protocol resulting in functional cyclic peptide-protein conjugates. Overall, our work provides versatile and powerful chemoselective modalities for the controlled modification of antibodies, peptide-cyclization and peptide-protein conjugation, expanding the toolkit for chemical biology and therapeutic development.},

In this study, we developed a series of twisted intramolecular charge transfer luminogens (TICTgens) for precisely regulating and in situ monitoring of tumor cell pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. The outperformed TICTgen HCM displayed second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission and exceptional viscosity sensitivity. Upon 671 nm laser irradiation, HCM induced the generation of type-I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia effect, which cumulatively triggered mitochondrial damage and pyroptosis of tumor cells. HCM was systemically delivered via intracellular acidity-sensitive nanoparticles (namely PDPA@HCM NPs) to effectively trigger pyroptosis-driven antitumor immunity. Notably, HCM performed NIR-II fluorescence and photoacoustic (PA) imaging of pyroptosis-induced mitochondrial dysfunction by measuring viscosity change, thus enabling in situ monitoring of pyroptosis-mediated antitumor immunotherapy. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, the PDPA@HCM NPs dramatically regressed colorectal tumor growth in a mouse model. Overall, this study demonstrated that the TICTgens could serve as a versatile platform for pyroptosis induction and monitoring of pyroptosis-based cancer immunotherapy.},

Besides near-quantitative photoconversion, the success and expediency of a psUAA for a certain application is defined by its interaction potential with the enzyme, its thermal stability and its effective wavelength of irradiation. To establish high versatility in the current repertoire, we have designed and synthesized six psUAAs based on azobenzene, arylazopyrazole, arylazothiazole, hemithioindigo and spiropyran photoswitches. The resulting psUAAs exhibit an enhanced interaction potential within an enzyme owing to their capacity for hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions and metal ion coordination. Moreover, we observed diverse photochemical behaviors among the psUAAs, with four of them reversibly switching between the isomers with purely visible light. Notably, we identified orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that facilitate the incorporation of five of the six psUAAs co-translationally and computationally analyzed the synthetase-psUAA interactions. Finally, we evaluated the photochemical behavior of the five psUAAs within an enzymatic model and tested the photocontrol of catalysis confirming their diversity. Ultimately, our findings significantly expanded the repertoire of psUAAs and demonstrated their feasibility for enzyme engineering studies.},

  abstract     = {Organic-inorganic metal halides (OIMHs) with multi-color switchable luminescence have raised pervasive attention in the field of sensing, optoelectronics, anti-counterfeiting, information encryption and storage. However, the complexity of soft lattice structures makes it difficult to establish design rules for realizing the luminescence regulation, which greatly hinders their practical applications. Herein, a series of 0D OIMHs are designed, including PA 3 SbCl 6 , PA 6 InCl 9 , PMA 4 InCl 7 , PEA 2 InCl 5 ·H 2 O and PPA 4 InCl 7 . Tunable self-trapped excitons (STEs) emission from 606 to 678 nm originated from [SbCl n ] 3-n are realized in these 0D structures by Sb 3+ doping at room temperature. The correlations among structural distortion, bandgap, emission position, and quantum yield are investigated in these 0D Sb 3+ -doped OIMHs. The greater distortion of local inorganic polyhedron induces a relative red-shift emission, while the increased separation distance between local inorganic polyhedron reduces non-radiative transitions, therefore enhancing quantum yield. Moreover, multi-emission centers are constructed in Sb 3+ /Bi 3+ -doped PMA 4 InCl 7 , achieving green/red and blue/green/red tunable multi-color switching luminescence under the regulation of excitation wavelength and temperature. Based on the multi-color luminescence response characteristics, potential application demonstrations in optical anti-counterfeiting and information encryption are designed. This suggests the application potential of constructing multi-color switchable luminescence in OIMHs using ns 2 ions, providing a new design perspective for low-dimensional OIMHs.},

Despite its central role in biology, chirality's influence on chemically driven reaction networks remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that chiral aminoacyl phosphate esters, synthetic analogs of biological acylating intermediates, drive self-assembly and reaction pathways, that are modulated purely by their configuration, without the need for changes in functional groups. Using enantiopure aminoacyl phosphate esters, we show that these left- and right-handed acylating agents generate transient epimeric (thio)-esters from homochiral peptide substrates, leading to supramolecular architectures with distinct lifetimes and self-assembly dynamics. Moreover, chirality regulates downstream reactivity in cascade reactions, where stereochemical control over an intermediate propagates into subsequent transformations. Finally, chiral acylating agents differentiate between two reaction cycles, selectively modulating one pathway while keeping another invariant – a level of control that remains difficult to achieve with conventional chemical strategies. Stereochemical programming enables control over reactivity and self-assembly, offering new opportunities to encode chirality in reaction networks and modulate their function through a single molecular parameter.},

Building on established principles, by appending a chemical gluing moiety to several small molecule inhibitors, we successfully transformed them into degraders, obviating the need for a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase recruiter. Specifically, we found that incorporating a hydrophobic aromatic ring or a double bond into a cyclin-dependent kinase 12 and 13 (CDK12/13) dual inhibitor enabled the recruitment of DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1), thereby transforming a high-molecular-weight bivalent CDK12 degrader into a potent monovalent CDK12/13 molecular glue degrader.

  abstract     = {Elaborating electrooxidation mechanisms of biomass molecules on transition-metal-based electrodes is crucial to designing high-performance active sites. Herein, we unveiled the direct oxidation mechanism of three electrode models, Co 4 N, CoO, and Co 4 N–CoO, in which the adsorptions of OH − and glycerol on the electrodes were competitive. The adsorption of glycerol on Co 4 N was quite strong but weak on CoO, whereas the CoO preferred to adsorb OH − species. The one-sided adsorption properties of surface reactants led to the sluggish electrooxidation kinetics of organics on Co 4 N and CoO. Constructing Co 4 N–CoO heterointerfaces significantly balanced the one-sided adsorption features. Due to the moderate OH − and glycerol adsorptions on Co 4 N–CoO, the OH − was mainly used to activate glycerol rather than trigger the oxidative reconstruction of materials to form high-valence OER sites. Consequently, the Co 4 N–CoO showed excellent glycerol oxidation properties. The Co 4 N–CoO delivered a lower Tafel slope of 178 mV dec −1 while achieving a high formate yield rate of 29.40 mmol cm −2 h −1 . Furthermore, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of formate was maintained above 90% in a 120-h electrolysis. In situ Raman and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) experiments and DFT simulations unraveled that the improved GOR performance was mainly ascribed to the balanced co-adsorptions of OH − and organics on Co 4 N–CoO interfaces.},

Catalytic experiments demonstrated that inclusion within 1 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of Mo 8 O 26 4− for the oxidation of sulfides into sulfoxides. In contrast, peripheral binding of the bulky tetraarylborate anion to the inclusion complex Mo 8 O 26 4− ⊂ 1 effectively inhibits its catalytic activity by obstructing access to the catalytic active sites of Mo 8 O 26 4− .},

  abstract     = {To achieve multi-state, visible-light-excited, long-wavelength thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with high emission efficiency within a single molecular dye system remains a significant challenge. Herein, we developed a series of V-shaped emitters comprising electron-deficient benzothiadiazole and electron-rich triphenylamine (TPA) or carbazole (Cz) units, featuring small singlet-triplet energy gaps. These molecules exhibit long-wavelength TADF emission and bright luminescence in both single-molecule and aggregate states. The V-shaped structure prompts multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds, while the intramolecular charge transfer effect significantly relaxes the molecular conformation in the excited state. These synergistic effects result in a rigid excited-state molecular conformation, facilitating strong single-molecule state emission with a high luminescence efficiency up to 75.90% (delayed: 26.57%). Meanwhile, the unique V-shaped structure and long alkyl chains enable these luminophores to maintain a twisted conformation and staggered stacking in the aggregate state, effectively preventing aggregation-caused quenching effects. Furthermore, the regular crystal environment ensures that these molecules possess a bright aggregate-state TADF luminescence with a high quantum yield up to 53.50% (delayed: 11.23%). Benefiting from their excellent photophysical properties, these molecules were successfully applied as functional dyes for concentration-independent cell imaging and antibacterial treatment. This work paves the way for designing long-wavelength TADF materials with efficient multi-state emission.},

  abstract     = {Organic molecules exhibiting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have attracted considerable attention due to their exceptional solid-state luminescent properties. Understanding the AIE mechanism has been a focal point of both theoretical and experimental research. While conical intersection (CI) dynamics on potential energy surfaces (PESs) have emerged as a key factor in elucidating the AIE mechanism, modulating the accessibility to CI to regulate the non-radiative decay pathways remains a substantial challenge. Here we propose a new strategy leveraging strain energy introduced by cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs) to tune the AIE property of tetraphenylethylene (TPE). We synthesized and characterized a series of TPE-incorporated CPPs with varying sizes and endo / exo vinyl moieties. The photophysical properties and AIE behavior of these strained TPE-CPPs were meticulously examined. Endo -TPE-CPPs exhibit AIE, while Exo -TPE-CPPs do not, opposite to strain-free TPE macrocycles. The luminescence of Endo -TPE-CPPs and Exo -TPE-CPPs can be further tuned by adjusting the number of phenylene units in the loop. Their excited-state dynamics were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The strain energy induces structural distortion of TPE, stabilizing or elevating the transition state (TS), thereby regulating the accessibility to CI and enabling tunable AIE properties. These findings provide new insights for designing AIE molecules.},

Despite their potential, performance limitations arising from high solution viscosity at high concentrations of active material and rapid degradation due to active material crossover continue to pose challenges. Here, we use flow chemistry to create redox-active hyperbranched copolymers (HBCs), which exhibited substantially improved suppression of crossover and enhanced rheology behaviors. The distinct reaction dynamics of flow chemistry facilitated the efficient and monomer-independent control over self-condensing vinyl polymerization, yielding well-defined HBCs with remarkably low dispersity. This strategy effectively enhanced the uniformity of the redox-active HBCs, leading to significantly reduced crossover and accelerated diffusion rates. The RFBs equipped with our redox-active HBCs exhibited long-term stability, mapping a pathway towards practical application of polymer-based technologies as well as highlighting the unique advantages of the flow chemistry techniques in high-precision electrolyte design.},

Herein, we report a chromium-catalyzed asymmetric reductive coupling of allyl gem -dichlorides with aldehydes, enabling precise and tunable control over regio-, enantio-, diastereo-, and Z/E -selectivity. This radical-polar crossover strategy circumvents the need for preformed organometallic reagents, offering a direct and modular approach to stereochemically complex homoallylic alcohols. A chiral imidazoline sulfonamide ligand directs the formation of Z -alkenes, while a bisoxazoline ligand reverses the selectivity to E -alkenes, achieving excellent stereocontrol across a broad substrate scope. Mechanistic studies support a chromium-mediated allyl radical generation and addition pathway.

Among them, Iron-Chromium RFBs (Fe-Cr RFBs), which utilize aqueous-based electrolytes, effectively address critical challenges in renewable energy integration while offering unparalleled safety, low-cost scalability and environmental compatibility. Potassium hexacyanochromate (K 3 [Cr(CN) 6 ]) has emerged as a promising negolyte material in Fe-Cr RFBs due to its favorable electrochemical properties. However, enhancing its long-term stability and elucidating its structural transformations remain crucial for optimized performance. Investigations into ligand exchange mechanism reveal connections to detrimental side reactions, notably hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hexacyanochromate instability, highlighting pathways for targeted improvement. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illuminate the effects of ligand exchange dynamics and structural variations on redox stability, providing mechanistic insights into electrolyte behavior. By strategically incorporating sodium hydroxide with sodium cyanide as supporting electrolytes, our study demonstrates significantly improved stability of the redox couple, achieving a stable cycling performance over 250 cycles with an energy density of 13.91 Wh L −1 and energy efficiencies exceeding 76%–77%.

Herein, we systematically engineered a series of methoxy ethoxy methane derivatives with tailored fluorinated alkyl groups to screen the optimal asymmetric difluorinated electrolytes for high-voltage LMBs. Spectroscopic and computational studies show that the ─CF 2 H group in difluoroethoxy methoxy methane (DFME) facilitates balanced Li─F interactions, which are essential for ensuring efficient ion transport and maintaining oxidation stability. In contrast, the elongated ─CF 2 CF 2 H group in tetrafluoropropyl methoxy methane (TFME) fails to coordinate with Li + ions, which hampers ion transport and leads to interfacial instability. The DFME electrolyte facilitates the spontaneous formation of a protective dual-layer interface featuring a LiF-rich inner phase and a Li 2 CO 3 -dominated outer phase. Consequently, Li||LiCoO 2 cells (2.5 mAh cm −2 ) using DFME exhibit remarkable cycling stability, retaining 92% capacity after 180 cycles. This is further corroborated by a 140-mAh pouch cell, which retains 91% capacity after 140 cycles.

Photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) offers a sustainable alternative by harnessing solar energy under ambient conditions. However, challenges such as low nitrogen adsorption, poor conductivity, and high electron-hole recombination of the photocatalysts limit their efficiency. This study introduces an Fe 3 O 4 @C@ZIF67 core-shell photocatalyst featuring an Fe─N─Co bridged Z-scheme heterojunction. This design incorporates carbon-coated Fe 3 O 4 in ZIF67-D (ZIF67-dodecahedron) with exposed (211) crystalline facets to enhance nitrogen adsorption. Fe─N 4 and Co─N 4 active sites improve catalytic activity, while the carbon layer enhances conductivity and facilitates oxygen vacancy formation. The Fe─N─Co bridged heterojunction further promotes charge separation and transfer. Therefore, the Fe 3 O 4 @C@ZIF67 composite achieves an outstanding ammonia yield of 33.2 mmol L −1 g −1 h −1 (outperforming other systems) with high selectivity and minimal by-products.

Here, we report the formation of gold hydride above 40 GPa and 2200 K in X-ray free electron laser heated diamond anvil cells using various hydrocarbons as hydrogen sources. Above 40 GPa, a hexagonal phase emerges close to the gold melting point, corresponding to a hydride with stoichiometry , with increasing from 0 to near 1 with pressure from 40 to 80 GPa. This is a high-temperature phase which reverts to face centered cubic gold on cooling to 295 K. Accompanying DFT-MD simulations are in excellent agreement with experiment and reveal the structure to consist of an hexagonal close packed gold lattice with atomic hydrogen disordered in the interstices. The hydrogen is superionic and exhibits high diffusivity through the crystalline gold lattice. Our results present the first solid-state binary compound of gold and hydrogen.},

  abstract     = {Climate change, driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions, demands urgent action to prevent a 2050 tipping point. With CO 2 levels at 427 ppm (50% above pre-industrial levels), deploying energy-efficient carbon capture technologies is crucial. Electrochemical carbon capture processes that have been touted to have the potential to meet these needs rely on the applied cell voltage, and electron utilization (CO 2 molecules separated per electron), which has generally been asserted to have a theoretical limit of one. Here, we introduce an electron-leveraging strategy to enhance electron utilization beyond this limit to 1.43 by employing Fe-EDDHA, a redox-active coordination complex having a ligand with multiple hemi-labile coordination sites. The reversibility and robustness of the system were enabled by the efficient prevention of CO 2 reduction upon the introduction of nicotinamide as a guardian of the iron(2+) center. The proof-of-concept cyclic system exhibits a minimum operational energy of 22.6 kJ e mol −1 and an average of 63.7 kJ e mol −1 over 29 cycles, using a simulated flue gas (15% CO 2 ). Our electron-leveraging strategy holds promise for advancing energy-efficient electrochemical carbon capture technologies, and offers an alternative to prevalent redox potential shifting methods proposed to mitigate undesired electron transfer reactions in redox-active materials across diverse operational conditions.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non-antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4′s center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces.},

  abstract     = {Catalyst screening is a demanding task for computational chemistry since the profound diversity of surface structures under operando conditions is accompanied by high demands on the accuracy to predict the relevant kinetics. Embedding approaches that allow researchers to focus the computational effort on the chemically active regions of interest are promising tools in the pursuit of balancing accuracy and efficiency. However, for metallic catalysts, the required separation of the system into an active part treated with highly accurate methods and an environment is technically hard to achieve due to the delocalization of electrons in the conducting surface. Therefore, studies analyzing the potential of embedding methods for heterogeneous (electro-)catalyst screening are scarce. In this contribution, we demonstrate that simple embedding approaches are indeed achievable for studying metallic catalysts if i) the active orbital space is held consistent over a reaction coordinate and ii) the nonadditive exchange-correlation functional used to calculate the embedding potential includes a fraction of exact exchange to mitigate delocalization errors. We verify the approach for a set of open- and closed-shell CO 2 reduction reaction intermediates on different adsorption sites of a Cu(111) surface represented by cluster models to demonstrate that catalyst screening with embedding approaches is achievable.},

  abstract     = {Graphite is widely utilized as an anode material in lithium-ion batteries due to its abundance, cost-effectiveness, and excellent structural stability during lithium intercalation and deintercalation, which contribute to a long cycle life. However, graphite is not inherently suitable for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to the limited intercalation properties of sodium ions. To address this, we propose the concept of bridging-donor-ligands, which construct ligand channels and consistently expand the graphite interlayer spacing. Using sodium dicyandiamide (NaDCA) as a model ligand, we demonstrate the formation of abundant ligand channels facilitated by the versatile dicyanamide anion (DCA − ), significantly enhancing the structural robustness of ternary graphite intercalation compounds (t-GICs). Hence, the graphite anode capacity retention is over 94% after 5000 cycles, with an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) exceeding 99.8% in SIBs. This mechanism is versatile and can be extended to other metal-ion battery electrolytes.},

The conventional Haber–Bosch process relies heavily on fossil fuels, making ammonia synthesis a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we show a carbon-negative ammonia synthesis process that not only produces ammonia from the air but also directly captures the atmospheric CO 2 (DAC). This process uses lithium as a mediator to cleave the nitrogen gas via a nitridation reaction at ambient pressure below 80 °C. Exposing the nitride to moisture naturally yields ammonia. The co-produced lithium hydroxide intermediate allows for spontaneous absorption of CO 2 with an exceptional capacity of 18.4 mmol CO 2 /g. The resultant lithium carbonate is electrolysed at ambient conditions to recycle the metallic lithium and release high-purity gaseous CO 2 . This proof-of-concept of ammonia production from air coupled with DAC paves a new way for the development of sustainable and negative-emission technologies.},

Here, we present the coordination-driven self-assembly of natural ursodeoxycholic-bile-acid-derived unsymmetric tris -pyridyl ligand ( L ) resulting in the selective and switchable formation of chiral stellated Pd 6 L 8 and Pd 12 L 16 cages. The selectivity of the cage originates in the adaptivity and flexibility of the arms of the ligand bearing pyridyl moieties. The interspecific transformations can be controlled by changes in the reaction conditions. The orientational self-sorting of L into a single constitutional isomer of each cage, i.e., homochiral quadruple and octuple right-handed helical species, was confirmed by a combination of molecular modelling and circular dichroism. The cages, derived from natural amphiphilic transport molecules, mediate the higher cellular uptake and increase the anticancer activity of bioactive palladium cations as determined in studies using in vitro 3D spheroids of the human hepatic cells HepG2.},

  abstract     = {Naturally occurring dimeric products have attracted considerable attention from both chemists and pharmacologists. The construction of pseudo-dimers often requires elaborate synthetic effort with low efficiency. Dearomatization reactions represent an ideal method to transform planar aromatics into 3D skeletons, which has attracted increasing interest in medicinal chemistry and total synthesis. Herein, we present a dearomative dimerization of N -heteroarenes under mild photochemical conditions. Through additive regulation, the catalytic dearomative cross-coupling of two distinct quinolines could also be achieved. With aromatic compounds as coupling partners, this strategy provides a straightforward avenue to pseudo-dimers of N -heteroarenes. Combined experimental and computational mechanistic studies reveal the intertwined EnT/SET nature and offered guidelines for synthesizing novel bridged polycycles. In addition, this strategy provides an effective approach for constructing functional polymers with high atom economy and environmental benefits via metal-free, one-pot polymerization. Furthermore, the synthetic transformations offer a complementary route to access formal crossed products that were previously inaccessible.},

Central to the solution was a recently-developed ligand type approach, rather than brute force screening, demonstrating the usefulness of this novel concept in complex target synthesis. Additional key features include an asymmetric Davis hydroxylation proceeding with only catalytic amounts of base, thus enabling the conversion of a highly sensitive, elaborate substrate. Furthermore, a late-stage aminolysis completed the polycyclic framework, circumventing laborious protective group chemistry. Together, this strategy provides a concise, high-yielding access, confirming the full architecture of this most potent class of polyaromatic xanthones, and establishes ligand types as a powerful design tool for sophisticated cross-couplings.},

  abstract     = {Tin-based perovskite films typically exhibit random crystal orientations, with significant accumulation of defects acting as charge recombination centers, which severely limit device performance. Furthermore, the disordered two-dimensional (2D) perovskite significantly impacts the subsequent crystal growth of three-dimensional (3D) perovskite through epitaxial growth mechanism, while the insulating properties of bulky spacer cations impede out-of-plane charge transport. Herein, we have innovatively developed a facile quasi-epitaxial growth strategy by introducing 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethanamine hydroiodide (NEAI) with reinforced π-conjugation interaction to construct orientationally aligned 2D perovskite, which acts as a template for 3D perovskite with (100)-dominant facet orientation. NEAI reacts with SnI 2 to pre-form NEA 2 SnI 4 , which subsequently converts to NEA 2 FASn 2 I 7 and ultimately FASnI 3 through an energetically unfavorable pathway to delay crystallization kinetics. Moreover, this innovative approach optimizes carrier transport dynamics while conferring device robust thermal degradation resistance and enhanced long-term stability. Consequently, the NEAI-based solar cells exhibit the impressive efficiencies of 14.03% (0.04 cm 2 ) and 12.44% (1 cm 2 ), representing the record performance for two-step deposited tin-based perovskite photovoltaics. This study offers new insights into the preparation of highly ordered tin-based perovskite films, paving the way for high-performance lead-free perovskite photovoltaics.},

  abstract     = {CO 2 electroreduction reaction in acid medium to produce multicarbon (C 2+ ) products has gained attention as an alternative to the traditional processes in neutral or alkaline solutions which often suffer from low single-pass conversion efficiency due to (bi)carbonate accumulation at the cathode. However, the CO 2 conversion efficiency in acid remains unsatisfactory. Herein, a strong-polarized layer-covered Cu catalyst is developed as electrode for CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in acid. Such a strong dipole moment layer is a sp 3 -hybridized nitrogen ( sp 3 -N)-enriched azulene-based polymer, which acts as Lewis base to boost the CO 2 -diffusion kinetics in inner Helmholtz plane. Such unique electrode delivers nearly 84% C 2 Faradaic efficiency at 200 mA cm −2 , and demonstrates long-term stability over 40 h, which is the record for CO 2 RR in acidic media. In situ experiments manifest the moderate azulene-polarized sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment can increase the local CO 2 /H 2 O ratio at electric double-layer to further stabilize the key intermediate atop-bound *CO. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong-polarized layer decreases the reaction energy barrier for C–C coupling. This study not only uncovers the units with strong dipole moment on tuning sp 3 -N-enriched micro-environment, but also provides an interfacial diffusion-reaction coupling strategy to enhance the selectivity of CO 2 RR by decorating polycrystalline Cu with strong-polarized polymers.},

  abstract     = {Conventional polymers exhibit low intrinsic thermal conductivity ( λ ) of 0.1∼0.5 W/(m·K) due to disordered chain arrangements, failing to meet the heat dissipation demands of high-power flexible electronic devices. This study proposes a molecular level design strategy for side-chain azobenzene-containing semicrystalline polymers that demonstrate exceptional intrinsic thermal conductivity with photoresponsive actuation and recyclability. By precisely regulating the spatial distribution and content of azobenzene groups and hydrogen-bond network along the polymer chain through controlled radical polymerization, a thermal conduction network featuring “high-efficiency conduction within crystal domains and low-resistance interfacial connections” was constructed. Azobenzene moieties self-assemble into highly oriented crystalline domains through π–π stacking, where their dense packing significantly enhances phonon coupling efficiency and increases phonon mean free paths. Concurrently, the dynamic reversibility of hydrogen bonds guides domain-boundary molecular chains to form gradual phase transitions, suppressing phonon scattering at amorphous-crystalline interfaces and improving phonon transport efficiency. The film of random copolymer with 35 azobenzene units achieves an outstanding highest intrinsic λ of 2.01 W/(m·K), representing a substantial improvement over its block copolymer counterpart (with a higher crystallinity) and traditional polymers. Additionally, the photoisomerization property of azobenzene endows the material with light-controlled dynamic deformation capabilities. Meanwhile, the noncrosslinked polymer films feature easy recyclability/reprocessability.},

Clever mechanochemical devices have been developed to that effect, but most are limited by the payload (type, number) they can deliver and their responsiveness to a single stimulus (force). However, the applications envisaged above require the precise delivery of a complex payload. In this context, a device able to release a diverse set of cargo molecules in response to a varied number of stimuli is desired. Here, we present a rotaxane-based device that can release a dual payload in response to two different stimuli: force and water. The first payload is released mechanically, while the release of the second cargo requires both force and water in a way reminiscent of a logic AND gate. Our device is built around a β-lactam mechanophore that is activated by a rotaxane actuator to release a ketene and reveal an imine that anchors the second cargo to the axle of the rotaxane; hydrolysis of the imine releases the second cargo molecule. The concept was demonstrated with the efficient release of two drugs, hymecromone and gemcitabine, both in solution and in bulk. We anticipate that our device should find applications in a variety of contexts where precise release is required.},

However, the transition mechanism of SAM molecules from colloidal solutions to films remains unclear. Herein, we systematically investigate the SAM precursor solutions and the crystallization quality of the resulting SAM and perovskite films. Fibrous micelles of about 460 nm are found in the pristine SAMs solution, leading to nonuniform and low coverage distribution of films. Strong dipole molecules are employed to establish supramolecular interactions with SAMs, enabling the formation of highly monodisperse cubic micelles in solution (160 nm) and uniform SAM films. The contact at buried interface is determined by the balance between dipole moment and steric hindrance. Consequently, the regulated SAMs based inverted PSCs (0.09 cm 2 ) and mini-module (aperture area of 14.40 cm 2 ) achieves efficiency of 26.58% (certificated 25.81%) and 22.95%, respectively. The optimized devices retain more than 96.30% of the initial efficiency for 5,100 h under the ISOS-D-1 condition with a linear fitting extrapolation to T 90 of 11,259 h and 98.30% efficiency for 2,660 h under the ISOS-L-2 condition.

This protocol features operational simplicity, selectivity, and scalability, enabling direct alkyl modification of various aryl alkyl sulfides as well as gram-scale production of trideuteromethyl drugs without the need for synthetic precursors. Mechanistic studies show that the in-situ generated sulfonium salt was the key intermediate.

Control of the energy level of the singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) is essential for the design and application of open-shell materials, but most triarylmethyl radicals are very electron-poor and exhibit similar SOMO values. In this work, we show how a combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents in triarylmethyl radicals allows tuning of their SOMO level over a wide range of –5.7 to –3.9 eV. We demonstrate that both methoxy and chlorine groups provide sufficient stabilization of the radical against peroxide formation, but one-electron oxidation in air limits the SOMO ≤ -4.5 eV to maintain bench stability. Two new stable radicals are characterized by X-ray crystallography, cyclic voltammetry, and luminescence measurements in solution and doped films. We show that the combination of chlorine and methoxy substituents improves the photostability of triarylmethyl radicals compared to tris(trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM). The extraordinarily large range of SOMO levels in these radicals provides an opportunity to benchmark computational methods for predicting redox potentials. We find that most common density functional theory functionals and even coupled-cluster (CCSD) calculations overestimate the substituent effects in these open-shell species.},

The amphiphilic character of octasulfur enables smooth reaction with the Zincke dienamine, affording the cyclized products under mild and neutral conditions. We illustrate this new disconnection with a synthesis of the anti-inflammatory drug suprofen from a pyridine starting material.},

Herein, we report feedstock-derived thiophene radical anions bearing ester functionalities that undergo galvanostatic charge–discharge redox cycling at potentials below −2 V versus Fc/Fc + (Fc = ferrocene). Systematic structural modification led to the identification of a derivative exhibiting exceptional redox stability, showing promise as a scalable and low-cost electrolyte for electron storage applications. Further, a crystalline thiophene radical anion was isolated and characterized using structural, spectroscopic, and computational methods. These studies revealed that the ester functionalities stabilize the reduced “quinoidal” thiophene electronic structure without the need for extended π-delocalization. Taken together, a new class of electron storage media is reported that combine redox stability at extreme potentials with straightforward synthesis, while offering rare insight into the structural and electronic features of stable thiophene radicals.},

  abstract     = {Hydrofluorination of alkynes provides a synthetic route to access fluoroalkenes, a class of compounds with wide applications in chemical research. Herewith, we describe an exceptional hydrofluorination process of alkynes catalysed by Pt(II) complexes at room temperature. Various Pt(II) dichloride complexes bearing chelating phosphines were synthesised and studied towards their catalytic behaviour. Mechanistic investigations suggest the involvement of a dicationic Pt(II) bis(alkyne) species as well as a cationic ß -fluorovinyl Pt(II) complex in the catalytic cycle. Remarkably, the hydrofluorination is enabled by fluorinated anions. The corresponding acids BF 3 , HF as well as PF 5 act as fluoride shuttles to allow for an outer-sphere fluorination of the metal-bound substrate. Detailed DFT analyses for BF 3 show that the hydrofluorination is mediated by complexes between the fluorinated anion and HF. This lowers the hydrofluorination barriers sufficiently to outcompete the simultaneously occurring, more exergonic cyclisation of two coordinated alkynes to a structurally characterised cycloallyl complex. The catalytic system can be applied to a wide substrate scope to generate fluoroalkenes bearing bulky alkyl, aryl and electron withdrawing groups, such as ester and carbonyl substituents.},

  abstract     = {While polymeric hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) offer scalable solutions for gas separations, their performance is fundamentally limited by the permeance-selectivity tradeoff and imprecise microporosity regulation. Herein, we propose a surface fluorination strategy using carbon tetrafluoride (CF 4 ) plasma to engineer a sub-10 nm fluorinated and crosslinked layer on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated Matrimid ® HFMs. Through precise modulation of plasma parameters, we achieved controlled substitution of PDMS methyl groups/methyl hydrogen atoms with fluorine species (up to 27.7 mol% F content), 5.3-fold enhanced chain rigidity via fluorine-induced interchain interactions and steric hindrance, as well as narrowed pore size distribution with preferential ultra-micropore filling. The optimized HFM-50W-65Pa-500s membrane exhibits record-breaking He/N 2 and He/CH 4 selectivities of 1202 ± 13 and 1790 ± 12 with 170 ± 2 GPU He permeance, surpassing perfluoropolymer upper bounds and outperforming previously reported polymeric HFMs. Remarkably, it demonstrates molecular discrimination precision (α(He/CO 2 ) = 56 ± 2.2, α(He/H 2 ) = 4.1 ± 0.2) for pure-gas and attractive ternary He/(CO 2 +CH 4 ) selectivity of 1005 ± 20 under 40-bar mixed-gas conditions while maintaining 720-h operational stability. This plasma-engineered fluorination paradigm combines nanoscale precision with industrial scalability, opening new avenues for advanced membrane design.},

The mechanism analysis demonstrated that micropores in 1 could anchor coordinated H 2 O in [Na(H 2 O) 5 ] + to form a cationic layer at the particle surface, inhibiting the competitive HER and enhancing catalytic activity. Moreover, 1 could be applied in hectogram-scale production with low cost of US$ 0.01405 g −1 , showing promising industrial potential in CO 2 RR.

  abstract     = {Rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage devices due to their high safety and environmental friendliness. However, they suffer from some issues in Zn anodes, including dendrites, hydrogen evolution reaction, and byproducts. Herein, an organic-riched phase (ORP) layer was constructed on Zn anode by introducing sodium anthraquinone-1-sulfonate (AQS) into the aqueous electrolyte with ethylene glycol (EG). In such an electrolyte, the zincophilic -SO 3 − groups of AQS molecules preferentially adsorb on Zn anodes, and stable chemical bonds are achieved between them. After that, the low-polarity and hydrophobic anthraquinone group in the AQS layer tends to repel H 2 O molecules. Simultaneously, more AQS and EG molecules are attracted and migrate toward AQS layer due to polar compatibility, constructing the AQS/EG-riched layer on the Zn anode by the interlocking effect among them. When Zn 2+ solvated structures migrate through the ORP layer on Zn anode surface, AQS and EG molecules enter Zn 2+ solvated structures, and thus, the solvated H 2 O molecules are removed. As a result, hydrogen evolution and side reactions were significantly suppressed, and the Coulombic efficiency of Zn anodes during plating/stripping process reached 99.56%. To illustrate the feasibility of the ORP layer, Zn||V 2 O 5 full cells were assembled and exhibited superior cycling performance.},

The isolation of a single lanthanide atom in a In/Bi cage offers a non-standard bonding situation, which deserves thorough exploration. In this study, the bonding behavior of La, In, and Bi atoms in the ternary cluster [(La@In 2 Bi 11 ) 2 Bi 2 ] 6− and the complex [La(C 5 Me 4 H) 3 ] used for its synthesis are characterized and compared by applying high energy resolution X-ray spectroscopy and computations. A clearly detectable covalent La(5d)─Bi(6p) interaction, induced in a highly electron-rich environment, is illustrated. The electronic structure of the La atom can be described as having the character of an ion being trapped and bonded in a heterometallic Bi/In cage. The advanced X-ray spectroscopic experimental tools applied here enable comparative studies of binding properties, focusing on different metals within the intermetalloid cluster. These tools can be employed iteratively to support the development of synthetic strategies that aim at tuning bond characteristics at the boundary of covalent and metallic bonding, thereby advancing the chemical and physical properties of novel multinary cluster compounds. The results were corroborated by GW and Bethe–Salpeter-equation ( GW -BSE) calculations.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are hindered by limited ionic conductivity, heterogeneous lithium flux and interfacial instability of solid-state electrolytes. Herein, we report a hierarchical ion-transport network formed by confining lithium halides (LiX, X═Cl, Br, I) within the mesoporous cages of MIL-100(Al), synergistically integrated with a PVDF-HFP polymer matrix. The 3D interconnected pores (0.5–1 nm) of MIL-100(Al) not only spatially confine anions via size-selective sieving but also enable continuous Li⁺ transport through tunable host–guest interactions between the Lewis-acidic metal nodes and lithium halides. Among these, the LiI-embedded composite (E-LiI) exhibits a high Li⁺ transference number (0.88 at 25 °C) and favorable interfacial kinetics, attributed to strong anion coordination and homogeneous Li⁺ plating. Structural characterizations confirm uniform LiX distribution within the MOF framework. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and COMSOL simulation elucidate halogen-dependent desolvation energetics and Li + transport kinetics. SSLMBs employing E-LiI electrolytes demonstrate exceptional cycling stability (capacity retention ∼100% after 600 cycles at 2C) with high-voltage cathodes and wide-temperature adaptability. This work advances the rational design of multi-scale ion-conductive frameworks and the pivotal role of lithium halide in regulating Li deposition kinetics, offering a transformative strategy for high-energy-density solid-state battery systems.},

  abstract     = {Ion-selective membranes with sub-nanometer micropores are essential in various separation processes and energy-related devices. However, the absence of molecular-level insights into ion transport behavior in sub-nanochannels challenges the accurate construction of fit-for-purpose membranes. Herein, we design cross-linked polybenzimidazole membranes with varying angstrom-scale pores and functional group densities by in situ crosslinking reaction during dual-coagulation bath-induced phase separation process. The modulation of pore architecture and pore chemistry enables precise control of ion transport under confined channels. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental results reveal that ion dehydration and ion–pore wall interactions are the two dominant mechanisms governing fast and selective ion transport within charged sub-nanometer channels. Based on “dehydration–diffusion” mechanism, membranes with low steric hindrance and weak ion–pore wall interactions facilitate low-energy-barrier ion transport. We demonstrate their applications in alkalescent zinc–iron flow batteries, achieving a high peak power density of 607.8 mW cm −2 and energy efficiency exceeding 80% at a current density of 200 mA cm −2 . Our study advances the understanding of ion transport in membranes with sub-nanometer pores and provides guidelines for designing next-generation ion-selective membranes by regulating channel size and channel chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Arylacetamides are important structural motifs found in many bioactive compound classes. Given their significance, the selective decoration of arylacetamides by transition metal-catalyzed C─H activation has attracted considerable attention. Here, we report a two-step transition metal-free formal C─H/C─H coupling of arylacetamides with sulfoxides that proceeds via the formation and rearrangement of little-known α-amido sulfonium salts; the amide motif “catches” the sulfoxide partner prior to its delivery to the ortho -position of the aromatic ring by rearrangement of a sulfur ylide intermediate. The approach delivers alkylated arylacetamides bearing sulfide functional handles that can be exploited in downstream manipulations. This protocol has allowed the synthesis of a dopamine D1 receptor allosteric modulator without recourse to the use of transition metals.},

Ionic fragmentation of both the NHC and nucleophile ultimately yields the desired substituted allene. The organic photocatalyst, 4CzIPN, is highly effective in promoting both oxidative and reductive electron transfer steps. Tri- and tetra-substituted allenes can be obtained in good yields through such a cascade. Mechanistic studies—including radical trapping, acylazolium reactions, and Stern–Volmer quenching—support the proposed mechanism.

However, this prospect is greatly hindered by its sluggish reaction kinetics involving multistep electron transfer and unstable intermediates. Herein, the fully exposed silver (Ag) clusters were anchored on poly(heptazinimide) (PHI) catalyst, forming a new kind of fully exposed cluster catalysts (FECCs), which can boost photocatalytic generation of H 2 O 2 in pure water, with a rate up to 1075.5 µmol g −1 h −1 , surpassing its Ag single atoms counterpart and many recent-reported state-of-the-art photocatalysts. In situ characterization and DFT analysis showed that fully exposed Ag clusters can form the electron-rich centers and optimize the binding energy of the O 2 and proton H, which in turn enhances the protonation process of *OOH, reducing the energy barrier of key steps, and finally leading to a high yield of H 2 O 2 . Interestingly, its Ag single-atom counterpart was favorable for decomposing the H 2 O 2 into ·OH. Thus, Ag FECCs achieve significantly enhanced tetracycline degradation efficiency with the strategic incorporation of Ag single atoms.},

Increased attention is directed toward bimetallic systems, as the synergistic effect of two different metal centers often yields enhanced properties. Despite this progress, obtaining optically active bimetallic clusters with pronounced chirality, both in their ground and excited states, has remained a challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy is formulated for the controlled aggregation of gold(I)–silver(I) coordination clusters leading to enhanced and tunable optical activity. Interactions with chiral and achiral additives resulted in cluster-assembled materials (CAMs) exhibiting morphology-dependent chiroptical responses. The assembly process, in addition to facilitating aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE), generated inverted and amplified chiroptical responses. Interestingly, the resultant Au(I)Ag(I) composite materials exhibited prolonged excited state lifetimes, indicating the possibility of near room temperature thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and lower temperature phosphorescence. Circularly polarized luminescence with a dissymmetry factor as high as (±)0.05 could be achieved, the highest reported for any metal cluster to date. The enhanced anisotropy highlights the effectiveness of this strategy in modulating excited-state chirality through hierarchical assembly, opening potential for the nanocomposites as chiral light-emitting materials.},

Efficient electrocatalytic system design that combines CO 2 valorization with biomass upgrading offers a viable solution to produce high-value chemicals and renewable energy at the same time. Here, we demonstrate an interfacial-engineered CoS/Co─N─C n─n type heterojunction featuring unique dual Co sites and strong built-in electric field (BEF) effects, which enables efficient electrochemical coupling of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The optimized catalyst achieves exceptional performance metrics, i.e., a record-low onset potential of 1.12 V (versus RHE), with 99% selectivity and 98.2% faradaic efficiency (FE) for 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in HMFOR, coupled with 98.6% CO 2 ─to─CO selectivity and the FE average was retained 98.4% in CO 2 RR, which outperform the previously reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Moreover, the integrated HMFOR//CO 2 RR system demonstrates impressive stability over 50 h continuous operation. Through systematic experimental examination and theoretical calculations, we reveal that the BEF boosts the formation of the unique dual Co coordination environments (Co─N 4 electron-deficient and Co─S electron-rich configurations) through modulation of charge transport dynamics, facilitating HMF activation through *OH intermediate stabilization while promoting multi-electron CO 2 reduction via charge accumulation.

We report the self-assembly of amphiphilic peptides I 3 H, designed with a modular structure featuring three consecutive isoleucine residues as a hydrophobic tail and a C-terminal histidine-based hydrophilic headgroup. Microscopic, neutron scattering, and spectroscopic techniques demonstrate that the designed peptides self-assemble into β-sheet nanofibrils, with their helix handedness exhibiting subtle pH-dependent inversion. pH titration, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the underlying mechanism correlates with the protonation state of histidine and the molecular packing modes in β-sheet assemblies. The protonated histidine promotes antiparallel β-sheet packing at lower pH while its deprotonated state favors parallel packing when pH is increased. Strong π-π stacking interactions between deprotonated histidine side chains in parallel β-sheet arrangements drive chiral flipping of β-strands, ultimately inducing supramolecular helix inversion. Furthermore, such a pH-dependent helix inversion can be engineered by inserting the achiral and flexible glycine at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface, with I 3 GH assembly maintaining this effect while I 3 GGH assembly abolishing it. This work not only advances our mechanistic understanding of peptide chirality inversion at the level of individual β-sheets but also provides a blueprint for designing hierarchical chirality through precise modulation of molecular packing modes and side-chain interactions.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic sulfion oxidation reaction (SOR) is a sustainable approach to treat sulfion-rich sewage for S recovery. Transition metal hydroxide (TMOH), utilized in various electrocatalysis, yet is clumsy in SOR due to overstrong adsorption toward S-containing intermediates from unsuitable electronic structure. Herein we report, for the first time, that the SOR performance of TMOH can be awakened by intercalation chemistry. Take Co(OH) 2 as a proof-of-concept demonstration, MoO 4 2− intercalated Co(OH) 2 2D nanosheet array is engineered, and presents remarkably enhanced SOR behavior with an ultralow potential of 0.29 V versus RHE to attain 100 mA cm −2 , a record Tafel slope of 27.7 mV dec −1 , and stable operation for 192 h without appreciable deterioration. The experimental and theoretical studies unveil that MoO 4 2− -intercalated nanoarray is advantageous for active site exposure, and boosting mass transport with enhanced sulfion enrichment and superhydrophilicity. Impressively, MoO 4 2− intercalation can manipulate electronic structure of Co(OH) 2 with downshift of d-band center, thereby weakening binding strength with HS − and S 8 , and decreasing the |ΔG s* |, eventually enhancing both activity and stability. Notably, such intercalation wake-up strategy for the SOR is general and can be extended to other oxometallate intercalated TMOH systems. This contribution provides a new paradigm to evoke TMOH for SOR electrocatalysis via elegant intercalation tactic.},

  abstract     = {Precise stereocontrol over functionalized alkenes remains a central challenge in organic synthesis. In particular, catalytic methods enabling flexible and stereodivergent synthesis of both trans -selective and cis -selective useful enol ethers are still underdeveloped. Herein, we report a manganese-catalyzed, ligand-controlled hydroalkoxylation of alkynylnitriles with alcohols under mild conditions. Through metal–ligand cooperation, a range of ( Z )- and ( E )-3-alkoxyvinylnitriles were obtained in high yields and with excellent selectivity by simply tuning the steric properties of PNP-pincer ligands: bulkier t Bu PNP–Mn catalyst favored Z -selectivity, while less hindered i Pr PNP–Mn catalyst led to E -selectivity. This method features a broad substrate scope, high functional group tolerance and exceptional chemo -, regio -, and stereo -selectivity. Mechanistic studies revealed that Z -products are initially formed in both cases, with the i Pr PNP–Mn catalyst further promoting isomerization to the thermodynamically favored E -isomers.},

  abstract     = {Precise therapy for tumors faces challenges associated with traditional methods, such as low targeting efficiency, substantial side effects, and drug resistance. As the core regulators of cellular energy metabolism and apoptosis, mitochondria exhibit considerable advantages through targeted molecular tools that precisely deliver drugs, interfere with key pathways, and activate immune responses. This article reviews the latest advancements in mitochondria-targeted molecular tools for precision tumor therapy. Modifying molecular structures or designing functionalized carriers, small molecular drugs, metal complexes, nanodrugs, and polymeric drugs can be precisely enriched in mitochondria, disrupting the mitochondrial membrane, interfering with the respiratory chain, or activating immune pathways, thereby significantly enhancing antitumor efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. However, further optimization of the design of mitochondria-targeted molecular tools is required, and their synergistic potential with immunotherapy metabolic regulation, and mitochondrial DNA targeting warrants further exploration. The rational design of mitochondria-targeted molecular tools holds great promise for achieving precise, personalized, and low-toxicity tumor therapy.},

The precise mechanism responsible for this neuronal labeling has remained a longstanding enigma. We investigated four potential mechanisms underlying NeuO's fluorescence, including its interaction with neuronal proteins, transportation into neurons, export from glial cells, and structural alterations within neurons. Our study found that NeuO undergoes structural changes via phosphorylation by the PAK6 kinase, resulting in high fluorescence in neurons, likely due to fluorogenic activation and intracellular retention within neurons. This discovery improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of NeuO in neurons and facilitates the development of new chemical compounds that can be selectively modified by kinases in living cells.},

However, the underlying molecular mechanism governing PETase-catalyzed PET depolymerization at the solid-liquid interface remains elusive, hampering the rational design of highly efficient enzymes. Here, we comprehensively elucidate the catalytic pathway of PETase, detailing steps from initial enzyme adsorption at the PET interface, subsequent substrate fragment capture, conformational refinement, to the ultimate cleavage of ester bonds. We uncover an intrinsic trade-off between the activity and stability of the enzyme's PET-binding loops, which negatively impacts overall PET degradation efficiency. By strategically reshaping the loop dynamics of PETase, we successfully overcome this compromise, simultaneously enhancing both enzymatic activity and structural stability. Collectively, this work provides critical insights into PETase functionality at solid-liquid interfaces and establishes valuable guidelines for the rational design of efficient plastic-degrading enzymes.},

At low electric fields, p -phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules exhibit a high-conductance state, which transitions successively to two distinct low-conductance states as the external electric field strength increases. This precise control of supramolecular junctions through electric field manipulation achieved an on/off ratio G H /G L of ∼1.25×10 3 , which is one of the largest values reported to date. Flicker noise analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the intrinsic mechanism for the observation, i.e ., electric field promoting the formation of trimer supramolecular junctions leads to the striking on/off ratio.

  abstract     = {Mechanophores (mechanosensitive molecules) are usually activated by pulling force transduced by polymer covalently attached to their structures. A variety of mechanophores have been described to date but many rely on a limited number of core structures. The diversity of products formed mechanochemically could be improved by promoting the scission of varied bonds within a single mechanophore. 4-membered rings are particularly suited for this as two sets of products can be obtained by formal retro-[2 + 2] cycloaddition depending on the pulling direction. This concept has been applied to a couple of mechanophores but the repositioning of the anchoring points often requires a redesign of the structures, and the pulling activation is not amenable to the release of the products. Here we show that the unique pushing activation of a rotaxane actuator enables the selective activation of covalent bonds parallel or perpendicular to the main chain in diazetidinone and β-lactam mechanophores. The selectivity depends on the orientation of the bulky substituents pointing toward or away from the incoming macrocycle. We were able to release ketene and triaryl imine/ethene molecules, and to generate imine, azobenzene, and isocyanate units. This alternative activation method demonstrates how to elicit new reactivity from known mechanophores and should inspire the design of new ones. The variety of structures released/generated here illustrate how this approach can be used for the release of reactive species and other functional molecules.},

Solar-driven photocatalytic technology depending on photocatalysts with matched energy band structure for simultaneously driving both O 2 reduction and water oxidation half-reactions, without necessary use of any sacrificial agent, enables green H 2 O 2 synthesis from O 2 and/or H 2 O, offering a low-energy and simple-operation process without secondary pollution while avoiding safety and environmental risk of conventional methods. Herein, a novel acylhydrazone-linked 2D COF, COF-S-OH , was prepared from benzo[1,2- b :3,4- b ':5,6- b '']trithiophene-2,5,8-tricarbaldehyde and 2,3-dihydroxysuccinohydrazide. Both experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that introduction of benzotrithiophene units and hydroxyl groups enhances the electron donor-acceptor effect in COF-S-OH , optimizes the light-harvesting and adsorption capacities to O 2 and H 2 O, and particularly enables efficient proton transfer, thereby synergistically improving photogenerated charge carrier separation and surface reaction efficiency. Consequently, COF-S-OH achieves an exceptional H 2 O 2 production rate of 10.2 mmol g −1 h −1 with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 2.1%, superior to all the thus far reported photocatalysts for H 2 O 2 synthesis. This work underscores the critical importance of carrier separation, active site, and proton supply in photocatalytic H 2 O 2 generation, providing guidance for designing and fabricating next-generation photocatalysts.},

However, realizing accurate regulation of structure by phase engineering is challenging, primarily due to constrained synthesis methods and the existing gaps in understanding of specialized phase structures. Herein, a series of P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 cathode material with prominent electrochemical performances were successfully synthesized, based on an in-depth understanding of structural insights into P′2 phase. By analyzing the structural evolution and Mn-valence changes during synthesis, we found that oxygen vacancies play a significant role in determining the P′2–P2 phase transition. Moreover, these insights not only identified the oxygen release and uptake behaviors in phase formation but also expanded synthesis strategy with enhanced operational feasibility. Benefits from expanded Mn redox range and stable oxygen vacancies during cycling, the obtained P′2-Na 0.67 Fe 0.05 Ti 0.1 Mn 0.85 O 2 demonstrated a capacity increase of over ∼40 mAh g −1 at 0.1 C, maintaining ∼93 mAh g −1 even after 1000 cycles at 10 C, with an impressive retention rate of 87.5%.

However, conventional POS synthesis via strong acid–base neutralization (e.g., ─SO₃H and ─NH₂) leads to extensive hydrogen bonding with water, compromising stability in aqueous and water-lean environments. Here, we address this challenge by designing POSs with hydrophobic porous channels and minimal hydrogen bonding formation. Our key innovation is the use of fluorinated tetrazole as a weak acid tecton and a tetra-substituted imidazole precursor devoid of active protons as the base. Single-crystal analysis and computational modeling reveal that the structural integrity of the synthesized POSs arises primarily from cation–anion interactions, with water confined as clusters in the pores, independent of hydrogen bonding with the scaffold. Robustness of the POS structure under aqueous and water-lean conditions is confirmed by X-ray and neutron scattering, as well as computational modeling, confirming preserved packing and crystal structures. The stability of POS is further demonstrated in aqueous iodine capture, with imidazolium cations and C–F functionalizations serving as strong adsorption sites. The approach developed herein further pushes the boundary of POS materials to withstand both aqueous and water-lean conditions.},

Here, we report for the first time a low-cost, high-performance Ni-based catalyst synthesized via a precise surface selenization protocol that effectively overcomes these limitations. The optimized catalyst significantly outperforms noble metal catalysts, achieving a total alcohol yield of 62.6% and a high selectivity of 83.8% for HAS (62.0% for C 5+ OH) in the cross-condensation of MeOH and EtOH. Our characterizations and theoretical simulations indicate that Se doping restructures the Ni surface, creating three-coordinated Ni─Se sites. These sites promote efficient alcohol dehydrogenation and raise the energy barrier for aldehyde decomposition, thereby greatly increasing the efficiency and selectivity of MeOH and EtOH cross-condensation to C 5+ OH.},

  abstract     = {Photoreduction of CO 2 is often hindered by the sluggish kinetics for its activation. Refinement of host–guest interactions is an effective strategy to overcome this barrier. Here, we report the immobilization of active Co(II) sites within a covalent-organic framework (COF) with a one-dimensional (1D) chain structure, Co-PyPDA-COF, which demonstrates a remarkable CO generation rate of 30.5 mmol g −1 h −1 and a high CO selectivity of 95.8% in 2 h for CO 2 photoreduction at room temperature. The pore size of Co-PyPDA-COF is comparable to the diameter of CO 2 , which allows simultaneous interaction of a single CO 2 molecule with the two Co(II) sites. The enhanced interaction result in increased local CO 2 pressure, limited CO 2 diffusion after adsorption, shortened distance for photoelectron transfer, and reduced energy barrier for the rate-determining step in CO 2 reduction, promoting CO 2 activation and conversion. This work opens a new way to design efficient catalysts by optimizing the pore size of the host.},

Here, we report a strategy to integrate whole-cell spirulina, a green-blue algae, into robust biohybrid algae-polyimine networks by leveraging a mechanochemical ball milling method. This strategy provides a greener synthetic approach to conventional solvent casting methods for polyimine synthesis; it simultaneously overcomes persistent constraints encountered in biomass processing and derivatization. The biohybrid algae-based materials retain adaptability and recyclability imparted by their underlying dynamic covalent polymer matrix and display enhanced mechanical properties compared to their all-synthetic equivalents. These advantageous properties are attributed to the unique morphology of the ball milled biohybrid materials which are facilitated by integration of the spirulina into the polymer matrix. Substituting spirulina with alternative biomass sources such as waste agricultural products also yields robust biohybrid networks, thus highlighting the broad utility of this straightforward mechanochemical synthesis to create more sustainable materials.},

However, existing strategies are not effective for pyridines with electron-withdrawing substituents at the C2 position. To address this long-standing issue, a new strategy has been developed that utilizes underexplored carbodications as the Lewis acids to activate pyridines. For the first time, pyridines with -CN and -ester substituents at the C2 position have been successfully converted to 1,4-DHPs through direct reductive dearomatization in exclusive C4 selectivity. The potential utility of this 1,4-DHP synthetic protocol is demonstrated with C5-bromination, C5-trifluoromethylation, C5-deuteration, and C4-deuteration of pyridines using the in situ generated 1,4-DHPs as key intermediates.},

Achieving an ultralong service life, e.g., beyond 100 000 cycles, is highly desired for aqueous energy storage, which necessitates the precise cognition and modulation of the surface/interface microenvironment with prolonged cycling conditions. Herein, to address this issue, we for the first time engineer the competitive bonding and the electrochemical deep progression of NiCoCu medium-entropy hydroxides. The theoretical and experiment results indicate that Cu is prone to leaching from the medium-entropy hydroxides with cycling, which elevates the d/p-band centers to activate the lattice oxygen and Co atoms, triggering a Cu/Co dual-cation dissolution relay phenomenon. As-incorporated Co vacancies favor the β-to-γ phase transformation of the reconstructed structure, accompanied by the coordination oscillation and the production of ultrafine (∼1.9 nm) nanodomains with improved kinetics and stability. Consequently, capacity retention of 1485 C g −1 was achieved after 150 000 cycles for the reconstructed electrodes, which is superior to many state-of-the-art NiCo-based materials. This work elucidates the potential of the coordination reorganization and deep progression of the reaction microenvironment to break the performance limit of energy storage and beyond.},

Hybrid capacitive deionization (HCDI), an energy-efficient desalination method, depends on electrode materials. Removing chloride ions (Cl − ), a key salinity factor, is vital for balanced electrode capacity. Yet, efforts focus mainly on cathode materials for Na + capture, limiting the progress of electrochemical desalination. Herein, we have developed a covalent organic framework (COF)-based redox-active anode material with excellent chemical stability and unique pseudocapacitive behavior. In the HCDI cell, the rationally designed material showed a remarkable chloride ion removal capacity (Cl-RC) of 71.5 mg g −1 in 1300 ppm saline solution with a noteworthy removal capacity rate (Cl − RCR) of 1.85 mg g −1 min −1 , while maintaining 98.7% capacity retention over 30 cycles. Under optimized conditions, the COF electrode displayed a high selectivity toward Cl − over other anions present in real-seawater samples with Cl-RC of 89 mg g −1 , implying its practical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first example of a purposefully functionalized COF serving as an anode in HCDI, highlighting the promising role of COFs in advancing capacitive deionization technologies.},

The increase in crystal size enabled the analysis of precise structural features such as the mechanical properties or the different aggregation states of the bidimensional framework. In addition, the reaction mechanism was computationally elucidated, and the roles of the modulator agent and the catalyst were analyzed, confirming the critical importance of trifluoroacetic acid and 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroaniline in modulating Schiff base bond formation and, consequently, the crystallinity of the resulting COF.

By shifting the pyridine bridging unit from the tetra to the penta positions, these molecules undergo a configurational transformation from an orthogonal (4BT) to a planar structure (5BT).

The planar configuration of 5BT enables more Lewis base sites to interact with perovskite, exhibiting more pronounced deep-level defect passivation effect, while improving hole extraction capability. Consequently, the 5BT-modified n-i-p PSCs achieved a champion PCE of 26.15% (certified at 26.12%) and superior operational stability by retaining 94.0% of the initial PCE according to ISOS-L-2 protocol.

Though single-atom catalysts (SACs), typically with symmetric M-N 4 coordination structures have demonstrated attractive electrocatalytic performance in Li–S batteries, herein we discovered that an asymmetric-coordinated metal center distinctly shifts sulfur redox reaction (SRR) kinetics—from first-order (concentration-dependent) behavior in the symmetric-coordinated SACs—to zero-order (surface-saturated) kinetics, highlighting fundamentally altered reaction pathways, leading to a concurrent polysulfide conversion. Experimental and theoretical studies on the Ni atom-based SACs showed that symmetry breaking raises the Ni d-band center, enabling a monodentate-to-bidentate Li 2 S 4 adsorption transition, which strengthens polysulfide adsorption and shifts the rate-limiting step from sluggish solid-solid transformation (Li 2 S 2 → Li 2 S) to a more favorable liquid–solid conversion (Li 2 S 4 → Li 2 S 2 ), effectively lowering the overall energy barrier of the SRR process. Consequently, Li–S cells employing Ni-NPG, a SACs with asymmetric Ni-N 3 P 1 coordination, achieved a specific capacity of 877 mAh g −1 at 4 C. Even under a high sulfur loading of 6 mg cm −2 , the cell retained 92% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0.2 C, outperforming conventional SACs with symmetric coordination structures.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic alkyne semi-hydrogenation (EASH) powered by renewable electricity using water as a hydrogen donor provides a sustainable alternative to conventional thermocatalysis. However, the current EASH systems predominantly follow hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) pathways, which are prone to over-hydrogenation and at the same time compete with the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, we report a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanism enabled on Cu(111) surface for highly efficient and selective EASH. Well-defined two-dimensional Cu nanosheets with exposed (111) facets achieve > 98% selectivity for electrochemical semi-hydrogenation of 4-aminophenylacetylene to 4-vinylphenylamine in a membrane electrode assembly reactor. The Cu nanosheets can also efficiently remove 1%–8% alkyne impurities in alkene and exhibit broad substrate scope, stereoselectivity, as well as operational stability. In situ Raman spectroscopy measurements reveal that, during the PCET-mediated EASH, the covalent adsorption of alkynes and their conversion to weakly bound planar intermediates facilitate the EASH process and suppress over-hydrogenation. Interfacial K + -structured and linearly hydrogen-bonded water species further enhance EASH selectivity via proton supply and steric modulation. Radical scavenging and kinetic isotope effect studies, along with theoretical calculations, corroborate a PCET-dominated mechanism on Cu(111) surface. This work establishes a PCET-driven paradigm for selective hydrogenation beyond the conventional HAT pathways.},

Herein, a competitive adsorption-driven, fast-ion-conducting host was innovatively developed based on the Li 15 Si 4 /Li 3 N microrods. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it was revealed for the first time that the dual-phase interface exhibits competitive adsorption interactions with solvent molecules and anions within the solvation sheath. This unique interfacial interaction triggers dynamic reconstruction of the solvation structure at the interface, significantly reducing the Li + desolvation barrier by 33%. Benefiting from the integration of these multifunctional advantages, the symmetric cell delivers an ultra-long cycle lifespan of over 5000 h at 1 mA cm −2 with an exceptionally low overpotential of 13 mV. Moreover, the full cell coupled with LiFePO 4 cathodes achieves an impressive cycling stability of 2000 cycles at 5 C, with a capacity retention of 107%.

  abstract     = {A hinge-like supramolecular mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and two excimer-forming 1,6-bis(phenylethynyl)pyrene luminophores is presented. Each luminophore shares one phenyl group with the [2.2]paracyclophane, resulting in a rigid and strained structure that forces the two luminophores into close proximity. As a consequence, the photoluminescence of the mechanophore in THF solution and in solid films of a polyurethane containing the new motif is dominated by excimer emission. Stretching the polymer films causes an easily discernible change from bright yellow excimer to blue–green monomer-dominated emission. The ratio of excimer to monomer emission intensities traces the nonlinear stress–strain curves of the polymer well and is a good indicator for the macroscopically applied force. The reversibility of the mechanoresponse, theoretical analyses, and reference experiments with a similar mechanophore in which the emitters and the [2.2]paracyclophane core are connected by flexible linkers support the conclusion that the mechanoactivation is caused by distorting the molecule into a bent, more open conformation and not the scission of covalent bonds. The operating principle was further confirmed by investigating a second hinge-like mechanophore based on a [2.2]paracyclophane core and 1,4-bis(phenylethynyl)benzene emitters.},

Inspired by the DNA duplex's iconic helical structure, we present here a novel strategy for designing a molecular-scale staircase configuration. The resulting molecular staircase ( MS ), predominantly linear in shape, consists of pyridine units linked by hydrazide groups, with backbone rigidity enhanced by intramolecular H-bonding. This MS incorporates up to five proton-transporting motifs, demonstrating remarkable efficacy as a proton-conducting channel within lipid bilayer membranes. Our findings indicate that the MS exhibits high proton transport activity (EC 50 of 0.31 mol%, relative to lipids) and significant selectivity for protons, with selectivity values of 160.3 for K + , 90.5 for Na + , and 3.5 for Cl ⁻ . These results underscore the potential of the MS and its variants as a highly selective and efficient proton channel, advancing the field of artificial ion transport systems.},

Here, we resolve this dilemma through heterointerface-engineered stabilization, where the strategically constructed Nb-TiO 2 rutile/anatase heterophase homojunction stabilizes Ir sites with enhanced orbital overlap and intensified charge transfer. This atomic-scale anchoring mechanism, validated by operando characterization and theoretical calculations, strengthens Ir─O support bonding and optimizes *OOH adsorption energetics, thereby enabling concurrent activity-stability improvements. The resultant Ir@IrO x /m-Nb-TiO 2 anode achieves exceptional PEMWE performance with ultralow loading (0.27 mg Ir cm −2 ), requiring a low electrolysis voltage of 1.72 V to reach industrial current densities of 2 A cm −2 , coupled with unprecedented durability with <1.7% voltage decay over 3000 h. This interface design philosophy establishes a general paradigm for developing active and stable supported electrocatalysts for PEMWE and beyond.},

However, their widespread application is restricted by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics coupled with the poisoning of adsorbed Cl − in seawater electrolyte. Herein, we design a pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon-supported Fe single-atom catalyst [Fe-SAC/NC(Py)] to achieve exceptional ORR performance in seawater electrolytes. The Fe-SAC/NC(Py) achieves a high onset potential ( E onset ) and halfwave potential ( E 1/2 ) of 1.174 and 0.907 V versus RHE, respectively, significantly outperforming the commercial 20% Pt/C (E onset : 0.972 V, E 1/2 : 0.848 V). Furthermore, the assembled SZABs demonstrates a peak power density of 204 mW cm −2 and a specific capacity of 800 mAh g −1 , surpassing most previously reported catalysts. In-situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the pyridinic nitrogen-modified carbon support in situ constructs a negatively charged interface during ORR process, effectively suppressing Cl − adsorption. Additionally, the atomic Fe sites coordinated with pyridinic nitrogen optimize the charge distribution of the active centers, lowering the adsorption energy of oxygen-containing intermediates and thereby enhancing ORR catalytic performance.},

This strategy notably supports a wide range of peptide modifications, including side chain alteration, amine functionalization, and peptide macrocyclization through both backbone and side chain groups, as well as incorporating aromatic scaffolds into the peptide backbone. The methodology demonstrates broad substrate tolerance, compatibility with peptide chemistry protocols, and access to complex motifs, including pharmacophores and imaging tags, all within a single reaction platform.

Despite decades of development, it is still difficult to perform SDM on some sequences, including highly repetitive ones, because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is often used as the most effective method for SDM, but results in complicated products with these sequences. To overcome this limitation, we report herein a PCR-free SDM method that uses DNA-cleaving DNAzymes. Since these DNAzymes lack the capability of cleaving double-stranded DNA, we employed single-stranded DNAs as assisting DNAs to open superhelical plasmids, allowing the DNA-cleaving DNAzymes to cleave the plasmid. Such a system, named single-stranded DNA-assisted double-stranded DNA nicking by DNAzymes (DANDA), expanded the substrate scope of DNAzymes to double-stranded, superhelical plasmids. We showed that DANDA is highly customizable and target-specific, which allows successful generation of mutations on a plasmid containing PCR-incompatible repetitive sequences. By using solely unmodified DNA oligos that are more cost-effective and easier to prepare than other systems that employ either PNA or restriction enzymes, this DANDA system further expands the applications of DNA-cleaving DNAzymes in synthetic biology for different biochemical and biotechnological applications.},

The incorporation of CDs into the RHO zeolite is realized via a straightforward calcination process, which endows the zeolite with the defect sites rich in hydroxyl groups that easily form hydrogen bonds with CDs. Along with 1 H- 1 H DQ-SQ experiments, in situ FTIR and DFT calculations, the unique hydrogen-bonding traps are unraveled, which can selectively capture and concentrate CO 2 . As a result, the CDs-containing zeolite (R-500) showcases exceptional performance in terms of both CO 2 adsorption (90.40 cm 3 g −1 at 298K and 1 bar) and CO 2 /N 2 (15/85) separation (IAST selectivity of 1063.6). Strikingly, a superior CO 2 adsorption with a capacity of 42.9 cm 3 g −1 is achieved in the dynamic separation process (CO 2 /N 2 15/85). The facile synthesis and impressive separation performance of R-500 provides a promising solution for industrial scale CO 2 /N 2 separation in flue gas.},

  abstract     = {Monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs), a class of bioactive natural products, are highly valued in drug development for their unique pharmacological activities. Teleocidins, known for activating protein kinase C (PKC), are particularly promising but challenging to synthesize due to their structural complexity. Traditional methods often rely on heavy metals and yield low amounts, while biosynthetic approaches face efficiency issues. Our study developed an efficient chemoenzymatic route to produce 13 teleocidin B compounds and derivatives at scale. To overcome enzymatic reaction bottlenecks, we engineered the critical enzyme TleB by fusing a reductase module to create a self-sufficient P450 system, boosting indolactam V production to 868.8 mg L −1 . Additionally, we established a dual-cell factory co-expressing engineered hMAT2A-TleD and TleB/TleC enzymes, enabling the first fully enzymatic synthesis of teleocidin B isomers with a total yield of 714.7 mg L −1 . Chemical modifications further expanded the library with five novel indolactam V and two teleocidin A1 derivatives. Fermentation confirmed the recombinant Escherichia coli system's scalability, producing 430 mg indolactam V, 170 mg teleocidin A1, and 300 mg teleocidin B isomers. This work not only establishes a sustainable platform for teleocidin synthesis but also addresses efficiency and scalability challenges in complex natural product synthesis, paving the way for practical applications of bioactive compounds.},

  abstract     = {Porosity and Al siting are key levers for optimizing zeolite catalysts, yet they are often addressed independently due to the lack of effective integrated tuning strategies. Herein, we report an integrative methodology for preparing hierarchical zeolite (Z F ) with interconnected mesostructures and tunable Al siting, achieved via regioselective dissolution of Al-rich domains by presetting accessible and inaccessible zones within parent zeolite (Z P ). Remarkably, ∼60% of the framework channels’ Al atoms were selectively removed without impairing the channel intersections’ Al atoms. Despite a 39% reduction in Brønsted acid sites (BAS), Z F exhibits a 1.8-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) than Z P during ethylene transformation at 973K, attributable to the introduction of mesoporosity. Notably, site-specific 31 P NMR analysis reveals that BAS located at channel intersections exhibits a TOF of 516 h −1 , which is 13 times higher than that of sites within the channels (40 h −1 ). The hierarchical zeolite also demonstrates superior durability and enhanced aromatic selectivity compared to Z P . These results highlight the synergistic benefits of simultaneously tuning porosity and Al siting, offering a new paradigm for the rational design of high-performance zeolite catalysts and providing deeper insights into the interplay between structure and function in zeolite-based catalysis.},

  abstract     = {The preparation of peptidic molecules is a mainstay of synthesis, creating new tools that advance chemical biology, catalysis, and drug discovery. Despite the wide adoption of methods for amide synthesis based on electrophilic acyl transfer reactions, significant limitations remain that restrict access to chemical space and plague accessible peptides with imperfect conservation of stereochemical information. These problems persist in key applications (i.e., solid phase peptide synthesis) where reagent excess can be used to drive maximal yield. As a general tactic, however, use of excess coupling agents that are often hazardous is unsustainable. Here we report the synthesis of the antiviral tridecapeptide feglymycin where half of the amides are formed using umpolung amide synthesis (UmAS) to replace conventional amide synthesis. Reliance on UmAS further allowed the enantioselective synthesis of each noncanonical residue from an inexpensive aldehyde. As a result, the most process-intensive components were simplified to a chiral Brønsted acid organocatalyst and potassium iodide/urea·hydrogen peroxide (KI/UHP). This solution-phase total synthesis illustrates the harmonious, strategic application of complementary amide synthesis methods, and it serves as a touchstone for the green synthesis of peptides composed of noncanonical amino amides.},

We show here that, in the construction of POM–organic cages with Keggin-type {SiW 9 Ni 4 } cluster nodes, introducing a secondary ligand may change the self-assembly processes in two distinct ways: by coordination or as supramolecular templates. The use of a tetracarboxylate panel L C , in complementary to a bent dicarboxylate linker (L A or L B ), allows the integrative self-sorting to give heteroleptic coordination cages POM 8 L A/B 4 L C 4 ( 3 or 4 ) that are otherwise not accessible through either ligand alone. The aromatic L C can also alter the outcome of the self-assembly process by acting as a non-coordinating template, transforming a coordinatively frustrated, homoleptic cage POM 8 L D 6 ( 5 ) to POM 8 L D 5 ( 6 ). These octa-Keggin cages were all shown to be efficient molecular catalysts for visible-light-driven hydrogen production; for 4 , in particular, an apparent turnover number of 4910 was achieved in 5 h under minimally optimized conditions. Mechanistic studies confirmed the existence of both reductive and oxidative quenching processes, with the former being dominant.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of high-performance photocatalysts is crucial for the iteration of light-driven micro/nanomotors. However, most existing light-driven micro/nanomotors, which are typically fabricated from inorganic semiconductors, suffer from limited visible-light absorption and inadequate control over 3D motion. Polymeric semiconductors, as emerging photocatalytic materials, feature narrow bandgaps, tunable band structures, and the potential for rational molecular design to optimize activity. This study introduces phenolic resins as efficient semiconductor photocatalysts, establishing a novel platform for constructing light-driven nanomotors. Among them, the m -aminophenol-formaldehyde resin nanomotor, synthesized via hydrothermal methods, exhibits exceptional mobility due to its efficient photoelectric conversion and charge transfer behavior. Its outstanding photoelectrochemical properties originate from a benzoxazine-quinoid structure with a low HOMO–LUMO gap (1.90 eV). These nanomotors feature broad-spectrum light absorption and can respond to various external stimuli, including light intensity, wavelength, and H 2 O 2 concentration, enabling precise control over in-plane and vertical motion with adjustable speed and directionality. As a proof of concept, the nanomotors demonstrate superior photodynamic inactivation of Karenia mikimotoi under visible light exposure, surpassing TiO 2 nanoparticles in antimicrobial efficiency. This work explores the relationship between molecular structure, photocatalytic performance, and motion behavior, providing instructive insights for designing light-driven nanomotors with advanced motion manipulation.},

However, overlooking the O 2 pre-adsorption process induced by defective structures hampers the precise identification of active sites and the investigation of the reaction mechanism in Fe-N-C SACs. Hence, we report a Fe SAC with abundant pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures (Fe-N v -C SAC) and propose a synergistic effect between pyridinic N vacancy defects and O 2 molecules that promotes the kinetics of ORR. The developed Fe-N v -C SAC demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, exhibiting superior mass activity and turnover frequency compared to conventional Fe-N-C SACs. The in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and theoretical calculations indicate that pyridinic N vacancy defects in microporous structures facilitate pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules results in the d-band centers of central Fe atoms shifting away from the fermi level. This shift weakens the adsorption strength of *OH species, thereby facilitating the kinetic process of ORR. This work addresses a critical gap in the field of electrocatalysis by providing the experimental validation of pre-adsorption of O 2 molecules on Fe single-atom catalysts, a phenomenon previously only speculated through theoretical calculations.},

Consequently, this metal‒nonmetal dual-site cooperation enables simultaneous optimization of both adsorption/activation and desorption processes, leading to remarkably enhanced catalytic activity.

And now, the host–guest-doped systems have become an effective approach for facilitating RTP, regardless of the still unclear inherent mechanism. In this work, a series of host–guest-doped RTP materials were constructed, and based on experimental results, the “strong assisting weak” effect was proposed. That is, the host with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect can effectively enhance the phosphorescence of the guest with weak intersystem crossing (ISC), while maintaining the guest's relatively long lifetime. With 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) as the host and naphthalene (NL) as the guest, the long RTP lifetime of 1.79 s could be achieved, which is obviously longer than 0.5 s of NL@ polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) process from the dark triplet excitons of DMAP to NL was found to play the key role in triggering RTP of NL. These findings deepen our understandings of RTP mechanisms and provide practical guidance for the creation of highly efficient and long-lived RTP materials.},

This system leverages multi-metal sulfide electrocatalysts inspired by denitrifying enzymes, which generate signaling molecules, nitric oxide (NO), and ammonia (NH 3 ) from nitrite ions. By controlling catalytic active sites, NO or NH 3 can be selectively produced under mild electric fields in physiologically relevant conditions. In situ product analyses and first-principles calculations reveal that NO intermediate binding affinity determines product selectivity. These electrocatalysts integrate seamlessly with biological systems, allowing precise, on-demand modulation of NO- or NH 3 -mediated signaling pathways in human cell lines.

  abstract     = {Solid-state lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs) are known for their enhanced safety, higher electrochemical stability, and improved energy density compared to liquid-state LOBs. However, the investigation of solid-state LOBs is limited with little understanding of their discharge and charge processes. In this work, a polymer-based solid-state LOB is used to investigate the effect of discharge rate on lithium peroxide (Li 2 O 2 ) formation, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and cycle performance. Notably, we observe a counterintuitive trend: Li 2 O 2 particle size increases with increasing discharge current density, in contrast to liquid systems. This behavior arises from inherent space charge layers that restrict Li⁺ transport under high current, and spatially heterogeneous active sites at the solid electrolyte–cathode interface, directly evidenced by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which govern nucleation accessibility and promote site-selective Li 2 O 2 growth. Furthermore, higher current densities improve ORR and OER efficiency but accelerate anode degradation, while lower currents promote side reactions. These opposing effects result in a trade-off that defines an optimal discharge rate (0.1 mA cm⁻ 2 ) for maximizing cycle life. This study provides a new mechanistic perspective on discharge-driven processes in solid-state LOBs and offers practical guidelines for performance optimization in future high-energy battery systems.},

However, the effective construction of multiaxial aromatic photoferroelectrics for stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection remains a great blank. Herein, we report for the first time the successful design of a multiaxial aromatic-based photoferroelectric, (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 (4Br2FBZ = 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzylammonium), through synergistic noncovalent interactions of hydrogen bonding and fluorine-π, which achieves a stable multidirectional self-powered X-ray detection. Notably, the aromatic cations rotate driven by synergistic molecular interactions to form a T-shaped stacking architecture, resembling interlocking puzzle pieces. This oriented arrangement generates electric dipoles, inducing four equivalent polarization directions, which endow (4Br2FBZ) 2 PbBr 4 with a large spontaneous polarization of 4.48 µC cm −2 and a high Curie temperature of 408 K. The combination of its biaxial nature and strong intermolecular interaction network, self-powered X-ray detectors assembled along two polar axes demonstrate high sensitivities (181.7 and 175.3 µC Gy −1 cm −2 ), and exceptional detection stability. Strikingly, the polycrystalline ferroelectric film also exhibits excellent self-powered X-ray detection behavior due to its biaxial ferroelectricity, indicating the potential for next-generation flexible and thin-film integrated devices.},

  abstract     = {In proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ionomer aggregation on Pt/C catalysts leads to increased oxygen transport resistance of conventional catalyst layers. This behavior significantly influences oxygen transport in the microenvironment at the triple-phase interface of Pt/C catalysts. To address this challenge, triazine-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) were incorporated into the cathode catalyst layer, so that their well-defined pore structure and proton eligible triazine sites interact with terminal sulfonate groups of the Nafion ionomer. This interaction regulates the triple-phase microenvironment, enhances Pt utilization, and establishes directed oxygen-enriched transport channels. Under low-platinum loading conditions (−0.05 mg Pt cm −2 ) in a H 2 ─O 2 PEMFC, the COF-modified system achieved a peak power density of 1.55 W cm −2 , 1.3 times of conventional PEMFCs, with a 38% reduction in local oxygen transport resistance. This work presents a new design principle for high-performance low-platinum PEMFCs, as a new approach to further advance their commercialization.},

  abstract     = {In response to the increasing demand for sustainable energy storage solutions, aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) have garnered significant attention for their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, two major challenges to battery stability persist: developing efficient cathode materials and addressing zinc dendrite formation. Here, we report a dual-functional covalent organic framework (COF), named Ni–DAPTO, designed to improve both Zn 2+ storage on the cathode and zinc deposition kinetics on the anode. The incorporation of Ni coordination centers achieves an expected low energy gap, enhancing the intrinsic conductivity, while selectively guiding uniform Zn 2+ deposition. As a result, the Ni–DAPTO cathode demonstrated superior cycling stability and rate performance, retaining a specific capacity of 127.0 and 119.7 mAh g −1 at 0.5 and 10.0 A g −1 , respectively after 10 000 cycles. Besides, when employed as artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), Ni–DAPTO can improve zinc utilization and inhibit dendrite formation. The full AZIBs assembled with Ni–DAPTO cathodes and Ni–DAPTO modified Zn anodes deliver a discharge capacity of 100.9 mAh g −1 after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A g −1 . These findings suggest that multifunctional COFs hold great potential for advancing high-performance and long-lasting aqueous secondary batteries.},

  abstract     = {Biofilms establish protective sanctuaries that shield resident bacteria, facilitating resistance. Despite extensive efforts, current chemicals for biofilm eradication remain insufficient, with the reliance on single-structure antimicrobials further exacerbating resistance. Photoisomerizable spiropyran derivatives reversibly transition between conformational states, alternately exerting antimicrobial activity against pathogens and potentially mitigating resistance. However, the biofilm-eradicating potential of spiropyran derivatives remains unverified, while their application is hindered by limited fatigue resistance, suboptimal foliar affinity, and reliance on UV-induced isomerization, all of which are incompatible with sustainable agriculture. Herein, we present a supramolecular strategy to fabricate SpA6 (MC)⊂CB[8], a self-assembled complex of the spiropyran derivative SpA6 and cucurbit[8]uril, offering day–night cycle isomerization, enhanced photostability, potent biofilm disruption, improved foliar adhesion, and high antibacterial activity. Notably, neither ambient light nor darkness attenuates its potency, enabling persistent antibacterial activity across diverse molecular configurations. In vivo studies demonstrate its superior dual protective/curative efficacy (54.73%/49.60%) at 200 µg mL −1 against bacterial leaf blight, surpassing thiazole copper (37.63%/33.58%) and bismerthiazol (31.20%/25.59%) without compromising safety, while extended indications reveal its enhanced efficacy (78.99%/63.50%) against citrus canker, outperforming thiazole copper (59.50%/41.42%).

  abstract     = {Patterning luminescent colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) at the micro- and nanometer scale is crucial for their integration into advanced solid-state optical, photonic, and electronic devices. However, it remains challenging to achieve high resolution and high fidelity in patterning chemically fragile luminescent NPs, while not sacrificing their structural integrity and/or optical properties. Here, we develop a rationally designed three-armed diazo crosslinker ( 3G ) for nondestructively patterning various chemically sensitive luminescent NPs with high resolution (down to nanoscale) and high fidelity. The key points of the 3G design include (i) shielding aliphatic C─H bonds, (ii) extending the distance between active sites, and (iii) introducing more crosslinkable moieties. Thanks to the low UV exposure dose (18 mJ cm −2 , in stark contrast to 200–500 mJ cm −2 for diazirine-based crosslinkers) required for sufficient crosslinking, mild photochemistry of 3G , and proper alignment of energy levels between 3G and NPs, the 3G -based patterning method can fully preserve the structural and photophysical properties of both upconverting NPs and perovskite quantum dots, as reflected by their unchanged emission peak/lifetime and high quantum yield retention (90%). Moreover, this method enables the fabrication of multi-layer structures for dual-mode anti-counterfeiting. This work broadens the scope for patterning inorganic NPs, thereby facilitating their potential applications in system-level devices.},

A well-known approach to modify their electronic properties involves introducing nonbenzenoid ring topologies in their ideal sp 2 -hybridized hexagonal lattice, such as azulene or Stone-Wales (SW) defects. However, despite the unique structural and electronic characteristics that these nonalternant defects induce, their systematic incorporation in graphene-based nanostructures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the on-surface synthesis of one-dimensional SW-based polymers linked through cumulene bonds on the Au(111) surface via thermal and visible-light-induced reactions of a tailored molecular precursor. Scanning tunneling and noncontact atomic force microscopies reveal the nonplanar structure of SW-based units within the polymer chain, while the chemical structure of the polymer has been verified by Raman spectroscopy in combination with theoretical modeling. Additionally, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show an experimental bandgap of 1.8 eV, which significantly differs from its isostructural cumulene-bridged bisanthene analogs. Our results highlight the critical role of SW defects in the structural and electronic properties of carbon-based conjugated polymers, advancing their design with prospects in next-generation optoelectronic devices.},

While traditional methods rely on etching in primarily acidic aqueous media, molten salts offer an intriguing alternative. However, the current understanding of MAX phase reactivity in molten salts is limited, restricting our ability to predict reaction outcomes. In this study, we present a computational framework that uses process-specific phase diagrams to model A-element substitution and MXene formation, as well as competing side reactions. Applying this approach to Ti 3 AlC 2 , V 2 AlC, and Ti 2 AlN in ZnCl 2 molten salt, we reveal distinct reaction behaviors despite identical redox potentials—defined here by the Al-to-Zn exchange—of key processes. Our findings underscore the limitations of predicting reactions based solely on redox potentials and show that our model can capture key trends in MXene synthesis.

Recently a promising family of photoswitches based on the rhodanine motif was described. Here, the photophysics of a typical example are investigated by ultrafast UV and IR spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. Remarkably, the photophysics are very different to and more complex than those of closely related monomethine photoswitches, which relax by ultrafast internal conversion to the electronic ground state. In the rhodanine photoswitch, the allowed Franck–Condon excited state also relaxes on a sub-picosecond timescale, but the ground state is repopulated only after several hundred picoseconds. Instead, the Franck–Condon state relaxes through (at least) two intermediate states. These states are characterized by transient spectroscopy, and the reaction pathway is modeled by quantum chemical calculations. Comparison of calculated and measured IR data suggests that a triplet mediated isomerization pathway is responsible for the slow excited state dynamics. The triplet state is rapidly populated via coupling of a nearly degenerate nπ * state populated by ultrafast internal conversion from the bright ππ * state. This unexpected isomerization pathway has important implications for the synthesis, analysis, and application of rhodanine photoswitches.},

Nevertheless, this approach is underexplored in luminescent semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) due to the lack of understanding into the HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical behaviors. Herein, harnessing the defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite NCs, we systematically synthesized and characterized high-entropy halide perovskite (HEP) NCs containing multiple B-site elements (Pb 2+ , Sr 2 ⁺, Ca 2 ⁺, Cd 2 ⁺, and Mg 2 ⁺). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, transient photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations are employed to unravel the evolution of electronic structures with respect to the alloying degree and link them to the spectral signatures and photostability. Counterintuitively, although the HEP NCs exhibit lateral sizes smaller than the Bohr diameter of CsPbBr 3 NCs (∼7 nm), HEA reduces the band dispersion and broadens the conduction band, thereby vanishing the excitonic feature by forming near band-edge shallow states. We show that these HEA-induced shallow states foster rapid radiative recombination and improve photostability, accompanied by a significantly reduced lead content by up to 70%. These findings pioneer the understanding of the correlation between HEA-induced electronic effect and photophysical properties, highlighting the versatility of HEA for band structure engineering and stabilization of metal halide perovskites NCs.},

  abstract     = {The topological nanopores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) show promise as spatially confined nanoreactors for solar CO 2 photoconversion. However, simultaneously increasing the electron density, improving the electron transfer, CO 2 capture, and catalytic efficiency within nanopores remains a challenge for optimizing the performance of such nanoreactors. Here, micro- and mesoporous triazine-COFs were in situ grown on amino-modified BiVO 4 nanosheets (BVO), respectively, obtaining two-dimensional heterojunctions. A highly active ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][NTf 2 ]) was subsequently confined within COF nanopores. Adopting IL-confined COF mesopore-nanoreactors, the best nanocomposite enables a 38-fold photoactivity enhancement compared to BVO and 100% selectivity towards CO and CH 4 in pure water under UV-vis light irradiation, resulting in the record apparent quantum yield of 12.7% in visible region. Such performance is due to increased electron density inside mesopores via Z-scheme charge separation between BVO and COF, and the nanoconfinement effects of mesopores for IL, leading to i) facilitated directed electron transfer from COF to IL via multi-hydrogen bonds between the triazine acceptors and [EMIM] + cations, ii) promoted CO 2 capture by redistribution of IL ions, and iii) easy activation of CO 2 molecules owing to shortened distance to adjacent [EMIM] + cations as catalytic sites and reduced relative orientation angle.},

  abstract     = {Chemical recycling to monomer (CRM) is the most attractive method for achieving the closed-loop usage of polymers, in which polymers are recycled back to their starting monomers and then used to produce new polymers without loss of the virgin material properties. However, during the CRM process, the depolymerized products are usually accompanied by the formation of byproducts (e.g., cyclic oligomers) in addition to monomers. Therefore, the directional depolymerization to monomer through catalyst design is significant. Herein, we report the directional depolymerization of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) to ε-caprolactone (ε-CL) under solution conditions through innovative design of catalyst structure. The (BisSalen)Al catalysts, featuring a confined cavity, demonstrated exceptional performance, enabling highly selective depolymerization of PCL with excellent monomer selectivity (>99%) and yield (93%). The mechanism of selective depolymerization was further investigated in detail through controlled NMR experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work reveals the correlation between catalyst structure and depolymerization selectivity, providing theoretical guidance for the design of directional depolymerization catalysts.},

  abstract     = {Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production. However, constructing an excellent catalyst with advantages of both superior water dissociation ability and easy OH * desorption remains urgently needed and yet challenging for the alkaline HER. Herein, superior water dissociation process, facile OH * desorption, and optimized H adsorption are realized on a strongly coupled heterostructure of Ru@Mn 3 O 4 , in which Ru clusters are decorated on Mn 3 O 4 via Ru─O─Mn bonds. The highly oxophilic Mn 3 O 4 facilitates the water dissociation, whereas the formed heterointerface can efficiently desorb OH * via hydroxyl spillover effect and optimize H adsorption. Consequently, the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 presents remarkable HER performance with a low overpotential of 17 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and Tafel slope of 30 mV dec −1 , surpassing recently reported Ru-based catalysts and commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the mass activity (MA) and turnover frequency (TOF) of the Ru@Mn 3 O 4 increase about 11- and 8-fold, respectively, compared to Pt/C at 100 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This study provides a new strategy for designing high-performance HER catalysts and enhancing the catalytic performance through hydroxyl spillover effect and sheds a light on understanding the HER mechanism.},

Genetic manipulation of the lipid metabolic network or supplementation of a high-fat diet/oleic acid (OA) are the traditional routes for voluntarily triggering LD formation in cells and animals to study the role of LDs in disease biology. We developed a new screening platform for identifying small molecule-based LD inducers, which identified linoleic acid (LOA, diunsaturated fatty acid) as a better tool than OA (monounsaturated fatty acid) in promoting LD formation in cells. Subsequent screening and validation discovered a novel heterocyclic compound and respective iron complex for promoting a rapid organization of endogenous lipids into droplets by mimicking desaturase function and modulating oxidative lipid metabolism. Notably, our mass spectral lipidomics analysis presented the overproduction of phosphatidylcholines and small triglycerides (TG), a hallmark of LDs. We uncovered that the abrupt levels of LD formation induced by our molecules promoted a unique cell death mechanism, lysophagy in cancer cells, to prevent their proliferation, movement, and colonization. Collectively, our work introduces new small molecules as powerful tools for reliably promoting LD accumulation in cells, a promising tool for studying the role in health and disease.},

  abstract     = {Natural gas upgrading requires efficient separation of H 2 S from CO 2 , another acidic impurity, to enhance gas utilization efficiency and enable resource recovery from waste streams. While significant advancements have been achieved in separating H 2 S from CH 4 , the selective removal of H 2 S from CO 2 remains a formidable challenge due to their similar physicochemical properties. Herein, we report a breakthrough strategy utilizing reversible nucleophilic addition reaction between carbonyl group and H 2 S, departing from conventional acid-base interaction-based liquid-phase capture processes. Through comprehensive characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, we confirmed the formation of nucleophilic addition products between the designed carbonyl-functionalized ionic liquids (ILs) and H 2 S. Dispersion-corrected DFT calculations revealed that the nucleophilic addition products facilitate secondary H 2 S capture through two distinct approaches: 1) conformational matching and 2) dissociation of H 2 S into [HS]⁻ species. The unique cascade H 2 S sorption mechanism demonstrates exceptional affinity for H 2 S, endowing the [6ca]-derived ILs with unprecedented high H 2 S capacities and record-breaking H 2 S/CO 2 selectivities (67–89 at 1.0 bar and 229–319 at 0.1 bar), surpassing previously reported values. Combined with energy-efficient regeneration cycles, these findings establish a new paradigm for H 2 S/CO 2 separation with significant potential for natural gas valorization.},

Additionally, there is a lack of visualization techniques to track conformational and functional transitions in polymers. Here, we designed and synthesized a novel tetraphenylethylene (TPE)-decorated poly(L-cysteine) derivative. Utilizing thioether oxidation as the driving force and strong aromatic-aromatic interactions between TPE molecules as stabilizing mechanism, we reported for the first time a conformational transition from β-sheet to β-turn in polymers. This transition not only significantly enhances fluorescence intensity but also induces chirality and circularly polarized light (CPL) of TPE, providing a new dual-modal approach to real-time monitoring of conformational changes of polymer chains. Furthermore, the conformational transition can trigger specific drug release, with the release process visualized and quantitatively analyzed through fluorescent colors. Such conformation-mediated structural and functional transformations hold significant potential for specific drug delivery and theragnosis of diseases such as cancer.},

Here, we report a facile yet effective biomineralization strategy to construct nanovaccine (OVA-ATV@MnO₂) that co-delivers ovalbumin (OVA) and atorvastatin (ATV) within MnO₂ matrix. The ATV-mediated nanovaccine reprograms endosomal trafficking by inhibiting the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thereby delaying endosomal maturation and preventing antigen diversion to degradative lysosomes. This intervention significantly enhances antigen preservation and MHC-I presentation in DCs. Simultaneously, the MnO₂ framework not only stabilizes the vaccine nanostructure but also releases Mn 2 ⁺ ions as an adjuvant to potently activate the cGAS-STING pathway, amplifying DC maturation and antitumor T-cell priming. In vivo studies demonstrate that the nanovaccine induces robust tumor regression, suppresses metastasis, and establishes durable prophylactic immunity.

More intriguingly, the glycoconjugated triplex metallohelice [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) can enantioselectively stabilize Sox2G4. Sox2G4 stabilization induced by [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) rather than Λ-f results in inhibition of Sox2 expression both in mRNA and protein levels in breast CSCs and decreases the cell viability and stemness of breast CSCs. These results indicate that [Fe 2 L Δ-f 3 ] 4+ (Δ-f) has the enantioselectivity even in living cells. In vivo studies further demonstrate that Δ-f can reduce tumor initiation of breast CSCs.

Upon admixture with Bu 4 N – BBcat , 31 P NMR chemical shift of O═PEt 3 significantly lower-shifted, implying the strong Lewis acidity of BBcat despite being an anion. In an Ir complex supported by a bidentate phosphine ligand, BBcat resides in the second coordination sphere as a noncoordinating counteranion. Ir/PHOX-BBcat exhibited an 8.2-fold higher reaction rate than Ir/PHOX-BArF consisting of the non-coordinating anion in the hydrogen isotope exchange of acetophenone derivatives bearing additional Lewis-basic functionalities. The acceleration effect depends on the steric hindrance and basicity of the additional Lewis-basic sites, located at remote positions to the C─H bond to be deuterated. These results clearly indicate that the interaction of BBcat with the Lewis-basic sites plays a crucial role, facilitating cooperative catalysis of the cationic transition-metal center and the counteranion.},

  abstract     = {Protein-based nanocarriers bear highly desirable properties such as biodegradability and the ability to facilitate passage through biological barriers such as the blood–brain-barrier. Using modular protein engineering, we develop a strategy for iteratively improving the delivery efficacy of hydrophobic small molecules for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). By increasing the multiplicity m of the coiled-coil and RGD peptide targeting regions from 1 to 2, we can increase both the hydrodynamic micellar size and drug loading capacity of the targeted multidomain protein assembly (TMPA) relative to its predecessor thermoresponsive assembled protein (TRAP). An upper limit of m is likely determined by steric interactions. TMPA shows a 1.7-fold increase in doxorubicin (Dox) encapsulation compared to TRAP and demonstrates a 1.3-fold improvement in uptake by U87 human GBM cells. Near-infrared (NIR) dye-labelled TMPA (NIR-TMPA) is intravenously administered to mice orthotopically implanted with GBM cells and to control mice. Pharmacokinetic analysis using a 2-compartment pharmacokinetic model reveals a significantly prolonged distribution-phase (short-phase) half-life in tumor-bearing mice compared to control, while the elimination-phase (slow-phase) half-life remains comparable between groups. This suggests altered early-phase kinetics likely due to tumor-associated sequestration or retention. The resulting increased area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in tumor-bearing mice supports enhanced accumulation or slower clearance. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging of organs and 3D reconstructions of whole mouse heads further corroboratesa preferential localization of NIR-TMPA in tumor regions. These findings highlight the potential of TMPA and its future derivatives for targeted GBM therapy.},

  abstract     = {Engineered cell-based therapy is an emerging approach for treating intractable diseases, in which the remote control of cellular behavior necessitates robust physical input-sensing-response systems. Nanomaterials represent promising tools to enable wireless remote control of cells. To achieve this, the precise anchoring of nanomaterials to target cells is crucial for nanomaterial-engineered cells to prevent undesired effects such as endocytosis and diffusion. Herein, we describe a general cell engineering strategy using nanomaterials to achieve remote-controlled and sustained insulin release from the engineered pancreatic β cells. The prepared nanocomposite, termed TCN, is composed of defect-rich titanium oxide quantum dots with ultrasound-electric conversion effect and fibrous carbon substrate. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the TCN enables cell surface engineering through carbon substrate adsorption onto pancreatic β cells without chemical modification, while the TiO x quantum dots of TCN enable effective ultrasound-responsive electrical stimulation to activate insulin release from β cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the subcutaneous implantation of TCN-engineered β cell complexes in type 1 and type 2 diabetic mice enables the restoration of normoglycemia by ultrasound stimulation, establishing a nanomaterials-enabled controlled cell therapy paradigm for diabetes.},

  abstract     = {Ultrasensitive point-of-care detection is urgently required for viruses with high infectivity and lethality rates. In this study, we developed a direct detection platform, a peptide–gold nanocluster-assembled binder (PEGNAB), in which antigen-binding polymeric peptides are modified on a single gold nanocluster. This innovative platform has been applied to detect the influenza A virus (IAV), and it exhibits a high affinity for its spike protein, hemagglutinin, owing to its multisite binding mechanism. Approximately 500–800 PEGNAB particles were bound per virion, enabling individual virus detection through signal amplification. The linear detection range for IAV was 1–100 copies per well. A PEGNAB-based IAV antigen assay kit and paper strip were developed, offering simple operation, cost-effectiveness, and ultra-high sensitivity. In a double-blind trial involving 130 throat swabs (80 positive and 50 negative specimens), the PEGNAB kit achieved 98.8% sensitivity and 96% specificity, and the PEGNAB strip achieved 97.5% sensitivity and 96% specificity, as validated against quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrate that different PEGNAB-based target binding modes can be readily adapted to various pathogens by altering the peptide sequence.},

In this study, DASCs of atomically dispersed platinum and palladium on nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages (Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC) are successfully synthesized using an impregnation–adsorption method. The Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC catalyst has higher mass activity toward ethanol and methanol oxidation than commercial Pt/C and Pd/C. In contrast, Pt or Pd single-atom catalysts on nitrogen-doped carbon nanocages are virtually inert. Ethanol and methanol on Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC are electro-oxidized to acetate ion and CO 2 as the final product, respectively. Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC exhibits long-term stability toward ethanol and methanol oxidation due to the absence of the CO intermediate. Ab initio simulations show that Pt 1 Pd 1 /NCNC optimizes the ethanol oxidation pathway thanks to a lower energy barrier and onset potential than individual single Pt or Pd atom catalysts on NCNC. This study opens a new path to developing advanced DASCs for alcohol oxidation.},

While significant progress has been made in the catalytic enantioselective hydroboration of simple dienes, the development of regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of more challenging substrates such as heteroatom-substituted or trisubstituted dienes remains limited. Here, we disclose a cobalt-catalyzed regiodivergent and enantioselective hydroboration of dienol ethers using a commercially available Co(acac) 2 catalyst and chiral ligands. The reaction exhibits good functional group compatibility and broad substrate scope, selectively affording 1,2-, 4,1-, 1,4-, and 4,3-hydroboration products in good yields and high regio- and enantioselectivities (up to >99%). Mechanistic studies, including deuterium-labeling, kinetic, and UV–vis experiments, suggest the involvement of Co–H species as active catalysts in the reactions. The powerful conversion capabilities of the products are demonstrated by various downstream transformations and the efficient preparation and late-stage elaboration of bioactive compounds.},

  abstract     = {The periphery surrounding oxide-supported metal nanoparticles plays a crucial role in many catalytic reactions that exhibit strong metal-oxide promotional effects. Engineering this catalytically active periphery, where kinetically relevant surface intermediates are efficiently turned over, offers a pathway to optimized performance, yet it remains challenging due to the need for precise control over nanospatial catalyst features. Herein, we address this subject for the relevant case of methanol synthesis by CO 2 hydrogenation on Cu/ZrO 2 catalysts. The methanol synthesis rate reaches a maximum at a surface-to-surface Cu interparticle distance of ca. 15 nm. Operando modulation–excitation diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy reveals that this optimal spacing maximizes the fraction of surface-bound HCOO* intermediates, stabilized on coordinatively unsaturated Zr(IV) Lewis acid sites on the ZrO 2 support, which are dynamically involved in catalysis. This particle spacing represents a shift in the reaction's kinetic control regime and the apparent activation energy for methanol synthesis. Engineering Cu interparticle spacing to the optimal value results in exceptionally high metal-specific methanol formation rates under industrially relevant reaction conditions. More broadly, our findings highlight that, beyond metal particle size, interparticle spacing is a key design parameter for catalyst systems featuring functional metal-oxide interfaces.},

This was used as a model reaction to investigate the mechanism of consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (ConPET) in our previously reported asymmetric [3+2] photocycloaddition. They proposed a new electron transfer pathway in which the electron from the excited state of the radical anion 4DPAPN* •− solvated in acetonitrile. This article replies to their Correspondence, including: the experimental and theoretical analysis on the driving force of electron transfer and a series of new experiments conducted with purer reagents under more stringent conditions, which suggest that the process of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) followed by ConPET cannot be excluded, as proposed in our previous publication. Yet, Ceroni et al.’s efforts to study organic photochemical reactions using time-resolved spectroscopy remain worthwhile, and their proposed mechanism also led us to consider other possible pathways for the reaction. This article concludes with a series of constructive suggestions for further studying the ConPET mechanism using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy and other techniques.},

  abstract     = {The bimetallic Co(I)/Co(–I) complex [Co(CO) 2 (κ 3 - P , N , P -PN H P)][Co(CO) 4 ] ( 1 ) has shown excellent activities in the methanolysis of hydrosilanes, surpassing the related bimetallic Co(I)/Co(–I) complex [Co(CO)(PMe 2 Ph)(κ 3 - P , N , P -PN H P)][Co(CO) 4 ] ( 2 ), the Co(II) complex [Co(Cl) 2 (κ 3 - P , N , P -PN H P)] ( 3 ), and the Co(I) complex [Co(CO) 2 (κ 3 - P , N , P -PN H P)]Cl ( 4 ). A comprehensive DFT study of the plausible reaction mechanisms indicates that the enhanced activity of 1 can be attributed to the presence of the [Co(CO) 4 ] – anion, which enables a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) mechanism that provides a low energy pathway for the heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond. The reaction mechanism entails the coordination of the hydrosilane to the Co(I) center upon decoordination of the amine functionality of the PN H P ligand, followed by heterolytic splitting of the Si─H bond with the participation of the Co(I) and Co(–I) centers. Then, the PhSiH 2 group at the Co(–I) center is transferred to the oxygen atom of a methanol molecule, which affords the [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + cation, regenerating the [Co(CO) 4 ] – species. [H 2 SiPh(HOMe)] + protonates the hydride at the Co(I) center, leading to the formation of H 2 and the corresponding silyl ether.

  abstract     = {Achieving ultrahigh birefringence in UV-transparent materials remains fundamentally constrained by the trade-off between strong optical anisotropy and wide bandgap transparency. Herein, we report a dual-sided multidentate coordination (DMC) strategy to construct two butterfly-shaped UV organic–inorganic hybrid crystals—(C 6 H 4 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (PCSF) and (C 10 H 6 NO 2 ) 2 SbF (QCSF)—in which planar π-conjugated bidentate ligands symmetrically chelate stereochemically active lone pair (SCALP) Sb 3+ centers. This coordination architecture enforces coplanar alignment of optical functional units and promotes dense π–π stacking, thereby significantly enhancing macroscopic birefringence. Notably, QCSF achieves a record-high birefringence of Δ n = 0.87 at 546 nm, surpassing all previously reported lone-pair-containing halide crystals with UV transparency. The exceptional optical performance is attributed to the unique [SbN 2 O 2 F] coordination geometry, near-planar molecular configuration, and extended π-electron delocalization. First-principles calculations reveal that the observed anisotropy stems from synergistic orbital coupling between the Sb centers and the π-conjugated organic ligands. This work introduces a broadly applicable molecular design paradigm for next-generation birefringent crystals that simultaneously offer high optical anisotropy and UV transparency.},

Here, we report sucrose-derived carbon molecular sieves (CMSs) with precisely tailored sub-Ångstrom slit pores that enable diffusion-gated kinetic sieving for the challenging separation of alkenes from alkanes. The optimized materials, C-Suc-650 and C-Suc-750, set new industry-leading standards for the kinetic separation of C 3 H 6 /C 3 H 8 and C 2 H 4 /C 2 H 6 , respectively. Through a combination of breakthrough experiments, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) simulations, and molecular dynamics (MD) modeling, we demonstrate that these sieves consistently achieve >99.9% alkene purity, with outstanding selectivity, rapid uptake kinetics, and remarkably low energy consumption. Mechanistic studies reveal that slit pore architecture uniquely enhances alkene diffusion while hindering alkane movement, establishing a clear design principle for next-generation, energy-efficient gas separations.

Operating in the ground state, these catalysts are conspicuous in their ability to simultaneously regulate reactivity and translate chiral information, often with broad substrate tolerance: this technology continues to expedite chemical space exploration. In stark contrast to the specificity of many enzymatic transformations, this promiscuity affords remarkable latitude for creative endeavour in synthesis. Given the transformative impact that stereoselective photocatalysis has had over the last decade, identifying privileged chiral catalysts that permit reactivity and enantioselectivity to be regulated in excited-state scenarios has emerged as an attractive but challenging frontier. Providing solutions to address this paradox will require the reactivity/selectivity divide to be reconciled through the validation of chiral scaffolds that effectively operate in non-ground state environments. Inspired by the venerable treatment by Yoon and Jacobsen entitled “ Privileged chiral catalysts ” ( Science 2003 , 299 , 1691–1693), this mini-review is intended to survey the conception and evolution of privileged chiral photocatalyst scaffolds, and offer a perspective on emerging contenders.},

However, the slower development of n-type materials compared to p-type ones limits their potential in advanced technological applications. In this study, we design and synthesize a novel thiophene-based donor building block, 2,3-di(thiophen-2-yl)fumaronitrile ( DTFMCN ), for D–A conjugated n-type PMIECs through donor engineering strategies. DTFMCN can be easily synthesized from commercially available starting materials via a simple one-step process. The DTFMCN-based D–A conjugated polymers, S-DTFMCN and B-DTFMCN , exhibit extremely low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and show typical n-type characteristics. OECT devices based on these polymers demonstrate ultra-low threshold voltages (6 and 40 mV) and high µ C* values of 13.49 and 13.57 F cm −1 V −1 s −1 , respectively. More importantly, these devices exhibit exceptionally high operational stability; the current retention rate after 168 minutes of operation is 96%, making them one of the most stable n-type OECT devices reported to date.

Here, a human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (RL) approach is used to discover polyurethane elastomers that overcome pervasive stress–strain property tradeoffs. Starting with a diverse training set of 92 formulations, a coupled multi-component reward system was identified that guides RL agents toward materials with both high strength and extensibility. Through three rounds of iterative optimization combining RL predictions with human chemical intuition, we identified elastomers with more than double the average toughness compared to the initial training set. The final exploitation round, aided by solubility prescreening, predicted twelve materials exhibiting both high strength (>10 MPa) and high strain at break (>200%). Analysis of the high-performing materials revealed structure-property insights, including the benefits of high molar mass urethane oligomers, a high density of urethane functional groups, and incorporation of rigid low molecular weight diols and unsymmetric diisocyanates. These findings demonstrate that machine-guided, human-augmented design is a powerful strategy for accelerating polymer discovery in applications where data is scarce and expensive to acquire, with broad applicability to multi-objective materials optimization.},

While combinations of Ni pre-catalysts and Al additives are known for site-selective C─H functionalization, detailed studies of such systems are rare. Combining [Ni(COD) 2 ] and [(BDI)AlH 2 ] ( 1 ; BDI = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl-β-methyldiketiminate) results in facile formation of a Ni–Al heterometallic complex [( η 4 -COD)Ni{( μ -H) 2 Al(BDI)}] ( 2 ; COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene). Once generated, this species can effect the C(sp 2 )─H activation of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) or pyridine with concomitant H 2 evolution, a process that is accelerated through addition of PCy 3 . The mechanism was studied through kinetics, kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), isotope labeling studies, and modeling. The reaction is 1 st order in PCy 3 and proceeds with a KIE of 0.9–1.1. Support is provided for a pathway involving the synergistic action of both metals, promoted by reversible coordination of the phosphine. The data suggest that both C─H oxidative addition and H 2 reductive elimination steps in this system are readily accessible and are not rate limiting. This finding has implications for future catalyst design using combinations of Ni and Al metals and suggests that control of ligand exchange steps may be the most important consideration in determining the rate of reaction.},

However, effectively arranging optical chromophores to achieve strong optical nonlinearity remains challenging. In this study, we explore the structural chemistry of 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chain-based oxyfluoroniobates and establish a molecular geometric framework to quantify key structural fingerprint factors , namely, the ∠(O─Nb─O′) bond angle, χ [F,Nb,Nb′,F′] torsion angle, chain alignment, and distortion of [NbO 2 F 4 ] nodes. Theoretical calculations confirm that these factors critically influence second harmonic generation (SHG) activity. By integrating π-conjugated biuret (C 2 H 5 N 3 O 2 ) molecules with optimally aligned 1 [NbOF 4 ] ∞ chains, we synthesized (H 3 O)(Biu) 2 (NbOF 4 ) (Biu = biuret), a crystal exhibiting a record-breaking SHG response, reaching 10.8 times that of KH 2 PO 4 , among transition metal (TM) oxyfluorides. Its moderate birefringence (Δ n = 0.062 @1064 nm) and wide band gap ( E g = 4.50 eV) further support its potential as a high-performance ultraviolet (UV) NLO material.

Here, we systematically investigate how excluded volume effects influence supramolecular polymerizations in organic media. We employ various discotic supramolecular monomers that assemble sequentially into polymers and kinetically-controlled higher-order aggregates (HOAs) only in the presence of macromolecular crowders. The phase diagram of the supramolecular assemblies reveals a strong dependence on the macromolecule concentration, size, and polarity, which can be tuned to control polymerization. Remarkably, at high crowder concentrations, large condensed and aligned assemblies were observed in dried samples, suggesting a transition to phase-separated states. By testing different monomers, macromolecules, and solvents, we establish the general applicability and versatility of macromolecular crowding in guiding supramolecular polymerization. This work provides fundamental insights into assembly processes in crowded environments and opens new avenues for applying macromolecular crowding beyond aqueous systems.},

Extending the device durability is still very challengeable for these emitters. Deuteration of emitters to slow down their degradation and lengthen device lifespan is a promising strategy. However, how to access deuterated high-order MR-TADF emitters remains to be explored. Herein, a synthetic protocol of high-order B/N products is proposed using deuterated starting materials and sequential borylation. Combining with fine-tuning electronic effect through adjusting position of tert -butyl ( t Bu) substituents, we successfully obtained deuterated triboron MR-TADF material ω’-DABNA-D that delivers precisely tuned pure-green emission with close-to-unity quantum yield and rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). The resulting binary OLED approaches the BT.2020 standard with CIE coordinates of (0.16, 0.75) and demonstrates impressive external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 34.6% at maximum and 30.7% at 1000 cd m −2 . Additionally, an Ir(ppy) 3 -sensitized device shows excellent operational stability, with an extrapolated lifetime (LT 80 ) of 6078 h at an initial luminance of 1000 cd m −2 . This study hence offers a promising methodology toward high-performance OLED with long device lifetime.},

Here, we report the first-in-class mitochondria-targeting anion channels derived from a structurally simple tetrabenzylphosphonium framework, in stark contrast to its phenyl-based counterpart, which lacks anion transport activity. Structural and computational analyses underscore the critical role of the methylene (CH 2 ) linkers in the benzyl groups. These CH 2 units reduce positive charge delocalization to enhance σ-hole–anion interactions, while also enabling H-atoms from both the CH 2 linkers and aromatic rings to cooperatively form multiple C─H⋯anion H─bonds. In further conjunction with the rigid benzene rings, they help create sufficient spatial voids to accommodate anion translocation, collectively facilitating and energizing the anion transport process. Among the series studied, those bearing methyl and tert -butyl substituents exhibit the highest transport activity via a channel mechanism, with a conductance value as high as 26.5 ± 0.8 pS. Furthermore, leveraging the cationic nature of the quaternary phosphonium center, this family of anion channels readily achieves targeted mitochondrial localization, demonstrating potent anticancer activity, with IC 50 values ranging from 1.42 to 3.04 µM across three cancer cell lines.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) luminogens, exemplified by tetraphenylethylene (TPE), exhibit enhanced fluorescence in aggregated states and have promising applications in display, photodetectors, fluorescent probes, bioimaging, and biomedicine. This study investigates the influence of varying degrees of deuteration on the photophysical properties of TPE across different aggregation states. Through the synthesis of partially and fully deuterated TPE derivatives (TPE-5d, TPE-10d, and TPE-20d), combined with steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the dual role of deuteration in modulating nonradiative decay pathways. In loosely packed nanoaggregates, increased deuteration enhances photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and extends fluorescence lifetimes by reducing internal conversion rates. Conversely, in tightly packed crystalline states, deuteration leads to decreased PLQY and shortened lifetimes, attributable to the Duschinsky rotation effect (DRE), which enhances inter-mode coupling and internal conversion. Additionally, deuteration significantly prolongs the operational lifetime of blue organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices, doubling the device lifespan in TPE-20d compared to TPE. This work underscores the necessity of evaluating structure–property relationships at the aggregate level, rather than solely at the molecular level, to fully comprehend and optimize AIE phenomena. These findings highlight the potential of isotope engineering in designing durable and efficient AIE luminogens for applications in optoelectronics and bioimaging.},

However, most conventional systems suffered poor thermal stability of chiral configurations and low luminescent dissymmetry factors. Herein, we reported a pair of triptycene-bridged enantiomers with a point chirality and a donor–acceptor architecture. Robust point chirality, originating from quaternary bridgehead-carbons, prevented the common racemization during thermal sublimation. Thanks to the reduced electric transition dipole moment (µ e ) in donor–acceptor architecture, tuned parallel alignment between the further reduced µ e and magnetic transition dipole moment (µ m ) in the exciplex emitter, and the utilized chiral exciplex host for energy transfer to phosphor, the corresponding dissymmetry factors of emitters were sequentially amplified from 3.3 × 10 −4 to 4.5 × 10 −3 , and to 8.1 × 10 −3 . Remarkably, the CP-OLED device simultaneously achieved outstanding electroluminescence performance with a high external quantum efficiency of 31.8% and a large dissymmetry factor of 2.2 × 10 −2 .

Furthermore, in contrast to natural NAD(P)H-dependent C═N bond reductases, this strategy utilizes silanes as reducing agents and is entirely orthogonal to conventional NAD(P)H-dependent cellular functions.

Here, we report a thiacalix[4]arene-protected Cu(I)-alkynide cluster, {NaCu 35 (TC4A) 4 (Ph-C≡C) 20 } ( Cu 35 ), which exhibits remarkable structural plasticity. This metastable cluster can grow into a Cu 36 species via ion substitution or undergo thermal-induced fragmentation to form a smaller Cu 14 cluster. Under thermal etching by Ag + ion, structural reconstruction is triggered, leading to the formation of the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 and Cu 40 Ag 16 clusters. The structural reorganization significantly alters the catalytic outcomes in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Although the monometallic Cu 35 and Cu 14 favor gaseous CH 4 /C 2 H 4 production, the bimetallic Cu 14 Ag 6 demonstrates remarkable selectivity for ethanol synthesis. Notably, Cu 14 Ag 6 achieves an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 49.27% for ethanol production, alongside a high partial current density of −67.94 mA cm −2 . This marks the highest ethanol selectivity reported to date for atomically precise cluster catalysts. Mechanistic investigations reveal that, compared to homometallic Cu⋯Cu dual sites (which typically favor C 2 H 4 ), the unique Ag⋯Cu⋯Cu trimetallic microstructure in Cu 14 Ag 6 is more thermodynamically favorable for asymmetric C─C coupling between *CHO and *OCH 2 , facilitating the formation of the key *CHO−*OCH 2 intermediate, which drives the ethanol-selective pathway.},

However, conventional regulation strategies based on the Hammer–Nørskov d-band model often change the hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and hydroxyl binding energy (OHBE) in a synchronized manner. Herein, we find that a catalyst consisting of fivefold-twinned ultrasmall Ni nanoparticles could tune HBE and OHBE individually via the strain effect. Experimental and theoretical calculations suggest that tensile strain in proximity to the twin boundary (TB) significantly enhances OHBE, allows for adjustable HBE due to unique geometric effects, and greatly reduces HBE at specific sites, enabling an unprecedented HOR activity. The catalyst has a high j k,m value of 106.6 mA mg Ni −1 , which is 24.2 times greater than that of Ni/C. The hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell (HEMFC) with fivefold-twinned Ni nanoparticles anode delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 805 mW cm −2 with H 2 /O 2 gas feed, which is the highest among Ni-based electrocatalysts reported thus far.

Traditional heavy-metal-based and crystalline systems are often toxic and environmentally sensitive, while strategies involving host–guest doping and encapsulation frequently suffer from phase separation and limited controllability—ultimately resulting in poor repeatability and restricted applications. Here, we developed a novel polyphenol-mediated molecular splicing and ring-locking strategy to incorporate benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BZT) into polyphenol molecules, yielding a range of eco-friendly and processable amorphous single-component systems with a lifetime of up to 124 ms. Experimental and calculational analyses confirm that phosphorescence arises from synergistic interactions between polyphenol and BZT. Furthermore, phosphorescent nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized via nanoprecipitation in tetrahydrofuran with 30% water content. These well-dispersed, metal-free NPs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, facilitating time-resolved luminescence imaging with minimal background fluorescence interference both in vitro and in vivo.

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are traditionally recognized as key regulators of the transcriptional response to low oxygen (hypoxia). Recent research expanded their functions, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets. Despite these advances, there is still a need for chemical biology tools that offer precise spatiotemporal control within the HIF network and output. Here, we introduce an optochemical approach that enables significant differences in expression of HIF1α-target genes depending on the photostationary state (PSS). Our photoswitchable stapled peptide PS B -BCB-04 stabilized HIF1α under normoxic conditions by targeting EloBC ( k i =  7.9 ± 1.3 nM) and preventing VHL-mediated degradation. Visible light allowed reversible regulation of peptide conformation, which entailed a sevenfold difference in its EloBC-binding capacity. In a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that inhibition of HIF1α degradation enabled isomer-specific expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) in prostate cancer cells. Our results validated the potential of photopharmacological stabilization of HIF1α and provided a new toolbox for on-demand photocontrol over the HIF-signaling pathway as well as VHL-mediated degradation.},

  abstract     = {The electroreduction of CO 2 under acidic conditions presents both scientific significance and technical challenges. Herein, we developed a post-synthetic modification strategy to anchor unexpected tetrahedral In(III) ions onto Zr-oxo clusters of a single-layer zirconium metal-organic framework (denoted as Zr-MOF-In ). Operating under harsh acidic conditions (pH = 1.67) at −1.8 V versus RHE, the Zr-MOF-In catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with 95.7% Faradaic efficiency for formic acid production and a current density of 213.3 mA cm −2 . The system maintains operational stability over 20 h without notable activity decay. Remarkably, when integrated into a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with solid-state electrolyte at 4 V full-cell voltage, Zr-MOF-In continuously generates pure formic acid solution (505.5 mmol L −1 , 100% purity) free of electrolyte contamination, achieving a concentration 1.5-fold higher than the current state-of-the-art. Mechanistic investigations identify dual enhancement mechanisms: i) the low-coordinated In(III) single-atom sites facilitate dual *HCOO intermediate binding, enhancing reaction kinetics beyond conventional single-intermediate adsorption on high-coordination metal centers; and ii) the single-layer MOF configuration optimizes active site exposure, synergistically maximizing catalytic efficiency.},

Although Li 2 MnO 3 (LMO) has been conventionally identified as the oxygen redox-active component in LRMOs, this layered material shows neither bulk redox activity nor reversible anion redox behavior in the absence of other transition metals (e.g., Ni and Co). Herein, we report a structural-engineered lithium manganese oxide with spinel-layered heterostructures (designated as LMO-SH), which exhibits reversible oxygen redox activities between lattice oxygen (O 2− ) and molecular oxygen (O 2 ) – the first documented instance of such redox behavior in a manganese-based material. Through combining experimental characterization and theoretical modeling, we establish that the interfacial architecture between the spinel and layered phases facilitates the Li + diffusion kinetics while simultaneously activating bulk oxygen redox processes. This mechanistic understanding not only advances fundamental knowledge of redox chemistry in LMO-based materials but also establishes new design principles for developing high-capacity cathodes through strategic phase engineering.},

  abstract     = {The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key bottleneck in clean energy conversion due to sluggish kinetics and high overpotentials. Transition metal single-atom catalysts offer great promise for OER optimization thanks to their high atomic efficiency and tunable electronic structures. However, intrinsic scaling relationships between adsorbed intermediates limit catalytic performance and complicate discovery through conventional machine learning (ML). To overcome this, we combined density functional theory (DFT) with a progressive learning strategy within an active learning framework. By first predicting adsorption energies as auxiliary features, our ML model achieved improved sensitivity to rare, high-activity candidates. High-throughput screening of 261 transition metal single-atom-doped metal oxides (M SA -MO x ) identified nine top-performing catalysts (theoretical overpotential < 0.5 V), including Mn SA -RuO 2 and Fe SA -TiO 2 (theoretical overpotential < 0.3 V). Data mining revealed key theoretical descriptors governing OER activity, while electronic structure analysis pinpointed intermediate binding strength as the key performance driver. Further constant-potential DFT calculations and experimental evaluation of Mn SA -RuO 2 confirmed its low overpotential and excellent durability under acidic conditions. This integrated framework, which connects theoretical modeling, ML prediction, and experimental validation, accelerates the discovery of efficient OER catalysts and provides mechanistic insights for the rational design of materials in sustainable energy technologies.},

  abstract     = {Intrinsic structural instability and sluggish reaction kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface are two critical concerns that block the application of MnO 2 cathode in high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries. This work proposes a theoretical screening principle to select the compatible guest cation for MnO 2 host, not only to strengthen the structure but also customize high-efficiency cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI). As identified, Sr 2+ is selected as the suitable intercalation ion that enable in situ forming the SrSO 4 CEI after partial release upon charge process. Moreover, density functional theory calculation and multiple characterization research indicate that such SrSO 4 interphase shows an electronic insulation to stabilize the interfacial pH, inhibit the Mn dissolution, and promote the efficient de-solvation of hydrated zinc ions. Benefited from the self-optimizing cathode/electrolyte interface chemistry, the 2.5% Sr-MnO 2 one exhibits higher specific capacity (304.1 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), better rate capability (115 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), as well as higher capacity retention of 87.9% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g −1 , when compared with pure δ-MnO 2 electrode.

The CaADH enzyme is utilized here for synthesizing 20 potential aryl isoserine side chains for the Taxotere family of tubulin-binding chemotherapeutics. The approach involves dynamic reductive kinetic resolution (DYRKR) upon the corresponding α-chloro-β-keto esters, showing high D- syn stereoselectivity, including those leading to the clinically relevant milataxel (Ar = 2-furyl) and simotaxel (Ar = 2-thienyl) side chains. Furthermore, various cross-coupling chemistries performed on the p -bromophenyl isoserine side chain significantly enhance the structural diversity of the taxoid side chain library obtained (16 additional taxoid side chains). The CaADH structure is notable: (i) the nicotinamide cofactor is bound in an anti- conformation, with the amide carbonyl occupying the ketone binding pocket, and (ii) a flexible loop near the active site likely contributes to the remarkable substrate promiscuity observed in CaADH. We present our perspective on the dynamic nature of the CaADH active site through molecular dynamics simulation, proposing a halogen bonding model as a potential mechanism for the remarkable selectivity for an ( S )-configured C─Cl bond, in addition to the D-facial selectivity, demonstrated across 20 diverse substrates by this remarkable short-chain dehydrogenase enzyme.},

This study demonstrates a Co, Fe bimetallic conjugated metal organic frameworks (CoFe-cMOFs) that enable efficient NO 3 RR via an unconventional [6 + 2] electron-transfer tandem pathway. Unlike the traditional [2 + 6] tandem pathway, the Fe sites predominantly reduce NO 3− to *NH 2 OH intermediate, which subsequently spills over onto the Co sites for further protonation. This unconventional tandem pathway effectively avoids the release of NO 2− and guarantees selective NH 3 production. The CoFe-cMOFs achieve 94.3% NH 3 -producing Faradaic efficiency with a yield rate of 14.1 mg h −1 cm −2 in neutral electrolyte.

These two COFs not only possess good crystallinity but also exhibit excellent physicochemical stability and contain abundant redox-active sites, which endows them with charming advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Remarkably, when employed as an anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), TAPT-COF delivered a reversible capacity of 517 mAh g −1 at 0.05 A g −1 while maintaining outstanding cycling stability with minimal capacity degradation (<0.035% per cycle) over 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g −1 . This superior performance stems from synergistic contributions of abundant redox-active centers (C═O and C═N groups), which enable efficient Na + storage through multielectron redox mechanisms.

  abstract     = {A new empirical electrophilicity reactivity parameter, E RB , was developed based on the rotational barriers of a series of N -phenylimide molecular rotors containing various electrophilic groups. In the bond rotation transition state, these electrophilic groups form close contact with an electronegative C═O oxygen. Thus, strong electrophilic groups significantly lowered the rotational barrier. As a result, the rotational barriers were inversely correlated with the strengths of the electrophiles. The rotational barriers were measured by dynamic NMR (EXSY), enabling the quantification across a wide range of types of electrophiles. Computational analysis confirmed that the observed variations arose from intramolecular interactions in the transition state, where the C═O oxygen served as a probe of both the electrophilic group's electrostatic potential and steric accessibility. By simultaneously capturing attractive and repulsive transition state interactions, E RB provides an effective means of predicting electrophilicity and reactivity trends across a broad range of electrophiles and reaction types. The utility of E RB was initially validated using a series of rotors containing Michael addition electrophiles, followed by broader application to a diverse array of reactions involving sp 3 and sp 2 electrophiles, including S N 2, S N Ar, Pd-oxidative addition, and Sonogashira reactions.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state batteries based on abundant elements, such as calcium, offer a promising route to safer, cheaper, and more sustainable energy storage. Here, we report a series of fast Ca 2+ -conducting compounds of methylamine calcium tetrahydridoborates, Ca(BH 4 ) 2 · x CH 3 NH 2 (0 < x < 4.9) and related nanocomposites stabilized by inert MgO nanoparticles. Three new crystal structures are identified: a three-dimensional network of octahedrally coordinated Ca 2+ complexes for x = 1, a molecular structure of neutral complexes for x = 4, and a structure of cationic complexes for x = 6. The thermal stability generally decreases with increasing CH 3 NH 2 content, and samples with x > 2 slowly release CH 3 NH 2 in “open” atmosphere at room temperature, but are stabilized in “closed” environments, e.g. capillaries. The ionic conductivity increases with CH 3 NH 2 content and correlates with increased void space and structural flexibility, reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 5.0·10 −5 S cm −1 at 60 °C for x = 4. Moreover, the effect of nanocomposite formation provides mechanical stability and a doubling of the ionic conductivity for Ca(BH 4 ) 2 ·4CH 3 NH 2 − MgO (50 wt%), reaching σ (Ca 2+ ) = 1.3·10 −4 S cm −1 at 60 °C. These findings demonstrate how local structure and nanoscale interfacial effects govern calcium transport, offering new design principles for functional calcium solid electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {The coexistent nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) in flue gas pose inherent challenges for simultaneous removal due to their disparate reactivities. Conventional sequential treatments for their simultaneous removal face major issues of catalyst deactivation and byproduct generation. Here, we develop a subtle strategy using light-induced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) catalysis with Fe(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-Feᴵᴵ) to achieve redox-coupled conversion of NO and SO 2 mixtures. LMCT excitation in EDTA-Fe II induces directional charge separation under irradiation, routing photogenerated electrons (e⁻) to Feᴵᴵ for driving selective NO-to-N 2 conversion (selectivity: 99.89%), while photogenerated holes (h + ) oxidize SO 2 to SO 4 2 ⁻ (selectivity: 96.34%). This spatial segregation of redox pathways suppresses N 2 O generation, enabling continuous operation with 90.3% NO and nearly 100% SO 2 removal efficiency. Mechanism studies reveal the LMCT-enhanced charge transfer from carboxyl/amino groups to Fe centers, while in situ EPR confirms the •SO 3 2 ⁻ radical-mediated h + scavenging that accelerates charge separation and utilization. This work establishes Fe-LMCT catalysis as a sustainable platform for gas-phase pollutants remediation, achieving unprecedented selectivity through precise redox pathway control.},

Among them, phosphatidic acids (PA) exist as many distinct species depending on acyl chain composition, each one potentially displaying unique signaling function. Although the signaling functions of PA have already been demonstrated in multiple cellular processes, the specific roles of individual PA species remain obscure due to a lack of appropriate tools. Indeed, current synthetic PA analogues fail to preserve all the functions of natural PA. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a novel synthetic approach to produce PA analogues without compromising structural integrity of acyl chains. Moreover, addition of a clickable moiety allowed flexible grafting of different molecules to PA analogues for various biological applications. Hence, this innovation also provides powerful tools to investigate specific biological activities of individual PA species, with potential applications in unraveling complex GPL-mediated signaling pathways.},

  abstract     = {The recent discovery of highly conductive, solution-processable, n-doped poly(benzodifurandione) (n-PBDF) has significantly pushed the boundaries of organic electronics. However, to maximize its practical impact, an efficient, scalable and cost-effective synthetic method is essential. Initially, n-PBDF was synthesized via duroquinone-mediated or copper-catalyzed polymerizations, but these methods required prolonged dialysis, limiting their scalability. Our recent SeO 2 -catalyzed polymerization improved efficiency but still necessitated centrifugation and filtration to remove solid selenium byproducts. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient molybdenum trioxide (MoO 3 )-catalyzed polymerization of n-PBDF. Remarkably, MoO 3 at parts-per-million (ppm) concentrations achieves near-quantitative monomer conversion (>99% by NMR), eliminating the need for purification. Kinetic studies demonstrate that this polymerization follows a chain-growth mechanism, enabling the synthesis of high-quality n-PBDF polymers with controlled particle sizes and block copolymers. Mechanistic investigations reveal that MoO 3 mediates an oxidative pathway involving dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with dimethyl sulfide (DMS) identified as the reduction product. This innovation not only provides a scalable, low-cost route to high-quality n-PBDF but also unlocks new synthetic opportunities, significantly expanding the synthetic toolbox for functional polymers.},

These fungi are distinguished by a distinctive cell wall architecture further reinforced by two virulence-associated layers, melanin and capsule, rendering them insensitive to antifungal agents targeting the cell wall, such as echinocandins. The molecular interplay between these three biomolecular layers remains poorly understood. Here, we employ solid-state NMR spectroscopy to examine intact cells of both wild-type and capsule-deficient strains of C. neoformans , along with melanized cells. High-resolution 13 C and 1 H data revealed five distinct structural forms of α-1,3-glucans that play versatile roles in forming the rigid cell wall scaffold by interacting with chitin microfibrils and chitosan, and in stabilizing the mobile matrix by associating with β-1,6-glucan and a small fraction of β-1,3-glucan. Two primary forms of α-1,3-glucans were distributed throughout the wall, capable of hosting melanin deposition in the inner domain and capsule attachment on the cell surface. These findings offer a paradigm shift in understanding the cryptococcal cell wall and its interaction with two key virulence factors on opposite sides, raising critical biochemical questions that could inform the development of more effective antifungal treatments for cryptococcosis.},

However, their costly synthesis and the vague understanding of their mechanical property hinder extensive progress. Herein, the supramolecular complexation approach is developed for the feasible construction of MGMs with hierarchical structures, while in situ small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is applied to monitor the mechanical deformation of MGMs for microscopic understanding. Amphiphilic oligomers are assembled from the ionic attraction of 1 nm molecular clusters and further pack into ordered hexagonal phases (HEX1) driven by hydrophobic interaction. Interestingly, stretching can induce structural orientation, and thus triggering the transformation of HEX1 to another hexagonal phase (HEX2) with denser packing, accounting for the tensile yield behavior of the MGMs. The supramolecular structure endows hierarchical structure relaxation dynamics, enabling their unique viscoelasticity with a resilient rubbery plateau even at high temperatures. Their flexibility renders the capability to facilely process the MGMs into highly oriented films and coatings with anisotropic properties for potential applications in optical device fabrications.},

Amorphous SSEs, in particular, offer promising advantages due to their grain-boundary-free nature, which facilitates intimate solid-to-solid contact and uniform lithium-ion flux, thereby improving composite electrode performance. Here, we report a class of SSEs based on a nitrogen–chlorine dual-anion framework, formulated as Li 3 x +0.1 ZrN x Cl 4.1 , for high-voltage ASSBs. Unlike widely studied crystalline Li 2 ZrCl 6 with a triclinic structure, increased N 3− substitution drives a structural transition to an amorphous phase (Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 ), which achieves a significant enhancement in Li + conductivity from 0.46 to 3.01 mS cm −1 , alongside improved oxidative stability up to 4.8 V. This dual-anion SSEs exhibits excellent compatibility with high-energy LiNi 0.83 Co 0.06 Mn 0.11 O 2 (NCM83) cathodes. The corresponding full cells deliver a high reversible capacity of 200.1 mAh g −1 at 4.5 V with outstanding capacity retention of 95.1% after 150 cycles at 0.2 C, along with remarkable long-term cycling stability exceeding 3000 cycles at 3 C. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of Li 1.3 ZrN 0.4 Cl 4.1 in conjunction with NCM83 is still preserved under elevated temperatures (50  °C) and higher cut-off voltages (up to 4.8 V). These results highlight the promise of dual-anion amorphous electrolytes, paving the way for the design of next-generation SSEs beyond traditional single-anion systems.},

Here, we present a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of ∼1.8 at 873 K in n -type PbSe doped with MoCl 5 by modulation of the conduction bands, while simultaneously suppressing the phonon transport. Doping MoCl 5 in PbSe induces notable convergence of conduction bands and an increased density of states near the Fermi level, mainly due to the contribution of Mo 4 d orbital hybridized with the Se 4 p -Pb 6 p . This results in an improved Seebeck coefficient, despite maintaining a high n -type charge carrier concentration resulting in an excellent power factor (σS 2 ) of ∼21 µW cm −1 K −2 at 873 K for PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 . When the solid solution limit of the doping exceeds, it forms unique modular nano-heterostructures (5-30 nm) of PbSe-MoSe 2 misfit layered compounds embedded in PbSe matrix. These nano-heterostructures significantly intensify phonon scattering, leading to an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (κ lat ) of 0.20 W m −1 K −1 at ∼725 K in PbSe + 1 mol% MoCl 5 sample.},

Although Zn (100) exhibits faster Zn electroplating/stripping kinetics than Zn (002), its high chemical reactivity results in susceptibility to water-induced side reactions. Herein, a two-pronged electrolyte engineering strategy is proposed to enhance the reversibility of Zn anodes, that is, modulating vertically oriented Zn (100) plating while simultaneously constructing a water-poor electrical double layer (EDL). Mechanistic studies revealed that the difluoro(oxalato)borate (DFOB − ) anions of sodium-difluoro(oxalato)borate (NaDFOB) function as a Zn 2+ trapping agent at the inner Helmholtz layer, displacing active water molecules and inducing the preferential deposition of Zn on the Zn (100) crystal facets, thus effectively inhibiting both side reactions and dendrite growth. Consequently, a symmetrical cell with the ZnSO 4 /NaDFOB electrolyte exhibited a long lifetime of over 950 h under severe conditions of 10 mA cm −2 and 5 mAh cm −2 . Furthermore, a practical Zn||NH 4 V 4 O 10 pouch cell could achieves a high capacity of 156 mAh at industrial-level mass loading of 16.6 mg cm −2 .

Herein, we report a robust metal-organic framework (Cu-MFU-4l) featuring open Cu(I) sites of low polarizability for benchmark N 2 /CH 4 separation. The presence of open Cu(I) sites in the framework was confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ CO-adsorbed infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Gas sorption isotherms revealed that Cu-MFU-4l exhibited a significant difference between N 2 and CH 4 uptakes, resulting in a high N 2 /CH 4 uptake ratio (1.94) and kinetic selectivity (2.20), of which the N 2 /CH 4 uptake ratio was the highest among all MOFs reported to date. Breakthrough experiments confirmed Cu-MFU-4l as the best porous adsorbent hitherto reported for binary N 2 /CH 4 separation, based on the record-high breakthrough selectivity (2.43) and CH 4 productivity (0.47 mmol g −1 ). High-purity CH 4 (99.99%) could also be obtained from ternary and even six-component CH 4 mixtures by a one-step separation process.

  abstract     = {Constructing multi-atomic interfaces architectures is promising for electrocatalytic CO 2 conversion, yet their synthesis and stability under industrial current densities remain challenging. Herein, multi-atomic Bi interfaces (Bi 0 /Bi δ+ −O moiety) were precisely engineered by embedding atomically dispersed Bi centers, encompassing Bi single atoms and Bi atomic clusters into the substrate of porous Bi 2 O 3-x nanosheets. The composite showcases outstanding CO 2 conversion performance across a wide pH range, attaining remarkable Faradaic efficiency for formate (FE formate ) of 96.48% (at ultralow potential of −0.5 V versus RHE) and 92.26% in alkaline and neutral electrolytes, along with exceptional long-term stability over 150 h. Depending on the designed CH 3 OH electrooxidation catalyst (CuO x /ZnCo(OH) x ) at the anode to couple with CO 2 conversion, symmetrical/asymmetrical electrolyzers were developed. The approach could obtain high-added value products with FE formate >90% at both electrodes, achieving a production rate of 4980 µmol h −1 cm −2 under industrial current density. Combined in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations unravel that multiple atomic interfaces featuring interfacial atomic sieving effects effectively enhance preferential binding of *H and *CO 2 to form *OCHO, while simultaneously suppressing the undesired recombination of hydrogen species into H 2 , rationalizing the high selectivity. Further intermediacy of concentrated formate precursors for subsequent C–N coupling toward urea synthesis, establishing a pathway for sustainable evolution.},

  abstract     = {Integrating different polymer types into a unified system in a thoughtful manner leverages their complementary advantages, providing a promising strategy for developing high-performance materials. Mechanically interlocked polymers (MIPs), characterized by their unique spatial entanglement, exhibit distinctive performance advantages, yet their potential to expand material properties through rational integration with other polymer architectures presents substantial opportunities for continued investigation. Herein, we report a coherent integration of covalent polymers (CPs) and mechanically interlocked polymers through sequential orthogonal polymerizations, developing a novel synergistic covalently and mechanically interlocked polymer (CMIP) featuring both structural stability and force-induced dynamics. Compared to its structurally similar but noninterlocked control sample, CMIP demonstrates markedly enhanced thermomechanical stability and performance recovery, achieving a 93.4% recovery efficiency at 100% strain after just 5 min of rest, in contrast to 59.7% for the control. This remarkable stability and recovery result from the synergistic interplay between the covalent polymer framework and the interlocked structure, which work in tandem to preserve network integrity and enable rapid host−guest reformation. Notably, despite this significant improvement, CMIP retains a comparable damping capacity (91% versus 87%) and material toughness (14.8 versus 15.1 MJ m −3 ), owing to the efficient energy dissipation mechanisms enabled by host−guest dissociation and subsequent sliding motion. This strategy imparts CMIP with unique characteristics, offering a prospective pathway for the development of a diverse array of advanced synergistic materials with enhanced, multifaceted properties.},

However, achieving both high sequence fidelity and structural diversity remains a significant challenge using conventional synthetic protocols. To address this issue, we introduce a versatile halide-pair-driven multicomponent polymerization (MCP) strategy that enables the library synthesis of sequence-controlled semiconducting poly(triarylamine)s (PTAAs). By optimizing halide pairing in conjunction with a rationally designed Buchwald ligand–Pd system featuring catalyst-transfer capability, we achieved efficient sequential cascade aminations, thereby enabling the MCP. The versatility of this strategy was demonstrated through the synthesis of a library of sequence-controlled PTAAs, including dendronized variants, underscoring its potential as a general platform for functional semiconducting material discovery.},

Their photophysical properties remained essentially unexplored. We report that the bright yellow-colored diamino stannylene Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 shows thermally activated dual orange/green phosphorescence with microsecond lifetime in fluid solution at room temperature, which has been overlooked for more than 50 years. These unique electronic and photophysical properties are studied in detail by temperature-dependent time-resolved emission and absorption spectroscopy and are corroborated by (time-dependent) density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The mechanism of photochemical radical formation has been disclosed, involving unprecedented stannylene excimers with second-order Jahn–Teller distorted structures. The present study provides new insights toward a rational design of tetrel(II) complexes with long-lived emissive excited states, with Sn[N(SiMe 3 ) 2 ] 2 being the prototype.},

Herein, three enantiomeric pairs of chiral tin-oxo clusters were constructed using axially chiral 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (BINOL) ligands. Structural analyses revealed supramolecular helical assemblies mediated by directional C─H···π interactions, while circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed their intrinsic chirality. Through in situ doping engineering, non-chiral fluorophores with distinct emission profiles were incorporated during chiral cluster crystallization, yielding composite materials exhibiting circularly polarized luminescence (CPL). The optimized system achieved a maximum dissymmetry factor ( g lum ) of 1.5 × 10 −2 . Mechanistic studies established that the spiral packing of the tin-oxo clusters facilitates stereochemical information transfer to the dyes via the spatial confinement effect.

As a prominent class of reactions, transition-metal-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen (C─H) bond activation is widely used for the synthesis of base chemicals, modern organic materials, and pharmaceuticals. Here, we report orthogonal selectivity in intramolecular cyclodehydrogenation of a nonplanar cyclic precursor steered by different facets of a copper single crystal. On the Cu(110) surface, the previously unknown cycloarene isokekulene forms with a high selectivity of 92%, whereas reaction on the Cu(111) surface exclusively yields kekulene (>99%). Combining scanning tunneling microscopy with CO-functionalized tips and density functional theory, we identify two adsorption geometries of the precursor, which react to the respective products. Isokekulene adopts two nonplanar adsorption configurations and exhibits strong molecule-substrate interactions, explaining its preferential formation on Cu(110). This combined in-solution and on-surface synthesis approach represents an alternative route for the highly selective synthesis of molecules that are challenging to synthesize and process via conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {The dynamic dissolution of active species of electrocatalysts suffers severe durability issues, thus limiting practical sustainable electrochemical application despite the enormous strides in the activity. An atomistic understanding of the dynamic pattern is a fundamental prerequisite for realizing prolonged stability. Herein, modeling on NiFe LDHs, multiple operando spectroscopies revealed the structural oscillation of the local [Ni–O 2 –Fe] unit identified a strong dependence on the alternant Fe dissolution and redeposition during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, thus mediating the dynamic stability. At this point, a proof-of-concept strategy with S, Co co-doping was demonstrated to tune structural oscillations. In situ S leaching that alleviates the lattice mismatch suppresses Fe dissolution, while the electron-withdrawing Co as a deposition site promotes Fe redeposition, thus achieving the reversible oscillation of local [Ni/Co–O 2 –Fe] units and dynamic stability. The implementation of the modified NiFe LDH in industrial water electrolysis equipment operated steadily over 800 h (5000-h lifetime obtained by epitaxial method with 10% attenuation) with an energy consumption of 4.05 kWh Nm −3 H 2 @ 4000 A m −2 .

In situ spectra and density function theoretical (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the 3 d -4 d hybridization between Co and Pd enables an increase in the energy level of the dz 2 -5 σ and dyz -2 π* states in the CO/PdCo alloy, thus enhancing the binding strength of the *CO intermediate and accelerating the CO hydrogenation.

As a result, PdCo-NC/CC exhibits unprecedented photothermal performance toward CO 2 methanation, delivering a CH 4 generation rate as high as 15.23 mol g metal −1 h −1 and a selectivity of 100% in batch reaction under the irradiation of Xenon lamp without any external thermal source.

Although post-treatment of InP cores with zinc compounds is a common approach to alleviate interface strain, conventional synthesis methods often fail to achieve effective doping, typically leaving zinc on the core surface rather than within the lattice. Herein, we present a dual-mode strain relief strategy using the small-molecule precursor Zn(Ac) 2 . Its ionic bonding character and low steric hindrance enable efficient Zn doping into the InP core and promote uniform epitaxial shell growth, leading to a 50% reduction in interfacial strain and a near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield in InP QDs. This approach simultaneously addresses two major sources of strain: lattice mismatch between the core and shell and steric hindrance from bulky surface ligands. The fabricated green InP-based QLED achieved a high external quantum efficiency of 26.3% and a current efficiency of 108.3 cd A −1 . We believe this strategy provides a general and scalable strain engineering platform for QDs, with broad applicability across various material systems.},

Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the Type B network suppressed CH 4 adsorption (3.6 cm 3 g −1 versus 6.2 cm 3 g −1 ) and significantly enhanced the small pore volume ratio ( V H2 / V CH4 : 10.3 versus 2.1) during carbonization, thereby eliminating non-selective pathways and reducing inter-skeletal spacing (4.09 Å versus 3.78 Å), which enables precise molecular sieving. This rigid-flexible cross-linked strategy for CMSMs establishes a scalable blueprint for next-generation hydrogen production.},

Thioimidate-containing copolymers with methylmethacrylate (MMA) are synthesized through radical-mediated, chain-growth polymerization. These materials serve as a synthetic branch point for facile conversion into amidines by treatment with a weak acid and an external amine. Our approach allows for more diverse amidine structures than have been previously reported in polymers. This chemistry also enables crosslinking to form novel hydrogels with finely tuned acid–base behavior. Subsequent examination of the acid–base properties revealed that these features are preserved across linear, soluble amidine polymers to cross-linked amidine gel polymer architectures.},

The in-lattice heterojunction, defined as FNCTO, achieves efficient radial carrier transfer along the Ti─C─N─Fe in-lattice atomic channel and greatly promoted N 2 adsorption benefiting photocatalytic NRR. Thus, FNCTO exhibits an excellent photocatalytic N 2 reduct`ion into NH 3 activity (88 µmol g −1 h −1 ), obviously higher than that of Fe─N─C sites on noncavity P25, illustrating the crucial role of cavity patch induced in-lattice heterojunction.

Enhancing the exciton diffusion length ( L D ) is pivotal for improving device parameters, including PCE. However, the underlying mechanisms governing exciton diffusion dynamics, influenced by the aggregation structure of conjugated polymers, remain insufficiently understood. This study employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the interchain free energy distribution [Δ G (r)] and strategically modulates the aggregation behavior of the polymer donor PM6 by controlling its molecular weight (MW). Medium-MW PM6 demonstrates optimized aggregation behavior, leading to extended L D and precisely tuned fluid mechanics, which facilitate the formation of a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) active layer. These advancements enable PPHJ-based all-polymer flexible devices to achieve a PCE of 18.01%, with notable improvements in J SC and FF, and retain 90.4% of their initial efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. Encouraged by these advantages, a record-breaking efficiency of 20.0% (certified 19.68%) was achieved for eco-friendly, printed OPVs (PM6//L8-BO) with small-area devices (0.0621 cm 2 ), whereas large-area modules (23.60 cm 2 ) reached an efficiency of 15.60%.},

Herein, we track the inter- and intra-ligand charge transfer processes that underpin light-driven charge separation in the well-studied “molecular lightswitch” [Ru(bpy) 2 dppz] 2+ (aqueous [Ruthenium II (2,2′-bipyridine)2(dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine)] 2+ [Cl − ] 2 ) by probing the electronic structure of ligand nitrogen atoms in real-time using ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy and first principles calculations. We confirm the localization of excited electron density on the phenazine N atoms of dppz and we newly identify two parallel electron transfer pathways to populate this state. Sub-70 fs electron transfer to the phenazine portion of dppz is observed and attributed to intra-ligand electron transfer following Ru-to-dppz metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) excitation. This fast charge transfer was not reported in prior ultrafast studies. The slower (ca. 2 ps) charge transfer reported extensively in time-resolved optical absorption and emission studies is reassigned here to inter-ligand electron “hopping” between nearly isoenergetic ligand moieties following Ru-to-bpy MLCT excitation. The results demonstrate much faster charge separation than previously identified in this well-studied system, highlighting how extended azaacene ligand motifs promote the competitive charge transfer processes needed to drive light-driven electron transfer chemistry.},

We propose the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction as a probe to study chemistry under VSC, owing to the high diversity of its reaction partners. Herein, fixed-width cavities and UV–vis spectroscopy were used to determine the rate constants for the reactions of the diene 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPIBF) with various dienophiles under different coupling conditions. We investigated the effect of coupling six different solvents and of cooperative coupling of the dienophile through the solvent. Secondly, as the DA reaction can be catalyzed by hydrogen bonding, we investigated how the reaction was influenced by coupling alcohol solvents. Finally, we explored the direct coupling of vibrational modes of the dienophiles, including the stretching mode of the reactive C═C bond. In all cases, no substantial changes to the reaction rate constants were observed among the diverse coupling scenarios explored. This work initiates the use of the DA reaction as a mechanistic platform to understand how VSC changes chemistry and invites further experimental and theoretical studies.},

Although “dual-locked” probes have been devised to enhance diagnostic accuracy via two biomarkers, most fall short in sensitivity, response time, and generalizability for pan-cancer use. We address these gaps with ACy-H-NTR , a cascaded-activation, doubly quenched NIR-II probe. Engineered to respond to hypoxia and acidity—universal tumor hallmarks—it offers fast response, high sensitivity, and specificity for pan-cancer screening and imaging. In contrast to existing probes, its tandem-locked design ensures robust activation exclusively within pan-tumor microenvironments, effectively reducing false positives and delineating precise diagnostic boundaries. Its NIR-II emission and “activation–retention” mechanism enhance tumor imaging efficacy and effectively tackle issues of rapid clearance and background noise, achieving 4.9-fold higher tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio than ICG and retaining tumor specificity for over 2 days. In pan-cancer models, it enabled high-contrast imaging (T/N ∼7.8) and precise resection with sub-2 mm margins. Crucially, it differentiates human carcinoma from adjacent tissues with sharp boundaries, confirming clinical potential. By integrating a tandem-locked and doubly quenched design that simultaneously optimizes activation efficiency, NIR-II imaging capabilities, and activation-retention mechanisms, this probe overcomes current limitations to enable precise pan-cancer identification and surgical navigation.},

Experimental and theoretical results reveal that Ce-O v -W acid–base pairs not only provide more Ce 3+ sites for promoting the reactivity of adsorbed NO, but also accelerate the reaction between NH 3 and gaseous NO owing to the generation of W 5+ species with superior surface acidity, which enhance Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanisms, respectively. Consequently, the designed catalysts achieve over 90% NO x conversion above 250 °C and exhibit higher activity than normal Ce/WO 3 and V/W-TiO 2 commercial catalysts, with anti-poisoning of SO 2 and H 2 O under harsh working conditions, expecting to provide the guidance for promoting de-NO x industrial application.},

  abstract     = {Layered transition-metal oxides have attracted growing attention for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs); however, their application is hindered by low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) due to Na-deficiency and solid-electrolyte interphase formation. Herein, a universal chemical presodiation pathway is reported with Na-bipyridine dissolved in diethyl ether (Na-Bpy/DEE) for stable Na-deficient P2-Na 2/3 Ni 1/3 Mn 2/3 O 2 (NNMO) electrode under air condition. The strongly electron-withdrawing N-functional groups of Bpy •− radicals endow its air insensitivity, and it reduces the NNMO cathode for compensation of Na + from the weakly solvating DEE. This results in a uniform and robust NaF-rich interface to prevent surface lattice disorder of NNMO, which is caused by local stress, and preserve structure integrity. The presodiated NNMO electrode shows high ICE of 100% and reversible capacity of 158.3 mAh g −1 , and its pouch cell coupled with hard carbon presents high-capacity retention of 95.9% after 200 cycles. This work proposes an industrially feasible presodiation strategy to highly efficient SIBs.},

However, achieving highly selective CPL detection with large dissymmetry factors ( g lum ) in Cu(I)-based chiral metal halides remains a significant challenge. Herein, we prepared 1D chiral ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 (where MPZ is 2-methylpiperazine) halides with the unique triangular–tetrahedral configuration in the noncentrosymmetric cubic P 1 2 11 space group, resulting in substantial structural distortions, which significantly impact nonlinear susceptibility. Consequently, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide exhibits efficient second harmonic generation (SHG), which is 7.29 times as high as that of KH 2 PO 4 . Additionally, ( R )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 halide also exhibits remarkable third harmonic generation (THG) response, and g THG-CD is as high as +0.309, which is the first demonstration of THG-based CPL detection in Cu(I)-based metal halides. The self-powered CPL photodetectors based on ( R / S )-MPZCu 2 Cl 4 show high CPL distinguishability at 0 V and further achieve self-powered X-ray detection with excellent low-dose detection and radiation resistance. Our study provides valuable insights into the structure–performance relationship in chiral organic–inorganic hybrid Cu(I) halides, paving the way for next-generation multifunctional optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) provides a promising strategy for producing high-value chemicals and fuels. However, developing high-performance photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction remains a great challenge due to the poor stability of reaction intermediates. Herein, we present an anionic coordination strategy to facilitate the stabilization of intermediates by constructing halogen-coordinated metal-organic cages (MOCs) (Ni 8 L 12 X 4 , X = Cl, Br, I). Theoretical calculations show that the formation of *COOH intermediate is the rate-limiting step and halogen coordination effectively regulates the energy barrier for this reaction. Notably, iodide anions significantly reduce the energy gap between the Ni d and iodide p orbitals, enhancing electron transfer from the Ni center to adsorbed CO 2 and promoting the production of *COOH. As a result, Ni 8 L 12 I 4 demonstrates superior performance with a CO production rate of 2680.23 µ mol g −1 h −1 and 95% selectivity, outperforming Cl- and Br-coordinated Ni MOC by 200- and 5-fold, respectively.

In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the amorphous structure and B-induced p-sp orbital hybridization modulate the electronic structure, optimizing intermediate adsorption while enhancing H* generation. These synergistic effects collectively reduce the energy barrier of the potential-determining step, significantly improving catalytic activity and selectivity. The catalyst achieves an NH₂OH Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 85.3% at −0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By employing a pulsed potential strategy, the FE further increases to nearly 100%, surpassing most reported counterparts.

The self-assembly process exhibits a pronounced odd–even effect, yielding either enantiomeric or meso duplexes through distinct chiral self-sorting pathways. Host–guest interactions between flex -COP-4 and a series of α,ω-dibromoalkanes were systematically investigated using NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The resulting inclusion complexes span a continuum of binding modes—from relaxed encapsulation to strained, overpacked assemblies—governed by geometric complementarity and mutual host–guest deformation.

We contribute here to this field with the development of a unique class of supramolecular polymers that are able to selectively encapsulate guest molecules within their lumen. This is achieved through a rational design of the monomer units, which self-assemble in amphiphilic cyclic entities that then stack into lipophilic tubular architectures that contain a polar pore. These tailored assemblies are able to host hydrophilic dye molecules that are complementary in size and chemical affinity for the pore coating. Dye extraction is characterized by: (1) the emergence of the dye absorption and emission features in solution, (2) a red shift of the absorption and emission maxima, caused by a confined environment of high viscosity, and (3) an energy transfer process from the monomer at the tube's walls to the included dye guest, which was characterized by photoluminescence (PL), excitation, and transient absorption measurements. When different dyes are co-encapsulated, the tubular supramolecular polymer provides a unidimensional confined chiral environment to promote sequential energy transfer processes between them.},

However, there are often a multitude of factors at play; hence, it can be unclear how operating conditions can be rationally tuned to optimize selectivity. Here, we demonstrate how the identity of alkali metal cations in the electrolyte can control the selectivity of electrochemical C─H chlorination. Specifically, we obtained a 90.3% Faradaic efficiency with KCl as compared to 78.4% with LiCl for the conversion of cyclohexane to chlorocyclohexane at 1000 mA using an IrO x electrode. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy experiments indicate a greater propensity for Cl − oxidation to generate Cl radicals in the order: K + > Na + > Li + . This leads to an increase in the selectivity toward the chlorination of cyclohexane and a concomitant decrease in competitive Cl 2 formation. Density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy experiments indicate that this is likely due to a decrease in *Cl binding energy on IrO x in the presence of K + . These findings highlight the important role of alkali metal cations, which can be a key consideration for designing electrochemical organic synthesis systems.},

Although homocysteine (Hcy) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring amino acid, it was excluded from the universal genetic code. Hcy is very interesting, yet mostly unexplored, for probing protein active sites because of its subtle structural and electronic differences from cysteine and serine, which are widespread catalytic residues in enzymes. We report the genetic encoding of a new protected Hcy precursor, HcyX, that can be conveniently deprotected by chemical reductants or bioorthogonal reagents. We find varying and sometimes remarkable levels of activity for different purified enzymes with Hcy at catalytic positions. By exploiting partial intracellular deprotection to Hcy, we show that two proteins rendered Hcy-dependent, an intein and thymidylate synthase, can rescue growth of Escherichia coli by catalyzing a reaction essential for cell survival. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first examples in which cell growth is linked to a genetically incorporated ncAA directly involved in catalysis. We further demonstrate that Hcy-based disulfide bonds are chemically more stable than cysteine disulfides. Together, these findings open new paths for the experimental evolution of the genetic code.},

The COF nanochannels stabilize the enzyme during MNP formation and the catalytic process, and synergize with the enzyme to regulate the size, dispersion, and electronic state of the MNPs through surface amino acid residues, realizing the co-encapsulation and dual-optimization of both components.

Their synergy in dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) delivers 91% yield, >98% enantiomeric excess (e.e.) value, and recyclability, with applicability to various chiral amines.

Herein, an ingenious design of a high-performance Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst by strategically coupling Ni single atoms (Ni SAs) and oxygen vacancies (Ov) onto urchin-like TiO 2 architecture. By virtue of the unique synergistic catalysis between atomically dispersed Ni species and precisely engineered Ov sites, the Ni 1 /TiO 2- X catalyst achieves a remarkable urea production rate of 15.73 µmol g cat. −1 h −1 . Further mechanistic studies reveal that the atomically dispersed Ni sites facilitate N 2 adsorption and activation, generating *N 2 species, while the adjacent Ov sites activate CO 2 to form *CO intermediates. More intriguingly, the *CO species can migrate from the Ov site to the nearby Ni active centers, where they spontaneously undergo thermodynamic coupling with *N 2 to form a “tower-like” urea precursor (*NCON* intermediate), subsequently converting to urea. The present work establishes a dual-active-site mechanism, comprising isolated Ni centers and adjacent Ov sites, which synergistically lowers the activation barrier for urea photosynthesis and accelerates reaction kinetics, and pioneers a transition strategy for the environmentally friendly and efficient synthesis of high-value products.},

In this study, we used a solvothermal method to synthesize a sub-1 nm copper oxide-phosphomolybdic acid nanosheet (CuO-PMA) for ultrasound (US)-controlled reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation to induce pyroptosis. Owing to the narrow bandgap of CuO-PMA, the electron holes are rapidly separated under US irradiation, then quickly migrate through the sub-nanosheet structure to the surface to catalyze the formation of singlet oxygen (¹O₂) and superoxide anions (•O₂⁻), while simultaneously consuming glutathione (GSH). Furthermore, leveraging electron delocalization properties, US triggered the directional migration of electrons in CuO-PMA, facilitating the Cu(II)-to-Cu(I) transition to enhance hydroxyl radical (•OH) production. The ROS burst together with ions and h + -mediated GSH exhaustion synergistically provokes mitochondrial oxidative stress, activating the caspase-1/GSDMD axis to induce pyroptosis. In vivo experiments demonstrated that CuO-PMA significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed excellent antitumor immunotherapeutic effects. This sub-nanosheet amplifies ROS generation in response to the electronic delocalization characteristics of the US, which provides a new strategy for the ultrasound-controlled pyroptosis activation (sonopyroptosis) and tumor immunotherapy.},

  abstract     = {Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has been recognized as a powerful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. However, the application of existing degraders is constrained by their dependence on a limited number of E3 ubiquitin ligases, such as CRBN and VHL. To address this limitation, we developed a suite of novel small-molecule degraders by integrating an ynamide electrophile into protein-targeting ligands. These compounds demonstrated remarkable target degradation capability. Subsequent proteome profiling and functional validation revealed that Cys97 residue of retinoblastoma binding protein 7 (RBBP7) E3 ligase was covalently engaged and responsible for the degradation mechanism. Furthermore, the ynamide motif has proved to be a versatile and transplantable chemical handle, facilitating the development of degraders targeting a wide range of proteins, including CDK4, PDE5, PI3K, AKT, BCR-ABL, BRD4, EGFR L858R , and EGFR L858R/T790M/C797S . Notably, incorporation of ynamide into the “pan-kinase” inhibitor XO44 yielded degraders capable of simultaneously degrading various kinases, such as PI3K, Syk, AKT, and GSK-3β, further highlighting the general feasibility of this approach. Importantly, the ynamide-containing degraders demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer potency compared to their parent inhibitors.},

  abstract     = {The separation of ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) from mixtures with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and acetylene (C 2 H 2 ) is of great industrial importance but remains a critical challenge. Here, we report that a rationally designed flexible metal–organic framework (FMOF), featuring a specifically engineered microporous environment with bifunctionality, can promote the efficient one-step separation of C 2 H 4 from a ternary mixture. Adsorption isotherms and dynamic breakthrough tests provide experimental evidence confirming the selective adsorption of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 over C 2 H 4 on such a FMOF, as well as its ability to separate C 2 H 4 from a CO 2 /C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 ternary mixture. Theoretical calculations and simulations provide critical insights into the flexible adsorption process and the separation mechanism of the FMOF. The bifunctionality incorporated in FMOF provides exceptionally strong binding of CO 2 and C 2 H 2 but inhibition of C 2 H 4 , which, in turn, enables high adsorption selectivity for CO 2 /C 2 H 4 and C 2 H 2 /C 2 H 4 . This FMOF has high potential for industrial applications in the separation of C 2 H 4 from gas mixtures.},

The gels were synthesized via an acid-catalyzed step-growth reaction of a difunctional PEG-thiol macromer with a wisely selected aromatic dialdehyde cross-linker. The formation of the photosensitive dithioacetal bonds at the cross−links rendered the hydrogels photodegradable, whereas the production of the initial comonomers as the main photoproducts after irradiation endowed the material with thermoreversible properties. The linear viscoelastic behavior of water-swollen gels, their photodegradation under UV ( λ = 254 nm) irradiation at very low intensity (0.063 mW cm −1 ), and the reversible reformation of the hydrogel upon heating were investigated by dynamic shear rheology.

However, previous reports mainly focused on modifying the π + core but often overlooked the crucial role of anions. Herein, we present a facile strategy to modulate the fluorescence intensity and cellular uptake of anion-π + type AIE photosensitizers by doping bulky fluorinated organic anions into nanoparticles (NPs). Anion-π + type AIE photosensitizer DPBCF-Br with different ratios of bulky anions (TB or FTB) were encapsulated into DSPE-PEG 2000 to obtain NPs (named DF-TB X or DF-FTB X , X denotes the molar ratios of TB or FTB to DPBCF-Br). Expectedly, as the doping molar ratios increased, a progressive enhancement in fluorescence intensity of the obtained NPs was observed. This can be ascribed to the steric effect of bulky organic anions and the formation of a hydrophobic environment within the NPs. Interestingly, the optimal cellular uptake was achieved at X = 8 in DF-TB 8 and DF-FTB 8 , resulting from the balance between lipophilicity and electronegativity. Ultimately, DF-FTB 8 demonstrated outstanding cellular imaging capabilities and high intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, achieving efficient cancer phototheranostics. This facile bulky anion doping strategy will pave a new way for the construction of robust anion-π + type photosensitizers.},

Moreover, they provide a great opportunity to show mathematically switchable matrix elements between nonzero and zero values in both second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ (2) and piezoelectric d matrices to realize the dual on/off switching of second-harmonic generation circular dichroism (SHG-CD) and piezoelectric responses, which, however, has never been reported.

They show strong SHG-CD effects with an anisotropy factor up to 1.28, far exceeding that of other chiral ferroelectrics. Notably, the 432 F 2 phase transition enables ( R -/ S -BTA) 2 CdBr 4 to show the unprecedented dual on/off switching of SHG-CD and piezoelectric response between the SHG-CD/piezoelectric active state in the ferroelectric phase and SHG-CD/piezoelectric inactive state in the paraelectric phase.

Those transformations relied on the multi-task ability of poly(ionic liquids) (PILs), which provides efficient electro-steric protection of the NPs, good solubility in neat carbonates, and organocatalytic activity depending on the nature of the PIL counter-anions. Hence, PIL incorporating nucleophilic anions, such as I − , triggers the cascade transformation of EC into EtOH via a sequential decarboxylation-hydrogenation process. Conversely, in the presence of non-nucleophilic anions, the PIL is catalytically a spectator, yielding to the “direct hydrogenation” of EC by the RuNPs.},

Here, based on the donor-acceptor molecular backbone, an oligoether chain is introduced with different chain lengths to endow two novel SAMs, namely, EPA and MEPA, with good capability of bottom-up regulation of perovskite formation and energetics. Compared to the model SAM MPA, EPA and MEPA can render NiO x with better coverage and conductivity. Moreover, the oligoether chain-containing SAMs are able to assist the formation of perovskite film with ordered growth, high crystallization, and importantly well-matched energy level alignment at the top surface, especially for MEPA. Consequently, a remarkably high efficiency of 25.50% is realized for NiO x /MEPA-based PSCs along with good device stability, which can maintain 90% of the initial efficiency under ISOS-L-1 conditions over 1260 h.},

  abstract     = {Integrating solar-driven CO 2 reduction with organic oxidation is regarded as an ideal strategy for achieving carbon neutrality. However, further enhancement of photocatalytic efficiency is persistently blocked by low photogenerated carrier yields and unavoidable fast bulk electron/hole recombination. Herein, we propose to design a plasmonic-ferroelectric heterojunction (WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 ), which enhances localized electromagnetic field and ferroelectric polarization field simultaneously through the cooperative coupling of localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect in WO 3-x and ferroelectric polarization in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 , thereby not only promoting energetic hot-carriers generation, but also accelerating bulk charge separation. Ultimately, hot-electrons and photoelectrons are directionally transferred and extracted to K 4 Nb 6 O 17 surface for CO 2 reduction, whereas massive holes are accumulated in WO 3-x for benzylicalcohol activation. Under mild conditions, WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 exhibits superior CO yield (294.76 µmol g −1 h −1 ), which is 9.87 and 6.27-folds higher than that of K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , respectively. Meanwhile, compared to the simple dehydrogenation of benzylicalcohol to benzaldehyde in K 4 Nb 6 O 17 and WO 3-x , WO 3-x /K 4 Nb 6 O 17 prefers to trigger benzylicalcohol C─C coupling for directed production of more value-added hydrobenzoin (313.15 µmol g −1 h −1 ). This work would open a conceptual vista for designing multifield coupling structures to facilitate charge spatial separation and directional transfer, which would inspire further establishment of efficient novel photocatalysts and solar-to-fuel conversion systems to meet the green and sustainable development goals.},

  abstract     = {Organic molecular dimers serve as valuable model systems for manipulating and exploring interchromophore interactions. However, the structural flexibility introduced by linker or chromophore rotation gives rise to conformational isomers with distinct atomic arrangements, complicating the interpretation of photophysical processes. In this study, we investigate 9,9′,10,10′-tetraphenyl-2,2′-bianthracene ( TPBA ) to elucidate the distinct electronic characteristics of its two primary rotational isomers: syn - and anti -TPBA . To address the “Janus-type” photophysical behavior of these isomers, we employed a comprehensive suite of static and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, including excitation-wavelength-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption, and time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance, complemented by theoretical calculations. syn - and anti -TPBA exhibit markedly different emissive properties and charge-transfer characteristics, reflecting their unique exciton coupling behaviors. Additionally, they showcase distinct triplet formation rates and exhibit environment-dependent triplet formation mechanisms. This in-depth study of the Janus-like electronic properties of TPBA underscores the critical role of conformational isomerism in organic molecular dimers. Neglecting these structural variations can obscure the true photophysical landscape and lead to misinterpretations of mechanistic processes, highlighting the necessity of considering conformational heterogeneity in molecular design and photophysical studies.},

  abstract     = {Cyclodextrin-based slide-ring gels (SRGs) have emerged as a promising class of materials owing to their unique topology. Upon mechanical loading, the slidable cross-links of the polymer network freely translocate along the polymer backbone enabling pronounced energy dissipation in the material, which is associated with exceptional ductility and toughness. Despite the critical role of sliding dynamics in defining SRG mechanical properties, attempts to control them have primarily been limited to tuning the overall loading of macrocycles. Further, SRGs that can be triggered via an external stimulus have yet to be reported. In this work, we present light-responsive SRGs based on azobenzene-containing polymers. Reversible photoswitching of the azobenzenes modulates the sliding dynamics of the threaded α-cyclodextrin (α-CD) macrocycles. By using UV–Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that α-CDs readily bind to the azobenzenes along the polymer backbone in the E configuration. Upon light irradiation, and thus isomerization to the Z isomer, the macrocycles no longer interact with the azobenzenes, allowing them to freely translocate along the polymer backbone. As a result of this E to Z isomerization and difference in sliding dynamics, the mechanical properties of the SRGs reversibly alternate between a stiff and a soft state.},

Despite extensive research on well-characterized exhaustively phosphorylated PP-InsPs, such as 5-PP-InsP 5 (5-InsP 7 ) and 1,5-(PP) 2 -InsP 4 (1,5-InsP 8 ), the functional relevance of less abundant not fully phosphorylated isomers, remains largely unknown. In this study, we synthesized all unsymmetric 5-PP-InsP 4 isomers in enantiopure form and assigned their structures using 31 P-NMR analysis in combination with a chiral solvating agent. Additionally, we developed 18 O-labeled PP-InsP 4 standards for mass spectrometry in combination with capillary electrophoresis (CE-MS), enabling the assignment of PP-InsP 4 in Arabidopsis thaliana under phosphate starvation. Our findings show that the previously detected, phosphate starvation-induced root-specific PP-InsP 4 isomer does not match any 5-PP-InsP 4 isomer, contrary to previous suggestions, thus indicating an alternative phosphorylation pattern. Enzyme assays further demonstrate that Arabidopsis ITPK1 selectively phosphorylates [6-OH]-InsP 5 and [3-OH]-InsP 5 at the 5-position, while other InsP 5 isomers remain unchanged. This suggests that an unidentified enzymatic activity is involved in the formation of the elusive root PP-InsP 4 species. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for the synthesis, analysis, and functional investigation of PP-InsP 4 , providing an entry point for future studies on their biochemical activity and their physiological roles.},

  abstract     = {Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are multi-domain enzymes that catalyze the biosynthesis of therapeutically relevant natural products. Efficient peptide synthesis relies on intricate domain interactions, whose underlying principles remain poorly understood. The communication-mediating (COM) domains facilitate interactions between separate NRPS subunits. For unknown reasons, COM domains co-occur with epimerization (E) domains, are partially embedded within the adjacent condensation (C) domains and can also be found as internal cis -COM domains. These features set COM domains apart from other docking domains. We present the first crystal structure of a cis -COM domain within an E-COM-C domain arrangement from modules 4 and 5 of bacitracin synthetase 3 (BacC). The structure reveals a compactly folded COM domain sandwiched between E and C domains, suggesting a role of the COM domain in orienting these domains for efficient peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) shuttling. Through mutational analyses, dipeptide formation assays, and proximity-dependent photo-crosslinking experiments, we investigated both cis - and trans -COM domains and provide evidence supporting a principal role of COM domains as scaffolds of NRPS architecture. Their function as docking domains may be a secondary consequence of their division into separate donor and acceptor parts.},

Therefore, designing high-molecular-weight acceptors with well-defined structures is crucial for achieving efficient and stable OSCs towards commercialization. Herein, we report a calix[8]arene-tethered dendritic octameric acceptor with a molecular weight of 14243 g mol −1 and a well-defined structure. Owing to its dendritic structure, which facilitates both multidimensional charge transport and molecular interactions, C8-IC can operate efficiently, achieving a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.7%, despite its lower crystallinity. Moreover, it effectively acts as a crystallization manipulator, regulating the interaction and crystallization within the D18:L8-BO system. This optimizes charge management in the ternary system, achieving a state-of-the-art efficiency of 20.7%. To our knowledge, this is among the highest efficiency values reported for OSCs based on dendritic acceptors. Moreover, the ultrahigh molecular weight of the dendritic acceptor effectively increases the glass transition temperature ( T g ), inhibits molecular diffusion, and stabilizes the morphology, leading to significantly improved device stability. This work presents high-performance OSCs based on a dendritic acceptor with ultrahigh molecular weight and provides valuable insights into the design of acceptor materials for highly stable OSCs.},

  abstract     = {Most record-efficiency perovskite solar cells rely on spin-coating with antisolvent dripping, which is fundamentally incompatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing. The crystallization kinetics of dynamic wet film during spin coating differs widely from the static wet film during R2R fabrication, which makes the existing crystallization control strategies become inapplicable while upscaling. The crystallization regulation of static wet film remains a critical challenge, particularly under ambient conditions. In this study, we employed the antisolvent-bathing method that can efficiently regulate the crystallization process of static wet films made by drop coating. Through systematic investigation of solvent-antisolvent interdiffusion kinetics and in-situ crystallization monitoring via time-resolved UV–Vis spectroscopy, we identify alkyl chlorides (particularly chloroform) as optimal bathing agents. The champion device made by CF bathing achieved an efficiency of 24.49% under ambient conditions (RH 30%–50%), representing the highest efficiency for perovskite solar cells made by the antisolvent bathing method. The device showed negligible decay after 2256 h storage in N 2 atmosphere. The method demonstrates exceptional environmental resilience to humidity and solvent accumulation, accompanied by an ultra-wide processing window (10 s–10 min bathing duration, >2 min post-bathing delay tolerance).},

  abstract     = {Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage. However, their application is hindered by Zn anode instability and reduced ionic conductivity at low temperatures. Here, we identified two decisive factors for low-temperature performance and anode stability of batteries: tetrahedral entropy and cation entropy. The former is closely related to antifreezing ability of electrolyte, while the latter is associated with the desolvation kinetics of Zn 2+ . We propose an effective strategy to balance the above two thermodynamic quantities by precisely tuning the molar fraction of the 1,3-butanediol (BDO) cosolvent with notable glass-forming ability. BDO enhances the tetrahedral entropy due to the disruption of the hydrogen-bond networks among water molecules, decreasing the solid–liquid transition temperature from −16.4 to −101 °C. Additionally, BDO modifies the solvated structure of Zn 2 ⁺ to limit the active water content, thus suppressing by-reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The optimized electrolyte enables long-term cycling of Zn||Zn symmetric cells for over 4000 h at −40 °C under 0.1 mA cm −2 /0.1 mAh cm −2 , and renders PANI||Zn full cells capable of working across a broad temperature range (−40 °C to 60 °C).

This enzyme demonstrates exceptional activity across more than 20 C 12 ─C 20 terpenes and shows notable tolerance to various functional groups, establishing it as a valuable tool for sustainable organic synthesis. We emphasize the critical influence of expression system choice in maximizing enzymatic performance, enabling high-yield transformations on the gram scale. Through a combination of homology modeling, consensus analysis, and targeted mutagenesis, essential residues involved in catalytic activity were identified. Notably, enhanced catalytic efficiency was only achievable through the epistatic effect of three specific mutations.

In this study, we unveil the crucial role of PdAu/CeO 2 catalysts in enabling selective methane transformation under mild conditions, using only water as the sole oxidant. Through a combination of experimental techniques, including XPS and catalytic testing, alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that a Pd 0.3 Au 0.7 /CeO 2 catalyst, which predominantly exposes isolated Pd atoms, achieves remarkable methanol selectivity (∼80%) at 500 K with a 1:1 methane-to-water ratio. While Pd/CeO 2 efficiently activates methane, its tendency for overreaction leads to complete methanol decomposition, thereby limiting selectivity. Alloying Pd with Au on ceria mitigates this over-reactivity, preventing methanol degradation while maintaining sufficient catalytic activity. The PdAu/CeO 2 composite exhibits a synergistic effect: Pd in contact with the ceria support facilitates methane activation and water dissociation, while Au fine-tunes reactivity to promote methanol formation. DFT calculations confirm that isolated Pd sites at the PdAu/CeO 2 interface play a key role in balancing activity and selectivity. This work underscores the importance of alloy/oxide interfaces in controlling selective methane conversion with water and offers valuable insights for designing highly efficient catalysts for methanol synthesis.},

  abstract     = {High-content screening (HCS) has become a powerful tool in drug discovery; however, its reliance on indirect readouts and surrogate markers limits HCS's ability to directly assess drug-protein interactions at endogenous levels, particularly in subcellular contexts. Here, we report an approach to address these limitations by combining confocal imaging-based HCS and bio-orthogonal labeling with clickable probes. As a proof-of-concept, we synthesized a probe Triptolide-alkyne (TL-alk) that rapidly and specifically labels xeroderma pigmentosum type B (XPB), a critical protein in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Probe-labeled XPB was conjugated to TAMRA to visualize the occupation of active sites, and EGFP and DAPI signals indicated XPB expression in the nucleus. Such a colorimetric HCS assay enabled the direct and precise measurement of drug occupancy rates in nuclear XPB of live cells. With this platform, pelitinib was identified as a novel ligand to bind XPB out of 1874 compounds containing. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Pelitinib formed a covalent bond with cysteine residue 342 of XPB, suppressed XPB's ATPase activity, impaired NER, and synergistically enhanced chemotherapy. This study not only overcomes limitations of HCS, but also demonstrates the transformative potential of bio-orthogonal labeling, such as in integration with HCS technologies, offering a novel framework for drug discovery targeting challenging protein systems.},

  abstract     = {Caged compounds are a valuable tool to photocontrol the release of enzymatic substrates in a reaction. For example, caged urea molecules were proposed to control urea delivery to urease reactions and aid the determination of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Owing to the success of several caged compounds based on ruthenium complexes, we synthesized a new inorganic caged urea (RuBpy-urea) and monitored the release of free urea by infrared spectroscopy upon irradiation. Transient infrared absorption (TRIR) indicates diffusion-controlled release of urea, and kinetics studies after photolysis demonstrate the functionality of the new caged molecule for photocontrolled delivery of urea to urease. Coupling photocontrolled delivery of urea to cryo-FTIR (fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) revealed that inhibition of urease results in different FTIR spectrum than the one observed for the noninhibited urease.},

  abstract     = {Carbazole-based self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been commonly used as a single-component hole transport layer (HTL) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but suffer from facile π-π stacking and self-aggregations in solution and consequently poor anchoring ability with the atop perovskite layer. Herein, we developed a synergistic SAM (syn-SAM) strategy through blending a non-planar molecule 3,3-(4-amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-diyl)-dibenzo acid (ABT) bearing multiple anchoring sites with the commonly used Me-4PACz SAM. The coexistence of these two components leverages π-π interactions and hydrogen bonding to mitigate aggregation effects, affording dense and uniform SAM, thereby enhancing anchoring at the perovskite buried interface and alleviating interfacial charge recombination. ABT incorporation further helps to mitigating tensile strain in perovskite film. Additionally, this strategy offers advantages of multi-device compatibility. The single-junction champion inverted PSC devices based on syn-SAM deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.75% (certified 25.45%) and 22.76% (area: 0.105 cm 2 ) for 1.56  and 1.68 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively. Moreover, this approach is beneficial for the monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells based on fully textured surfaces of heterojunction (HJT) silicon bottom cells, affording PCEs of 31.56% (area: 1.07 cm 2 ) and 26.57% (area: 20.06 cm 2 ).

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential genes for mitochondrial and cellular functions and acts as a cell signaling molecule in innate immune and inflammatory responses. Defects in mtDNA are implicated in a range of mitochondrial disorders and human diseases. Currently, no chemical strategy exists to prevent mtDNA loss under genotoxic stress. To address this, we developed a mitochondria-targeting probe (mTAP) that selectively reacts with key mtDNA repair intermediates–abasic (AP) sites. We confirmed that mTAP forms oxime conjugates exclusively with mitochondrial AP sites without conjugation with nuclear AP sites. Upon mTAP conjugation, DNA substrates containing AP sites were resistant to cleavage by AP endonuclease (APE1) and mitochondrial extracts. This conjugation significantly reduced the DNA-binding affinity of APE1 without affecting the DNA-binding activity of a mtDNA-packaging factor, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Importantly, cellular experiments demonstrated that mTAP treatment alleviated the decrease in mtDNA and transcription product levels induced by mitochondrial AP site damage. Functional assays also demonstrated that mTAP treatment did not compromise mtDNA replication activity or increase the overall mtDNA damage level. These findings highlight the potential of mTAP as a valuable chemical tool to modulate mtDNA levels under genotoxic stress.},

  abstract     = {Zero-dimensional metal halides have emerged as a versatile platform for the development of light-emitting materials, but achieving tunable or even multicolor emission from a material containing a single type of metal has proven highly challenging. Here, we leverage the “structural tolerance” of recently-developed polymeric metal halides to integrate two distinct coordination units of a single metal into a material, thereby achieving highly tunable optical properties in single-phase metal halides. By manipulating the steric hindrance of polycations, facilely adjustable green, red or bicolor emission can be realized in manganese bromides, which originates from controllable transformation from manganese-bromine tetrahedra into octahedra. This design principle is further extended to polymeric copper halides, wherein broad self-trapped exciton emissions derived from distinct copper-iodine polyhedrons allow the emission colors to be linearly tunable from blue to yellow, encompassing pure white light, by tailoring the composition, excitation wavelength, or temperature. This study opens avenues for facile and precise modulation of the optical properties of metal halides by exploiting the intrinsic coordinative diversity of metal elements.},

  abstract     = {The stress-responsive up-regulation process is a sophisticated biological response to maintain cellular homeostasis. In intracellular anti-oxidant systems, the expression level of oxidoreductases is up-regulated under oxidative stress, mitigating oxidative damage on biomolecules and enhancing protein folding capacity. Herein, inspired by the biological system, we developed a synthetic folding promotor whose reactivity is up-regulated under stress conditions. We conjugated two metal-binding 1,4,7,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligands and a redox-active disulfide to obtain cyclam-SS, whose reactivity can be enhanced under metal-induced stress. Metal coordination increased the redox potential of cyclam-SS, activating it as an oxidant. While Cu II ions severely hampered the oxidative folding of substrate polypeptides, cyclam-SS exhibited bifunctional folding-promoting properties, i) suppressing Cu II -mediated misfolding and aggregation, and ii) harnessing Cu II to enhance oxidative folding. Cyclam-SS was also useful for disulfide-bond formation to promote oxidative folding of pharmaceutical and pathological proteins, as demonstrated with proinsulin and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Furthermore, cyclam-SS protected cultured cells from copper-induced stress. Thus, we demonstrated the induction of the stress-responsive up-regulation process by a bifunctional folding promotor controlling the folding status of biologically important proteins under metal-induced stress. The strategy of “stress-responsive up-regulation” could aid the development of novel synthetic materials for treating intracellular stress and related disorders.},

  abstract     = {In solid-state lithium-ion batteries, the fraction of active materials involved in electrode electrochemistry reduces with the increase of electrode thickness. Conventional wisdom suggests that the degree of reaction linearly decreases toward the current collector as in lithium-ion batteries, which is, however, limited by the high difficulty of experimental capture of operando charge and mass transport. Electrode dynamics simulations can provide space visualization but are usually based on simplified models. Herein, we build digital-twin electrodes with digital-space voxel microstructure based on synchrotron tomography, which transforms the electrode architecture from real space to digital space for the construction of precision models. From the digital model-driven simulation, we find an “lithium trapping” effect, stemming from susceptible lithium stuck in the solid electrolyte, triggers an inadequate reaction of the intermediate region of electrodes. Then, we construct locally accelerated ion paths activating the lithium trapping, indicating that this strategy can significantly guide the sustainable battery design for next-generation energy storage.},
