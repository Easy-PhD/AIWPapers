  abstract     = {Accelerated failure time (AFT) models offer an attractive alternative to Cox proportional hazards models. AFT models are collapsible and, unlike hazard ratios in proportional hazards models, the acceleration factor—a key effect measure in AFT models—is collapsible, meaning its value remains unchanged when adjusting for additional covariates. In addition, AFT models provide an intuitive interpretation directly on the survival time scale. From the recent development of smooth parametric AFT models, we identify potential issues with their applications and note several desired extensions that have not yet been implemented. To enrich this tool and its application in clinical research, we improve the AFT models within a flexible parametric framework in several ways: we adopt monotone natural splines to constrain the log cumulative hazard to be a monotonic function across its support; allow for time-varying acceleration factors, possibly include cure and accommodating more than one time-varying effect; and implement both mixture and nonmixture cure models. We implement all of these extensions in the rstpm2 package, which is publicly available on CRAN. Simulations highlight a varying success in estimating cure fractions. However, in terms of covariate-effect estimation, flexible AFT models appear to be more robust than the Cox model even when there is a high proportion of cured individuals in the data, regardless of whether cure is reached within the observed data. We also apply some of our extensions of AFT models to real-world survival data.},

  abstract     = {Phase I dose escalation trials in oncology generally aim to find the maximum tolerated dose. However, with the advent of molecular-targeted therapies and antibody drug conjugates, dose-limiting toxicities are less frequently observed, giving rise to the concept of optimal biological dose (OBD), which considers both efficacy and toxicity. The estimand framework presented in the addendum of the ICH E9(R1) guidelines strengthens the dialogue between different stakeholders by bringing in greater clarity in the clinical trial objectives and by providing alignment between the targeted estimand under consideration and the statistical analysis methods. However, there is a lack of clarity in implementing this framework in early-phase dose optimization studies. This paper aims to discuss the estimand framework for dose optimization trials in oncology, considering efficacy and toxicity through utility functions. Such trials should include pharmacokinetics data, toxicity data, and efficacy data. Based on these data, the analysis methods used to identify the optimized dose/s are also described. Focusing on optimizing the utility function to estimate the OBD, the population-level summary measure should reflect only the properties used for estimating this utility function. A detailed strategy recommendation for intercurrent events has been provided using a real-life oncology case study. Key recommendations regarding the estimand attributes include that in a seamless phase I/II dose optimization trial, the treatment attribute should start when the subject receives the first dose. We argue that such a framework brings in additional clarity to dose optimization trial objectives and strengthens the understanding of the drug under consideration, which would enable the correct dose to move to phase II of clinical development.},

  abstract     = {Hazards constitute key quantities for analyzing, interpreting, and understanding time-to-event data. Hazards and corresponding effect measures, such as the hazard ratio from the Cox proportional hazards model, have a valid causal interpretation if the hazard function is considered as a function in time rather than hazards at specific time points. In this comment, we would like to add two points: (1) The hazard ratio is also a useful population-level estimand with a valid causal interpretation. (2) Empirical evidence shows that problematic situations, which could occur in theory due to strong heterogeneity, are usually avoided in typical randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract     = {Partially linear models are commonly used in observational studies of the causal effect of treatment and/or exposure when there are observed confounding variables. The models are robust and asymptotically distribution-free for testing the causal null hypothesis. In this research, we investigate methods for estimating the partially linear models with data missing at random in all the variables, including the response, the treatment, and the confounding variables. We develop a general estimation method for inference in partially linear models with nonmonotone missing at random data. It proposes using partially linear working models to improve the estimation efficiency of the standard complete case method. It can be shown that the new estimator is consistent, which does not depend on the correctness of the working models. In addition, we recommend bootstrap estimates for the asymptotic variances and semiparametric models for the missing data probabilities. It is computationally simple and can be directly implemented in standard software. Simulation studies are provided to examine its performance. A real data example with sparsely observed missingness patterns is used to illustrate the method.},
