  abstract     = {The interaction between air jets and hairy yarns is an important aspect in textile machinery. Currently, there is a need for high-fidelity two-way coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) simulations of a hairy yarn subjected to high-speed air flows in textile processing, as these models are vital to understand yarn dynamics in, for example, air-jet weaving looms. Therefore, this work develops a fully three-dimensional two-way coupled FSI framework for modeling the yarn dynamics in air-jet weaving. The framework combines an adapted version of the Actuator Line Method (ALM) for the flow with beam elements for the structural representation of the yarn. This enables computationally efficient simulations at the machine scale without the need for resolving fiber-level details. Instead, these properties—derived in earlier work using microscale simulations—are homogenized into aerodynamic force coefficients and structural material parameters, resulting in a multiscale modeling approach. The framework is first validated on the launch of a nylon monofilament yarn, demonstrating its ability to predict yarn velocity and transversal oscillations while reducing the computational cost compared to existing overset mesh methods. In a second step, the method is applied to a hairy staple-fiber yarn, marking the first high-fidelity FSI simulation of such a system. The results confirm the potential of this approach for characterizing hairy yarn behavior in air-jet weaving without tuning of coefficients.},

  abstract     = {The Generalized/eXtended Finite Element Method (G/XFEM) augments standard FEM approximation spaces with functions tailored to represent well specific behaviors of a problem, such as those introduced by cracks in linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The method allows mesh generation to be made independently of crack surfaces and achieves optimal first- and second-order convergence rates, while keeping the condition number of its global matrices under control. Regarding second-order G/XFEM formulations, it has been shown that when only singular enrichment functions able to represent the singularity are adopted, the convergence rate is still bounded by the second-highest crack singularity. In this case, mesh refinement around crack fronts is a strategy to recover optimal convergence. In this work, this is addressed by h-adaptive mesh refinement algorithms. To this end, first, a Zienkiewicz and Zhu block-diagonal (ZZ-BD) error estimator is proposed for three-dimensional (3-D) LEFM problems. For that, the most challenging part is the definition of good recovery enrichment functions that are able to represent the crack singularity. These functions are proposed in this work based on the derivatives of enrichment functions commonly adopted in the G/XFEM context. It is shown that the use of these new singular recovery enrichment functions in the recovery process of the ZZ-BD error estimator leads to estimated discretization errors that are very close to the exact discretization errors. Also, the performance of the error estimator becomes much better than if one adopts recovery enrichment functions commonly used in 2-D. Finally, with a good error estimator able to also quantify the distribution of discretization errors over the domain and along crack fronts, adaptive algorithms are developed. Herein, h-adaptive techniques are proposed to recover optimal second-order convergence for G/XFEM and enhance its usability in such a way that final discretizations meeting a user's pre-specified tolerance on the discretization error are delivered on the fly by the adaptive procedure. 3-D LEFM numerical experiments with increasing levels of complexity are used to assess the ZZ-BD effectivity as well as to show that the proposed h-adaptive algorithms can, at a reasonable computational cost, deliver accurate discretizations at optimal convergence rates.},

  abstract     = {The partitioned approach for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations involves solving the structural and flow field problems sequentially. This approach allows separate settings for the fluid and solid subsystems, ensuring modularity and leveraging advanced commercial and open-source software capabilities to offer increased flexibility for diverse FSI applications. Most partitioned FSI schemes apply the Dirichlet–Neumann partitioning of the interface conditions. The Dirichlet–Neumann coupling scheme has proven adequate in a wide range of applications. However, this coupling scheme is sensitive to the added-mass effect and is susceptible to the incompressibility dilemma, that is, it completely fails for FSI problems in which the fluid is incompressible and furnished with Dirichlet boundary conditions on the part of its boundary complementary to the interface. In the present paper, we demonstrate that if the fluid is incompressible and the fluid domain is nearly- closed, in the sense that the fluid domain is furnished with Dirichlet conditions except for a permeable part of the boundary where a Robin-type condition holds, then the Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned approach is sensitive to the flow resistance at the permeable part and, in particular, convergence of the partitioned approach deteriorates as the flow resistance increases. The Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned approach then becomes arbitrarily unstable in the limit of vanishing permeability, that is, if the flow resistance passes to infinity. Based on a simple model problem, we establish that in the nearly closed case, the convergence rate of the Dirichlet–Neumann partitioned method depends on a so-called added-damping effect . The presented analysis provides insights that can be leveraged to improve the robustness and efficiency of partitioned approaches for FSI problems involving contact, such as valve opening/closing applications. In addition, the results elucidate the incompressibility dilemma as a formal limit of the added-damping effect passing to infinity, and the corresponding challenges related to FSI problems with nearly closed fluid-domain configurations. Based on numerical experiments, we consider the generalization of the results of the simple model problem to more complex, nearly closed FSI problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling complex thermo-mechanical fracture behavior. A high-order element formulation is established on the basis of the hierarchical quadrature element method (HQEM) to perform spatial discretization of transient heat conduction problems. Due to the use of hierarchical, high-order shape functions, temperature gradients can be effectively captured even on relatively coarse meshes. The discretized transient heat conduction equation is subsequently solved using an implicit time integration scheme, specifically, the backward difference method. Numerical validation against the commercial software ABAQUS demonstrates the accuracy of the proposed approach in simulating heat transfer and predicting thermoelastic deformation fields under mixed thermal boundary conditions. Furthermore, HQEM is integrated with the virtual crack closure method (VCCM) for the evaluation of fracture parameters in two-dimensional cracked structures subjected to coupled thermo-mechanical loadings. Within the VCCM framework, a unified explicit expression of the virtual crack closure integral is derived for HQEM with arbitrary nodal configurations. The integration of HQEM with VCCM significantly reduces mesh refinement requirements and preprocessing effort compared to conventional FEM. Case studies confirm that the integrated HQEM–VCCM approach yields accurate solutions for fracture parameters of cracked structures under coupled thermo-mechanical conditions.},

To address the issue of decreased computational accuracy of the material point method (MPM) near physical domain boundaries, a Gaussian kernel function with kernel correction is employed to establish the interpolation formulas between particles and the background grid.

  abstract     = {The long-term performance of pavement structures is influenced by the combined effects of repeated traffic loads and environmental conditions, such as temperature variations. Traditional numerical approaches face significant challenges in simulating the decades-long lifespan of pavements due to the vast disparity between the time scales of individual loading events and the overall lifespan. This paper presents a novel framework for the thermo-mechanical analysis of pavement structures, based on a time homogenization technique to efficiently predict long-term performance. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is employed to simulate the mechanical response of pavements to consecutive tire overruns, while a thermo-mechanical material model accounts for the effects of temperature variations. A key innovation is the treatment of history variables (HVs). The framework incorporates both spatial and temporal mapping of HVs, enabling the extrapolation of material behavior when the evolution rate of HVs stabilizes. This allows for the skipping of computationally expensive tire overruns, significantly reducing simulation time without compromising accuracy. Numerical examples demonstrate the framework's ability to predict the long-term response of pavement structures under realistic traffic and thermal conditions.},

  abstract     = {Reduced-basis methods (RBMs) constitute a promising technique for delivering numerical solutions of parameterized PDEs in real time and with reasonable accuracy. The most significant drawback of RBMs is the requirement of parametric affinity, a condition that only very trivial problems satisfy. Without parametric affinity, the reduced model cannot be quickly assembled in the online stage. The most common solution to this issue is to establish a form of approximate parametric affinity. However, most methods for doing so are highly intrusive: they require in-depth expert knowledge of the problem to be solved, of the high-fidelity simulation software for solving it, or both. It is often impossible to adapt a high-fidelity software package for RBMs without significant source-code edits. We present an approach for approximate affinization based on least-squares projected quantities over a predetermined function space. We contend that this offers a method for affinization with minimal impact, which we demonstrate by producing linear elastic RBMs for components using two widely different simulation software packages, without source code edits and with no significant expert knowledge.},

FFT-based methods were originally developed for periodic boundary conditions, and recent work provided extensions to Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the unit cube faces by utilizing dedicated sine and cosine series. Unfortunately, such approaches were only developed for discretizations that fail to converge for complex porous microstructures. The article at hand closes this gap by constructing the appropriate Eshelby-Green operator for the displacement gradient associated with the staggered grid discretization and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eponymous staggering of the displacement variables infers certain challenges to be resolved, that is, the construction is significantly more difficult than for the cases discussed in the literature.

  abstract     = {This work presents a novel stabilized bipenalty formulation for explicit contact-impact analysis, aiming to enhance traditional bipenalty methods and resolve issues associated with a large mass penalty parameter. To address this challenge, two key contributions are introduced. First, a new formulation integrates the bipenalty method with a predictor-corrector scheme, enabling a more accurate penetration estimation by dividing the computational process into prediction and correction phases. This separation ensures that the mass penalty affects only the contact forces, thereby eliminating undesirable mass effects on internal forces when a large mass penalty parameter is used. Second, new criteria tailored to the predictor-corrector scheme are proposed for two types of contact problems: the flexible-rigid case and the flexible-flexible case. Unlike traditional bipenalty methods, which rely on stability conditions for explicit time integrators, the proposed criteria focus on enforcing the kinematic constraints. As a result, any predicted penetration is eliminated during the correction phase, leading to zero penalty energy. Stability analysis confirms that the computation of the gap within the correction phase maintains stability. Contact impact examples are performed in 1D, 2D, and 3D and demonstrate that the proposed method provides improved stability and superior performance compared to the penalty and traditional bipenalty methods for various contact scenarios, including extremely large penalty parameter cases.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization is a popular and versatile approach that is well suited to solve challenging optimization problems. Their popularity comes from their effective minimization of expensive function evaluations, their capability to leverage gradients, and their efficient use of noisy data. Bayesian optimizers have commonly been applied to global unconstrained problems, with limited development for many other classes of problems. In this article, two alternative methods are developed that enable rapid and deep convergence of nonlinearly-constrained local optimization problems using a Bayesian optimizer. The first method uses an exact augmented Lagrangian and the second augments the minimization of the acquisition function to contain additional constraints. Both of these methods can be applied to nonlinear equality constraints, unlike most previous methods developed for constrained Bayesian optimizers. The new methods are applied with a gradient-enhanced Bayesian optimizer and enable deeper convergence for three nonlinearly-constrained unimodal optimization problems than previously developed methods for constrained Bayesian optimization. In addition, both new methods enable the Bayesian optimizer to reach a desired tolerance with fewer function evaluations than popular quasi-Newton optimizers from SciPy and MATLAB for unimodal problems with 2 to 30 variables. The Bayesian optimizer had similar results using both methods. It is recommended that users first try using the second method, which adds constraints to the acquisition function minimization, since its parameters are more intuitive to tune for new problems.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a flexible multi-body dynamics approach for elastic smooth and non-smooth shells undergoing large deformations and large overall motions. The formulation is based on a co-rotational curved quadrilateral shell element employing vectorial rotational variables and a quasi energy and momentum conservation algorithm. Hamilton's principle is adopted to derive the system's dynamic differential equations. When differentiating the kinetic energy functional with respect to time, the part involving the first-order differentiation of vectorial rotational variables with respect to time is integrated into an equivalent load vector, yielding a symmetric equivalent mass matrix. Accelerations, velocities, displacements, body, and surface loads of the generalized midpoints are generated by convex functions. The Newmark scheme is applied to transform the dynamic differential equations of the system into a set of nonlinear equations. Instead of using strains and their first/second derivatives with respect to local nodal variables at the midpoint configuration, the formulation employs time-averaged assumed strains (computed via the MITC method) and their corresponding derivatives evaluated at both ends of the time step for calculating the internal force vector and element tangent stiffness matrix in the local coordinate system. The transformation matrix from local to global coordinates, however, remains computed at the midpoint configuration. This approach ensures near-exact conservation of total energy and exact conservation of linear and angular momenta once the external loads vanish, while also yielding symmetric tangent stiffness matrices in both local and global coordinate systems. Finally, four examples of three smooth shells and one non-smooth shell problems subjected to impulse loads are solved to verify the proposed formulation for flexible multi-body dynamics of shells. It is shown that the results exhibit excellent agreement with those from other references, demonstrating the reliability, accuracy, and long-term stability of the proposed quasi energy and momentum conserving algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to identify key parameters of a system and gain insight into the effect of variables on system outputs. For systems with multiple outputs, traditional sensitivity analysis methods are typically carried out for each system response individually. However, obtaining the importance of variables from the system-level view still needs objective decision support. To address this issue, this study proposes a multi-output system sensitivity decision-making method based on evidence theory. The proposed method first conducts surrogate model-based Sobol sensitivity analysis for each output of the system. Subsequently, the global sensitivity information for each output is used as evidence to construct a basic probability assignment, according to a rule defined for determining basic probability assignment. Finally, a synthesis rule is applied to calculate comprehensive sensitivity information. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through validation with three numerical examples and one engineering case. This method provides more objective and rational decision support for sensitivity analysis of multi-output systems, offering significant potential benefits in parametric studies of complex systems.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stabilized finite element method (FEM) for incompressible hyperelastic materials at finite strains, addressing the computational and implementational challenges of traditional inf-sup-stable mixed FEMs. By augmenting the weak formulation with Galerkin/Least-Squares (GLS) stabilization terms, the method enables equal-order Lagrange elements ( ), eliminating the need for complex element pairings like Taylor–Hood ( ). The stabilization parameter is defined as where denotes the finite-element mesh size and is the shear modulus; this choice, derived via eigenvalue analysis-ensures robustness against volumetric locking while preserving consistency. The nonlinear system of algebraic equations is solved via a Newton–Raphson scheme with a block-preconditioned GMRES solver, achieving optimal displacement convergence rates (comparable to Taylor–Hood elements). Validated on benchmarks including Cook's membrane and a pressurized neo-Hookean cylinder, the method demonstrates optimal displacement convergence and less than 2% error in reaction forces compared to Abaqus. It reduces degrees of freedom by 30%–40% and solve times by 35% relative to Taylor–Hood elements, as shown in weak scaling tests. An industrial case study on seal compression under 4 mm displacement highlights its capability to handle contact mechanics and geometric nonlinearities, with pressure oscillations suppressed below 5%. The framework's open-source implementation, combined with its accuracy, efficiency, and robustness under mesh distortion (aspect ratios up to 5:1) and near-incompressibility ( ), makes it a versatile tool for engineering applications. Key advancements include a theoretically grounded stabilization strategy, computational efficiency gains, and seamless integration into industrial workflows.

  abstract     = {In this article, we propose a unified variational framework for deriving the evolution equation of the level set function in topology optimization, departing from conventional Hamilton–Jacobi-based formulations. The key idea is the introduction of an auxiliary domain, geometrically identical to the physical design domain, occupied by fictitious matter which is dynamically excited by the conditions prevailing in the design domain. By assigning kinetic and potential energy to this matter and interpreting the level set function as the generalized coordinate to describe its deformation, the governing equation of motion is determined via Hamilton's principle, yielding a modified wave equation. Appropriate combinations of model parameters enable the recovery of classical physical behaviors, including the standard and biharmonic wave equations. The evolution problem is formulated in weak form using variational methods and implemented in the software environment FreeFEM++. The influence of the numerical parameters is analyzed on the example of minimum mean compliance. The results demonstrate that topological complexity and strut design can be effectively controlled by the respective parameters. Notably, the proposed formulation inherently supports the nucleation of new holes and maintains a well-defined level set function without requiring explicit re-initialization procedures, both of which emerge naturally from the physically motivated variational framework. The inclusion of a damping term further enhances numerical stability. To showcase the versatility and robustness of our method, we also apply it to compliant mechanism design and a bi-objective optimization problem involving self-weight and compliance minimization under local stress constraints.},

The method incorporates two innovative concepts: an interpolation grid and supplementary particles, both aimed at refining density distributions. The proposed method is straightforward to implement, making it accessible for a wide range of applications. It proves highly effective in calculating improved hydrostatic pressure fields in high-pressure regions close to solid boundaries. Moreover, the proposed method effectively suppresses unphysical oscillations and peaks in the hydrodynamic pressure fields while alleviating unintended numerical dissipation that often occurs in long-term simulations. Additionally, the method offers greater flexibility in determining the correction interval and demonstrates excellent compatibility with various solid boundary treatments. The performance of the proposed method is validated through several numerical tests, and comparisons with other related numerical schemes are presented.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional transport codes for the simulation of tokamak plasmas are simplified versions of full 3D fluid models, where plasma turbulence is averaged out. One of the main challenges in such reduced models is to accurately reconstruct transverse transport fluxes that arise from the averaging of stresses due to fluctuations. These transverse fluxes are typically approximated by ad-hoc diffusion coefficients (turbulent eddy viscosity), manually adjusted to align numerical solutions with experimental observations. They can vary significantly depending on the type of tokamak, the experimental conditions, and even the location within the device, severely limiting the predictive capability of these codes for new configurations. To address this issue, we recently proposed an innovative approach to fusion plasma simulations by introducing two additional transport equations for turbulence-related variables (specifically, the turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate ) into the mean-flow system to estimate the turbulent eddy viscosity. This approach also introduces new free parameters, but they are primarily governed by the underlying transport physics and thus exhibit considerably less variation across devices and plasma regions. In this article, we continue an ongoing study of data assimilation techniques to determine the free parameters of the model for transverse turbulent plasma transport. Based on digital twin experiments within the framework of equations averaged over the magnetic surfaces of the tokamak, we provide an in-depth study of optimization strategies to improve the performance of the calibration algorithm in a complex configuration with considerable scale variation of the parameters.},

A regularization strategy based on Tikhonov regularization is discussed, and an automatic regularization parameter choice is introduced to deal with cases where the noise level is not known beforehand. The algorithm is tested on three examples, including artificial models where the exact solution is known and a case study from the Matilde donjon in Livorno, with experimental data measured by seismic stations during ambient vibration tests.

They therefore require the development of advanced numerical techniques to enhance computational efficiency and enable codes to simulate realistic plasma configurations relevant to tokamak operation. This paper proposes an adaptive mesh refinement strategy ( -adaptivity) in the SolEdge-HDG code for the resolution of 2D fluid-drift Braginskii equations using the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method. The strategy is based on an oscillation indicator implemented to detect under-resolved regions and dynamically refine the mesh, associated with an a posteriori accuracy indicator built on the local difference between the solution at order and the post-processed one at order considered as reference. The method thus enables both refinement, where necessary, as well as coarsening in regions where the solution is smooth. Numerical results obtained with this method in realistic tokamak geometry and plasma conditions show significant reductions in computational resources and an improvement in code robustness while maintaining high accuracy, particularly in regions with steep gradients or near the sharp angles of the tokamak walls. This work highlights the potential of such -adaptivity technique to optimize transport simulations in realistic tokamak configurations, offering a fully automated, goal-oriented mesh refinement strategy. In addition to optimizing the numerical cost of simulation, this strategy offers all users a fully automated means of designing a mesh in any tokamak geometry.},

  abstract     = {The Total Lagrangian Material Point Method (TLMPM) is a relatively new variant of the now popular MPM, a method to solve partial differential equations appearing in solid and fluid mechanics problems. In TLMPM, each solid has its own grid, and all calculations are carried out in a configuration of reference, often the original configuration. Because of this, TLMPM is free of numerical fracture, cell crossing instability and is efficient. An unfortunate result of having individual grids is that TLMPM does not have a built-in contact algorithm. Recently, a contact algorithm based on particle-to-particle contact was published for TLMPM. However, it scales quadratically with the number of particles and is therefore slow for a large number of particles. This paper introduces a new contact algorithm for TLMPM using a flexible contact grid. The advantages of this algorithm are: (1) all the advantages of TLMPM are kept, such as the absence of numerical fracture and good convergence rates; (2) the core principle of using a background grid in the material point method for contacts is preserved; (3) different basis functions can be used for each grid, and (4) boundary conditions can be enforced with more flexibility. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through several two and three-dimensional numerical examples exhibiting large elastic and plastic deformation.},

Math. 60 (2007): 1443–1487], we previously proposed the generic projection and unconstrained PPE (GePUP) formulation [Zhang, J. Sci. Comput. 67 (2016): 1134–1180] for numerically solving the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (INSE) with no-slip boundary conditions. In GePUP, the main evolutionary variable does not have to be solenoidal, with its divergence controlled by a heat equation. This work presents GePUP–FEM, high-order finite-element solvers for the INSE under the framework of the method-of-lines. Continuous Lagrange finite elements of equal order are utilized for the velocity and pressure finite element spaces to discretize the weak form of GePUP in space, while high-order implicit–explicit Runge–Kutta methods are then employed to treat the stiff diffusion term implicitly and the other terms explicitly. Due to the implicit treatment of the diffusion term, the time step size is only restricted by convection. The solver is efficient in that advancing the solution at each time step only involves solving a sequence of linear systems either on the velocity or on the pressure, with geometric multigrid methods. Furthermore, the solver is enhanced with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) so that the multiple length scales and time scales in flows at moderate or high Reynolds numbers can be efficiently resolved. Numerical tests with various Reynolds numbers are performed for the single-vortex test, the lid-driven cavity, and the flow past a cylinder/sphere, demonstrating the high-order accuracy of GePUP–FEM both in time and in space and its capability of accurately and efficiently resolving the right physics. Moreover, GePUP–FEM offers the flexibility in choosing velocity and pressure finite element spaces and is free of the standard inf-sup condition.},

  abstract     = {Plates are common flat structural elements that support loads through their flexural bending rigidity. Because plate thickness is much smaller than their surface dimensions, plate theories have emerged to simplify full three-dimensional behavior. Since analytical solutions for plate elements are not always available, especially for general loads and boundary conditions, numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), are often employed to solve these problems. Due to its general polynomial approximation of the solution field, FEM often requires a large number of degrees of freedom to achieve convergence, increasing the computational burden. In this study, we propose a new approach for the analysis of plates utilizing the eXtended finite element method (XFEM) within the Mindlin-Reissner thick plate theory. As opposed to the traditional XFEM, where the enrichment functions are applied locally, mainly targeting strong and weak discontinuities in the domain, in the proposed approach, the entire domain is globally enriched with functions inspired by analytical solutions available for simple cases of plates. The objective of the current formulation is to reduce the computational burden by reducing the number of degrees of freedom in the problem compared to the standard FE configuration. The deformation of rectangular plates is studied for different boundary and loading conditions. The enrichment functions added to the FE shape functions are based on the series expansion resulting from the analytical solution of a simply supported plate under uniform pressure. However, those functions may not necessarily match the actual problem studied. To this end, higher series terms are employed to improve the accuracy and response of the plates. A convergence study is conducted to investigate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. The results show an improved convergence rate of the XFEM compared to the standard FEM approach.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel approach utilizing cluster means to address the non-differentiability issue arising from multiple eigenvalues in eigenfrequency and bandgap optimization. This study builds upon the method proposed by Zhang et al., extending it to eigenfrequency topology optimization using bound formulations. By constructing symmetric functions of repeated eigenvalues—including cluster mean, -norm and Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) functions—the study confirms their differentiability when all repeated eigenvalues are included, that is, clusters are complete. Numerical sensitivity analyses indicate that, under some symmetry conditions, multiple eigenvalues may also be differentiable with respect to the symmetric design variables. Notably, regardless of enforced symmetry, the cluster mean approach guarantees the differentiability of multiple eigenvalues, offering a reliable solution strategy in eigenfrequency optimization. Optimization schemes are proposed to maximize eigenfrequencies and bandgaps by integrating cluster means with the bound formulations. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples of 2D and 3D solids and plate structures. All optimization results demonstrate smooth convergence under simple/multiple eigenvalues.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing the responses of solid materials under diverse loading scenarios with different types and forms is a fundamental engineering necessity. However, a load-adaptable machine learning model that can predict such responses still needs to be explored. This study formulates the load-adaptable response prediction problem as a solution operator family regression task and develops a Load-Adaptable Physics-Informed DeepONet (LA-PIDON) to learn the solution operator family of mechanics. The proposed method utilizes the product space as the input space, composed of function spaces for force boundaries, displacement boundaries, material properties, and other mechanical factors. Distinct branch networks are established for each mechanical factor and distinct trunk networks for each corresponding response. The solution family learning task is accomplished by using shared branch networks across multiple trunk networks. The load adaptability for both concentrated and distributed forces is achieved through the integration of Gaussian Random Fields(GRFs) and Fourier polynomials to generate function spaces for the force boundary; the load adaptability for force and imposed displacement excitation is achieved by incorporating the product space of force and displacement boundaries into the input space. The numerical cases of (1) elastic plates subjected to benchmark force and imposed displacement excitations, (2) benchmark beams under pure and tensile bending, and (3) 3D elastic cubes undergoing axial tension demonstrate the method's adaptability to various load scenarios and its capacity to handle complex stress states. The proposed method has potential applications in fields that require numerous simulations for diverse load scenarios, such as reliability analysis and digital twins.},

  abstract     = {A neural network is inserted into a theoretical framework for modeling the inelastic behavior of materials. The neural network replaces functional expressions for such phenomena as isotropic and directional hardening and viscoplasticity. The theoretical framework, into which the neural network is inserted, is Eulerian in the sense that all state variables are defined in the current state of the material, and the framework is independent of history variables, such as plastic strain, accumulated equivalent plastic strain, etc. The neural network-based model is compared to and trained to reproduce the uniaxial tension response of theoretical reference solutions as well as experimental results. The neural network-based model is able to reproduce the reference results with excellent precision. Also, the neural network-based model was implemented as a VUMAT in Abaqus together with one of the theoretical reference models. Deformation of a plate with a hole in it was simulated, and the outcome from the reference model and the trained neural network-based model was compared. The solutions, in terms of von Mises stress and accumulated equivalent plastic strain, were very similar. Hence, it seems like training the neural network model by use of uniaxial stress data is sufficient for being able to make accurate 3D predictions.},
