  abstract     = {The COSMOS-Web survey is the largest JWST Cycle 1 General Observer program, covering a contiguous ∼0.54 deg 2 area with NIRCam imaging in four broadband filters and a noncontiguous ∼0.2 deg 2 with parallel MIRI imaging in a single broadband filter, F770W. Here we present a comprehensive overview of the MIRI imaging observations, the data reduction procedure, the COSMOS-Web MIRI photometric catalog, and the first data release including the entire COSMOS-Web MIRI coverage. Data reduction primarily relies on the JWST Science Calibration Pipeline, supplemented by custom background subtraction to mitigate prominent instrumental artifacts and sky background within the MIRI images. We reach 5 σ (point source) limiting depths ( m F770W ∼ 25.51 based on r ∼ 0 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x02033}} 3 circular apertures) that are significantly better than initial expectations. Using the images provided in this release, we construct a photometric catalog and compare the F770W flux densities to the Spitzer/IRAC CH4 measurements from the COSMOS2020 catalog (for CH4 detections with signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 5). We find that these are in reasonable agreement with a small median offset of <0.05 mag. We also derive robust 7.7 μ m number counts spanning five orders of magnitude in flux (∼0.2–2300 μ Jy)—making COSMOS-Web the only JWST survey to date to sample such a large flux range—which are in good agreement with estimates from other JWST and IRAC surveys.},

  abstract     = {The triggers of starburst episodes are a key component to our understanding of the baryon cycle in galaxies. Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested catalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single kinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to assess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to dominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such dwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2–10, which appears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst episode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy itself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new Very Large Array 21 cm observations and unpublished archival Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy CO data to investigate the dynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an H i tail consistent with the structure reported by H. A. Kobulnicky et al. ( 1995 ), which was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather, these new observations indicate an extended H i distribution. We also find that the H i appears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a tidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of some type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a metaanalysis of available results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the starburst episode in Henize 2–10, and speculate that the large CO feature could be falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity.},

The CME is associated with an M3.6 flare and filament eruption. Observations from the AIA 171 Å images reveal the origin of pre-CME arcade ≈1 hr prior to the eruptive event. Before the onset of event, the hot AIA 131 and 94 Å images exhibit an existence of a hot flux rope, which on eruption results in the activation and eruptive expansion of the pre-CME coronal arcade. The eruptive process of pre-CME arcade consists of a slow rise evolution with a speed ≈3 km s −1 , “arcade-to-bubble” transformation, and blowout expansion of the CME-bubble with a fast speed of ≈400 km s −1 . A differential emission measure analysis suggests the presence of multithermal plasma in the bubble-structure and strong plasma heating at the core of the AR. A blowout expansion of CME is accompanied with multiple type III and a split-band type II radio bursts in association with X-ray emission up to 50 keV energies from its source region. Our observations reveal that the formation and expansion of the CME-bubble serve as the earliest signatures of the CME, capturing its development in the low corona. Concurrent X-ray and radio emissions further highlight the critical role of large-scale magnetic reconnection in powering both the flare emissions and the early evolution and dynamics of the CME.},

We map the spatially resolved kinematics of the [O iii ] gas and stars, and investigate the alignments between their global kinematic position angles (PAs). Large-scale gas motions are primarily dominated by rotation and are kinematically aligned with the stars (ΔPA ≤ 30°). However, eight galaxies exhibit nonrotational kinematic signatures (e.g., kinematic twists, possible outflows) in their ionized gas velocity fields near the nucleus. We compare aperture-wide measurements of the gas and stellar velocity dispersions ( σ gas and σ ⋆ ) to test the use of the width of the [O iii ] line core as a surrogate for σ ⋆ . Direct comparisons between σ gas and σ ⋆ show that σ gas tends to underestimate σ ⋆ , and thus is not a reliable tracer of σ ⋆ for our selected galaxies. We measure the extent of the narrow-line region (NLR) using several definitions, resulting in sizes of ∼0.1–10 kpc. For a given [O iii ] luminosity, our NLR sizes derived from the [O iii ]/H β flux ratio or an [O iii ] isophotal radius are an order of magnitude larger than those measured from past imaging data.},

  abstract     = {We use the Illustris-TNG300 simulation to investigate the anisotropic distribution of subhalos in/around dark matter halo pairs. We measure the position angle ( θ ) of each subhalo by the angle between the line connecting it to the nearest host halo and the line connecting the paired halos, and examine P(\cos \theta ) (the distribution of \cos \theta of all subhalos) for halo pairs with various separations ( d sep ), primary halo masses ( M p ), and secondary-to-primary halo mass ratios ( M s / M p ). We find that P(\cos \theta ) generally exhibits a combined result of two distinct features: the “bulging” distribution characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the “lopsided” distribution showing an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs with larger d sep and smaller M p , while the lopsidedness strengthens as M p increases. Both signals depend weakly on M s / M p , and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from the host halos. Remarkably, these measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of the halos is properly taken into account. Our findings suggest distinct origins: lopsidedness arises from simple halo overlap, while bulging reflects alignment with large-scale filaments. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large d sep , small M p , and large M s / M p .},

  abstract     = {Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for probing the internal structure and evolution of galaxies, the nature of dark matter, and the expansion history of the Universe, among many other scientific applications. For almost all of these science cases, modeling the lensing mass distribution is essential. For that, forward modeling of imaging data to the pixel level is the standard method used for galaxy-scale lenses. However, the traditional workflow of forward lens modeling necessitates a significant amount of human investigator time, requiring iterative tweaking and tuning of the model settings through trial and error. An automated lens-modeling pipeline can substantially reduce the need for human investigator time. In this paper, we present dolphin , an automated lens-modeling pipeline that combines artificial intelligence with the traditional forward-modeling framework to enable full automation of the modeling workflow. dolphin uses a neural network model to perform visual recognition of the strong lens components, then autonomously sets up a lens model with appropriate complexity and fits the model with the modeling engine, lenstronomy . Thanks to the versatility of lenstronomy , dolphin can autonomously model both galaxy–galaxy and galaxy–quasar strong lenses.},

To construct the map, we first infer the distance, extinction, and stellar types of over 700 million stars using the brutus stellar inference framework with a set of theoretical MESA Isochrone and Stellar Tracks ( MIST ) stellar models. Our resultant 3D dust map has an angular resolution of 1^{\prime} \rm{}\,\rm{}\, roughly an order of magnitude finer than existing 3D dust maps and comparable to the angular resolution of the Herschel 2D dust emission maps. We detect complexes at the range of distances associated with the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms in the fourth quadrant, as well as more distant structures out to a maximum reliable distance of d ≈ 10 kpc from the Sun. The map is sensitive up to a maximum extinction of roughly A V ≈ 12 mag. We publicly release both the stellar catalog and the 3D dust map, the latter of which can easily be queried via the Python package dustmaps . When combined with the existing Bayestar19 3D dust map of the northern sky, the DECaPS 3D dust map fills in the missing piece of the Galactic plane, enabling extinction corrections over the entire disk ∣ b ∣ < 10°.

In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in ongoing galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical “slingshot” mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect coevolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (∼2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ∼10 to 600 km s −1 and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.},

The ever-present counterstreaming flows observed within the filament are identified as interleaved unidirectional mass flows in opposing directions occurring in neighboring threads. Multiwavelength observations corroborate the multithermal nature of these counterstreaming flows: the cool H α component flows at about 10−20 km s −1 , while the warm ultraviolet and extreme-ultraviolet components reach 40–70 km s −1 . The Si iv 1400 Å line reveals significant microturbulence in the filament’s counterstreaming flows, with a nonthermal velocity width of ∼40 km s −1 . These multithermal flows emanate from compact brightenings at the filament’s ends, manifesting as small-scale, collimated upflows at their nascent phase. They continuously inject both chromospheric and transition region plasma into the filament channel, thereby feeding the counterstreaming flows. At their base, the Si iv and C ii spectral lines show pronounced line broadening and intensity enhancements, indicating significant localized chromospheric heating. Additionally, numerous small-scale photospheric flux emergence and cancellation events, with a magnitude of ∼10 17 Mx, are detected near their base. We suggest that such weak magnetic-field activities, possibly associated with unresolved magnetic reconnection events, drive these persistent upflows and localized footpoint heating. This work elucidates the multithermal origin of counterstreaming flows within a forming filament and provides evidence of localized chromospheric heating at the filament footpoints.},

Likewise, we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ( s ) neutron capture process. We explore the performance of both a binary classifier and a one-class classifier. We demonstrate that our ML models do well overall in recognizing the s process from the r process, and after training on theoretical calculations, ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We then apply the one-class classifier to numerous cases on which it did not train, including i -process stars, and a few nucleosynthesis predictions for the i process in rapidly accreting white dwarfs and r process in MHD supernovae. We demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered i -process stars to instead be of r or s in origin but likewise finds stars currently labeled as s to be potentially more aligned with i enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward.},

  abstract     = {Corotating interaction regions (CIRs) are long-lasting solar wind structures that persist over multiple solar rotations. These structures accelerate particles throughout the heliosphere and can impart significant energy onto planetary ionospheres and magnetospheres. Understanding how CIRs and their associated energetic particles evolve radially with heliocentric distance is of great interest and can give insight into acceleration mechanisms that occur within these structures. CIR solar wind and particle properties have been examined at numerous heliocentric distances but have been largely unexplored at Mars. We examine the properties of a CIR observed over two Carrington rotations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO)-A at 1 au and the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) spacecraft at 1.5 au. This CIR was observed during near-radial alignment of the spacecraft, allowing for the exclusion of significant longitudinal variations in the CIR’s properties. We find that during both rotations, the scaled solar wind density and interplanetary magnetic field are slightly higher at MAVEN than measurements at STEREO-A, and the CIR compression occurs over similar periods at both spacecraft during each event. Suprathermal particle enhancements are observed at both spacecraft during both passes of the CIR. Variations in the particle spectra between observations indicate suprathermal particle acceleration at both spacecraft, with higher-energy populations observed at 1.5 au compared to 1 au. Spectral anisotropies observed at MAVEN also indicate a combination of local and nonlocal particle acceleration, further demonstrating that the acceleration mechanisms associated with CIRs are complex and evolve with heliocentric distance.},

  abstract     = {Quasiperiodic disturbances in EUV emission intensity, propagating along polar plumes in the solar corona, are frequently observed. Analysis of these propagating disturbances in the 171 Å bandpass of the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly reveals that the wave spectrum evolves with height. Near the footpoints, the dominant spectral peak corresponds to oscillation periods of 12–15 minutes. As the disturbances propagate upward, the shorter-period spectral component diminishes, while a longer-period component of 20–30 minutes becomes dominant. Theoretical modeling of coronal slow magnetoacoustic waves effectively reproduces this spectral evolution. The model incorporates field-aligned thermal conduction and the back reaction of wave-induced perturbations on local thermal equilibrium. Coronal slow waves, driven by a broadband source with a peak at a shorter period, show a decrease in shorter-period spectral power with height, while the 20–30 minute spectral power increases due to thermal overstability. Analysis of the dispersion relations reveals that, given the chosen model parameters, the most rapidly growing spectral component corresponds to a 22.5 minute period, which aligns well with the observational findings.},

  abstract     = {The singularity structure of the electromagnetic field fluctuations in strong Alfvénic turbulence is addressed. Owing to the transverse polarization of the fluctuations, the turbulent cascade is essentially perpendicular to the direction of the guiding magnetic field. A scaling analysis of the local energy transfer rates suggests that the most intense singularities are the sites of inertial dissipation of the energy. The lack of smoothness of the electromagnetic fields can give rise to dissipative processes unrelated to collisional transport phenomena in the magnetized plasma. A log-Poisson cascade model is developed. The random multiplicative cascade process is quantized and acts on the Elsässer field increments. In a multifractal interpretation, the log-Poisson cascade is characterized by three parameters: the most probable singularity strength, the strongest singularity, and its fractal codimension. The resulting probability distribution functions are derived from discrete superpositions of dilated integral scale distributions weighted by scale-dependent Poisson distributions. In addition to the three parameters mentioned above, they depend on the standard deviation of the integral scale fluctuations. The four-parameter family of normal log-Poisson mixture distributions is sensitive to the strongest singularities responsible for inertial dissipation of the electromagnetic energy in collisionless space plasma environments.},

  abstract     = {We perform a comprehensive study of thermonuclear bursts from the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1702–429 detected with NICER and XMM-Newton. The thermonuclear burst detected with NICER shows clear evidence of a photospheric radius expansion (PRE) event and a distinct feature in the burst profile. The burst profiles demonstrate significant energy dependence, with the hardness ratio varying notably during the PRE phase. The radius of the neutron star photosphere expanded to a maximum of 23.{1}_{-3.2}^{+3.8} km while its temperature reached a minimum of ∼1.4 keV. The time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using the variable persistent emission method, indicating that the soft excess may arise from enhanced mass accretion onto the neutron star, potentially due to the Poynting–Robertson drag. Alternatively, the disk reflection model can be used to explain the soft excess emission during a burst. The time-resolved spectral study is performed for three thermonuclear bursts detected with XMM-Newton. The XMM-Newton time-resolved burst spectra can be modeled using an absorbed blackbody model, without any signatures of the PRE. We conduct a detailed spectral analysis of the 2025 NuSTAR observation of 4U 1702–429, revealing a broad iron line at 6.4 keV and a Compton hump around 20 keV, indicating X-ray reflection features. The disk reflection model relxill provides an inner disk radius of ∼12 R g and an inclination angle of ∼39°. The magnetic field strength at the pole of the neutron star is estimated to be 5.1 × 10 8 G, assuming that the accretion disk is truncated at the magnetosphere boundary.},

The electron temperature is found to increase toward the interior of the remnant ranging from 0.15 to 0.19 keV energy range within a spatial scale of 6′ (or 1.27 pc at a distance of 725 pc) from the shock front. This can be explained well by a modified Sedov solution with radiative cooling. We also show that the ionization timescales determined from our spectroscopy are significantly larger than those estimated based on the electron density of the surrounding materials and the shock velocity. This excess can be qualitatively explained by a mixing of inner multiple plasma components with different ionization states due to turbulence.},

This study is based on high-resolution optical spectra obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope. We first calculated the average chemical element abundance, the rotational velocity, and the radial velocity of the stars using the ZEEMAN2 spectrum synthesis code with the PHOENIX model atmospheres. We then studied the abundances of titanium and iron inferred from individual lines in the spectra of each star and their variations with their predicted formation depths τ 5000 . Similarly to the BHB stars cooler than 11,500 K observed in globular clusters, no clear observational evidence of vertical stratification is detected in the atmosphere of these stars. In the second part of this project, we searched for the presence of a magnetic field in the stars, applying the least-squares deconvolution technique on the Stokes I and V spectra. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field uncertainties, ranging from 8 to 30 G, effectively rule out the presence of an organized magnetic field in these targets with a strength larger than a few 100 G.},

  abstract     = {Enceladus exhibits some remarkable phenomena, including water geysers spraying through surface cracks, a global ice shell that is librating atop an ocean, a large luminosity, and rapid outward orbital migration. Here, we model the coupled evolution of Enceladus’s orbit and interior structure. We find that Enceladus is driven into a periodic state—a limit cycle. Many of Enceladus’s observed phenomena emerge from the model, and the predicted values for the orbital eccentricity, libration amplitude, shell thickness, and luminosity agree with observations. A single limit cycle lasts around 10 million years, and has three distinct stages: (1) freezing, (2) melting, and (3) resonant libration. In our model, Enceladus is currently in the freezing stage, meaning that its ice shell is getting thicker. That pressurizes the ocean, which in turn cracks the shell and pushes water up through the cracks. In this stage, the orbital eccentricity increases, as Saturn pushes Enceladus deeper into resonance with Dione. Once the eccentricity is sufficiently high, tidal heating begins to melt the shell, which is the second stage of the cycle. In the third stage, the shell remains close to 3 km thick. At that thickness, the shell’s natural libration frequency is resonant with the orbital frequency. The shell’s librations are consequently driven to large amplitude, for millions of years. Most of the tidal heating of Enceladus occurs during this stage, and the observed luminosity is a relic from the last episode of resonant libration, while the present-day heat production is small (∼1 GW).},

Our previous studies have successfully demonstrated the potential of various analysis methods in extracting essential physical properties; however, the lack of background consideration has limited their practical application. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating a realistic treatment of the experimental signal and background events with the on-going SK experiment. We therefore optimize our analysis framework to reflect realistic observational conditions, including both signal and background events. Using this framework we study several long-time supernova models, simulating the late phase neutrino observation in SK and focusing in particular on the identification of the last observed event. We discuss the possibility of model discrimination methods using timing information from this last observed event.},

We examine SED models in which either galaxy or active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission dominates the rest-frame UV or optical continuum, extracting physical properties to explore each scenario’s implications. In the galaxy-only model, we find massive, dusty stellar populations alongside unobscured, low-mass components, hinting at inhomogeneous obscuration. The AGN-only model indicates dusty, luminous AGNs with low hot dust fractions compared to typical quasars. A hybrid AGN and galaxy model suggests low-mass, unobscured galaxies in the UV, with stellar mass estimates spanning ∼2 dex across the different models, underscoring the need for caution in interpreting LRD stellar masses. With MIRI photometry, the galaxy-only model produces stellar masses within cosmological limits, but extremely high stellar mass densities are inferred. The hybrid model infers highly overmassive black holes exceeding those in recently reported high-redshift AGNs, hinting at a partial AGN contribution to the rest-optical continuum or widespread super-Eddington accretion. Our findings highlight the extreme conditions required for both AGN- and galaxy-dominated scenarios in LRDs, supporting a mixed contribution to the red continuum, or novel scenarios to explain the observed emission.},

We develop a model to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust, and as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale of 1 day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different size distributions at different distances from the source. With such a special dust environment, we fit the multiwavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by taking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is found that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of the irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can be distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value. Furthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are found to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of the NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between the spectra.},

Compared to other SEP populations, the extremely large enrichment of 3 He and much smaller though significant heavy ion enhancements suggest a common origin but without firm observational evidence due to the small size of the events. Using improved instruments close to the Sun on Solar Orbiter, we surveyed the period 2020 April—2025 May for 3 He-rich events whose rise phase phases were sufficiently undistorted and intense that the particle arrival times could be measured accurately. We found six events that met the criteria and that appear to be typical impulsive SEP events but with unusually high counting statistics. For C–Fe the mean arrival times of 226–320 keV nucleon −1 ions are simultaneous to ∼5 minutes, a small fraction of the ion propagation time from the Sun (110–310 minutes depending on heliocentric distance). H and 4 He mean arrival times showed a maximum difference of 1.6 minutes. Overall 3 He arrival times differ from the others by ∼3 ± 3 minutes. These times are sufficiently close to simultaneity to give evidence for a common acceleration mechanism. This adds a new constraint to models for these events, namely, that the accelerating waves can interact with the broad range of gyrofrequencies associated with the range charge-to-mass ratios for H–Fe.},

  abstract     = {While plane-of-sky magnetic field observations in molecular clouds are now common, observations of their line-of-sight magnetic field remain limited. To address this issue, M. Tahani et al. developed a technique based on Faraday rotation. The technique incorporates an ON–OFF approach to identify the rotation measure induced by the magnetic fields associated with the cloud. The upcoming abundance of observations of Faraday rotation from the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders necessitates robustly tested software to automatically obtain line-of-sight magnetic fields of molecular clouds. We developed software, called MC-BLOS (for molecular cloud line-of-sight magnetic field; DOI:10.5281/zenodo.15338512), to carry out the technique in an automated manner. The software’s inputs are Faraday rotation of point sources, maps of extinction or column density, results from chemical evolution code, and a parameter file that allows the user to specify the cloud name or other parameters pertaining to the technique. For each cloud, the software invokes a set of predefined initial parameters such as density, temperature, and surrounding boundary, which the user can modify. The software then runs the technique automatically, outputting line-of-sight magnetic field maps and tables (including uncertainties) at the end of the process. MC-BLOS generates diagnostic files for result evaluation and input parameter refinement, allowing for expert judgment in parameter selection. We have tested the software on previously published clouds, and the results are consistent within the reported uncertainty range. This software will facilitate the analysis of forthcoming observations of Faraday rotation, enabling a better understanding of the role of magnetic fields in molecular cloud dynamics and star formation.},

  abstract     = {Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e., capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. Using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, we study the emission of IC 443 with the objective of finding signatures of cosmic-ray acceleration at the PeV scale. Using a maximum likelihood method, we find a point source located at ( α = 94 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x000b0}} 42, δ = 22 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x000b0}} 35) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of −3.14 ± 0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cutoff at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to ∼30 TeV. Furthermore, we also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of −2.49 ± 0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.},

  abstract     = {We use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA) to explore the redshift, luminosity, and black hole mass dependence of the quasar halo occupation distribution (HOD). In both simulations, we find that the quasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass (∼10 13 M ⊙ ) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function. We note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars selected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias (a factor of ∼10–50 in the central occupation and ∼10%–70% in the satellite occupation fraction) is introduced in the reconstruction of quasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation function, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the central occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the occupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows a power-law-like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction of quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with 20%–40% of the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with previous clustering-based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while the occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and feedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole (SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter space is well modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has been found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the light curves (LCs) of luminous astronomical transients, such as supernovae, is crucial for understanding their progenitor physics, particularly with the exponential growth of survey data. However, existing methods face limitations: efficient semianalytical models (e.g., Arnett-like) employ significant physical simplifications (like time-invariant temperature profiles and simplified heating distributions), often compromising accuracy, especially for early-time LCs. Conversely, detailed numerical radiative transfer simulations, while accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large data sets. This paper introduces TransFit , a novel framework that numerically solves a generalized energy conservation equation, explicitly incorporating time-dependent radiative diffusion, continuous radioactive or central engine heating, and ejecta expansion dynamics. The model accurately captures the influence of key ejecta properties and diverse heating source characteristics on LC morphology, including peak luminosity, rise time, and overall shape. Furthermore, TransFit provides self-consistent modeling of the transition from shock-cooling to 56 Ni-powered LCs. By combining physical realism with computational speed, TransFit provides a powerful tool for efficiently inverting LCs and extracting detailed physical insights from the vast data sets of current and future transient surveys.},

For the different elements, our results for the DR rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 2 × 10 −12 –5 × 10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , 10 −13 –5 × 10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , and 2 × 10 −15 –10 −11 cm 3 s −1 , respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. Using this new atomic data (DR), we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days after the merger using the spectral synthesis code SUMO . Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and, correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr ( Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r -process compositions. Furthermore, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g., [Se III ] 4.55 μ m) and optical (e.g., Rb I 7802, 7949 Å) lines weaken in the new model. Instead, [Se I ] 5.03 μ m emerges as a signature. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.},

Kinematical analysis of 13 CO (2–1), C 18 O (2–1), H 2 CO (3 0,3 –2 0,2 ), CH 3 OH (4 2 –3 1 ) emission demonstrates that these molecular lines trace the infalling-rotating envelope and possibly a Keplerian disk, enabling us to estimate the protostar mass to be 0.15 M ⊙ < M ⋆ < 0.39 M ⊙ . The dusty disk is found to exhibit a brightness asymmetry along its minor axis in the continuum emission, probably caused by a flared distribution of the dust and the high optical depth of the dust emission. In addition, the 12 CO (2–1) and SiO (5–4) emissions show knotty and wiggling motions in the jets. Our high-angular-resolution observations revealed the most recent mass ejection events, which have occurred within the last ∼25 yr.},

  abstract     = {Within the molecular clouds of the Camelopardis OB1 (Cam OB1) association exists a region previously noted as one subgroup. However, bulk clustering from Gaia astrometry has recently shown three distinctive kinematically coherent groups, all found in a similar location in the sky (137 ⪅ l ⪅ 145 and −2 ⪅ b ⪅ 5) and at a similar distance (∼1 kpc). In this work, we derive from first principles the three proposed clusters in this region, refine the membership list and cluster ages, and, for the first time, examine the 3D structure, motion, and origin of the clusters. Using clustering of Gaia data in 3D position + 2D velocity space, supplemented by available fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey radial velocities, we find clusters of ages 10, 15.8, and 20 Myr with members numbering 140, 469, and 184, respectively. All three clusters overlap currently in 3D space. Tracing their previous locations, based on present-day motions, shows that each cluster originated in its own distinct region and exhibited no influence on each other’s formation. Two of the clusters trace their origin to different areas within the Cam OB1 association, with the oldest cluster tracing its origins to the near edge of the Perseus Arm, in the direction of the Perseus OB1 or Cassiopeia OB6 associations. Overall, this work illustrates how different stellar groups, even those originating in a different spiral arm, can visit and pass through each other as they travel through the Galaxy.},

We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the subhertz band (0.1–1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). We estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to ∼1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings weeks before mergers, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multimessenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients—whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.},

However, direct numerical simulations of these explosive phenomena have barely addressed the question of the impact of ejecta−disk collision on the midterm evolution of such explosions. This is particularly critical for a better understanding of classical and recurrent novae, where each nova cycle depends on the imprint left by the precedent explosion. In this work, we describe and analyze a set of high-resolution simulations of the ejecta−disk interaction. We show that, depending on the initial configuration of the binary system, the disk is partially or, more often, totally destroyed, which will impact the next nova explosion cycle. In the case of SNe Ia, the much larger kinetic energy carried by the ejecta always provokes complete destruction of the accretion disk. We also discuss the alterations induced in the geometry of the ejecta by the shielding effect of the disk, which has been shown to cause reduced contamination of the companion star up to a factor ∼1.5–2 in key nuclei produced during the nova outburst. In the framework of recurrent nova simulations, we report for the first time on the formation of a cavity in the ejecta after its interaction with the disk. We also describe the onset and development of several hydrodynamic instabilities such as Kelvin–Helmholtz and Richtmyer–Meshkov.},

A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates such a long distance while keeping its sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600–399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L -band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed a pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed 3D cube of the Faraday dispersion function. MRC 0600–399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600–399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with other observations, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.},

  abstract     = {Starburst galaxies, such as M82, launch kiloparsec-scale galactic outflows that interact with the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in complex ways. Apart from enriching the CGM with metals and energy, these outflows may trigger star formation in the halo—either by driving shocks into the CGM or transporting cold, star-forming gas. To investigate such processes, we analyze the star formation history (SFH) of the Southern Arcs—arc-like stellar features located ∼5 kpc from M82’s star-forming disk along the minor axis—using Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 photometry. From resolved stellar populations, we derive SFHs over the last ∼500 Myr, finding that ∼85% of the stellar mass formed between ∼150 and ∼70 Myr ago, followed by a brief pause, with the remaining ∼15% forming since ∼30 Myr ago. The two stellar populations are cospatial on scales of at least ∼200 pc. The timing of the ∼100 Myr burst aligns with star formation in the M82 disk and the age distribution of its star clusters, suggesting a causal link between the disk starburst and halo star formation. We explore two mechanisms that could explain these observations. In the first, shocks driven by the interaction between hot outflowing gas and cooler CGM material compress dense clouds, triggering collapse and star formation. In the second, stars form directly within massive, cool clouds associated with the outflow. As these clouds move ballistically through the halo, subsequent interactions with tidal debris may trigger additional star formation, producing the observed episodic structure.},

We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm s −1 for the “hit-and-stick” collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE < 10 −12 J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to 10 −10 J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding 10 −8 J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ( α ≤ 10 −5 ), while intermediate turbulence levels ( α = 10 −3 –10 −4 ) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.},

  abstract     = {The transport of high-energy particles in the presence of small-scale, turbulent magnetic fields is a long-standing issue in astrophysics. Analytical theories on transport perpendicular to the large-scale magnetic field disagree with numerical simulations at rigidities where the particles’ gyroradii are slightly smaller than the correlation length of turbulence. At the same time, extending the numerical simulations to lower rigidities has proven computationally prohibitive. We present an analytical model for the perpendicular transport, based on (1) initial particle transport along field lines, (2) the transport of field lines, and (3) the eventual decorrelation of particles from field lines. Transport parallel to the large-scale field is governed by pitch-angle scattering, and so for times larger than the inverse pitch-angle diffusion coefficient, particles spatially diffuse in the parallel direction. Our results suggest that perpendicular diffusion occurs when particles have displaced in the perpendicular direction by a few correlation lengths of turbulence. We have tested the analytical theory by running a large suite of test particle simulations at unprecedentedly low rigidities, making extensive use of graphical processing units. Our numerical results exhibit a nonstandard rigidity dependence for the perpendicular diffusion coefficient at intermediate rigidities. At the lowest rigidities, the standard rigidity dependence is recovered. The simulated diffusion coefficients are nicely reproduced by our analytical model. We have traced the nonstandard rigidity dependence to a subdiffusive phase in the field line transport. Our study confirms our understanding of the escape of cosmic rays from the Galactic halo and its rigidity dependence. It also rejects speculations about different rigidity dependencies of the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients at very low rigidities that were invoked to explain nonstandard gamma-ray spectra from the Galactic center. Other possible applications concern particle acceleration at perpendicular shocks.},

  abstract     = {We present multiband ATLAS and ZTF photometry for SN 2019tsf, a Type Ib stripped-envelope supernova (SESN). The slow spectral evolution could be associated with an uncommon explosion mechanism specific to this SN. Possible explanations include fallback accretion onto a compact remnant or a long-lived central engine, both of which could provide extended energy injection responsible for the late-time rebrightening and unusual spectral features. The rebrightening observations represent the latest photometric measurements of a multipeaked Type Ib SN. As late-time photometry and spectroscopy suggest no hydrogen, the potential circumstellar material (CSM) must be H-poor. The absence of a nebular phase and the lack of narrow emission lines in the late-time spectra (>142 days) of the SNe suggest that any CSM interaction is likely asymmetric and enveloped by the SN ejecta. However, an extended CSM structure is evident through a follow-up radio campaign with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), indicating a source of bright optically thick radio emission at late times, which is highly unusual among H-poor SESNe. We attribute this phenomenology to an interaction of the supernova ejecta with asymmetric CSM, potentially disk-like, and we present several models that may explain the origin of this rare Type Ib supernova. We propose a warped disk model in which a tertiary companion—commonly present around massive stars—perturbs the progenitor’s CSM, producing density enhancements that may explain the observed multipeaked SN 2019tsf light curve. This SN 2019tsf is a unique SN Type Ib among the recently discovered class of SNe that undergo mass transfer at the moment of explosion.},

The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86−3.70 μ m spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50–7.34 μ m region. Higher-spectral-resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 μ m region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 μ m aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at ∼3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 μ m. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon. Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 μ m aliphatic and the 3.3 μ m aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 μ m bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from the 3.25 μ m band seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.},

  abstract     = {Stars with outflows interacting with ambient gas experience accelerations arising from the gravitational feedback induced by the interaction structure. In this work, three-dimensional local shearing box simulations are performed to investigate the dynamical evolution of a star with outflows embedded in the outer regions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. Two types of stellar wind are considered, isotropic winds and axisymmetric jets, along with variations in the radial pressure gradient profile. The results show that antifriction enables AGN stars to acquire angular momentum from the ambient gas, resulting in outward migration away from the disk center. The formation and stability of the headwind structure, which is crucial for maintaining antifriction, are sensitive to both the strength of the stellar outflow and the radial pressure gradient of the disk gas. Once the headwind structure is disrupted, the antifriction effect ceases to operate effectively. A case study is also presented, focusing on a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) in an AGN disk. It is shown that jet material launched along the z -axis is confined to the trailing side of the object’s motion by high gas inflow velocities, thereby activating antifriction and inducing outward migration. If such an sBH migrates inward initially, the interplay between inward and outward migration may trap it at an equilibrium radius, potentially facilitating the formation and merger of black hole binaries.},

  abstract     = {We present a new method for identifying Galactic halo substructures accreted from dwarf galaxies by combining metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) with orbital parameters. Using apogalactic distance–orbital phase space, we assume that the MDF peak of a substructure reflects its progenitor’s chemical signature. We test this approach with two Galactic potentials (St \ddot{a} ckel and McMillan) and find consistent results. Our sample consists of retrograde halo stars with low orbital inclinations and intermediate eccentricities (0.5 < e ≤ 0.7), drawn from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Large sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope spectroscopy combined with Gaia DR3 astrometry. We identify four distinct low-inclination retrograde substructures (LRS 1, LRS 2, LRS 3, LRS 4) with MDF peaks at [Fe/H] = −1.5, −1.7, −1.9, and −2.1, respectively; LRS 3 is newly discovered. Further analysis reveals an additional stream (LRS 2B) with [Fe/H] = −2.3 embedded within LRS 2; the remaining LRS 2 stars (LRS 2A) are associated with Sequoia. LRS 1 is likely linked to Thamnos 2 and Arjuna, and LRS 4 is likely linked to I’itoi. Comparison with the ED-2 stream suggests that LRS 2B is chemically distinct, but high-resolution spectroscopy is required to confirm whether they originate from separate progenitors. Our MDF-based approach demonstrates the utility of chemodynamical space for uncovering halo substructures, while highlighting caveats such as metallicity gradients and redshift evolution of the mass–metallicity relation, which may blur the mapping between MDF peaks and progenitors.},

The model features photon indices of Γ 1 = 1.19 ± 0.07 and Γ 2 = 1.47 ± 0.02 below and above a break energy of E b = 7.7 ± 0.8 keV. The resulting unabsorbed 2–10 keV flux from the pulsar is (9.{5}_{-0.3}^{+0.4})\times 1{0}^{-12}\,{\rm{erg}}\,{{\rm{cm}}}^{-2}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} . Furthermore, timing analysis of NICER data spanning MJD 58250 to 60630 reveals a very large glitch occurring around MJD 59300, characterized by a frequency jump of Δ ν = 29.367(7) × 10 −6 Hz, which can be well explained by the vortex creep model. Phase-resolved spectral analysis indicates a clear anticorrelation between the photon index and the pulse intensity, suggesting spectral hardening at the pulse peak.},

When chromospheric plasma is sufficiently heated, it can flow into coronal loops, which subsequently cool down due to radiation. From observations, we infer that this cooling does not occur uniformly, often resulting in coronal condensations such as coronal rain. To date, coronal condensations have only been found in simulations of steadily heated loops, and never in impulsively heated ones. We implement spatiotemporally variable elemental abundances in a radiative hydrodynamic code. Flows, including chromospheric evaporation, directly cause a shift in the local elemental abundances, which then affects the local radiative loss rate. As a consequence, we find that incorporating spatiotemporal low first ionization potential elemental abundances into coronal loop simulations directly causes coronal condensations, which are otherwise absent in impulsively heated loop or flare models. We conclude that spatiotemporal variations in elemental abundances are a fundamental feature of the solar corona and are therefore necessary to accurately model radiation.},

  abstract     = {Together with gas, stars, and supermassive black holes, dust is crucial in stellar and galaxy evolution. Hence, understanding galaxies’ dust properties across cosmic time is critical to studying their evolution. In addition to photometric constraints on the absorption of blue light and its reemission at infrared wavelengths, dust grain properties can be explored spectroscopically via polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands in the mid-IR. The new SPHEREx space telescope conducts an all-sky spectrophotometric survey of stars and galaxies at wavelengths of 0.75–5 μ m, making it ideal for studying the widespread presence of the 3.3 μ m PAH emission across galaxy populations out to z ∼ 0.4. In this paper, we simulated galaxy spectra to investigate SPHEREx's capability to study PAH emission in such galaxies. We find that for the all-sky survey the PAH 3.3 μ m emission band flux can be measured to 30% accuracy at {\mathrm{log}}\,(M/{M}_{\odot })\gt 9.5 and star formation rate (SFR) > 1 M ⊙ yr −1 at z = 0.1, {\mathrm{log}}\,(M/{M}_{\odot })\gt 10.5 and SFR > 10 M ⊙ yr −1 at z = 0.2–0.3, and {\mathrm{log}}\,(M/{M}_{\odot })\gt 11 and SFR > 100 M ⊙ yr −1 at z = 0.4. For deep SPHEREx fields, a factor of ∼10 deeper sensitivity limits can be reached. Overall, SPHEREx will enable the measurement of the 3.3 μ m PAH band emission in several hundred thousand galaxies across the sky, providing a population study of the smallest dust grains (“nano grains”) and radiation properties in massive galaxies in the nearby Universe.},

This collision results in shock heating and a modified density structure for the ejecta, both of which affect the light curve. As highlighted by D. Kasen, these considerations are particularly relevant for Type Ia supernovae, as the companion is expected to be Roche-lobe filling at the time of the explosion. We simulate here the interaction between Type Ia supernova ejecta and a white dwarf donor using Athena++, finding the formation of a low-density wake extending to higher velocities than the unperturbed ejecta. Radiation hydrodynamics is then used to generate synthetic light curves for the first day after the explosion for a range of viewing angles. We find that the hot, high-velocity, shocked ejecta yield L > 10 40 erg s −1 over half the sky in the first few hours. The photosphere within the shock-heated ejecta cools and recedes in velocity space, partially obscuring it from view, as heating from radioactive nickel becomes increasingly important in driving the supernova’s luminosity. By one day after the explosion, the luminosity measured by observers looking directly into the wake is dimmer than that of a normal Type Ia supernova by 15% due to the modified density structure.},

  abstract     = {We report the discovery of diffuse radio emission within SNR G338.3−0.0 using new MeerKAT observations at 816 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The radio emission spatially overlaps with the X-ray pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by PSR J1640−4631 and the GeV/TeV γ -ray source HESS J1640−465. The morphology of this radio emission is centrally peaked and its extent is well contained within the SNR shell. A lack of mid- and far-infrared counterparts and the absence of cataloged H ii regions argue against a thermal origin, while the morphology and radial profile are suggestive of a PWN origin powered by PSR J1640−4631. Under this assumption, we use a one-zone, time-dependant model to reproduce the size and broadband (radio, X-ray, and γ -ray) spectral energy distribution of the PWN. The modeling and broadband properties of this PWN suggest it is currently interacting with the reverse shock within its host SNR. This evolutionary stage is associated with particles escaping the PWN and entering the interstellar medium, suggesting this object may be an important source of Galactic PeV e ± .},
