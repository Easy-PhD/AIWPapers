  abstract     = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided critical mid-infrared data for cold brown dwarfs. It has also provided low-resolution near-infrared spectra, and for faint sources these are the first spectra at these wavelengths. We use these data and other literature sources to synthesize near-infrared photometry on the Mauna Kea Observatories (MKO) system for 19 T and Y dwarfs, on the Euclid system for 44 T and Y dwarfs, and on the Roman systems for 48 T and Y dwarfs. We also synthesize Euclid I E magnitudes for 15 T and Y dwarfs. Using the S. A. Beiler et al. ( 2024 ) observational effective temperatures ( T eff ), together with ATMO 2020++ model colors, we show that the absolute 4.6 μ m magnitude can be used as a proxy for T eff . We present a polynomial fit to the M W2 : T eff relationship for cool dwarfs with 250 ≲ T eff K ≲ 1000. We select five Y dwarfs with 275 ≲ T eff K ≲ 400 that have a range in near- to mid-infrared colors. Comparison of the JWST spectral energy distribution to ATMO 2020++ models indicate that Y dwarfs that are bluer in J − W2 are lower gravity or more metal rich than their redder counterparts, with stronger CO and CO 2 absorption at 4.2 ≲ λ μ m ≲ 4.9. The near-infrared color diagrams show significant scatter, with complex dependencies on T eff , metallicity, and gravity. In order to disentangle these effects, opacity sources for cool model atmospheres need to be more complete at λ < 1 μ m.},

VERITAS has collected ∼40 hr of data that we used to set ULs to the emission above 200 GeV. The HAWC data, collected over ∼2400 days, reveal emission between 3 and 146 TeV, with a significance of 7.5 σ , favoring an extended source model. The best-fit spectrum measured by HAWC is characterized by a simple power law with a spectral index of 2.45 ± 0.11 stat . Fermi-LAT analysis finds a point source with a very soft spectrum in the LHAASO J2108+5157 region, consistent with the 4FGL-DR3 catalog results. The XMM-Newton analysis yields a null detection of the source in the 2–7 keV band. The broadband spectrum can be interpreted as a pulsar and a pulsar wind nebula system, where the GeV gamma-ray emission originates from an unidentified pulsar, and the X-ray and TeV emissions are attributed to synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering of electrons accelerated within a pulsar wind nebula. In this leptonic scenario, our X-ray upper limit provides a stringent constraint on the magnetic field, which is ≲1.5 μ G.},

  abstract     = {Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are systems with gas-phase oxygen abundances below ∼5% solar metallicity (12+log(O/H) ≤ 7.35). These galaxies populate the metal-poor end of the mass–metallicity and luminosity–metallicity relations (MZR and LZR, respectively). Recent studies have found XMP galaxies in the nearby Universe to be outliers on the LZR, where they show enhanced luminosities relative to other galaxies of similar gas-phase oxygen abundance. Here, we present a study of the recently discovered XMP galaxy Leonessa and characterize the system’s properties using new imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Green Bank Telescope and Hobby–Eberly Telescope. We use these observations to measure a tip of the red giant branch distance (15.86 ± 0.78 Mpc) to Leonessa, the H i gas mass, the gas-phase oxygen abundance, and N/O ratio. We find Leonessa is an isolated, gas-rich (gas fraction μ = 0.69), low-mass (log( M ⋆ / M ⊙ ) = 6.12 ± 0.08), XMP (12+log(O/H) = 7.32 ± 0.04), star-forming galaxy at a distance of 15.86 ± 0.78 Mpc. Our measurements show that Leonessa agrees with the MZR, but disagrees with the LZR; we conclude the LZR offset is due to recent star formation enhancing the system’s luminosity. To investigate possible chemical evolution pathways for nearby XMP galaxies, we also compile a comparison sample of 150 dwarf galaxies (53 XMP systems) taken from the literature with gas-phase metallicity measurements based on the direct method. We find evidence for an anticorrelation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and H i gas-to-stellar mass ratios. We posit Leonessa is undergoing a chemical evolution pathway typical of field dwarf galaxies.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging the large sample size of low-resolution spectroscopic surveys to constrain white dwarf stellar structure requires an accurate understanding of the shapes of hydrogen absorption lines, which are pressure broadened by the Stark effect. Using data from both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Survey, we show that substantial biases (5–15 km s −1 ) exist in radial velocity measurements made from observations at low spectral resolution relative to similar measurements from high-resolution spectra. Our results indicate that the physics of line formation in high-density plasmas, especially in the wings of the lines, are not fully accounted for in state-of-the-art white dwarf model atmospheres. We provide corrections to account for these resolution-induced redshifts in a way that is independent of an assumed mass–radius relation, and we demonstrate that statistical measurements of gravitational redshift with these corrections yield improved agreement with theoretical mass–radius relations. Our results provide a set of best practices for white dwarf radial velocity measurements from low-resolution spectroscopy, including those from SDSS, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the 4 m Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope, and the Wide-Field Multiplexed Spectroscopic Facility.},

  abstract     = {There are various surveys that will provide excellent data to search for and localize fast radio bursts (FRBs). The BINGO project will be one such survey, and this collaboration has already estimated an FRB detection rate that the project will yield. We present a forecast of the future constraints on our current cosmological model that the BINGO FRB detections and localizations will have when added to other current cosmological data sets. We quantify the dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift ( z ) for the BINGO FRB mock sample. Furthermore, we use current data sets (supernova, baryonic acoustic oscillation, and cosmic microwave background data) prior to assessing the efficacy of constraining dark energy models using Monte Carlo methods. Our results show that a spatially localized BINGO FRB data set will provide promising constraints on the population of host galaxies' intrinsic DM and be able to measure the nuisance parameters present within an FRB cosmological analysis. They will also provide alternative estimates on other parameters such as the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation of state. In particular, we should see that BINGO FRB data can put constraints on the degenerate w − H 0 plane, which the cosmic microwave background is incapable of measuring, allowing FRBs to be a viable alternative to baryonic acoustic oscillation to constrain the dark energy equation of state. We conclude that FRBs remain a promising future probe for cosmology and that the FRBs localized by the BINGO project will contribute significantly to our knowledge of the current cosmological model.},

  abstract     = {The formation and evolution of galaxies are intricately linked to the baryon cycle, which fuels star formation while shaping chemical abundances within galaxies. Investigating the relationship between star formation and metallicity for large samples of galaxies requires expensive IFU surveys or sophisticated tools to analyze grism data. Here we analyze JWST NIRISS slitless grism data using Sleuth , a tool that forward models and infers spatially resolved physical properties from grism data, including observations from JWST NIRISS/NIRCam and future grism data like that from the Roman Space Telescope. Sleuth enables the extraction of high-quality emission line maps from slitless spectra, overcoming contamination and spatially varying stellar populations, which previously limited such studies. Utilizing Sleuth with data from the Canadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey, we investigated the relationship between metallicity and star formation in the star-forming clumps of galaxies at 0.6 < z < 1.35. We analyzed a sample of 20 galaxies, extracted high-quality emission line maps with Sleuth , and analyzed, in detail, the spatially resolved properties of star-forming clumps. Using H α , [S II ], and [S III ] emission line maps, we examined the spatially resolved metallicities, ionization, and star formation rates of our sample. Our findings reveal that these star-forming clumps show lower metallicities (∼0.1 dex) than their surrounding galactic environments, indicating a metallicity dilution of 20% within the clumps’ gas. Our analysis indicates that these clumps exhibit intensified star formation and reduced metallicity, likely due to the inflow of metal-poor gas. These clumps illustrate the dynamic relationship between star formation and chemical enrichment within galaxies.},

  abstract     = {The nonlinear coupling between stellar convection and rotation is of great interest because it relates to understanding both stellar evolution and activity. We investigate the influence of rotation and the Coriolis force on the dynamics and thermodynamic structure of an F-type main-sequence star with a shallow outer convection zone. We perform a series of 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of a 1.47 M ⊙ star for different rotation rates (periods of rotation 1 and 14 days) and with local computational domains (102.4 Mm × 102.4 Mm × 50.6 Mm) placed at latitudes of 0 ° (equator), 30 ° , and 60 ° , using the f -plane approximation. Because the star has a relatively shallow convection zone (28.5 Mm thick or about 3% R * ), we model its dynamics from the upper layers of the radiative zone, the whole convection zone, and the low atmosphere. The initial simulation results indicate that rotation suppresses temperature and density perturbations in the upper convection zone, leading to a decrease in the mean temperature throughout the convection zone. In addition to the multiscale granular-type convection, the simulations reveal the formation of roll-like patterns, the circulation in which is responsible for the retrograde flows extending from the photosphere to the bottom of the convection zone, where the mean flows transition to prograde motions with the onset of solid body rotation in the radiative zone, forming the tachocline in the overshooting layer. In this paper, we primarily discuss the properties of the outer convection zone for different rotation rates. A detailed analysis of the properties of the tachocline, the overshoot layer, as well as the properties of acoustic and gravity waves, will be discussed in follow-up papers.},

  abstract     = {The solar corona is much hotter than the photosphere and chromosphere, but the physical mechanism responsible for heating the coronal plasma remains unidentified. The thermal microwave emission, which is produced in a strong magnetic field above sunspots, is a promising but barely exploited tool for studying the coronal magnetic field and plasma. We analyzed the microwave observations of eight solar active regions obtained with the Siberian Radioheliograph in the years 2022–2024 in the frequency range of 6–12 GHz. We produced synthetic microwave images based on various coronal heating models, and determined the model parameters that provided the best agreement with the observations. The observations and simulations strongly favor either a steady-state (continuous) plasma heating process or high-frequency heating by small energy release events with a short cadence. The average magnetic field strength in a coronal loop was found to decrease with the loop length, following a scaling law with the most probable index of about −0.55. In the majority of cases, the estimated volumetric heating rate was weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength and decreased with the coronal loop length following a scaling law with an index of about −2.5. Among the known theoretical heating mechanisms, the model based on wave transmission or reflection in coronal loops acting as resonance cavities was found to provide the best agreement with the observations. The obtained results did not demonstrate a significant dependence on the emission frequency in the considered range.},

  abstract     = {The lithium-dip observed in mid-F dwarfs remains a long-standing challenge for stellar evolution models. We present high-precision stellar parameters and A (Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the Li-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124 stars with T eff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly beyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both components within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of comoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that rotational spin down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in the Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km s −1 shows higher A (Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip, indicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we observe a correlation between A (Li) and v sin i : fast rotators retain higher A (Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A (Li) and greater dispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A (Li) varies widely, suggesting that differences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how much Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down rapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow rotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that rotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond the effects of stellar age and mass.},

  abstract     = {Kinematics of solar eruptive filaments is one of the important diagnostic parameters for predicting whether solar eruptions would induce geomagnetic storms. Particularly, some geomagnetic storms might be induced by solar filament eruptions originating from unexpected surface source regions because of nonradial ejection. The nonradial ejection of filaments has received widespread attention but remains inconclusive. We select two eruptive filaments, both of which are supported by flux ropes, as indicated by the hot channel structures seen in the 94 Å images and the hook-shaped brightenings where the filament material falls back. We measure the three-dimensional ejection trajectory of the eruptive filaments by integrating the simultaneous observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Furthermore, we calculate the distribution of the poloidal field along the ejection path and compare it to the ejection acceleration. It is revealed that the reinforcement of the poloidal magnetic field may lead to the suppression of the acceleration, with the acceleration resuming its increase only when the poloidal field diminishes to a certain level. Additionally, we compute the spatial distribution of the poloidal field in various directions and find that the poloidal magnetic field above the filaments is asymmetric. For both investigated events, the filaments appear to eject toward the side where the poloidal magnetic field is weaker, indicating that the eruptive filaments tend to propagate along the side with weaker strapping force. This may provide a new explanation for the inclined ejection of filaments.},

  abstract     = {We present a Chandra/ACIS-I study of X-ray sources in BOSS 1441, a protocluster at z = 2.32 ± 0.02 that exhibits a prominent overdensity of Ly α emitters (LAEs). Using a 45 ks observation, we identify seven X-ray sources spatially coincident with LAE density peaks. The average X-ray photon index for the seven sources, derived from an absorbed power-law model with Galactic absorption fixed, is 1.49 (ranging from −0.68 to 2.51), corresponding to an average luminosity of 6.85 × 10 44 erg s −1 in the rest-frame 2–33 keV band, with individual luminosities spanning (3.57–13.96) × 10 44 erg s −1 . Three sources exhibit relatively flat spectral slopes. Two are associated with the MAMMOTH-1 nebula, while the third, located at the edge of BOSS 1441 with a \gt 5\,^{\prime} \, offset from the LAE density peak, resides in a region with a high submillimeter-band density. We estimate the fraction of X-ray-detected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) among the LAEs to be 11.{5}_{-4.6}^{+3.8} \% , approximately double that of previously studied LAEs. This elevated fraction suggests BOSS 1441 is in a mature evolutionary stage, with even higher AGN fractions expected in massive LAEs such as PKS 1138-262. In contrast, the submillimeter galaxy population shows a lower AGN fraction ( 6.{9}_{-4.5}^{+6.9} \% ), consistent with their typically obscured nature. These results indicate that the protocluster’s massive galaxies are evolving into the bright red sequence galaxies observed in local clusters, where AGNs likely play a critical role in quenching their star formation.},

  abstract     = {We analyze 4859 O stars in the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across P = 2.5–200 days follows a power law f log P ∝ (log P ) Π with Π = −0.34 ± 0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik’s law (Π = 0). We divide our O stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B stars and other O stars. The EB fraction of O stars in young clusters is 10.2% ± 0.6%, which matches the 10.8% ± 2.1% for O stars in young Milky Way clusters. O stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5% ± 0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N -body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities v proj < 24.5 km s −1 ) and field runaways ( v proj > 24.5 km s −1 ) are 7.3% ± 1.0% and 4.7% ± 1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O stars were dynamically ejected via N -body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and <28%, respectively, to the field population.},

Since becoming operational in 2024 January, MAG has continuously recorded local magnetic field data and has captured several solar transient events over the past 1 yr. During these events, the IMF, typically around 5 nT, exhibited significant enhancements in magnitude. This study focuses on three such solar events observed in 2024 March, May, and October. Analysis of the magnetic field power spectra during these events reveals fluctuations consistent with Kolmogorov-type turbulence, characterized by a spectral slope close to −5/3. To emphasize changes in spectral behavior, the event-day spectra are compared with those from a day when the quiet solar wind conditions prevail. A marked contrast is observed: while the quiet periods exhibit anisotropic turbulence, the extreme events display quasi-isotropic behavior, with spectral slopes closely following the Kolmogorov spectrum across all three IMF components. The results, including detailed variations in spectral slope and turbulence characteristics, are presented and discussed in this paper.},

  abstract     = {The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and reemits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-near-infrared (NIR) band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound–free and free–free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has νL ν ∝ ν 1.5 at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow’s outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the prototype FBOT AT2018cow by fitting the spectra to the observed spectral energy distribution. The best-fit mass-loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is {M}_{{\rm{out}}}\approx 5.{7}_{-0.4}^{+0.4}\,{M}_{\odot } . If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a preexplosion mass of ∼20 M ⊙ ), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least ≈14 M ⊙ . This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.},

We estimate ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions and densities at z ∼ 17 and z ∼ 25. The number density of galaxies with absolute magnitudes of −19 < M UV < −18 at z ∼ 17 ( z ∼ 25) is a factor of 4 (25) smaller than at z ∼ 12; the luminosity density presents a similar evolution. Compared to state-of-the-art galaxy simulations, we find the need for an enhanced UV-photon production at z = 17–25 in M DM = 10 8.5−9.5 M ⊙ dark matter halos, provided by an increase in the star formation efficiency at early times and/or by intense compact starbursts with enhanced emissivity linked to strong burstiness, low or primordial gas metallicities, and/or a top-heavy initial mass function. There are a few robust theoretical predictions for the evolution of galaxies above z ∼ 20 in the literature; however, the continuing rapid drop in the halo mass function would predict a more rapid evolution than we observe if photon production efficiencies remained constant. Our z > 16 candidates present mass-weighted ages around 30 Myr, and attenuations A ( V ) < 0.1 mag. Their average stellar mass is M ⋆ ∼ 10 7 M ⊙ , implying a stellar-to-baryon mass fraction around 10% if the emissivity increases with redshift, or significantly higher otherwise. Three candidates present very blue UV spectral slopes ( β ∼ −3) compatible with Population III young (≲10 Myr) stars and/or high escape fractions of ionizing photons; the rest have β ∼ −2.5 similar to the z = 10–12 samples.},

If particles injected at the base of the loops have Lorentz factors ≳10 2 , the RICS spectra will be attenuated by both one-photon pair production and photon splitting in the ultrastrong magnetar fields, producing additional spectral components from pair synchrotron radiation and split photons that produce further generations of pairs and split photons. We investigate such cascades initiated by the primary injected electrons through a Monte Carlo simulation, and study the cascade spectra and pair distributions. For most observer angles, the pair synchrotron and split-photon spectra dominate the RICS primary spectra and produce complex polarization signals. In particular, the synchrotron spectra are highly polarized with degree 40%–80%, are softer than the RICS spectra, and may account for the high polarization of some magnetar spectra observed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer above 3 keV.},

Near-infrared data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) detect the scattered starlight from the disk surface and reveal a large shadow that extends over its entire southern half. We model the ALMA continuum and line data to determine the outer-disk geometry and the central stellar mass. Using radiative transfer models, we demonstrate that a misaligned inner disk, tilted in both inclination and position angle with respect to the outer disk, can reproduce the salient scattered-light features seen with VLT. Applying an image threshold algorithm to compare disk morphologies and training a neural network on a set of high-signal-to-noise-ratio models, we forward model the data and determine the inner-disk geometry. We find that the rotation axes of the inner and outer disks are misaligned by 38° and constrain the mass and location of a perturbing planetary or substellar companion. The technique of simulation-based inference that is illustrated here is broadly applicable for radiative transfer modeling of other objects.},

We find a systematic trend of higher gas excitation with increasing star formation rate (SFR) and SFR surface density (Σ SFR ), with the range of variations being even larger than predicted by simulations. Power-law fits of the CO line ratios as a function of SFR and Σ SFR provide a good description of the trends seen in our sample and also accurately predict values for a wide range of galaxy types compiled from the literature. Based on these fits, we provide prescriptions for estimating CO(1–0) luminosities and molecular gas masses using CO(3–2) or CO(2–1) in cases where CO(1–0) is not observed directly. We compare our observed SLEDs with molecular cloud models in order to examine how the physical properties of cold gas vary across the galaxy population. We find that gas conditions in star-forming and starburst galaxies lie on a continuum with increasing gas density in more actively star-forming systems.},

  abstract     = {M31N 2017-01e is the second-fastest recurrent nova known, with a recurrence period of 2.5 yr in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). This system exhibits a unique combination of properties: a low outburst amplitude (∼3 mag), starkly contrasting with known recurrent novae (typically ≥6 mag), and a very fast evolution ( t 2 ∼ 5 days). Its position coincides with a bright variable source ( M V ∼ −4.2, B − V = 0.042) displaying a 14.3 day photometric modulation, which has been suggested as the likely progenitor. We present a multiwavelength analysis of optical and UV data spanning quiescence and the 2019 and 2024 outbursts. Archival high-resolution imaging reveals two nearby faint sources within 5″ of the proposed nova system, which we identified as unrelated field stars. Color analysis and spectral energy distribution fitting suggest the progenitor is likely an early-type star. Combined with archival spectra consistent with a B-type star with H α in emission, this points to the quiescent counterpart being a Be star with a circumstellar disk. We propose that M31N 2017-01e arises from a rare BeWD binary , where the white dwarf (WD) accretes from the decretion disk of its companion, explaining its rapid recurrence, low-amplitude outbursts, and unusual quiescent luminosity and color. This analysis highlights M31N 2017-01e as a compelling outlier among recurrent novae, suggesting a distinct accretion mechanism and evolutionary path that challenges the prevailing paradigm.},

  abstract     = {Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving toward the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity ζ RT scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.},

  abstract     = {The stellar obliquity of a planetary system is often used to help constrain the system’s formation and evolution. One of the mechanisms to reorient the stellar spin involves a secular resonance crossing due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk when the system also has an inclined, distant (∼300 au) binary companion. This mechanism is likely to operate broadly due to the ∼50% binary fraction of FGK dwarfs and can play an important role in setting the initial stellar obliquities prior to any dynamical evolution. In this work, we revisit this mechanism analytically for idealized, homologously evolving disk models and show that the resulting stellar obliquities are broadly distributed between 60° and 180° for most warm and cold planets. We further show that nonhomologous disk dissipation, such as the development of a photoevaporatively opened gap at ∼2 au, can help maintain the orbital alignment of warm planets, in agreement with observations. Our results represent the proper primordial obliquities for planetary systems with distant binary companions. They also represent the obliquities of stars with no present-day binary companions if these companions are dynamically unbound during the birth cluster phase of evolution, a process that occurs on a comparable timescale as the disk-driven obliquity excitation.},

Most earlier imaging-spectroscopic studies have relied on slit-based spectrometers, which offer high spectral resolution but are limited in spatiotemporal coverage and temperature diagnostics. In contrast, slitless spectrographs like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) produce overlapping spatial-spectral data (overlappograms) to enable wide-field imaging spectroscopy with broader temperature coverage. However, extracting elemental abundances from overlappogram data remains inherently challenging due to spatial and spectral confusion.

  abstract     = {Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)–type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the SMUGGLE framework and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total 0.5–2 keV luminosity is consistent within uncertainties with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond ∼5 kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least 1–2 orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central ∼5 kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, active galactic nuclei feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm (∼10 5 K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the SMUGGLE model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW O vi absorbers.},

  abstract     = {Accurate thermal emission models of neutron stars are essential for constraining the dense matter equation of state. However, incorporating realistic magnetic field structures is computationally prohibitive, severely constraining feasible parameter space exploration. In this work, we develop a neural network (NN) emulator to generate model thermal bolometric X-ray light curves of millisecond pulsars with multipolar magnetic fields. We assess the NN’s predictive and computational performance across a broad parameter space. We find that for a static vacuum field model, the NN provides a >400 times speedup. We integrate this NN emulator into a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) framework to replace the computationally expensive physical model during parameter exploration. Applied to PSR J0030+0451, this approach allows the MCMC to reach equilibrium in ∼1 day on 4000 cores, where with the original physical model alone it would have taken more than a year on the same hardware. We compare posterior distributions by running equivalent MCMC iterations with both the NN and the physical model, evaluate differences in distributions when continuing the physical model MCMC from the NN MCMC equilibrium state, and assess variations in posterior distributions resulting from NNs trained on data sets of different sizes. Our NN architecture is agnostic to the underlying physics of the physical model and can be trained for any other physical model, opening many previously intractable avenues of analysis. The NN speed remains the same regardless of the complexity of the physical model it was trained to emulate, allowing greater speedups for more complex physical models.},

Due to the intrinsic nature of this quantity, \dot{P} analysis has been used to probe fundamental physics, such as constraining the mass of hypothetical axion particles. However, most white dwarfs are expected to host planets that could induce an external source of period change, caused by the light travel time variations from reflex motion about the system barycenter. Assuming a plausible distribution of planets that could orbit white dwarf stars, we quantify the amount of reflex motion expected from undiscovered planets as an important source of extrinsic error in \dot{P} analyses. While the median error from reflex motion is ∼10 −15 s s −1 (similar to the secular \dot{P} rates expected for cool DAV pulsators), individual close-in planets could cause \dot{P} errors as large as 10 −11 s s −1 .},

Here we propose that the magnetic reconnection induced by the migration of satellite black holes (sBHs) in the AGN disk can be a new plausible mechanism for AGN short-term variability. During the sBH migration, the comoving plasmas surrounding the sBH could influence the large-scale magnetic field of the AGN disk and trigger the magnetic reconnections to contribute to AGN UV/optical variability. Meanwhile, high-magnetization plasmas are more likely to escape the disk and cause a secondary magnetic reconnection in the corona. For a ∼10 2 –10 3 M ⊙ sBH in the inner regions of the disk surrounding a supermassive black hole with ∼10 7 M ⊙ , the reconnection process that occurred in the space outside of the disk should produce X-ray emission, which can last ∼10 3 –10 6 s with the luminosity ∼10 38 –10 42 erg s −1 .},

  abstract     = {Hot ionized interstellar medium interlinks star formation and stellar feedback processes, redistributing energy, momentum, and material throughout galaxies. We use X-ray data from Chandra to extract the hot gas emission from 78 of the most luminous infrared-selected galaxies in the local Universe. In the extreme star-forming environments, the intrinsic thermal X-ray luminosity of hot gas ( {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} ) shows a significant excess over the predictions of the standard linear L X −SFR relation for most objects with very high star formation rates (SFRs). The contribution of active galactic nuclei appears to have little impact on the global hot gas luminosity. For galaxies with SFR > 50 M ⊙ yr −1 , the Bayesian analysis gives a superlinear relation of {\rm{log}}({L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}}/{\rm{erg}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1})=1.34\,{\rm{log}}({\rm{SFR}}/{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{yr}}}^{-1})+39.82 , similar to that found in the central regions of normal spiral galaxies. These results suggest a scenario in which the merger of galaxies delivers substantial amounts of gas, triggering intense star formation in both the nuclear region and the galactic disk, and ultimately enhancing the global thermal X-ray emission. The ratio of the apparent thermal luminosity in the 0.5−2 keV band ( {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{appar}}} ) to {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} shows statistically significant negative correlations with the intrinsic column density ( N H ) and SFR. Moreover, in contrast to the luminosity ratio, SFR shows a moderate positive correlation with intrinsic N H . This suggests that the correlation between {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{appar}}} / {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} and SFR may be driven by the underlying {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{appar}}} / {L}_{0.5-2\,{\rm{keV}}}^{{\rm{gas}}} − N H and SFR− N H relations.},

Both clusters have similar ages (250 and 300 Myr, respectively). Spectra were recorded with the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System located on the Magellan–Clay 6.5 m telescope. Spectra were visually inspected to assess the presence of stellar H α emission lines attributed to B stars rotating close to breakup velocity (Be stars). High fractions of Be stars in the cluster typically indicate the presence of a large population of fast rotating stars, predicted by some models to explain the observed split and extended main sequence. There are numerous Be star candidates in NGC 1856, exhibiting weak but broad H α emission. However, only one such target was detected in NGC 1953. This stark contrast between the observed populations for NGC 1856 and NGC 1953 may suggest that cluster density plays a key role in determining the fraction of Be stars. These results provide essential constraints for the different scenarios attempting to explain the bimodal distribution of rotational velocities and the multiple populations of stars observed in globular clusters. The impact of stellar radial velocity and nebular emission on photometric measures is assessed through simulations relying on the spectra. These simulations suggest that photometric studies can underestimate the fraction of H α emitters in a cluster, in particular for stars with relatively weak emission features. The results also show that nebular emission has minimal impact on the photometric H α excesses.},

Using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation, we construct H i sky cubes at redshift z ∼ 0.1 and the corresponding optical galaxy catalogs, simulating FAST observations under various survey strategies, including pilot, deep-field, and ultradeep-field surveys. The H i MF is measured for distinct galaxy populations—classified by optical properties into red, blue, and bluer galaxies—and injected with systematic effects such as observational noise and flux confusion caused by the FAST beam. The results show that Bayesian stacking significantly enhances H i MF measurements. For red and blue galaxies, the H i MF can be well constrained with pilot surveys, while deeper surveys are required for the bluer galaxy population. Our analysis also reveals that sample variance dominates over observational noise, emphasizing the importance of wide-field surveys to improve constraints. Furthermore, flux confusion shifts the H i MF toward higher masses, which we address using a transfer function for correction. Finally, we explore the effects of intrinsic sample incompleteness and propose a framework to quantify its impact. This work lays the groundwork for future H i MF studies with FAST H i IM, addressing key challenges and enabling robust analyses of H i content across galaxy populations.},

  abstract     = {Centaurus X–3 (Cen X–3) is a bright, high-mass X-ray binary pulsar. We present a pulse phase–resolved X-ray spectral analysis of data from an archival XMM-Newton observation of Cen X–3 taken during the high state of the source. The observation was entirely in the out-of-eclipse part of the binary orbit. We study the pulse phase variability of the three K α fluorescent emission lines from near-neutral, helium-like, and hydrogen-like iron, along with the iron K β emission line. All four lines show clear modulation with the pulse phase of the neutron star (NS), and modulation is found to be higher for the lines from highly ionised iron compared to the neutral lines. Structures within the light travel distance corresponding to the pulse period of the NS are likely responsible for the pulse phase modulation of the emission lines. We have also investigated the orbital phase dependence of the pulse phase variability in the iron lines by dividing the data into four segments at different orbital phases of Cen X–3. The pulse phase modulation behavior of the four lines is quite identical at different orbital phases of Cen X–3, indicating the pulsed iron emission region is persistent in nature and probably phase aligned with respect to the observer. The accretion stream intercepting the line of sight can probably produce the observed phase dependence of the iron fluorescence emission lines.},

  abstract     = {Binary black holes (BBHs) are expected to form and merge in active galactic nuclei (AGN), deep in the potential well of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), from populations that exist in a nuclear star cluster. Here we investigate the gravitational-wave (GW) signature of a BBH lensed by a nearby SMBH. For a fiducial GW150914-like BBH orbiting close to a 10 8 M ⊙ SMBH located at z = 0.1, the lensed GW signal varies in a predictable manner in and out of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) detectability band and across frequencies. The occurrence of such signatures has the potential to confound LISA global fit models if they are not modeled. Detection of these sources provides an independent measure of AGN inclination angles, along with detecting warping of the inner disk and measuring the SMBH spin.},

  abstract     = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) typically exhibit a three-component structure in white-light (WL) coronagraphs. Utilizing the seamless observations of the inner corona (≤3 R ⊙ ), we have revealed the early evolution of the cavity and core of a CME starting at ∼18:20 UT on 2014 October 14. The CME originates from a hot channel (HC), which appears as the bright core and compresses the cavity in WL images. Specifically, most of the dark cavity in WL is filled by bright loop-like structures in 174 Å. The differential emission measure analysis indicates that the electron temperature decreases from the core (∼13.4 MK) to the cavity (∼1.35 MK), and the CME cavity is significantly cooler than that enshrouding a prominence (≥2 MK). The effective temperature of the cavity increases over time in general, probably due to the compression by the HC expansion. The evolution of the CME bright core includes slow-rise, fast-rise (up to ∼330 km s −1 ), and residual-acceleration phases. The cavity exhibits an evolution similar to the core but lags by ∼4 minutes, with a lower speed peaking at ∼220 km s −1 . Moreover, the 2D radial speed distribution exhibits the highest speeds at the core apex. The kinematical results further confirm the compression of the cavity. The present event supports the new explanation of the CME structures, i.e., the magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is proxied by the HC, is only responsible for the core, while the cavity is likely a low-density region between the CME front and the MFR.},

  abstract     = {Space irradiation plays a crucial role in surface weathering and hydration processes of airless bodies in the solar system. Despite extensive laboratory studies, the impact of crystal orientation and temperature on these irradiation processes remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted hydrogen-implantation experiments on olivine crystals, controlling both crystal orientation and temperature. Our results reveal that the amount and depth of implanted hydrogen depend on the crystal orientation. Olivine exhibits the largest resistance to ion irradiation along the [100] direction, resulting in a thinner damaged region (∼180–200 nm) and subsurface vesicle formation. In contrast, the [010] and [001] orientations allow deeper damage (∼200–210 nm) accompanied by fracturing. Additionally, increasing temperatures from 25°C to 200°C promote the saturation and retention of implanted hydrogen. However, above a critical temperature (∼200°C for olivine), hydrogen levels stabilize, and no further increase is observed. These findings highlight the critical role of crystal orientation and temperature in the irradiation process, providing important constraints for numerical models simulating the effects of space irradiation on rocky bodies.},

In particular, we examine how different surface temperature models for PSR J0030+0451, categorized as scenarios A, B, and C, lead to significantly different mass–radius estimates. We present a comprehensive study constraining the parameters of the constant speed of sound (CSS) model based on representative observational categories. Our findings indicate that for certain hadronic EoSs (for representative cases, we chose one density-independent and one density-dependent), the results remain consistent for lower values of the energy density discontinuity, but discrepancies emerge as the discontinuity increases. Scenarios involving large jumps in energy density are generally disfavored by the requirement of supporting massive neutron stars, while higher values of the speed of sound in the quark matter phase tend to yield better agreement with various observational trends. These results underscore the importance of phase transition characteristics in aligning hybrid star models with current astrophysical observations. We have also constrained the CSS parameters using observational data from PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0952–0607 by computing the maximum mass supported by these parameters.},

The goal is to understand the nature of the excess MIR emission originally detected by Spitzer redward of 8 μ m. The stellar-subtracted MIR spectrum is well modeled by a power law with a spectral index of α = 0.72 ± 0.01, where the flux density scales with frequency as F ν ∝ ν α . The spectral characteristics, along with rapid variability—a 40% flux flare at 15 μ m and 25% achromatic variability in the 5–12 μ m range—rule out a circumbinary disk as the source of the MIR excess. The Low Resolution Spectrometer reveals a prominent emission feature at 7.5 μ m, resulting from the blend of three hydrogen recombination lines. While the contribution from partially self-absorbed synchrotron radiation cannot be ruled out, we argue that thermal bremsstrahlung from a warm (a few tens of thousands of Kelvin) wind accounts for the MIR excess; the same outflow is responsible for the emission lines. The inferred mass outflow rate indicates that the system’s low luminosity is due to a substantial fraction of the mass supplied by the donor star being expelled through a wind rather than accreted onto the black hole.},

Applying the Histogram of Relative Orientations analysis to the FIREPLACE data, we find that the relative orientation between magnetic fields and column density structures is random in low-density regions ( 2\times 1{0}^{22}\lesssim {N}_{{{\rm{H}}}_{2}}\lesssim 1{0}^{23}\,{{\rm{cm}}}^{-2} ) but becomes preferentially parallel in high-density regions (≳10 23 cm −2 ). This trend is in contrast with that of the nearby molecular clouds, where the relative orientation transitions from parallel to perpendicular with increasing column densities. However, the relative orientation varies between individual CMZ clouds. Comparisons with magnetohydrodynamic simulations specific to the CMZ conditions suggest that the observed parallel alignment is intrinsic, rather than artifacts caused by the projection effect. The origin of this parallel configuration may arise from the fact that most dense structures in the CMZ are not self-gravitating, as they are in supervirial states, except for the ministarburst region Sgr B2. These findings are consistent with the low star formation efficiency observed in the CMZ compared to that in the Galactic disk.},

The radio emission from pulsars, magnetars, and fast radio bursts can be elliptically polarized, and measurements of the EA have become increasingly important in interpretations and models of their polarization. An in-depth understanding of the statistical properties of the measured polarization angles is a prerequisite to their detailed interpretation. While the statistics of the PA have been understood for some time, the statistics of the EA do not appear to be as well developed as those of the PA. The statistical properties of the EA are derived when the amplitude of the polarization vector is constant, to include its probability density, mean, standard deviation, and confidence limits. Similar to the PA, the standard deviation and confidence limits of the EA vary inversely with the polarization signal-to-noise ratio. However, unlike the PA, the probability density of the EA is generally asymmetric, its standard deviation and confidence limits are dependent upon the intrinsic value of the EA, and the measured EA is biased by the instrumental noise, particularly at low signal-to-noise ratios and large values of the intrinsic EA. General expressions for the joint probability density of the polarization angles and the probability density of the EA are also derived when the amplitude of the polarization vector fluctuates due to the superposition of incoherent modes of orthogonal polarization.},

In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNs, the numbers known remain very small (∼40) compared to the overall Galactic PNs population (∼4000). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNs with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes, such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG eROSITA-DE eRASS1 source catalog and the Hong Kong (HASH) PNs Database. Five known X-ray PNs have been detected (A30, NGC 2392, NGC 3242, NGC 5315, and LoTr 5), two new X-ray PNs are revealed (IC 1297 and NGC 2867), one (K 1–27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNs are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNs reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNs with X-ray fluxes larger than ≈2 × 10 −14 erg cm −2 s −1 .

This scattering process can be effectively modeled as photon diffusion in phase space. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparison between the quasilinear diffusion coefficients and those calculated by ray-tracing the photon trajectories in numerically generated, broadband, isotropic density fluctuation fields in both 2D and 3D configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that for weak scattering, the simulated diffusion coefficients agree well with the quasilinear theoretical predictions. However, when the radio frequency approaches the electron plasma frequency and/or the density fluctuation amplitude becomes significant, photons experience strong scattering. Under such conditions, the quasilinear theory tends to underestimate the scattering strength of photons induced by 2D density fluctuations while overestimating the scattering strength in 3D cases. Furthermore, we implement a group velocity correction to the theoretical diffusion coefficients, based on the effective propagation speed averaged over all test photons. The corrected coefficients provide an accurate quantification of the scattering strength for radio waves propagating through 3D density fluctuations. The physical mechanisms underlying these phenomena are elucidated in the discussion.},

The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by 21 cm KAN enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early Universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. 21 cm KAN predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than 21 cm LSTM, when utilizing the same typical GPU. In addition, 21 cm KAN is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that 21 cm KAN required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of 21 cm KAN allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of neural networks.},

The average stellar metallicity decreases from ∼1.9 Z ⊙ near the center of the galaxy to ∼0.3 Z ⊙ at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen abundance from H ii regions using the direct method. The H ii region-based Cepheid metallicities used by A. G. Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble constant H 0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ∼0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor, are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae. Utilizing the flux-weighted gravity–luminosity relationship (FGLR) of blue supergiants, we measure a distance to M101, D = 6.5 ± 0.2 Mpc ( μ = 29.06 ± 0.08), which is within 1 σ from determinations based on the tip of the red giant branch and Cepheids. With M101 as a nearby Type Ia supernova host and using the observed standardized B -band magnitude of the supernova, our FGLR distance yields an independent value of H 0 = 72.5 ± 4.6 km s −1 Mpc −1 .},

  abstract     = {Broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLSy1s), characterized by high black hole masses and low accretion rates, represent a crucial subclass of active galactic nuclei. We present a systematic analysis of the variability and X-ray spectral properties of the BLSy1 Mrk 1220 using 225 high-quality Swift observations from 2016 to 2018. Mrk 1220 exhibits significant multiwavelength variability across X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), and optical bands, with amplitude increasing with energy but remaining weaker than narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) with high accretion rates. Cross-correlation analysis reveals no significant interband time delays. The UV/optical–X-ray correlation weakens with increasing wavelength, with a maximum correlation coefficient of only 0.54. The relatively weak UV/X-ray connection may be attributed to the dynamic evolution of the coronal structure. Structure function (SF) analysis reveals a distinctive double “S” structure in optical/UV bands. Short-timescale SF parameters resemble those of NLSy1s, while X-ray bands show significantly longer decorrelation timescales, indicating an extended X-ray corona. SF spectral coefficients ( β ) across bands generally follow the damped random walk model, with only the U -band long-timescale β slightly elevated, potentially influenced by broad-line region radiation. X-ray spectral characteristics remain consistent between high and low flux states, showing weak soft excess below 1 keV. The stability of the soft excess parameters and power-law spectral index suggests unchanged coronal geometry across states, with X-ray variations primarily driven by intrinsic electron density fluctuations. These results provide valuable observational constraints for understanding the variability mechanisms and spectral characteristics of typical BLSy1s.},

  abstract     = {The behavior of lithium (Li) in Population I main-sequence stars challenges standard stellar theory. Two phenomena stand out: the solar Li problem, which extends to Li depletion in solar analogs, and the Li dip observed in mid-F stars within open clusters. Building on the meridional-circulation-driven radial mixing framework previously developed to explain Li-enriched red clump stars, we explore its relevance to Li depletion on the main sequence. First, our models reproduce the observed A (Li)–age correlation in solar analogs. Through detailed isochrone analysis, we find good agreement between the simulated and observed A (Li)– T eff relationships within the solar analog parameter space. However, the predicted solar Li abundance (∼1.5 dex) is still higher than current solar measurements. Second, our models partially explain the Li dip phenomenon in mid-F cluster stars. The models accurately reproduce Li distributions on the cool side of the Li dip in most clusters and capture the Li behaviors on the hot side observed in systems like the Hyades. However, we identify limitations in the models’ ability to fully reproduce the dip morphology, particularly due to the rotation velocity distribution of sample stars in this temperature zone.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, with the increasing number of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered soon after their explosions, a nonnegligible fraction of SNe Ia with early-excess emissions (EExSNe Ia) have been confirmed. In this paper, we present a total of 67 early-phase normal SNe Ia from published papers and ongoing transient survey projects to systematically investigate their photometric behaviors from very early time. We found that EExSNe Ia in our sample have longer rise and brighter peak luminosities compared to non-EExSNe Ia. Moreover, EExSNe Ia commonly have “tiny red bump” or “blue plateau” features in the early B − V color while non-EExSNe Ia show blueward evolution from the very beginning. Here, we propose that the thin He-shell double detonation scenario can phenomenologically explain the photometric diversities of normal SNe Ia considering different white dwarf–He-shell mass combinations and the viewing angle effect, implying a unified explosion mechanism of normal-type SNe Ia. To further verify the possible common origin of normal SNe Ia, systematical studies of multiband photometric and spectral properties of early-phase SNe Ia through the new-generation wide-field time-domain survey facilities and global real-time follow-up networks are highly needed.},

  abstract     = {Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated with a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with an hours to days period, which is brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of an accretion disk, repeated star–disk collisions lead to ablation of a small fraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically track stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the EMRI’s Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream that collides with the disk half an orbit after the last star–disk encounter. For orbital periods ≳12 hr, the dilute stream is deflected at the disk surface by a strong shock, rather than penetrating it. Due to their low optical depth and prolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically dominates over emission from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star. We find that (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream–disk collision timescale; (2) flare luminosities of 10 42−43 erg s −1 , consistent with observed QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) soft X-ray flares with temperatures of ∼100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a radiation-mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher-mass streams yield softer flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower-mass streams result in collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We discuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying disk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same galaxy.},

  abstract     = {Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies occasionally disrupt stars or consume stellar-mass black holes (BHs) that wander too close, producing observable electromagnetic or gravitational wave signals. We examine how mass segregation impacts the rates and distributions of such events. Assuming a relaxed stellar cluster, composed of stars and stellar-mass BHs, we show that the tidal disruption rate of massive stars ( m ≳ M ⊙ ) is enhanced relative to their abundance in the stellar population. For stars up to m ≈ 3 M ⊙ , this enhancement is roughly m / M ⊙ and it is driven by segregation within the sphere of influence. Stars with masses m ≳ 3 M ⊙ , if relaxed, are predominantly scattered by more massive stellar-mass BHs, leading to a constant enhancement factor of ≈9, independent of mass. This aligns with observational evidence suggesting an over-representation of massive stars in tidal disruption events. For stellar-mass BHs, we predict an enhancement factor scaling as {m}_{\bullet }^{1/2} for plunges and {m}_{\bullet }^{3/2} for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). The power of one-half in both cases reflects the shorter relaxation times of heavier BHs, allowing them to segregate into the sphere of influence from greater distances, thereby increasing their abundance. The additional power in the EMRIs’ rate arises from the tendency of heavier BHs to circularize and sink inward more efficiently. Finally, we estimate the rate of main-sequence star inspirals and find that it favors low-mass stars ( m ≲ M ⊙ ). This seems compatible with the observationally estimated rate of quasiperiodic eruptions.},

  abstract     = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as important cosmological probes whose X-ray afterglow light curves (LCs) may exhibit a plateau phase (with temporal slope α between 0 and 0.5) that may originate from magnetar energy injection. Similar to Type Ia supernovae, GRBs with a common physical origin can be used as standardizable candles for cosmological studies. However, observational gaps in GRB LCs introduce significant uncertainties in plateau parameter estimation, thereby affecting cosmological constraints. In this work, we employ a stochastic reconstruction technique to reconstruct the X-ray afterglow LCs for 35 GRB samples exhibiting plateau features, generating 50 simulated data points for each LC. Using the reconstructed LCs, we calibrate three luminosity correlations: the L 0 – t b , L 0 – t b – E p , i , and L 0 – t b – E γ ,iso relations, which are then applied to constrain both flat and nonflat ΛCDM cosmological models. The main results include (i) the L 0 – t b relation yields a slope b ≈ −1, supporting a constant magnetar energy injection rate; (ii) LC reconstruction has limited impact on cosmological parameter constraints; and (iii) for the flat ΛCDM model constrained by the L 0 – t b – E p , i relation, the precision of Ω m improves by 6.25%; for the non-flat ΛCDM model constrained by the L 0 – t b – E p , i relation, the precision of Ω Λ improves by 1.01%. Our findings suggest that increasing the number of LC data points provides limited improvement to cosmological constraints, while expanding the sample size of GRBs with identical physical origins may be more crucial.},

To explore effective survey strategies for detecting FRBs from nearby globular clusters (GCs), we investigate the burst energy distribution, which has a strong influence on the detection rate. We reanalyze FRBs and pulsars exhibiting broad energy distributions by fitting their high-energy tails with power-law models. Two cosmological repeating FRBs (FRB 20201124A and FRB 20220912A), one nearby FRB (FRB 20200120E), and two pulsars (RRATs J1846−0257 and J1854+0306) exhibit power-law indices of α ≳ −1, suggesting that their bright pulses contribute significantly to the total radio pulse energy. The brightest bursts from these sources can be fitted with a power-law model ( α Bri = −0.26 ± 0.05), suggesting that an extremely flat index is required to naturally derive high-luminosity FRBs from low-luminosity sources. We present detailed survey strategies for FAST, MeerKAT, and Parkes cryoPAF in the search for FRBs in nearby GCs using different power-law indices, recommending targets for observation. We suggest that combining observations with FAST (∼3 hr) and Parkes cryoPAF (10−20 hr) is practicable for discovering new FRBs in nearby GCs.},

  abstract     = {The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by active galactic nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the broad-line region (BLR). In 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line Mapping Code (B ELMAC ), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of B ELMAC , which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H α , H β , Mg II λ 2800, and C IV λ 1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations where the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single-zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an intercloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.},

Our model supersedes previous models by making use of new multiband Hubble Space Telescope data and Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectroscopy. We identify two additional lensed galaxies to inform a more well-constrained model using 12 sets of multiple images in five separate lensed sources. The three previously known sources were spectroscopically confirmed by G. Mahler et al. at redshifts of z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048. We measured the spectroscopic redshifts of two of the newly discovered arcs using MUSE data, at z = 3.0205 and z = 5.3288. We increase the number of cluster member galaxies by a factor of 3 compared to previous work. We also report the detection of extended Ly α emission from several background galaxies. We measure the total projected mass density of the two major subcluster components, one dominated by the brightest cluster galaxy and the other by a compact group of luminous red galaxies. We find {M}_{{\rm{B}}{\rm{C}}{\rm{G}}}(\lt 80\,\rm{kpc})=3.9{3}_{-0.14}^{+0.21}\times 1{0}^{13} M ⊙ and {M}_{{\rm{LRG}}}(\lt 80\,\rm{kpc})=2.9{2}_{-0.23}^{+0.16}\times 1{0}^{13} M ⊙ , yielding a mass ratio of 1.3{5}_{-0.08}^{+0.16} . The strong lensing constraints offer a robust estimate of the projected mass density regardless of modeling assumptions; allowing more substructure in this line of sight does not change the results or conclusions.

Improved observational constraints on the cosmological evolution of SMBH demographics are needed. Here we report results of a search via photometric variability for SMBHs appearing as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the cosmological volume defined by the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. This work includes particular focus on a new observation carried out in 2023 with the Hubble Space Telescope using the WFC3/IR/F140W, which is compared directly to equivalent data taken 11 yr earlier in 2012. Two earlier pairs of observations from 2009 to 2012 with WFC3/IR/F105W and WFC3/IR/F160W are also analyzed. We identify 521, 188, and 109 AGN candidates as nuclear sources that exhibit photometric variability at a level of 2 σ , 2.5 σ , and 3 σ , respectively, in at least one filter. This sample includes 13, 3, and 2 AGN candidates at redshifts z > 6, when the Universe was ≲900 Myr old. After variability and luminosity function (down to M UV = −17 mag) completeness corrections, we estimate the comoving number density of SMBHs, n SMBH ( z ). At z ≳ 6, n SMBH ≳ 6 × 10 −3 cMpc −3 . At low z our observations are sensitive to AGN fainter than M UV = −17 mag, and we estimate n SMBH ≳ 10 −2 cMpc −3 . We discuss how these results place strong constraints on a variety of SMBH seeding theories.},

We apply the approach to the SiO–H 2 collision system, which is crucial for reliable astrophysical environment modeling of SiO emission. The most accurate quantum scattering calculation method employs the coupled-channel formalism, which is computationally expensive. Approximate approaches, generally referred to as decoupling approximations, are significantly more computationally efficient, but less accurate. To bridge this accuracy gap, we use a multilayer perceptron to predict the difference between the accurate and approximate results. Our model is trained on a carefully selected and preprocessed data set, which includes both approximate and accurate calculation results. We show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the approximate calculation results, as the relative rms errors from the predicted results are orders of magnitude smaller than those from the approximate calculation results, benchmarked against the accurate calculations. The present approach can be applied to similar problems in other fields to improve the accuracy of computationally efficient approximate methods, reducing computation time and enhancing automation.},

  abstract     = {We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297, which is home to a powerful bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense interstellar medium (ISM) and/or jet precession. Archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ∼30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas, and clumpy blue excess emission cospatial with the radio hotspots. Our Very Large Telescope (VLA)/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially resolved H α + [N II ] emission in this source. A prominent blueshifted wing in H α indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ∼8 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H α data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback, with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to accretion onto the black hole. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.},

  abstract     = {The high-redshift ( z > 4) compact sources with “V-shaped” spectral energy distributions, known as Little Red Dots (LRDs), were discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope and provide valuable clues to the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the early Universe. The nature of LRDs is controversial. Recently, several studies have investigated LRDs through variability, a characteristic feature of AGNs. These studies explore LRD variability by extrapolating empirical relationships from local quasars. Here, we adopt the Corona-heated Accretion-disk Reprocessing (CHAR) model, which is motivated by accretion physics and is applicable to reproducing AGN conventional variability, to study the variability of 22 LRDs in W. L. Tee et al. Our results indicate that the observed variability in LRDs is dominated by measurement uncertainties. Within the CHAR model, the lack of variability in LRDs can be explained by two scenarios: either AGNs contribute ≲30% of the observed luminosities, or they are intrinsically luminous AGNs. We use simulations to demonstrate the observational requirements to effectively investigate LRDs via variability with the following criteria: first, the sample has about 200 LRDs; second, each LRD has two observations separated by at least 2 yr in the observed frame; third, the photometric uncertainty is ≤0.07 mag. If the LRDs still lack variability under these conditions, the time–domain study would provide independent evidence that the accretion mode of LRDs differs significantly from low-redshift quasars.},

  abstract     = {The young neutron star (NS) in the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant is a fascinating test for theories of NS cooling. Chandra observations have indicated that its surface temperature is declining rapidly, by about 2% per decade, using 20 yr of data, if a uniform carbon atmosphere is assumed for the NS. This rapid decline may be caused by the neutrons in the NS core transitioning from a normal to a superfluid state. However, most of the Cas A NS observations were performed by the Chandra ACIS detectors, which suffer complicated systematic effects. Here, we test the cooling of the Cas A NS with Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) data over 25 yr. The Chandra HRC detector has independent systematics, serving as a cross-check. Assuming a fixed hydrogen column density ( N H ), we infer the cooling rate of the Cas A NS to be 0.57 {}_{-0.27}^{+0.26} % per decade. Allowing the N H to vary with time (as estimated using ACIS data), the cooling rate is 1.11 {}_{-0.28}^{+0.25} % per decade. These cooling rates are smaller than measured using ACIS data, implying systematic uncertainties have not been eradicated from either or both data sets. However, we have verified the decline in the absorbed flux from the Cas A NS using an independent instrument, at >3 σ level (4.7% ± 1.5% over 10 yr). Additionally, the weaker cooling rate of Cas A NS inferred from HRC data sets eliminates the tension with the theoretically predicted cooling, and can be explained by the reduced efficiency of the neutrino emission accompanying the Cooper pair breaking and formation process in neutron triplet-state superfluid.},

  abstract     = {Pulse profile stability in millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is a key factor in achieving high-precision timing essential for detecting nanohertz gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). In this work, we present a systematic analysis of profile stabilization timescales in MSPs using a direct method based on pulse stacking, applied to long-term multiepoch observations. Our study utilizes data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) between 300 and 750 MHz for nine MSPs over 3–5 yr and Parkes Ultra-Wideband, low-frequency receiver observations (covering 704–4032 MHz) for three of them. We find that stable profiles typically require averaging over 10 5 –10 6 pulses. This is the first time such a quantitative approach has been applied to MSPs across a wide frequency range, providing an indirect but practical estimate of jitter noise—a dominant noise source in PTA data sets. We observe that stabilization timescales depend on signal-to-noise ratio, pulse morphology, and surface magnetic field strength, with a moderate correlation indicating a possible role of magnetic field in emission stability. A complementary single-epoch analysis of nine bright MSPs with uGMRT Band-3 (300–500 MHz) reinforces these results and demonstrates the method’s applicability to broader MSP populations. We show that a strong correlation exists between profile-stability slope and the jitter parameter, implying that, for faint MSPs, profile-stability analysis can act as an effective proxy for intrinsic pulse-shape variability. Our work provides a novel and scalable framework to assess intrinsic profile variability, helping to guide integration time choices and reduce timing noise in PTA experiments.},

Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature.

These spectra are among the latest direct detections of a core-collapse SN, both through emission lines in the optical and thermal continuum from infrared (IR) dust emission. The new IR data show that dust heating from radiation produced by the ejecta interacting with circumstellar matter is still present but greatly reduced from when SN 1995N was observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope and WISE in 2009/2010 and 2018, when the dust mass was estimated to be 0.4 M ⊙ . New radiative-transfer modeling suggests that the dust mass and grain size may have increased between 2010 and 2023. The new data can alternatively be well fit with a dust mass of 0.4 M ⊙ and a much reduced heating source luminosity. The new late-time spectra show unusually strong oxygen forbidden lines, stronger than the H α emission. This indicates that SN 1995N may have exploded as a stripped-envelope SN, which then interacted with a massive H-rich circumstellar shell, changing it from intrinsically Type Ib/c to Type IIn. The late-time spectrum results when the reverse shock begins to excite the inner H-poor, O-rich ejecta. This change in the spectrum is rarely seen but marks the start of the transition from SN to SN remnant.},

  abstract     = {Multiple studies show that planet–planet scattering plays a key role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. It can also contribute to the census of free-floating planets. In this work, we run an ensemble of N -body simulations and record the properties of ejected planets. Our simulations sample a wide range of orbital and physical parameters. We find that 40%–80% of planets are ejected, depending on the initial number in the system. Most ejections occur over ∼10 8 –10 9 yr. The mean excess velocity of ejected planets lies in the range 2–6 km s −1 relative to the host star, and strongly depends on the semimajor axis of the innermost planet. Regardless of initial location, all planets are equally likely to be ejected. Bound and ejected planets show distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive. Increasing planetary radii reduces the ejection fraction due to higher collision rates. The properties of ejected planets do not strongly depend on initial spacing, though ejection timescales increase with separation. The ejection fraction is also largely insensitive to the distance from the host star used to define unbound status. Comparing our results with observed free-floating planet populations, we conclude that fewer than five Jovian-mass planets need to form per star to match observations—consistent with current constraints from both observations and planet formation models.},

Here, we analyze a second epoch of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations to better characterize the properties of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from the central region, i.e., ([Ar vi ] 4.5292 μ m, [Ar ii ] 6.9853 μ m, [S iv ] 10.5105 μ m, and [S iii ] 18.7130 μ m), and also identify similar components in [Ca v ] 4.1585 μ m, [Cl ii ] 14.3678 μ m, and possibly [Fe ii ] 1.6440 μ m. These lines are blueshifted by ∼−250 km s −1 , while the emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center. The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of 510 ± 55 km s −1 for the neutron star. We also identify [Ca iv ] 3.2068 μ m near the center, but it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of ∼700 km s −1 . We find that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size ∼0.3 μ m can explain the [Ca iv ] properties and the absence of other narrow lines at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at λ ≳ 8 μ m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe ii ] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the expanding ejecta decreases.},

The primary ionization product of water is H 2 O + , which is rapidly converted into H 3 O + through proton-transfer reaction with H 2 O in the inner coma. Ion-mass spectrometers on board spacecraft such as Giotto and Rosetta have measured H 2 O + ions in the inner coma, while emission bands of H 2 O + in the optical wavelength region can be observed from ground-based observatories. We present the spatial intensity distribution of the H 2 O + emission in comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy), derived from high-resolution spectra taken on UT 2015 January 11. The observations covered a projected distance of ∼3000 km across the sky along the slit, with a spatial resolution of ∼200 km resulting from the atmospheric seeing. The observed H 2 O + profile scales as {\rho }^{-0.13} (where \rho is the projected distance from the nucleus), in contrast to the {\rho }^{-1} profile seen in sunlight reflected by dust grains. We modeled the intensity profile of H 2 O + using a steady-state, radially expanding coma model. Our results indicate that the proton-transfer reaction of H 2 O + with H 2 O dominates the loss process of H 2 O + in the inner coma. Assuming that H 2 O + is produced primarily by photoionization of H 2 O, the modeled intensity profile of H 2 O + remains constant, which is inconsistent with our observations. However, when an electron-impact ionization frequency inversely proportional to distance from the nucleus is assumed, the model successfully reproduces the observed profile.},

The 1D spectrum exhibits faint dust continuum emission and is relatively poor in molecular gas compared to protoplanetary disks with no inner dust cavities. We identify fundamental CO emission, bright rotationally excited OH lines longward of 9 μ m, weak rotational H 2 O emission, the methyl cation CH {}_{3}^{+} , HCO + , and tentatively identify CO 2 . Otherwise, the spectrum is dominated by H 2 and atomic emission. We model the molecular spectra using slab models and retrieve excitation temperatures, column densities, and emitting areas in a Bayesian framework. The OH line fluxes are used to estimate the photodissociation rate of water. We find that 5.4 × 10 40 H 2 O molecules are photodestroyed every second, which suggests that the highest-energy OH lines trace a region near the 0.2 au dust cavity wall with an incident far-ultraviolet flux of G 0 ∼ 10 7 . The OH emission is compared to DALI models, which point toward a high incident flux of Ly α photons in the OH emitting region. We further use the H I lines to provide an independent estimate of the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate, in agreement with prior measurements. A comparison with other cavity disks indicates that more evolved systems such as GM Aur may be less volatile rich and are characterized by brighter OH prompt emission and abundant molecular ions.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the long-term modulation of cosmic-ray (CR) intensity across median rigidities from 11 to 107 GV using over four decades (1980–2023) of data from neutron monitors (NMs) and muon detectors (MDs). The analysis incorporates global NM stations and the Nagoya Multi-Directional Muon Telescope to evaluate the influence of key heliospheric parameters: interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, heliospheric current sheet tilt angle (TA), and solar wind (SW) speed. Results reveal pronounced rigidity-dependent modulation patterns. Lower-rigidity NMs exhibit stronger sensitivity to heliospheric conditions, driven largely by IMF and TA, consistent with diffusion- and drift-dominated transport. In contrast, higher-rigidity MDs show reduced modulation amplitudes, with IMF remaining the dominant influence and SW gaining relative importance as drift effects diminish. These findings provide new insight into the energy-dependent roles of heliospheric drivers in CR modulation and offer a robust framework for advancing space weather prediction and heliospheric transport modeling.},

  abstract     = {The surface rippled structures of Orion molecular cloud have been attributed to the Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instability, and the influence of magnetic field and pressure on the formation and evolution of these structures is one of the important issues that has been considered frequently in the dynamics of clouds. However, the effects of magnetic field inhomogeneity and compressibility variations are still underexplored. Here, the two-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations are performed to study the evolution of the KH instability in the Orion Nebula in the presence of a nonuniform magnetic field parallel to the flow direction. The results indicate that the rippled structures in the near Trapezium Cluster region are more pronounced. Also, the sound Mach number increases with decreasing gas pressure, enhancing the system compressibility and weakening the KH instability. And the position of the slow rarefaction layer, where the gas pressure is relatively weak, corresponds to that of the strong compression layer of the magnetic flux tube. Finally, it is found that the strong magnetic field gradient with small magnetic shear thickness between the H II region and the rippled region has a stabilizing effect on instability, which is a result of the increased magnetic field strength within the shear layer. Based on these results, it is preliminarily discussed that the magnetic field in the Orion Nebula is the key feedback process to regulate or stimulate the formation of stars, and the compressibility also affects the efficiency of the star formation.},

  abstract     = {Compact object binaries with accreting white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes are crucial for understanding accretion physics. In this study, we identify accreting compact object binary candidates in the Spectrum–Roentgen–Gamma/eROSITA eRASS1 by combining their X-ray fluxes with Gaia photometry and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) time-domain observations. Candidates are selected based on their location in the “X-ray Main Sequence,” a diagram incorporating their X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors, which suggest accretion-driven X-ray emission. We identify 22 candidates in the eRASS1 catalog using a three-step selection process: (1) cross-matching to a unique Gaia optical counterpart within a 10″ radius; (2) requiring X-ray-to-optical flux ratios exceeding the “X-ray Main Sequence”; and (3) detecting short-period variability in ZTF time-domain photometry. The resulting 22 candidates, including two previously confirmed compact object binaries, represent promising candidates for spectroscopic follow-up to confirm their accreting nature. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining X-ray-to-optical flux ratios and optical colors jointly with time-domain photometry to uncover accreting compact object binaries. The approach is scalable and adaptable to future multiwavelength sky surveys, offering a promising path toward a more complete census of compact object binaries in the Galaxy.},

  abstract     = {We present Mantis Shrimp , a multisurvey deep learning model for photometric redshift estimation that fuses ultraviolet (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), optical (PanSTARRS), and infrared (UnWISE) imagery. Machine learning is now an established approach for photometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance in areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over template-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based convolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude models. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design complexities: It is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different instruments that have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis Shrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using cutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated, and the point estimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2), and catastrophic outlier rate ( η >0.15 = 4.51%). We find that early-fusion approaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments) match the performance of late-fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent space representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the user. Finally, we study how the model learns to use information across bands, finding evidence that our model successfully incorporates information from all surveys. The applicability of our model to the analysis of large populations of galaxies is limited by the speed and ease of downloading and preparing cutouts from external servers; however, our model could be useful in smaller studies such as in generating priors over redshift for stellar population synthesis.},

  abstract     = {The IBEX-Lo instrument on the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) mission observes primary and secondary interstellar helium in its four lowest energy steps. Observations of these helium populations have been analyzed and compared to simulations using the analytic full integration of neutrals model. A systematic difference is observed between the simulations and observations of secondary helium during solar cycle (SC) 24. We show that elastic scattering of primary helium by solar wind protons, which redistributes atoms from the core of the primary helium flux distribution, provides an explanation of the observed divergence from simulations. We test the validity of this explanation by showing that the elastic scattering also forms a halo in the wings of the primary helium distribution in the spin-angle plane. Correcting the simulation for the effects of elastic scattering requires an increase of the estimated density of primary helium, compared to previous estimates by Ulysses/GAS. The combined density of interstellar helium, derived from the previous studies, has been recalculated to be 0.0153 ± 0.0011. Based on our analysis of IBEX observations and χ 2 minimization of simulation data that include the effects of elastic scattering, any estimation of neutral interstellar helium density at 1 au by direct detection of the peak flux of neutral helium needs to be adjusted by ∼12%.},

  abstract     = {Planet formation impacts exoplanet atmospheres by accreting metals in solid form, leading to atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) and sulfur-to-nitrogen ratios (S/N) that deviate from those of their host stars. Recent observations indicate differing metal abundances in planetary atmospheres compared to their stellar companions. However, these observations are biased toward mature planets, raising questions about whether these abundances result from formation or evolved over time. Another way to alter an atmosphere is through the escape of particles due to thermal heating. This study examines how billions of years of particle escape affect metal abundances. Using an adjusted stellar evolution code incorporating hydrodynamic escape, we model a warm ( T eq ≈ 1000 K) super-Neptune-type planet ( M ini = 26 M ⊕ ) orbiting a solar-type star. Our results show increased metal-to-hydrogen abundances of ∼50–70 × initial enrichment after 10 Gyr. We also see a 0.88 × decrease in C/O abundance and a 1.27 × increase in S/N abundance, which can affect the interpretation of planet formation parameters. We also simulate the evolving atmosphere using chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, finding substantial increases in SO 2 , CO 2 , and H 2 O abundances and a decrease in CH 4 abundance. These changes are easily observable in the IR wave band transmission spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that extreme escape of lighter particles significantly influences the evolution of warm Neptunes and complicates the interpretation of their observational data. This highlights the need to consider long-term atmospheric evolution in understanding exoplanet compositions.},

However, the increasing diversity among cosmological simulation models presents a challenge to the robustness .

An estimator is considered robust if it possesses a consistent predictive power across all simulations, including those used during the training phase. We train our machine using multiple simulation models and ensure that it only extracts common features between the models while disregarding the model-specific features. This allows us to develop a novel model that is capable of accurately estimating parameters across a range of simulation models, without being biased toward any particular model. Upon the investigation of the latent space—a set of summary statistics, we find that the implementation of robustness leads to the blending of latent variables across different models, demonstrating the removal of model-specific features. In comparison to a standard machine lacking robustness , the average performance of M iest on the unseen simulations during the training phase has been improved by ∼17% for Ω m and 38% for σ 8 . By using a machine learning approach that can extract robust , yet physical features, we hope to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in a (subgrid) model-insensitive manner, and ultimately, gain insight into the underlying physical processes responsible for robustness .},

We find that particles in the field are mapped to distinct clusters in the lower dimensional space in a way that is closely related to their accretion history. The largest cluster in UMAP space does not contain the entire mass of the Milky Way virial region and neatly separates the older halo from the recently accreted matter. Particles within this cluster, which only comprise ∼70% of the Milky Way particles, have had several pericenter passages and are, therefore, likely to be phase mixed, becoming dynamically uniform. The infall region and recently accreted particles and substructure, even up to splashback, form distinct components in the lower dimensional space; additionally, higher angular momentum particles also take longer times to mix. Our work shows that the current state of the Milky Way halo retains historical information, particularly about the recent accretion history, and even a relatively old structure is not dynamically uniform.

The advent of all-sky time-domain surveys has enabled the rapid discovery of these unique systems. We present the results of a large systematic search for main-sequence dipper stars, conducted across a sample of 63 million FGK main-sequence stars using data from Gaia eDR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility survey. Using a novel light-curve scoring algorithm and a scalable workflow tailored for analyzing millions of light curves, we have identified 81 new dipper star candidates. Our sample reveals a diverse phenomenology of light-curve dimming shapes, such as skewed and symmetric dimmings with timescales spanning days to years, some of which closely resemble exaggerated versions of KIC 8462852. Our sample reveals no clear periodicity patterns in many of these dippers and no IR excess or variability. Using archival data collated for this study, we thoroughly investigate several classification scenarios and hypothesize that the mechanisms of such dimming events are either driven by circumstellar clumps or occultations by stellar/substellar companions with disks. Our study marks a significant step forward in understanding main-sequence dipper stars.},

  abstract     = {We analytically model stationary and axisymmetric active galactic nucleus jets, assuming energy conservation along each magnetic flux tube. Using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations and published general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we constrain the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor, the magnetization parameter, and the magnetic field strength along the jet. We then infer the electron density, emission coefficient, and absorption coefficient at each point, and integrate the radiative transfer equation to compute the spectral energy distribution (SED) and the core shift of the synchrotron emission from the relativistic jet. Applying the method to the M87 jet, we find that the hot plasmas are injected at the altitude of seven Schwarzschild radii from the black hole (BH), that the M87 jet is likely composed of a pair plasma, and that the jet flowline geometry is quasi-parabolic as reported at much greater distances. Fitting the nonthermal fraction of the leptonic jet as a function of the position, we also find that most of the radio photons are emitted within 1000 Schwarzschild radii from the BH. Although hadronic jets do not reproduce all the VLBI observations consistently in our model, we also discuss that their heavy mass allows for a stronger magnetic field within the observational constraints, leading to an inverted SED in submillimeter wavelengths by the thermal emission from the jet base. It is therefore implied that contemporaneous observations of the M87 jet with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and VLBI could discriminate the jet composition and its collimation within the central 100 Schwarzschild radii.},

We find that ∼21% of X-ray-selected broad-line AGN are DPEs, consistent with rates previously reported for z < 0.2 broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ∼0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ∼0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [O i ] λ 6302 to narrow H α flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from non-DPE broad-line AGN in the L bol versus M BH relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multiwavelength properties when comparing DPEs to non-DPE broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer colors, α ox , the column density of neutral obscuring material N H , and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multicomponent disk-wind models of the AGN broad-line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines may introduce biases in “virial” supermassive black hole mass estimates, with consequences for the inferred M BH – M * relation.},

  abstract     = {Observations of fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) with the Einstein Probe have successfully led to the discovery of some unusual extragalactic optical transients. EP241021a is a newly discovered FXRT that was featured by a significant bump at around 10 days in both optical and X-ray bands. This timescale and the exceptionally high peak bolometric luminosity up to ∼10 44 erg s −1 of the optical bump make it somewhat similar to fast blue optical transients but still distinctive from them by its relatively red color. We then suggest that the multiwavelength bump of EP241021a could represent an explosion-type transient, while the underlying power-law decaying component of the optical and X-ray emission as well as the total radio emission are produced by a moderately relativistic jet. By fitting the observed multiwavelength light curves, it is found that the explosion ejecta that produce the thermal optical emission can have a mass of ∼0.03 M ⊙ , an expanding velocity of ∼0.25 c , and an optical opacity of ∼12 cm 2 g −1 , which was continuously powered by a rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron star (NS; i.e., a magnetar). In addition to heating the explosion ejecta, the magnetar also provided the dominant contribution to the observed X-ray rebrightening through the nonthermal emission of its wind. These properties suggest that the explosion may result from a catastrophic collapse/merger of a compact star system, which led to the formation of a millisecond magnetar, and the possible progenitor could be an accreting white dwarf (WD) or a binary consisting of a double WD, a double NS, or a WD and an NS.},

The main results are as follows: (1) The area and horizontal velocity of MMFs mainly range from 0.4 to 2 MSH and 0.2 to 1.7 km s −1 , with typical values of 0.65 MSH and 0.6 km s −1 , respectively. The dominant ranges for B , B t , B z , and γ are 200–400 G, 75–350 G, 153–297 G, and 20°–60°, respectively. (2) Comparing the pre-pore (the stage before the sunspot transforms into the pore) and pore (after the transformation) stages, the area, horizontal velocity, and B z show similar distribution ranges, while the mean values and ranges of B , B t , and γ decrease significantly. (3) In the pre-pore stage, MMFs predominantly manifest as horizontal MMFs (MMFs that have a horizontal magnetic field (45° < γ < 90°)), whereas in the pore stage, most of them are observed as vertical MMFs (MMFs that have a vertical magnetic field (0° < γ ≤ 45°)). These findings provide observational evidence for the turbulent erosion model of the sunspot decay; the mean vertical magnetic field may be an important parameter for the detachment of MMFs from the sunspots.},

We found that HFQPO power spectra may be sensitive to the spatial distribution of dissipation rates, while the quality factors are more sensitive to black hole spin.

The stellar atmospheric parameters, including effective temperature ( T eff ), surface gravity (log g ), metallicity ([Fe/H]), and microturbulence ( ξ t ) are derived using the spectroscopic method, and the nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium effects for both Fe i and Fe ii lines have been considered when determining the iron abundance. Our results show that both [Pd/Fe] and [Ag/Fe] exhibit flat trends with metallicities between −0.7 and −3.0 dex, with an increasing scatter at lower metallicities. This study also finds a clear correlation between [Ag/H] and [Pd/H], indicating that both elements likely share a similar nucleosynthetic origin.},

  abstract     = {T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ( M WD ) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ( M ejecta ) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ( M accreted ). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946 to 2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption, which is P post = 227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ( \dot{P} ) is (−3.1 ± 1.6) × 10 −6 . I have used my full 213,730 magnitude B and V light curve from 1842 to 2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the O − C from 1866 to 1946. I fit the broken parabola shape to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption, which is {P}_{{\rm{pre}}} = 227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by Δ P = +0.146 ± 0.019 days. With Kepler’s Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074 ± 0.00009 M ⊙ . M accreted is reliably measured to be 1.38 × 10 −6 M ⊙ from the accretion luminosity. M ejecta is larger than M accreted by 540×, so M WD is decreasing every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become an SN Ia.},

  abstract     = {Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ( M ejecta ) against the mass accreted between eruptions ( M accreted ). Measuring M accreted can be done in several ways to usable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring M ejecta (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) all have real error bars of 2–3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption (Δ P ). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of Δ P for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses from 1945 to 2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of M ejecta from Δ P . The four eruptions ejected a total of (103 ± 14) × 10 −6 M ⊙ , while the white dwarf accreted 4 × 10 −6 M ⊙ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M ejecta = 26 × M accreted , the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.},

  abstract     = {Observations over the past decade have shown that galaxy clusters undergo the most transformative changes during the z = 1.5–2 epoch. However, challenges such as low lensing efficiency, high shape measurement uncertainty, and a scarcity of background galaxies have prevented us from characterizing their masses with weak gravitational lensing (WL) beyond redshift z ∼ 1.75. In this paper, we report the successful WL detection of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122 at z = 1.80 and z = 1.98, respectively, utilizing deep infrared imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope with careful removal of instrumental effects. These are the most distant clusters ever measured through WL. The mass peaks of JKCS 041 and XLSSC 122, which coincide with the X-ray peak positions of the respective clusters, are detected at the ∼3.7 σ and ∼3.2 σ levels, respectively. Assuming a single spherical Navarro–Frenk–White profile, we estimate that JKCS 041 has a virial mass of M 200 c = (5.4 ± 1.6) × 10 14 M ⊙ , while the mass of XLSSC 122 is determined to be M 200 c = (3.3 ± 1.8) × 10 14 M ⊙ . These WL masses are consistent with the estimates inferred from their X-ray observations. We conclude that although the probability of finding such massive clusters at their redshifts is certainly low, their masses can still be accommodated within the current ΛCDM paradigm.},

While effective algorithms are being developed, there still lacks an integrated understanding of the statistical properties for the population of overlapping compact binary coalescence signals. For the first time, in order to aid rapid and robust estimation, we rigorously derive and establish analytical expressions for the expectation and variance for the number of overlapping events. This framework is highly extensible, allowing analytical calculation for more complicated scenarios, such as multi-signal overlaps, overlaps between different types of sources, and source-dependent thresholds. We also mathematically prove that the time difference between events in a single observation run is described by the beta distribution, offering an analytical prior reference for Bayesian analysis.},

We identify a previously unaccounted screening force, arising from mutual shielding of thermal gas particles between pebbles when their separation falls below the gas mean free path. This force facilitates pebble binding, overcoming key growth barriers under turbulent disk conditions. Unlike conventional mechanisms, screening forces operate independently of surface adhesion and complement streaming instability and pressure traps by enhancing aggregation in high-density regions. Our analysis predicts that screening interactions are most effective in the middle disk regions (∼0.3 to a few astronomical units), consistent with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations (e.g., TW Hya) of enhanced dust concentrations. Furthermore, we find that screening-induced pebble growth from centimeter to kilometer scales can occur on timescales significantly shorter than the disk lifetime (∼10 5 yr). Importantly, this growth naturally terminates when particles smaller than the local gas mean free path are depleted, thereby avoiding runaway accretion. Beyond planetary science, the screening forces have potential implications for high-energy astrophysics, dusty plasmas, confined particle suspensions, and other relevant areas, suggesting a broader fundamental significance.},

However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require further development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids onboard inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer solar system. We show that, for Earth–spacecraft and interspacecraft distances of ≳10 au, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational-wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of 10−30 au and ∼10 W transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that, despite the ∼ 10 4 × longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at ≲0.3 × 10 −4 Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concepts require two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at 10 4 s of 10 −17 , a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational-wave sensitivities in a “Doppler tracking” configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.},

  abstract     = {Understanding solar energetic particle transport in wide-longitude events remains a significant question in heliophysics. By utilizing the increasing number of available observers at various heliographic distances and longitudes, such as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter, we are able to further our understanding of these widespread events. This study presents 3D test particle modeling of three widespread events during the Parker era, each detected by at least four observers. The role of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) in transporting particles to the wide longitudes observed in these events is evaluated. A newly updated and more sophisticated HCS model is used, incorporating three different configurations derived from the Wilcox Solar Observatory, Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport, and Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data (via Predictive Science, PSI) for each event. The modeled proton flux profiles at each observer location are compared against energetic proton measurements for each HCS configuration. We find that inclusion of the HCS is essential to reproduce both the wide longitudinal spread of particles and the observed flux profiles in all three events. For events with longitudinal separations exceeding 100°, the most intense fluxes, both observed and modeled, are associated with observers located nearest to the HCS. This is observed for the 2023 March 13 event, where two observers were located closer in longitude and radial distance than other observers to the source region, yet observed no solar energetic particle signatures due to their lack of proximity to the HCS. Among the three configurations, the HMI-PSI-derived HCS consistently yields the best agreement between observed and modeled flux profiles.},

The availability of both NUV and FUV spectra allows us to define the quasar continuum and correct for strong Lyman-limit systems (LLSs) that fall in the gap between the FUV and optical. Each active galactic nucleus (AGN) has a prominent LLS, but the flux recovery shortward of their Lyman edges allows us to fit and restore the true AGN continuum. In the EUV (450–912 Å), these AGN have flux distributions, {F}_{\nu }\propto {\nu }^{-{\alpha }_{\nu }} , with spectral indices α ν = 1.11 ± 0.22 (SBS 1010+535, z AGN = 1.5086) and α ν = 0.98 ± 0.22 (HS 0747+4259, z AGN = 1.9006), both considerably harder than the mean index, α ν = 1.41 ± 0.15, in a COS composite spectrum of 159 UV-bright AGN.

  abstract     = {Radio relics, arc-like polarized sources with highly aligned magnetic fields, are typically found on the outskirts of merging galaxy clusters. The magnetoionic media responsible for the significant coherence observed in radio relics remain poorly understood. Low-frequency measurements of radio relics are essential for constraining depolarization models, which provide crucial insights into the magnetic field distribution. However, these measurements are challenging due to the emission properties and interferometer systematics. We have detected polarization signals from the northwest radio relic in A746 at 650 MHz with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope, marking the first-ever detection of polarization from radio relics below 1 GHz. At this frequency, the average rotation-measure-corrected magnetic fields align well with shock radio emission, typical of radio relics. The fractional polarization at 650 MHz is ∼18% ± 4%. Our results indicate that a single internal depolarization model cannot explain the observed depolarization spectra, suggesting a nonuniform magnetic field distribution or complex contribution of different polarized regions in the radio relic. Our detection of polarization signals at 650 MHz reveals critical insights into radio relic magnetic field structures, offering a low-frequency approach to understanding intracluster medium magnetic fields in merging galaxy clusters.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for six metal-poor stars with [Fe/H] < –3 (including one with [Fe/H] < –4), selected using narrowband Ca ii HK photometry from the DECam MAGIC Survey. The spectroscopic data confirm the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allow for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with the [Fe/H] < –3 range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 < d helio /kpc ≲ 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026−5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433−5548, with [Fe/H] = –4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe] = +1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433−5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from an ∼11 M ⊙ star in the early Universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring chemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about early galaxy formation and evolution.},

  abstract     = {Pitch angle scattering of pickup ions (PUIs) in the outer heliosheath is studied using two-dimensional hybrid simulations, with the PUIs continuously injected at specified injection rates and pickup angles. The simulations reveal the growth of quasiparallel-propagating waves, quasi-antiparallel-propagating waves, and the oblique mirror mode. The excited waves scatter the PUIs and can reverse their parallel velocities with respect to the background magnetic field. The scattering time, defined as the time when the squared standard deviation of the pitch angles of the PUIs approaches thresholds of 0.2 or 0.4, increases as the PUI injection rate decreases, approximately following a power law. The scattering time estimated for a realistic injection rate in the outer heliosheath is about 0.5 yr at a 45° pickup angle. This scattering time is shorter than the average charge exchange time of about 2 yr for the PUIs to be converted into energetic neutral atoms (ENAs). This result conflicts with the spatial retention scenario of the secondary ENA mechanism, which assumes weak (or incomplete) scattering of PUIs in the off-ribbon directions to explain the ENA ribbon discovered by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer.},

This yields an upper limit on the dark matter cross section if the dark matter column density is known. We investigate a bias in such constraints: the measured column density (along the line of sight, using gravitational lensing) is lower than that experienced by a dark matter particle, as follows. Dark matter halos are triaxial and generally collide along their major axes, yielding a high scattering column density—but the merger is obvious only to observers whose line of sight is nearly perpendicular to that axis, yielding a low observed column density. We trace lines of sight through merging halos from the BigMDPL n -body simulation, both with and without mock observational effects. We find that a hypothetical skewer through the center of the halo along the merger axis (more precisely, along the current separation vector of the two halos) has nearly twice the column density of a typical line of sight. With weak lensing measurements, which involve some spatial averaging, this ratio is reduced to 1.25, suggesting that existing constraints on the scattering cross section are biased high by about 25%.},

The shock is a site of nonthermal particle acceleration, likely via shock-driven magnetic reconnection, and produces synchrotron emission. These shocks are among the few systems in which global scales can be reasonably captured with kinetic simulations, enabling first-principles particle acceleration and emission studies. We perform the first global 3D kinetic simulations of spider pulsar IBSs and predict their polarized emission properties. We report emission spectra, light curves, and polarization patterns as a function of the stripe-averaged magnetic field, cooling strength, and viewing inclination. At 90° inclination and for a low stripe-averaged magnetic field, we reproduce the double peaked light curve observed in spider systems. We predict a significant polarization degree ≳15%, which monotonically increases with the stripe-averaged field strength. Our results can be applied to and tested by forthcoming X-ray polarization observations of spider pulsars.},

  abstract     = {The detection of a ≃220 PeV muon neutrino event by the KM3NeT telescope offers an unprecedented opportunity to probe the Universe at extreme energies. A photopion interaction origin of the neutrino requires a parent cosmic-ray energy of ≳4 EeV per nucleon. We analyze the origin of this event under three scenarios, i.e., a transient point source, diffuse astrophysical emission, and a line-of-sight interaction of an ultrahigh-energy cosmic ray (UHECR; E ≳ 0.1 EeV). Our analysis includes the flux from both a KM3NeT-only fit and a joint fit, incorporating data from KM3NeT, IceCube, and the Pierre Auger Observatory. If the neutrino event originates from transients, it requires a new population of transients that is energetic, γ -ray-dark, and more abundant than the known ones. In the framework of diffuse astrophysical emission, we compare the required local UHECR energy injection rate at ≳4 EeV with the rate derived from the flux measurements by Auger, across various models of source redshift evolution. This disfavors the KM3NeT-only fit, considering the source evolution up to high values of redshift, while the joint fit remains viable for sources contributing up to a maximum redshift {z}_{{\rm{\max }}}\gtrsim 1 for the limiting case of photopion interaction efficiency, f pγ = 0.1. For a cosmogenic origin from point sources, the luminosity obtained at redshifts z ≲ 1 from the joint fit is compatible with the Eddington luminosity of ∼10 9 M ⊙ black holes in active galactic nuclei, assuming a proton composition and optimistic values of extragalactic magnetic field strength.},

Significant variability was detected in the HCO + (1–0)/N 2 H + (1–0) flux ratio. Radiative transfer analysis indicates this ratio variability likely results from temperature fluctuations driven by an accretion burst, as chemical processes operate on timescales exceeding our observational window. Correlation with a 6.7 GHz methanol maser light curve suggests the HCO + /N 2 H + ratio serves as a novel tracer of accretion bursts in MYSOs.

Using thermochemical modeling, we explore how the temperature and chemistry within a protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star are impacted by the surrounding UV environment. The disk becomes hotter due to heating by photodissociation of molecules, photoelectric heating, H 2 , and atomic processes, and as a result, the area in which molecules exist in the ice phase shrinks, being pushed both downward and inward. Beyond 1 au, the chemistry changes most significantly in a UV-rich background; the atmosphere becomes more H 2 O, OH, and atomic-rich. Hydrocarbons, however, reside primarily well within 1 au of the disk; thus, their abundance and distribution are not impacted by the UV field up to 10 6 G 0 . The products of photodissociation and photochemistry are formed deeper into the disk with increasing UV background field strength beyond 1 au, impacting the chemistry near the midplane. Effectively, a “reset” chemistry takes place, with an enhancement of atoms, simple molecules, and molecules in the gas phase. Planets that form in highly irradiated regions will be exposed to a different chemical reservoir in the gas and ice phases than that in an isolated disk, and the impact from the UV background should only be detectable in highly irradiated disks (∼10 6 G 0 ).},

We confirm the presence of broad features, type C, and type B quasiperiodic oscillations in the power spectra of the different spectral states. We investigate the fractional rms and lags of all the variability features and discover that the lags swing between positive and negative during the outburst evolution. While modeling the features with a simple model that considers variations in accretion parameters, such as the accretion rate, heating rate, and inner-disk radius, along with the delays between them, we find a dynamic reversal in the origin of the variability between the corona and the disk. Furthermore, our results are consistent with previous works and a radio study conducted on this source during its outburst.},

  abstract     = {The Milky Way’s disk–halo interface mediates energy and mass exchange between the interstellar thin disk and the halo. In the first detailed study of the Perseus arm’s disk–halo interface, we combine Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Cosmic Origins Spectrograph absorption spectra toward six stars and 23 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) projected behind a narrow section (95° < l < 145°, −46° < b < 0°). This provides a unique data set that bridges the disk and its extended vertical structure in these directions. We measure S ii , Si iv , and C iv absorption, along with H i 21 cm emission, at heights −70 pc to −3.3 kpc from the midplane. The arm’s southern vertical structure shows distinct height-dependent behaviors: H i and S ii column densities sharply decline with height up to 1.5 kpc, then continue declining at a much shallower rate at greater heights. In contrast, high ion (Si IV and C IV ) column densities remain relatively constant throughout the entire height range. In the disk–halo interface, where warm neutral medium dominates, S ii and the high ions show similar kinematics, and we find a remarkably uniform C iv /Si iv ratio (〈 N C IV / N Si IV 〉  = 2.5 ± 0.5) within −0.9 to −3.25 kpc. Both the kinematic correspondence and high-ion ratio are consistent with the high ions probing turbulent mixing layers at the interfaces between warm/cool and hot gas phases. The AGN sight lines reveal minimal circumgalactic medium contribution in the low-velocity gas at ∣ v LSR ∣ < 100 km s −1 . The extraplanar absorbing gas may trace material ejected from previous Galactic fountain activity.},

  abstract     = {We present Chandra observations of 63 sources from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph−Distant Quasar Survey, of which 54 were targeted by snapshot observations in Cycle 24. A total of 55 sources are clearly detected in at least one X-ray band, and we set stringent upper limits on the X-ray fluxes of the remaining eight sources. In combination with rest-frame ultraviolet–optical spectroscopic data for these sources, we assess whether X-rays can provide a robust accretion rate indicator for quasars, particularly at the highest accessible redshifts. We utilize a recently modified H β -based Eddington luminosity ratio estimator, as well as the C iv λ 1549 emission-line parameter space, to investigate trends and correlations with the optical–X-ray spectral slope ( α ox ) and the effective hard X-ray power-law photon index (Γ). We find that α ox does not improve current accretion rate estimates based on H β or C iv . Instead, within the limitations of our sample, we confirm previous findings that the C iv parameter space may be a better indicator of the accretion rate up to z ∼ 3.5. We also find that the average Γ values for a small subset of our sources, as well as the average Γ value in different groupings of our sources, are consistent with their respective relatively high Eddington luminosity ratios. Deeper X-ray observations of our X-ray-detected sources are needed for measuring Γ accurately and testing whether this parameter can serve as a robust, unbiased accretion rate diagnostic.},

Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in the case of an aligned dipole, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437–4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.},

  abstract     = {Most general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH) hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger-scale Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss of coherent rotation. To investigate these differences, we modify the standard torus setup across four BH spins: a * = 0, 0.5, 0.9, −0.9. First, we increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational radii), allowing long simulations (2.8 × 10 5 gravitational times) without gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori, indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors of ∼1.6 and 2.5 for BH spins a * = 0.5 and 0.9, respectively, compared to a * = 0. Also, the density profile scales as ρ ( r ) ∝ r −1.1 for prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in the large torus by setting the plasma- β ≈ 1. This induces strong variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the a * = 0.9 model, for instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and the gas rotation reverses directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key parameter is the ratio { \mathcal R } between the rotational and magnetic energies in the initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with larger values of { \mathcal R } . The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot accretion flows in nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved long enough.},

The twist and tilt of the BMR magnetic field are modeled as a result of an effective electromotive force along the rising part of the toroidal magnetic field. This force generates the poloidal field that tilts the whole magnetic configuration. We find that variations of BMR’s twist and tilt determine the magnitude and the sign of the magnetic helicity flux on the solar surface. The model shows that the helicity flux associated with the BMR’s tilt/twist is the dominant contribution to the BMR helicity at the beginning of the BMR’s evolution, while the effect of differential rotation is the main source of the helicity flux at the final stage of the BMR’s evolution. We discuss the implications of these effects on the basic properties and variations of the hemispheric helicity rule of active regions on the solar surface.},

In order to bypass the use of field differences, which mitigate flat field errors but reduce sensitivity, we characterize and correct for the flat field on pseudopower spectra, which includes both additive and multiplicative biases. To more effectively mask point sources at 1.1 and 1.8 μ m, we develop a technique for predicting masking catalogs that utilizes optical and near-infrared photometry through random forest regression. This allows us to mask over 2 Vega mag deeper than the completeness limits of Two Micron All Sky Survey alone, with errors in the shot noise power remaining below <10% at all masking depths considered. Through detailed simulations of CIBER observations, we validate our formalism and demonstrate unbiased recovery of the sky fluctuations on realistic mocks. We demonstrate that residual flat field errors comprise <20% of the final CIBER power spectrum uncertainty with this methodology.},

Nebular gas emission is a common tracer of galaxies’ gravitational potential and angular momenta, but is sensitive to nongravitational forces as well as galactic outflows, and thus might not accurately trace the host galaxy dynamics. We present kinematic maps of young stars from rest-ultraviolet photospheric absorption in the star-forming galaxy CASSOWARY 13 (a.k.a. SDSS J1237+5533) at z = 1.87 using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, alongside nebular emission measurements from the same observations. Gravitational lensing magnification of the galaxy enables good spatial sampling of multiple independent lensed images. We find close agreement between the stellar and nebular velocity fields. We measure a mean local velocity dispersion of σ = 64 ± 12 km s −1 for the young stars, consistent with that of the H ii regions traced by nebular C iii ] emission (52  ±  9 km s −1 ). The ∼20 km s −1 average difference in line-of-sight velocity is much smaller than the local velocity width and the velocity gradient (≳100 km s −1 ). We find no evidence of asymmetric drift nor evidence that outflows bias the nebular kinematics, and thus we conclude that nebular emission appears to be a reasonable dynamical tracer of young stars in the galaxy. These results support the picture of star formation in thick disks with high velocity dispersion at z ∼ 2, and they represent an important step toward establishing robust kinematics of early galaxies using collisionless tracers.},

  abstract     = {Diverse formation channels have been proposed to explain the emergence of fast radio bursts (FRBs), yet their origin remains elusive. With improved localization precision, roughly 90 FRBs are now associated with host galaxies. Spectral energy distribution fitting to the host galaxy photometry reveals their stellar masses ( M ⋆ ) and star formation rates (SFRs), enabling discrimination between various formation channels. We conduct an extensive comparison of the stellar mass, SFR, and redshift distributions of 51 FRB hosts and mock generated galaxy samples to test whether FRBs trace SFR or M ⋆ . We incorporate a mass-to-light ratio ( {({{M}}_{\star }/{{L}}_{{r}})}_{{\rm{obs}}} ) prescription to address optical selection biases. In line with K. Sharma et al., we provide evidence in favor of FRB progenitors tracking SFR rather than stellar mass. We show that the shape of the assumed {({M}_{\star }/{L}_{r})}_{{\rm{o}}{\rm{b}}{\rm{s}}} distribution affects the predictions, bringing the low-mass end of the stellar mass distribution closer to the data when accounting for the {\mathrm{SFR}}\mbox{--}{({M}_{\star }/{L}_{r})}_{{\mathrm{obs}}} correlation. The K -correction effect in the r band is minimal for galaxies at z ≲ 0.7. In the model in which FRBs trace SFR, up to ∼6% of a flux-limited FRB host sample can reside below the star-forming main sequence. Finally, we examine a hybrid model in which a fraction of FRBs tracks stellar mass rather than SFR. This fraction can be as large as ∼40%−50%, suggesting that multiple formation channels are still consistent with observations. The toolkit developed in this work, GALFRB ( https://github.com/loudasnick/GALFRB ; N. Loudas et al.), is publicly available, offering a straightforward way to generate mock galaxy samples suitable for direct comparisons with future FRB host galaxy data.},

This observing mode marks a new era in the discovery of new objects, such as L- and T-type dwarfs, which can be found from direct identification through the H 2 O and CH 4 absorption bands. NISP spectral resolution ( R ∼  450) is enough to classify the objects by the spectral type using known standard templates. Q1 provided more than 4 million NIR spectra in one visit to the Euclid Deep Fields. The large amount of spectra released in these fields allowed us to (a) confirm the UCD nature of almost half of the photometric candidates compiled by J. Y. Zhang et al.; (b) discover at least 11 new late L- and T-type dwarfs by a specific spectral index search in Q1 data; and (c) spectroscopically confirm 100 more candidates from a new photometric selection conducted by M. Žerjal et al. We present a preliminary list of Euclid UCD templates built by the combination of the best spectra from all these searches. We include the first spectral analysis of confirmed UCDs from Q1 data; spectral classifications; determination of effective temperatures; H 2 O, CH 4 , and NH 3 spectral indices; and measurements of the K I absorption doublet.

The used Ketju code combines the gadget-4 fast multiple gravity solver with accurate regularized integration and post-Newtonian corrections (up to PN3.5) around SMBHs. The ejected SMBHs carry clusters of bound stellar material (black hole recoil clusters, BRCs) with masses in the range of 10 6 ≲ M BRC ≲ 10 7 M ⊙ and sizes of several 10 pc. For recoil velocities up to 60% of the galaxy escape velocity, the BRCs are detectable in mock photometric images at a Euclid-like resolution up to redshift z ∼ 1.0. By Monte Carlo sampling the observability for different recoil directions and magnitudes, we predict that in ∼20% of instances the BRCs are photometrically detectable, most likely for kicks with SMBH apocentres less than the galaxy effective radius. BRCs occupy distinct regions in the stellar mass/velocity dispersion versus size relations of known star clusters and galaxies. An enhanced velocity dispersion in excess of σ ∼ 600 km s −1 coinciding with the SMBH position provides the best evidence for an SMBH-hosting stellar system, effectively distinguishing BRCs from other faint stellar systems. BRCs are promising candidates to observe the aftermath of the yet-undetected mergers of the most massive SMBHs and we estimate that up to 8000 BRCs might be observable below z ≲ 0.6 with large-scale photometric surveys such as Euclid and upcoming high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy with the Extremely Large Telescope.},

In this paper, we study the afterglows of these GRBs—namely GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C, and GRB 221009A—modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within the framework of an optimized relativistic fireball model. We constrain the model parameters and their temporal evolution by applying our theoretical model to the high-energy emission in the X-ray and GeV–TeV energy bands observed at intermediate and late times. Our results reveal interesting differences among the TeV-detected GRBs, potentially reflecting a variety of underlying physical processes that lead to different maximum energies {E}_{{\rm{\max }}}=\,{\gamma }_{{\rm{\max }}}\,{m}_{e}\,{c}^{2} of the accelerated particles responsible for the GRB high-energy emission. We indeed obtain different behaviors of the late TeV afterglows that ultimately depend on {\gamma }_{{\rm{\max }}} . We discuss how late afterglow observations—on timescales of hours and days—of X-ray and GeV–TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics of the physical processes behind GRBs, and we emphasize the theoretical expectations for future TeV observations.},

  abstract     = {We analyze the dynamics of low-mass black hole (BH) seeds in the high-redshift ( z ≳ 5) Universe using a suite of [4.5 Mpc] 3 and [9 Mpc] 3 BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The simulations form seeds with mass M seed = 2.2 × 10 3 M ⊙ in halos that exceed critical thresholds of dense and metal-poor gas mass (5–150 M seed ) and the halo mass (1000–10,000 M seed ). While the initial BRAHMA boxes pinned the BHs to the halo centers, here we implement a subgrid dynamical friction (DF) model. We also compare simulations where the BH is allowed to wander without the added DF. We investigate the spatial and velocity offsets of BHs in their host subhalos, as well as BH merger rates. We find that subgrid DF is crucial to ensure that a significant fraction of BHs effectively sink to halo centers by z ∼ 5, thereby enabling them to get gravitationally bound and merge with other BHs at separations close to the spatial resolution (∼0.2–0.4 kpc) of the simulation. For the BHs that merge, the associated merger timescales lag between ∼100 and 1000 Myr after their host halos merge. Compared to predictions using BH repositioning, the overall z ≳ 5 BH merger rates under subgrid DF decrease by a factor of ∼4–10. Under subgrid DF, the different seed models predict merger rates between ∼100 and 1000 events per year at z ≳ 5. These mergers dominate early BH growth, assembling BHs up to ∼10 4 –10 5 M ⊙ by z ∼ 5, wherein ≲2% of their mass is assembled via gas accretion. Our results highlight the promise for constraining seeding mechanisms using gravitational waves from future facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.},

Truncation can have spectral and polarization signatures all its own, tilt introduces both inclination and azimuthal dependencies into the spectra and polarization, and precession and oscillations of the tilted accretion flow inside the truncation radius introduce time dependencies or periodicity to all of this. We use the ray-traced results from our simulations to evaluate the feasibility of measuring these effects, particularly in the context of current and future X-ray polarization observatories.

It is unclear to what extent the rarity of magnetic detections in massive stars near the TAMS is due to magnetic field decay or observational biases. We report the detection of a weak surface magnetic field in the O-type giant 63 Oph ( T eff = 35.0 ± 0.3 kK, {\mathrm{log}}\,g=3.51\pm 0.03 ) from new ESPaDOnS circularly polarized spectra. The mean longitudinal field strength associated with the magnetic detection is 〈 B z 〉 = 84 ± 14 G, which we use to set a lower limit on the dipolar field strength of B p ≥ 300 ± 50 G. We report Balmer line-core equivalent widths (EWs) and radial velocity measurements from the analysis of spectra primarily obtained by the IACOB project with the FEROS, FIES, and HERMES spectrographs. We identify a dominant period of ∼19.8 days in the EWs, which we attribute to the effects of a rotating magnetosphere under the oblique rotator model. We do not identify any coherent signals in a time series analysis of archival Hipparcos, ASAS-SN, and K2 photometry. Our findings show that 63 Oph may be a rare link between strongly magnetic massive stars detected on or near the zero-age main sequence and weakly magnetic O-type supergiants. Additional observations are needed to fully constrain 63 Oph’s magnetic field geometry and magnetospheric properties.},

In this work, for the first time, we used the archival data and employed the physics-determined SED processing method to form approximately average-state SEDs for 513 Fermi bright BL Lacs. In general, we found that the magnetic field ( B ) is weaker than those obtained for the flaring/outburst state by nearly 1 order of magnitude, and the dissipation region size ( R ) is larger than those obtained for the flaring/outburst state, suggesting that the dissipation region could be more extended and less magnetized. A correlation between the synchrotron self-Compton peak frequency ( {\mathrm{log}}\,{\nu }_{{{\rm{ssc}}}} ) and the synchrotron peak frequency ( {\mathrm{log}}\,{\nu }_{{{\rm{sy}}}} ) suggests that the inverse Compton scattering of higher-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs suffers a significant Klein–Nishina (KN) suppression; we quantified the condition of KN suppression by determining the critical synchrotron peak frequency ( {\nu }_{{{\rm{sy}}}^{{\rm{c}}}} ) and found 359 out of 513 sources in our sample suffer KN suppression. Furthermore, our analysis of the relationship between synchrotron curvature (1/ b sy ) and {\mathrm{log}}\,{\nu }_{{{\rm{sy}}}} indicates that the energy-dependent probability acceleration mechanism may dominate the particle acceleration in BL Lac jets.},

This study continues our previous simulation work that successfully reproduced the X7.1-class solar flare. In this study, we performed a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation using the nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition to investigate the X9.0-class solar flare. The NLFFF showed the sheared field lines, resulting in the tether-cutting reconnection, the magnetic flux ropes, and eventually led to eruption. The magnetic reconnection during the pre-eruption phase plays a critical role in accelerating the subsequent eruption, which is driven by torus instability and magnetic reconnection. Furthermore, our simulation results are consistent with several observational features associated with the X9.0 flare. This simulation could reproduce diverse phenomena associated with the X9.0 flare, including the tether-cutting reconnection, the flare ribbons and the postflare loops, the transverse field enhancement, and the remote brightening away from the flare ribbons. However, the initial trigger, magnetic flux emergence, was inferred from observations rather than explicitly modeled, and future comprehensive simulations should incorporate this mechanism directly.},

We find that HST/H α and JWST/NIRCam 2–3.6 μ m photometry significantly improves our ability to disentangle the age–reddening degeneracy between young, gas- and dust-rich clusters and older, dustless clusters. The near-infrared data provide strong constraints on hot continuum dust and small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission for populations where gas and dust are present. These hot dust constraints demonstrate that Bruzual & Charlot stellar population models do not align with the observed near-ultraviolet-optical-near-infrared spectral energy distributions of star clusters in the first 10 Myr. We note that for old and low-metallicity globular clusters, the inclusion of narrowband H α and/or broadband near-infrared data does not improve the determination of age and reddening parameters, due to the lack of stars capable of heating dust in the near-infrared regime.},

  abstract     = {We report the first robust evidence for a cospatial subparsec acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in the twin jets of the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus NGC 4261. This result is derived from multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array imaging, combined with the frequency-dependent properties of the radio core (core shift and core size) and jet kinematics determined from the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at (1.23 ± 0.24) pc or (8.1 ± 1.6) × 10 3 R s (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and (0.97 ± 0.29) pc or (6.4 ± 1.9) × 10 3 R s for the counterjet. We also derive the jet velocity field at distances of ∼(10 3 –2 × 10 4 ) R s . While local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from ∼10 3 to ∼8 × 10 3 R s , with a maximum Lorentz factor of {{\rm{\Gamma }}}_{{\rm{\max }}}\approx 2.6 . Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to subrelativistic speeds. These findings support the existence of a subparsec-scale (≲1.5 pc) ACZ in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analog of that in M87. These results point toward a potential diversity in jet ACZ properties, emphasizing the importance of extending such studies to a broader AGN population to elucidate the physical mechanisms at play.},

The redshift range of the galaxies is limited to 5.03 ≤ z ≤ 5.26 by requiring photometric excess in NIRCam’s F277W and F410M images. A total of 259 H β + [O iii ] and H α dual-line emitters are found over the absolute UV magnitude −22 ≲ M UV ≲ −17, with a mean rest-frame equivalent width of 990 Å for H β + [O iii ] and 1050 Å for H α . This population accounts for ∼40% of the Lyman-break galaxies at this redshift range. Intriguingly, there are 58 objects (22% of the whole sample) that exhibit compact morphology at the rest-UV or optical wavelength. Assuming that these compact dual-line emitters are dominated by AGNs, their bolometric luminosities are in the range of 2 × 10 43 ≲ L bol /(erg s −1 ) ≲ 3 × 10 44 . Their number density is 2 dex higher than the extrapolation from UV-selected luminous quasars, which is in good agreement with previous JWST studies of broad-line AGNs, requiring a ∼10% AGN duty cycle. Moreover, our dual-line emitter sample reaches the faint end of the H α and [O iii ] luminosity functions down to ≲10 42 erg s −1 .

  abstract     = {Surface lithium is depleted when a star goes through the first dredge-up phase, yet 1% of red giants are found to be Li rich. The formation mechanism for these remains uncertain. We combine observational constraints from Galactic Archaeology with HERMES ( GALAH ) Li-rich giants, with the binary population synthesis software Compact Object Synthesis and Monte Carlo Investigation Code ( COSMIC) to investigate the system properties of these objects assuming binary mass transfer. By evolving nine million binary systems, we find that binary histories most consistent with the observational constraints are mass transfer from an intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) donor to a main-sequence (MS) star now observed as a Li-rich red giant. In GALAH , 9% of MS stars have A (Li) = 2.5–3.2 dex making it plausible to create red giants with A (Li) = 1.5–2.2 dex via MS mass transfer, but they cannot explain the more enriched giants with A (Li) ≳ 2.2 dex. Nucleosynthetic yields from stellar models show that AGB stars with initial masses of 4.25–5 M ⊙ and 8 M ⊙ contain the most lithium in their ejecta. Intermediate-mass AGB stars comprise 29% of the COSMIC results, with present-day separations s = 3.3 ± 0.5 au and mass ratios q = 0.5–1.6. We achieve 95% agreement in mean enhancements in Ba and Y between the GALAH observations and stellar models of 6 and 8 M ⊙ AGB stars, assuming a 1% mass transfer efficiency. We find a low mass transfer efficiency best reproduces the GALAH observations suggesting that the preferred mass transfer mechanism for Li enrichment is via wind Roche-lobe overflow. While we constrain the most plausible binary parameters assuming AGB mass transfer creates Li-rich giants, discrepancies in the nucleosynthesis comparisons and the small fraction of Li-enhanced MS stars suggests additional enrichment mechanisms are likely.},

  abstract     = {Strong gravitational lenses with two background sources at widely separated redshifts are a promising independent probe of cosmological parameters. We can use these systems, known as double-source-plane lenses (DSPLs), to measure the ratio ( β ) of angular-diameter distances of the sources, which is sensitive to the matter density (Ω m ) and the equation-of-state parameter for dark-energy ( w ). However, DSPLs are rare and require high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy for detection, lens modeling, and measuring β . Here, we report only the second DSPL ever used to measure cosmological parameters. We model the DSPL AGEL 150745+052256 from the ASTRO 3D Galaxy Evolution with Lenses ( AGEL ) survey using Hubble Space Telescope/Wide-Field Camera 3 imaging and Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy. The spectroscopic redshifts for the deflector and two sources in AGEL 1507 are z defl = 0.594, z S1 =  2.163, and z S2 = 2.591. We measure a stellar velocity dispersion of σ obs = 109 ± 27 km s −1 for the nearer source (S1). Using σ obs for the main deflector (from literature) and S1, we test the robustness of our DSPL model. We measure \beta =0.95{3}_{-0.010}^{+0.008} for AGEL 1507 and infer Ω m =\,0.3{3}_{-0.23}^{+0.38} for ΛCDM cosmology. Combining AGEL 1507 with the published model of the Jackpot lens improves the precision on Ω m (ΛCDM) and w ( w CDM) by ∼10%. The inclusion of DSPLs significantly improves the constraints when combined with Planck’s cosmic microwave background observations, enhancing the precision on w by 30%. This paper demonstrates the potential constraining power of DSPLs and their complementarity to other standard cosmological probes. Tighter future constraints from larger DSPL samples discovered from ongoing and forthcoming large-area sky surveys would provide insights into the nature of dark energy.},

  abstract     = {We are on the cusp of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar timing arrays. These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks and minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which is essential for localizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the radiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines one of the minidisks in an equal-mass 2 × 10 7 M ⊙ MBHB separated by 100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with detected GWs.},

  abstract     = {The study of pulsar glitches provides a unique window into the internal structure and dynamic processes of neutron stars. PSR J0007+7303, a very bright gamma-ray pulsar, is the first pulsar discovered by the Fermi–Large Area Telescope (LAT) telescope. In this paper, we present the 15 yr of timing results of this pulsar using the Fermi-LAT data. We identified nine glitches, five of which are newly discovered. Among these new glitches, two are small glitches, occurring between the three previously reported ones, while the other three are large glitches. The glitches exhibit fractional frequency changes ranging from 21.5 × 10 −9 to 1239 × 10 −9 , with intervals of approximately 1–2 yr between events. Uniquely, this pulsar shows no exponential recovery behavior following any glitch, setting it apart from most glitching pulsars. Furthermore, no significant changes were observed in the gamma-ray pulse profile, flux, or phase-averaged spectra before and after glitches, indicating the stability of the pulsar’s emission properties despite internal changes. A parametric analysis of the glitches yielded a fractional moment of inertia of the crustal superfluid involved in glitches as 1.06%, which matches extremely well with previous statistical work if the nondissipative entrainment effect is not considered and strongly supports the internal origin of these glitches. These results highlight the distinct glitch behavior of PSR J0007+7303 and offer valuable insights into the crust–superfluid interaction in neutron stars. The physical origin of no exponential recovery is also discussed.},

  abstract     = {We present SIDM Concerto: 14 cosmological zoom-in simulations in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models based on the Symphony and Milky Way-est suites. SIDM Concerto includes one Large Magellanic Cloud– (LMC-) mass system (host mass ∼10 11 M ⊙ ), two Milky Way (MW) analogs (∼10 12 M ⊙ ), two group-mass hosts (∼10 13 M ⊙ ), and one low-mass cluster (∼10 14 M ⊙ ). Each host contains ≈2 × 10 7 particles and is run in CDM and one or more strong, velocity-dependent SIDM models. Our analysis of SIDM (sub)halo populations over seven subhalo mass decades reveals that (1) the fraction of core-collapsed isolated halos and subhalos peaks at a maximum circular velocity corresponding to the transition of the SIDM cross section from a v −4 to v 0 scaling; (2) SIDM subhalo mass functions are suppressed by ≈50% relative to CDM in LMC, MW, and group-mass hosts but are consistent with CDM in the low-mass cluster host; (3) subhalos’ inner density profile slopes, which are more diverse in SIDM than in CDM, are sensitive to both the amplitude and shape of the SIDM cross section. Our simulations provide a benchmark for testing SIDM predictions with astrophysical observations of field and satellite galaxies, strong lensing systems, and stellar streams.

  abstract     = {We present a new spectropolarimetric method for the estimation of the inclination of X-ray binaries using the linear polarization (LP) value in black hole (BH) sources, based on the early paper by R. A. Sunyaev & L. G. Titarchuk. The X-ray LP arises from multiple scattering of initially soft photons in a hot, optically thick Compton cloud (CC) using a flat geometry. R. A. Sunyaev & L. G. Titarchuk showed that the LP degree P depends on the binary inclination i and remains independent of the photon energy. Moreover, P follows a characteristic angular distribution based on the CC optical depth τ 0 ; in particular, for τ 0 > 10, the LP follows the S. Chandrasekhar distribution. In light of the vast number of recent IXPE spectropolarimetric observations of BHs, testing this approach in combination with spectral analysis of these sources by other missions is desirable. In particular, the BH source, 4U 1957+115, was observed with IXPE in the high/soft state for which a P of ∼ 2% was found. To apply the new method, in addition to knowing P for a given source, it is necessary to estimate the CC optical depth τ 0 and then to calculate the best-fit photon index Γ and the plasma temperature kT e . We present the X-ray spectral analysis of 4U 1957+115 using data from IXPE , NuSTAR, NICER, RXTE, Swift, Suzaku, and ASCA. We show that the X-ray source spectra are well described by the Comptonization model with Γ varying from 1.5 to 3. We find a monotonic increase in Γ with the mass accretion rate, \dot{M} , and a final saturation of the index at Γ ∼ 3 for high \dot{M} . We determine a BH mass by the scaling method: M 1957 = 4.8 ± 1.8 M ⊙ , assuming a source distance of 22 kpc, using H 1743–322, 4U 1630–47, and GRS 1915+105 as reference sources.},

Using different analysis methods, such as a space-integrated study of the entire region of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and a space-resolved polarization map, we detect significant polarization from the PWN at the center of the SNR, with an average polarization degree of ∼10% oriented at ∼33° (north through east). No significant energy-dependent variation in polarization is observed across the IXPE band (2–8 keV). The polarization map, corrected for the effect of polarization leakage, reveals a consistent pattern in both degree and angle, with little change across the nebula. Our findings indicate the presence of a highly polarized central torus, suggesting low levels of turbulence at particle acceleration sites. Unlike Vela, but similar to the Crab Nebula, we observe substantial differences between radio and X-ray polarization maps. This suggests a clear separation in energy of the emitting particle populations and hints at an important, yet poorly understood, role of instabilities in the turbulence dynamics of PWNe.},

  abstract     = {Stellar streams from disrupted globular clusters are dynamically cold structures that are sensitive to perturbations from dark matter subhalos, allowing them in principle to trace the dark matter substructure in the Milky Way. We model, within the context of Λ cold dark matter, the likelihood of dark matter subhalos to produce a significant feature in a GD-1-like stream and analyze the properties of such subhalos. We generate many realizations of the subhalo population within a Milky Way mass host halo using the semianalytic code SatGen , accounting for effects such as tidal stripping and dynamical friction. The subhalo distributions are combined with a GD-1-like stream model, and the impact of subhalos that pass close to the stream are modeled with Gala . We find that subhalos with masses in the range 2 × 10 6 M ⊙ –10 8 M ⊙ at the time of the stream–subhalo encounter, corresponding to masses of about 2 × 10 7 M ⊙ –10 9 M ⊙ at the time of infall, are the likeliest to produce gaps in a GD-1-like stream. We find that gaps occur on average ∼3 times per realization of the host system. These gaps have typical widths of ∼(5–27)° and fractional underdensities of ∼(10–30)%, with larger gaps being caused by heavier subhalos. The stream–subhalo encounters responsible for these have impact parameters (0.1–1.5) kpc and relative velocities ∼(200–410) km s −1 . We also investigate the effects of increasing the host-halo mass on the gap properties and formation rate.},

These systems will serve as verification sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). To significantly improve the electromagnetic (EM) constraints on these two systems and the LISA detectability predictions, we conducted spectroscopic follow-up observations using Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Keck I/LRIS, and Keck II/Echellette Spectrograph and Imager. Our analysis significantly improves the temperature, surface gravity, and mass constraints for both primary and secondary components in J2322+0509, as well as dynamical properties such as radial velocities and orbital periods in both systems. For J2322+0509, we derive an updated inclination of i = 25 {}_{-3.0}^{+4.5} deg, while for J0634+3803, we obtain i = 43 {}_{-5.6}^{+7.0} deg. We assess the detectability of these sources using LDASOFT. Incorporating EM priors on inclination significantly enhances the gravitational-wave signal recovery, reducing uncertainties in amplitude by a factor of 2–4 and shortening the detection time by up to a few months. Our results underscore the importance of multimessenger observations in characterizing DWD binaries and maximizing LISA’s early scientific capabilities.},

Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for 16 O/ 20 Ne separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including 22 Ne in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard 16 O/ 20 Ne case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (<10%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay of up to ∼10 times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.},

  abstract     = {About two-thirds of disk galaxies host spiral arms, ranging from well-delineated grand-design spirals to fragmented flocculent spiral galaxies. We introduce fractal dimension D B as a nonparametric measure to distinguish between grand-designs and flocculents. We calculate the D B of 197 grand-designs and 322 flocculents from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR18, using the samples of R. J. Buta et al. ( 2015 ) and S. Sarkar et al. ( 2023 ). Our calculated median values of D B are 1.2{9}_{-0.04}^{+0.06} and 1.3{8}_{-0.06}^{+0.05} for the grand-designs and flocculents, respectively. In addition, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K-S) test rejects the null hypothesis that these distributions are drawn from the same population. Finally, using a random forest model, we compare the effectiveness of D B in classifying spiral arm morphology with that of five other parameters: the total atomic hydrogen H I mass, M HI; the ratio of atomic hydrogen mass to blue luminosity, M HI / L B ; concentration index, C i ; clumpiness, S ; and arm contrast, C . Our results indicate that D B has the highest feature index (30.8%), followed by C i (26.0%) and M HI (21.0%). In fact, C—the metric routinely used to distinguish between the spiral morphologies—has a feature importance of 8.3%. Further, D B for grand-designs is found to anticorrelate with the central velocity dispersion with a correlation coefficient of −0.3 and p ≪ 0.05. The high value of central velocity dispersion indicates a central Q -barrier, which favors the formation of grand-designs according to the density wave theory. Thus, the fractal dimension serves as a robust metric to distinguish between spiral morphologies and also links to the formation mechanism of the spiral features.},

  abstract     = {Time-series analyses of helioseismic data and solar neutrino data have indicated the potential existence of a second tachocline at the core–radiative zone interface, which may in turn require consideration of an additional source of magnetic flux generation in the deep solar interior ( r / R ⊙ ≲ 0.5). This work considers the generation of a Biermann battery magnetic flux in the deep solar interior and the potential transport of that magnetic flux outward by diffusion. At low latitudes, we expect this additional flux to interact with the flux generated at the base of the convective zone to result in the solar magnetic field observed near the ecliptic. At high latitudes, the diffused flux may manifest as scattered regions of intense polar fields that could be measured by appropriate instruments on spacecraft far off the ecliptic.},

  abstract     = {Using a time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we demonstrated the lunar limb compression caused by the core-induced magnetic field. When a sudden change occurs in the upstream interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), an induced response is generated within the Moon’s conductive core. When the direction of the IMF jump is the same as the IMF direction after the jump, a diamagnetic current is driven inside the core, strengthening the magnetic field beneath the lunar surface but outside the core. In most dayside regions, this induced subsurface magnetic pressure is suppressed by the strong solar wind dynamic pressure. However, in regions near the terminator, where the solar wind dynamic pressure is lower, this induced subsurface magnetic pressure can compress the solar wind above the lunar surface, forming limb compression structures around the Moon. This work not only clarifies a new physical mechanism for the source of the lunar limb compression (driven by the core-induced magnetic field rather than the crustal magnetic field) but also ascertains the starting position of the limb compression, as well as its temporal variation during the IMF jump. These results can greatly improve our understanding of the Moon’s electromagnetic environment and have potential applications to constrain the conductive state of lunar core.},

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal place to study hot core and COM formation in an environment that is different from our Galaxy, though prior to this study there have only been nine detections of extragalactic hot cores (seven in the LMC and two in the Small Magellanic Cloud, SMC). Here, we report 1.2 mm continuum and molecular line observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in the star-forming region N 160, which we named N 160A–mm. We identify six 1.2 mm continuum sources, four of which are associated with methanol (CH 3 OH) emission. Another COM, methyl cyanide (CH 3 CN) is associated with the brightest source, N 160A–mm A, the most chemically rich source in the field. Using the XCLASS software, we perform spectral modeling to estimate rotational temperatures and total column densities of detected molecular species for four sources. Based on the temperature exceeding 100 K, its small size, and high H 2 number density, we identify N 160A–mm A as a hot core. We compare the molecular abundances of this newly detected hot core with those previously detected in the LMC and SMC, as well as with a sample of Galactic hot cores, and discuss the complex nature of N 160A–mm A.},

Over the ∼60 day duration reported here, the integrated pulse profile remained consistently stable, exhibiting a single, narrow peak with a small precursor component and no evidence of a postcursor one. This pulse profile is in sharp contrast to the double-peaked morphology observed during an observing campaign ∼120 days preceding ours. Along with this change in the integrated pulse profile shape, we also measured a slower spin-down rate ( \dot{\nu } ) compared to the end of that preceding campaign. Together, these differences suggest that a mode-switching event likely occurred between the end of that campaign and the start of ours. Finally, we derived a phase-connected timing solution from our data, from which we inferred a characteristic age of τ c ∼ 2500 yr—about 2.5 times older than the most recent published estimate—and a surface dipole magnetic field strength of B field ∼ 1 × 10 14 G, nearly 3 times weaker. These updated estimates reflect the short-term variations in the magnetar’s spin-down rate, from which both its age and magnetic field strength are inferred, rather than intrinsic changes in the magnetar itself.},

  abstract     = {Galaxy clusters, the most massive, dark-matter-dominated, and most recently assembled structures in the Universe, are key tools for probing cosmology. However, uncertainties in scaling relations that connect cluster mass to observables like X-ray luminosity and temperature remain a significant challenge. In this paper, we present the results of an extensive investigation of 329 simulated clusters from IllustrisTNG300 cosmological simulations. Our analysis involves cross-correlating dark matter and the hot X-ray-emitting gas, considering both the 3D and 2D projected distributions to account for projection effects. We demonstrate that this approach is highly effective in evaluating the dynamical state of these systems and validating the often-utilized assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, which is key for inferring cluster masses and constructing scaling relations. Our study revisits both the X-ray luminosity–mass and X-ray temperature–mass scaling relations, and demonstrates how the scatter in these relations correlates with the clusters’ dynamical state. We demonstrate that matter–gas coherence enables the identification of an optimal set of relaxed clusters, reducing scatter in scaling relations by up to 40%. This innovative approach, which integrates higher-dimensional insights into scaling relations, might offer a new path to further reduce uncertainties in determining cosmological parameters from galaxy clusters.},

  abstract     = {Using advanced processing techniques, we analyze high-cadence, high-resolution extreme-ultraviolet images and show that, throughout the solar cycle, midlatitude coronal holes (CHs) are made up of ubiquitous and space-filling funnel-shaped structures (or cells) anchored to unipolar magnetic flux concentrations in network lanes. We demonstrate that the coronal cells, previously documented in the magnetically closed regions, and coronal plumes, inside CHs, are a particular manifestation of ubiquitous cells. The cell properties depend on the magnetic field intensity at their footpoint and connectivity in the corona, either closing in opposite-polarity regions (CF-cells) or extending to form open field (OF-cells). The OF-cells reach size scales on the order of supergranules and are characterized by dark lanes delimiting ray-like features both showing, at different levels, persistent jetlike ejections. The cells’ lifetime mirrors that of magnetic flux concentrations revealed by magnetograms, slowly emerging and then disappearing in a matter of a few hours to a few days in a one-to-one correspondence. When a cell forms along the CH boundary, it can alter the CH boundary by shrinking or expanding the CH by an approximately supergranular cell unit. Therefore, coronal cells can contribute to the dynamics of the CH boundary. We contextualize these observations in a “coronal cell” theory potentially able to provide an explanation for fine-scale coronal structures and jetting activity in polar CHs.},

Based on the long-term high-resolution spectroscopic monitoring data set of the RS CVn-type star II Pegasi (II Peg), we search for stellar prominence eruptions and potential CMEs by investigating asymmetric signatures in the H α and H β line profiles during the flare events. We observed seven optical flares with asymmetric spectral profiles, releasing low limit energies of 10 33 –10 34 erg in the H α line. Five of these flares were associated with six potential CMEs, identified through the Doppler-shifted emission signatures in the chromospheric line profiles, particularly the H α line. The mass estimates for the CME candidates range from 10 19 to 10 20 g, while the kinetic energies are calculated to be around 10 33 –10 34 erg. The most massive CME candidate was simultaneously recorded in the H α , H β , and He i D 3 lines. For II Peg, the possible flare–CME association rate is about 30%. There were also some redshifted excess absorption signatures in the H α line profiles. These signatures could not only be observed in the flaring spectra but also in the spectra without flare, which could be interpreted as features resulting from flare-driven coronal rain and quiescent rain, respectively.},

Detailed 1 mm spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array resolve the individual images and show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical redshifts. The Hubble Space Telescope F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four galaxies with a photometric redshift z phot ∼ 1.0. Lens models that only include the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By adding a fifth massive component, lying southeast of the brightest galaxy of the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape, and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge on. The serendipitous discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated with the lensing galaxy group.},

One signature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the mid-IR when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical photons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on the fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the Universe (cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the Universe (cosmic walls) by using ∼12 yr of combined multiepoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR variability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability−AGN fraction among high- and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their wall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather large and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded detection using more traditional AGN selection methods such as single-epoch mid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly recovered AGNs is larger among galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in the most underdense large-scale structures of the Universe.},

In addition, we consider not only the ordinal positions but also the specific period ratios and radius ratios of planetary pairs in multiplanet systems. We explore various dependencies on stellar host type and metallicity, as well as planetary type, and explore the differences between planetary systems with different planet multiplicities and different planetary pairs in the same system. Focusing on Kepler systems with two to four planets, we account for observational biases and uncover a robust trend of smaller inner planets. This trend is particularly pronounced in inner pairs of three-planet systems and exhibits variations in stellar metallicity and planet multiplicity. Notably, we find that the distribution of inner-to-outer planet radius ratios depends on the systems’ metallicities, suggesting a link between the initial conditions and the resulting system architecture. Interestingly, planet pairs in resonance do not exhibit significantly different size ratios compared to nonresonant pairs, challenging current theoretical expectations, again, possibly suggesting that initially resonant systems could have been later destabilized. Our findings align with planet formation and migration models where larger planets form farther out and migrate inward. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of planet ordering as a novel and crucial observable for constraining planet formation and evolution models. The observed patterns offer unique insights into the complex interplay of formation, migration, and dynamical interactions shaping planetary systems.},

On 2024 May 10, after the arrival of the ICME shock at 17:04 UT, a Forbush Decrease (FD) was seen in various Neutron Monitor (NM) stations located worldwide. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of neutron data from 28 NM stations and gamma-ray data obtained from the NaI(Tl) detector at Maitri, Antarctica. The present paper reports for the first time about an ICME shock-sheath related enhancement of ∼3%–5% magnitude in the neutron flux at stations with geomagnetic rigidity between 4 and 7 GV, located at higher altitudes (≥1000 m). For these stations, the high-rigidity ends of the asymptotic trajectories are confined to the midnight to the postmidnight region. It appears that the increase may be associated with magnetospheric particle precipitation triggered by the passage of the ICME shock-sheath. The variation of FD amplitude with rigidity shows a decreasing trend in general, with a minimum amplitude at 5–7 GV, which we attribute to the location of field-aligned currents (FACs). The FD amplitude is found to have the effects of storm-time westward ring current, FACs, and magnetospheric dynamics, in addition to the ICME parameters. During the recovery phase of FD, enhancement is observed between 01:50 and 03:00 UT on 2024 May 11, which coincided with Ground Level Enhancement (GLE#74). The GLE # 74 was coeval with the strong SYM-H index and the sudden recovery of the FD due to reduced interplanetary magnetic field, which might be responsible for the observed enhancement at high rigidity stations.},

  abstract     = {We conducted systematic radiative transfer (RT) modeling of the Mg ii doublet line profiles for 33 low-redshift Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers, and Ly α modeling for six of these galaxies, using a multiphase, clumpy circumgalactic medium (CGM) model. Our RT models successfully reproduced the Mg ii emission line profiles for all galaxies, revealing a necessary condition for strong LyC leakage: high maximum clump outflow velocity ( {v}_{{\rm{MgII}},{\rm{\max }}}\gtrsim 390\,{\rm{km}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} ) and low total Mg ii column density ( N MgII, tot ≲ 10 14.3 cm −2 ). These two parameters have the strongest influence on the emergent Mg ii profile. For the six galaxies with archival HST data, our Ly α modeling shows that their spectral properties do not consistently match conventional LyC leakage criteria. A direct comparison of the best-fit Mg ii and Ly α model parameters reveals no clear correlations in clump outflow velocities, column densities, or volume filling factors, suggesting that H i and Mg ii may not be kinematically or spatially coherent. The inferred LyC escape fraction from Ly α modeling is primarily governed by the number of optically thick H i clumps per sightline ( f cl ). Intriguingly, two galaxies with low observed LyC leakage exhibited the highest RT-inferred LyC escape fractions, due to having the lowest f cl values, driven by strong Ly α blue peaks. Future spatially resolved observations will be crucial for resolving this puzzle. Our results support a “picket fence” CGM geometry over a “density-bounded” scenario, where high Mg ii outflow velocities and low Mg ii column densities trace low-density H i channels that facilitate LyC escape.},

  abstract     = {Modern slitless spectroscopic surveys such as Euclid and Roman collect vast numbers of galaxy spectra, but their low signal-to-noise ratios often lead to incorrect redshift assignments when relying on a single emission line. This misidentification, commonly caused by noise spikes or nontarget emission-line contamination, results in redshift interlopers . We present a machine learning method to mitigate interloper effects at the level of cosmological summary statistics, focusing on the power spectrum monopole as a test case. Using halo catalogs from the Quijote simulations as galaxy proxies, we simulate interlopers by displacing a fraction of halos by redshift offsets between target and interloper populations. This yields contaminated catalogs spanning a wide cosmological parameter space. We train a neural network on the power spectrum monopole, alone or combined with the bispectrum monopole, from contaminated mocks to estimate the interloper fraction and reconstruct the cleaned power spectrum. We assess performance in two scenarios: one with fixed cosmology and one where cosmological parameters vary. In the fixed case, the method recovers the interloper fraction and corrects the power spectrum to 1% accuracy. When cosmology varies, performance degrades, but including bispectrum information improves results, reducing interloper fraction errors and correcting with 2% accuracy. We also analyze how the size of the training set and the correlation between target and interloper populations affect performance. When these samples are uncorrelated, bispectrum information is more beneficial; when strongly correlated, tighter cosmological priors offer greater improvements. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning to enhance cosmological inference in contaminated spectroscopic data sets.},

Utilizing a force-free jet model that considers exclusively the relativistic plasma dynamics along large-scale magnetic fields attached onto the central black hole, we examine the effects of asymmetric plasmoid injections within the subparsec jet. At subparsec scales, the jet velocity is predominantly influenced by poloidal velocity, leading to distinctive characteristics in both the morphology and trajectories of the plasmoids injected within the jet. We explore the potential modifications to the limb-brightened subparsec jet images resulting from the injection of asymmetric, shearing plasma, which is traditionally considered solely under conditions of stationary and symmetric mass loading. By comparing the model jet properties with the 43 GHz observations of the M87 jet, it is suggested that the asymmetric injection of plasmoids within the jet offers a satisfactory explanation for the observed velocity variations and morphological dynamics of the M87 jet.},

  abstract     = {The Earth–Moon libration points no longer exhibit the dynamical characteristics of “equilibrium points” due to perturbation effects when applying the ephemeris model. By decoupling the forced motions within the ephemeris model and computing the dynamical substitute trajectories, we can reconstruct a dynamical system that recovers the “equilibrium points” feature. Diverging from the conventional analytical approach rooted in the framework of Newtonian mechanics, this paper presents a novel method for calculating dynamical substitute based on the Hamiltonian mechanics framework. First, the Hamiltonian equations for the ephemeris model are formulated. Subsequently, the problem of decoupling forced motions is reformulated as solving a nonautonomous differential equation through canonical transformations. Then, an iterative method based on frequency analysis is employed for the computation. Eventually, approximate analytical solutions for five libration points over a 360 yr period are provided. Simulation results demonstrate that the computed approximate analytical solutions are in excellent agreement with the numerical integration results derived from the ephemeris model, thereby validating the efficacy of the proposed method. The Hamiltonian dynamical system derived herein enables the analysis of nonlinear central manifold motions via canonical transformations, facilitating the construction of higher-order analytical solutions for libration point orbits. This framework also provides a robust foundation for exploring characterization parameters of libration point orbits within the real Earth–Moon system.},

We present a detailed comparison of gas distribution in these regimes for the jet/outflow system associated with G205.46−14.56S3 (HOPS 315), focusing on the inner ∼800 au along the jet. ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H 2 rotational lines (S(7)–S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)–S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H 2 rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm (∼773 ± 44 K) and hot (∼2499 ± 721 K). Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction A V ≈ 23.3 ± 2.5 mag. JWST/MIRI emission implies a jet mass-loss rate of {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{J}},{\rm{blue}},{\rm{jwst}}}\approx (0.27\pm 0.1)\times 1{0}^{-6}\,{M}_{\odot }\,{{\rm{yr}}}^{-1} .

In this paper, we present a multiepoch search and detailed timing analysis of millisecond pulsars in the GC M2, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. We have discovered two new binary millisecond pulsars in M2, designated M2F and M2G. We provide measurements of the emission properties of all known pulsars in M2, including their polarization profiles, rotation measures (RMs), flux densities, scintillation characteristics, and so forth. In particular, we report the first RM at the distance and direction of this cluster. Additionally, we report the first phase-coherent timing solutions for the M2 pulsars. From our Bayesian timing analysis, we have measured their spin and orbital parameters with high precision, including the advance of periastron for M2A and M2E indicating total system masses of 1.75(13) and 1.80(5) solar masses, respectively. Using archival data from the Hubble Space Telescope, we have identified an optical counterpart of M2C, which is likely the white dwarf companion of the pulsar. By combining results from optical and radio observations, we have reconstructed the binary evolution track of this system and estimated the cooling age of the companion to be approximately 10 Myr, making it the youngest white dwarf in any known GC binary pulsars. Furthermore, using the spin period derivatives of M2 pulsars, we have investigated the gravitational potential of the cluster and found that our results strongly support the latest central stellar velocity dispersion measurement in M2.},

Based on 5.5 yr of NICER monitoring, we detected a glitch around MJD 59300, characterized by a fractional frequency jump of approximately 2 × 10 −6 . We constructed semi-phase-coherent timing solutions for pre- and postglitch epochs, allowing for phase alignment of multi-instrument data and a subsequent measurement of the pulsed spectrum of the pulsar. This analysis confirmed previously reported spectral curvature and revealed a peak energy of 7{3}_{-26}^{+85} keV in the pulsar’s spectral energy distribution (SED), based on a logpar model fit of the pulsed spectrum. We discuss these findings within the framework of pulsar magnetospheric emission scenarios. The PWN’s X-ray spectrum is well described by a power law with a photon index of 2.1 ± 0.3, softer than previously reported measurements. We also characterized the X-ray emission from another extended X-ray source AX J1837.3−0652 within the extent of HESS J1837−069. Based on the spatial and spectral properties of these X-ray sources, we propose a leptonic emission scenario for HESS J1837−069 and demonstrate its feasibility through SED modeling. Finally, we discuss the implications of our model results and alternative scenarios for the gamma-ray emission.},

  abstract     = {Most X-ray pulsars in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems exhibit both global and local trends of spin acceleration (spin-up) and deceleration (spin-down). Moreover, decades-long monitored objects display even more general spin-up trends in their spin evolution and simultaneously demonstrate a decrease in the orbital period, so-called orbital decay. Although obvious, this general behavior leaves open the question of the energy source and the mechanism of angular momentum transfer that ensures the neutron star’s (NS's) spin acceleration. We hypothesize that the observed spin acceleration of X-ray pulsars in HMXB (Roche lobe overflow and sgXRB) systems results from orbital angular momentum transfer via tidal interactions with their massive companions. To study these phenomena, we sample five well-studied objects with the longest observational history of their spin periods from the population of known Galactic persistent X-ray pulsars in HMXB systems. We obtain the spin frequency change from the observational data and estimate energy loses for orbital decay and pulsars’ spin acceleration. We propose a new term of super-global spin-up trends, and show that their observable values do not exceed theoretical upper limits predicted within the scenario of orbital decay due to the tidal interaction between the NS and its massive companion.},

Parker Solar Probe (PSP) measurements have established the switchback as a prominent feature of the near-Sun solar wind. Detailed observations have shed light on switchback properties, leading to various proposed mechanisms for their generation. However, one key aspect that remains unexplored is the distribution of the tangential bulk velocity within switchbacks. A particular challenge has been accurately determining the tangential component of the plasma flow in the near-Sun plasma. With the most recent Solar Probe Cup measurements, it has been possible to gather sufficient statistics of proton tangential speed data in near-Sun solar wind switchbacks. This is important because some switchback models, particularly those involving solar wind interactions, predict that the tangential velocity should exhibit a strong one-sided polarity inside switchbacks. In this study, we examine the tangential component of the bulk velocity inside switchbacks during PSP encounters. Our findings reveal that switchbacks preferentially exhibit a positive tangential bulk velocity, strongly supporting the hypothesis that the majority of switchbacks are generated by the interaction of slow and fast wind across a superspiral outside the Alfvén critical point.},

In this study, a multispecies global magnetohydrodynamic model is used to investigate Mars’s response to a series of idealized solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements with varying durations and magnitudes, aiming to capture responses in different plasma regions and isolate the effects of dynamic pressure. For the subsolar region, the simulations reveal a sequence of response phases, each exhibiting distinct temporal characteristics. Beyond the subsolar region, the terminator ionosphere and global ion escape show prolonged disturbances.

Here we study the detailed evolution of flare ribbons down to the arcsecond scale for 10 flares characterized by the classic double ribbons. Identifying the flaring pixels by combining the intensity variances of the UV filter ratio and an intensity threshold, we found that the waiting time distributions of the flaring pixels are well described by power laws, distinct from those in the preflare or quiet-Sun regions, and that the power-law slopes are generally consistent with those predicted by nonstationary Poisson processes in the nonlinear regime or by the 2D/3D self-organized criticality (SOC) model. The size distributions for flaring duration also follow power laws but the slopes are more scattered. In contrast, the size distributions for other parameters, including peak intensity, energy, and radial magnetic field strength of the flaring pixels, deviate from power laws, and the estimated slopes significantly differ from the SOC predictions. These results suggest that a nonstationary Poisson process or an avalanche-like process might be ongoing temporally in the reconnecting current sheet, but in other aspects, e.g., space- and energy-wise, the avalanche is likely modulated by other physical processes or the fine structures of the reconnecting current sheet.},

M13I has a spin period of 6.37 ms and an orbital period of 18.23 days. The eccentricity of the binary orbit is 0.064, with a companion mass range of approximately 0.45 to 1.37 M ⊙ . The orbital properties of M13I are remarkably different from those of the other known pulsars in M13, indicating that this pulsar has undergone a different evolutionary path compared to the rest.},

  abstract     = {JWST has revealed a population of compact and extremely red galaxies at z ≳ 4, which likely host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We present a sample of 434 “little red dots” (LRDs), selected from the 0.54 deg 2 COSMOS-Web survey. We fit galaxy and AGN spectral energy distribution models to derive redshifts and physical properties; the sample spans z ∼ 5–9 after removing brown dwarf contaminants. As a thought experiment, we consider two extreme physical scenarios: either LRDs are all AGNs, and their continuum emission is dominated by the accretion disk, or they are all compact star-forming galaxies, and their continuum is dominated by stars. If LRDs are AGN-dominated, our sample exhibits bolometric luminosities ∼10 45−47 erg s −1 , spanning the gap between JWST AGNs in the literature and bright, rare quasars. We derive a bolometric luminosity function (LF) ∼ 100 times the (UV-selected) quasar LF, implying a nonevolving black hole accretion density of ∼10 −4 M ⊙ yr −1 Mpc −3 from z ∼ 2–9. By contrast, if LRDs are dominated by star formation, we derive stellar masses ∼10 8.5−10 M ⊙ . MIRI/F770W is key to deriving accurate stellar masses; without it, we derive a mass function inconsistent with Λ cold dark matter. The median stellar mass profile is broadly consistent with the maximal surface densities seen in the nearby Universe, though the most massive objects exceed this limit, requiring substantial AGN contribution to the continuum. Nevertheless, stacking all available X-ray, mid-IR, far-IR/submillimeter, and radio data yields nondetections. Whether dominated by dusty AGNs or compact star-formation, the high masses/luminosities and remarkable abundance of LRDs implies a dominant mode of early galaxy/SMBH growth.},

  abstract     = {Using our rich observations within the Milky Way to better understand galaxy evolution requires understanding what the Milky Way looks like “as a galaxy”—that is, its “true” shape and abundance profiles (unskewed by observational biases), signatures of past mergers and significant accretion events, and even its total stellar mass and integrated spectral energy distribution, which have historically been difficult to constrain. We present a new approach to determining the Milky Way’s integrated mass and colors, using recent measurements of the intrinsic density profiles of stellar populations spanning nearly 13 Gyr in time and 1.5 dex in metallicity (representing nearly all of the Galaxy’s stars). We trace the evolution of the Milky Way in various diagnostic spaces, explore the impact of specific events on the present-day Milky Way’s integrated properties, and use TNG50 simulations to identify “young” Galactic analogs and their eventual fates, compared to the real Milky Way’s path. From the simulation comparisons, we find strong evidence for an earlier-than-average stellar mass assembly of the Milky Way, and that present-day Milky Way analogs follow a similar growth history, albeit at slightly later times; we also find that analogs of the early Milky Way are in no way guaranteed to follow the Milky Way's subsequent path. This empirical study offers new constraints on our “Galaxy as a galaxy”—today and across cosmic time—and on its place in the general galactic population.},

We use combined wideband and narrowband (NB) optical photometry to identify Ly α emitters (LAEs) within a 21 cMpc radius from the submillimeter source J1000+0234, at z = 4.54, to identify typical star-forming galaxies that may trace an underlying structure. Our approach selects line emitters as NB excess objects and we use the COSMOS2020 photometric redshift catalog to eliminate potential low-redshift interlopers whose line emission (e.g., [O III ] at z ∼ 0.3) might be responsible for the observed excess in the narrow band. In comparison with the LAE density in the field, our results point to a mean LAE number overdensity of \bar{\delta }=3 spanning a region of 27 × 20 × 36 cMpc 3 , probably evolving into a moderate-mass cluster ((3–10) × 10 14 M ⊙ ) at z ∼ 0. This work supports the idea that submillimeter sources, although offset from the major overdensity peaks, serve as traces of moderately massive, potentially infalling structures.},

  abstract     = {We explore whether Local Group dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies might have hosted Earth-like planets dwelling unexposed for several billions of years to major galactic threats to life, such as supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. To this aim, we developed a novel semiempirical model that exploits the observed chemical abundances and star formation histories of a selected sample of local dSphs, to explore whether their stars may have (i) reached the minimum metallicity to trigger planet formation and (ii) avoided exposure to destructive events long enough to provide time for possible biological development. From our work two scenarios emerge. If planet formation is possible for [Fe/H] ≲ −1, then in all dSphs with 5 × 10 3 L ⊙ ≤ L V ≤ 2 × 10 7 L ⊙ a fraction ≈0.1%–10% of stars might have safely hosted terrestrial planets for more than 1 Gyr. In this scenario, ancient ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, L V ≤ 10 5 L ⊙ ) would have been the first to reach this condition in the history of the Local Group. Conversely, if planets form for [Fe/H] ≥ −0.6 then they should not exist in UFDs, while only ≈0.001%–0.1% of stars in dSphs with L V ≥ 3 × 10 5 L ⊙ would host planets dwelling in safe conditions for long times. Interestingly, we find a “luminosity sweet spot” at L V ∼ 10 6 L ⊙ , where dSphs in our sample safely host terrestrial planets up to 4 Gyr and in any planet formation scenario explored. In conclusion, planet formation at low metallicity is key to understanding which types of galaxies might have formed Earth-like planets that dwelt unexposed to galactic threats over several billions of years, first in the history of the Local Group.},

  abstract     = {Bright blazars were found to be prominent neutrino sources, and a number of IceCube events were associated with them over recent years. A particularly strong observational connection is present between neutrinos and blazars with bright, Doppler-boosted, parsec-scale radio emission. In this work, we further explore the nature of this connection by examining the jet geometry and kinematics of neutrino-associated blazars. We find that these blazars demonstrate remarkably strong jet beaming, even compared to other radio-bright sources. Their Doppler and Lorentz factors are larger, and viewing angles are smaller than for other blazars in the complete uniformly selected MOJAVE sample. Observationally, this serves as yet another piece of evidence for blazars forming a major population of neutrino sources. The strong neutrino–beaming correlation indicates that high-energy neutrino velocity is predominantly oriented along the jet, and the original PeV-scale protons exhibit a relativistic bulk motion along the jet. It suggests that neutrino production happens not too close to the black hole, but rather at subparsec distances, where the jet is already accelerated.},

The 5 ″ long arc is the most highly magnified z > 10 galaxy known. It straddles the lensing critical curve and reveals five star clusters with radii of ∼1 pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a median magnification of \mu \sim 6{0}_{-8}^{+17} (delensed 29.7 AB mag, M UV = −17.8). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W−F200W >3.2 mag (2 σ lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters (<2 σ ), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break ( β = −2.7 ± 0.1). This results in a photometric redshift z phot = 10.2 ± 0.2 (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below z < 9.8. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of M * ∼ 2.4–5.6 × 10 7 M ⊙ , young mass-weighted age of ∼21–79 Myr, low dust content ( A V < 0.15), and a low metallicity of ≲1% Z ⊙ .

Given the structurally complex region near M32 on the sky, we modeled M32’s line-of-sight kinematics simultaneously alongside M31’s rotating stellar disk and potential outliers corresponding to M31’s kinematically hot stellar halo and/or tidal substructure. Inside the radius corresponding to the observed twisting of isophotal contours in M32’s surface brightness profile ( R iso ∼ 5 r eff ∼ 150” or 0.56 kpc), M32 exhibits a line-of-sight velocity distribution characteristic of ordered rotation, transitioning to a distribution with heavier outliers beyond this radius. Within R iso , the rotational direction is aligned with M32’s major-axis rotation, but shifts to become roughly aligned with M32’s minor axis beyond R iso . We interpret these kinematical signatures in the stellar outskirts of M32 as evidence of tidal distortion from interactions with M31 and discuss their implications for M32 formation pathways.},

Its core is currently at a heliocentric distance of ∼21 kpc, near apogalacticon (∼18 kpc), and it reaches ∼5–7 kpc at perigalacticon. Pal 5’s leading and trailing arms stretch over 20° on the sky, making them sensitive probes of the Milky Way’s mass distribution. In this work, we search for red giant members of Pal 5 using spectroscopic data from APOGEE DR17 and photometric and astrometric data from Gaia data release 3. Based on position and proper motion, we identify eight members of Pal 5: six in the core and two in the stream. The clustering algorithm HDBSCAN finds these same eight. We then use chemical tagging with APOGEE abundances to search for additional members across five APOGEE fields overlapping Pal 5. While several dozen candidates are identified, most deviate (some significantly) from known kinematic and color–magnitude trends, suggesting that they are less likely to be true members. We estimate the expected number of giants in the APOGEE pointings based on the area and stellar mass of the streams. Given APOGEE’s limiting magnitude, we find that few, if any, new giants are expected, especially if the stream is more diffuse at these locations. Our results support the presence of density variations in Pal 5’s tidal streams, consistent with earlier studies attributing such features to baryonic perturbers in the Milky Way, dark matter subhalos, or interactions with passing globular clusters.},

  abstract     = {A weakly magnetized neutron star (NS) undergoing disk accretion should release about half of its power in a compact region known as the accretion boundary layer. Latitudinal spread of the accreted matter and efficient radiative cooling justify the approach to this flow as a two-dimensional spreading layer (SL) on the surface of the star. Numerical simulations of SLs are challenging because of the curved geometry and supersonic nature of the problem. We develop and test a new two-dimensional hydrodynamics code, SPLASH , which uses the multislope second-order Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Law scheme in combination with an HLLC+ Riemann solver on an arbitrary irregular mesh on a spherical surface. The code is suitable and accurate for Mach numbers up to 5–10. Adding sinks and sources to the conserved variables, we simulate early stages of constant-rate accretion onto a spherical NS. During these stages of accretion, heating in the equatorial region triggers convective instability that causes rapid mixing in the latitudinal direction. One of the outcomes of the instability is the development of a “tennis ball” pattern rotating at a frequency considerably different from the rotation frequency of the matter. In the simulated variability curves, there are signatures of both the pattern rotation and the rotation of the SL, as well as their harmonics. The pattern and cyclonal vortices associated with it are probably a manifestation of an inertial oscillation mode excited within the layer ( https://github.com/TURBOLOSE/SPLASH ).},

  abstract     = {We present an analysis of new multiwavelength observations of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS J0632+057, conducted using SALT, Swift, NuSTAR, and VERITAS in 2023–2024. By combining these new data with archival observations, we confirm previous suggestions of orbital variability in the source’s X-ray spectrum, including increased X-ray absorption at the orbital phase interval of ϕ ≈ 0.3–0.4. The source’s X-ray flux within this phase interval seems to have exhibited a significant change on an orbital timescale. Additionally, occasional short-term variations in the X-ray band on a timescale of less than 3 days have been observed. The measured duration of the increased absorbing column density and the flux variability timescales can provide clues about the interaction between the putative pulsar and the Be companion’s disk if, as previously suggested, the pulsar crosses the disk at this phase interval. Moreover, the new contemporaneous X-ray and TeV observations around the pulsar-crossing phases revealed independent variability in the X-ray and TeV fluxes, contrary to a previous observation of concurrent flux increases. While these observations alone cannot provide definitive conclusions, we discuss our results in the context of pulsar–disk interaction and intrabinary shock emission scenarios.},

We identify 23 likely XRBs within the Two Micron All Sky Survey K S isophotal radius and find the distributions of their dynamic ranges and duty cycles are consistent with a young, high-mass XRB (HMXB) population dominated by supergiant-fed systems, consistent with previous work. In general, we find that brighter HMXBs (those with L X ≳ several ×10 36 erg s −1 ) have higher duty cycles (i.e., are more persistent X-ray sources) than fainter objects, and the dynamic ranges of the sgHMXBs in the lower-metallicity environment of IC 10 are higher than what is observed for comparable systems in the Milky Way. After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia parallaxes, we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the XLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very recent (3–8 Myr) burst of star formation with a rate of ∼0.5 M ⊙ yr −1 is needed to adequately explain the observed bright end ( L X ∼ 10 37 erg s −1 ) of the HMXB XLF.},

  abstract     = {Collisionless electron–ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using particle-in-cell simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter σ i in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ( σ i > 1) exhibit lower-density compression ratios ( R ∼ 2), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a suprathermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.},

Jansky Very Large Array data in the 120–168 MHz and 1–2 GHz ranges, we study the diffuse emission around the nearby dwarf galaxy KUG 1138+327. Our analysis reveals a diffuse X-ray feature on the southern side, disconnected from the galactic disk. This feature exhibits a hard X-ray spectrum, which is highly unusual for an outflow from a dwarf galaxy. We interpret the irregularly shaped feature as hot plasma in a young galaxy cluster at redshift 0.5, supported by X-ray spectral fitting and consistent with the optical redshift of the central elliptical galaxy of a known cluster identified by a red sequence. Additionally, we detect a radio lobe east of the X-ray feature, likely produced by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) offset from the cluster center and confined primarily by ram pressure from the ambient medium. The lobe shows a steep nonthermal radio spectrum, suggesting a cosmic-ray age of ≳5 × 10 7 yr. Assuming energy equipartition between cosmic rays and magnetic fields, we estimate the lobe’s total energy to be ∼9 × 10 56 erg, comparable to the thermal energy in the same volume. This study thus identifies a background young cluster projected next to KUG 1138+327 and highlights the potentially significant role of off-center AGN feedback in shaping the intracluster medium.},

  abstract     = {Low-resolution infrared spectroscopy from JWST confirms the presence of SiC and likely metallic iron dust around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Sextans A dwarf galaxy, which has a metallicity ∼1%–7% Z ⊙ . While metal-poor carbon-rich AGB stars are known to produce copious amounts of amorphous carbon dust owing to the dredge up of newly synthesized carbon, this is the first time that Si- and Fe-bearing dust has been detected at this extreme metallicity. Of the six AGB stars observed, one is an intermediate-mass (∼1.2–4 M ⊙ ) carbon star showing SiC dust, and another is an oxygen-rich M-type star with mass ∼4–5 M ⊙ that is likely undergoing hot bottom burning. The infrared excess of the M-type star is strong, but featureless. We tested multiple dust species, and found that it is best fit with metallic iron dust. Assuming its dust-production rate stays constant over the final 2–3 × 10 4 yr of its evolution, this star will produce ∼0.9–3.7 times the iron dust mass predicted by models, with the range depending on the adopted stellar mass. The implications for dust production in high-redshift galaxies are potentially significant, especially regarding the assumed dust species used in dust evolution models and the timescale of AGB dust formation. Stars on the upper end of the AGB mass range can begin producing dust as early as 30–50 Myr after they form, and they may therefore rival dust production by supernovae at high redshift.},

We develop new models of polarized Galactic dust and synchrotron emission at CMB frequencies that draw on the latest observational constraints; that employ the “polarization fraction tensor” framework to couple intensity and polarization in a physically motivated way; and that allow for stochastic realizations of small-scale structure at subarcminute angular scales currently unconstrained by full-sky data. We implement these models into the publicly available Python Sky Model ( PySM ) software and additionally provide PySM interfaces to select models of dust and CO emission from the literature. We characterize the behavior of each model by quantitatively comparing it to observational constraints in both maps and power spectra, demonstrating an overall improvement over previous PySM models. Finally, we synthesize models of the various Galactic foreground components into a coherent suite of three plausible microwave skies that span a range of astrophysical complexity allowed by current data.

Radiation interacts with matter, driving hydrodynamic feedback that further alters the radiation characteristics (energy and angular distribution). This paper reviews the current state of the art in the modeling of inhomogeneous radiation transport, subgrid models developed to capture this often-unresolved physics, and the experiments designed to improve our understanding of these models. This paper focuses on simulations based on upcoming experiments designed to test this physics. We present a series of detailed simulations (both single-clump and multi-clump conditions) probing the dependence on the physical properties of the radiation front (e.g., radiation energy) and material characteristics (specific heat, opacity, clump densities). We find that, unless the radiation pressure is high, the clumps will heat and then expand, effectively cutting off the radiation flow. The expanding winds can also produce shocks that generates high-energy emission. We compare our detailed simulations with some of the current subgrid prescriptions, identifying some of the limitations of these current models.},

We analyze two optical spectra of the TDE source, one near the optical peak of the second flare from the Transient Name Server and one at the quiescent flux level after the second flare. The latter was taken by us with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Comparing the features of the two spectra, we identify that the host is likely a composite galaxy at redshift 0.23, and the TDE event, probably an H+He type, mainly powered broad components in the emission lines of H α , H β , and He I λ 5876. More interestingly, we find that two Bronze-type neutrino events, detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory, match the TDE in position and the second flare, especially the delayed MIR flare, in time. We discuss the MIR luminosity properties of the currently reported (candidate) neutrino-emitting TDEs and suggest that luminous MIR emission is a prerequisite for neutrino production in TDEs.},

This phenomenon suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation framework to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, partially reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multiwavelength radiative spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) the slow-diffusion properties near the Geminga pulsar and its proper motion may cause the radiation from electrons originating from Geminga to be distributed across a more extended region, and (2) the incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo may contribute, to some extent, to the diffuse gamma-ray fluctuations detected by LHAASO. We hope that LHAASO will detect more sources of cosmic-ray halo to further validate our model.},

The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass spectrum without any feature at in the 30–40 M ⊙ range, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pileup due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near 50 M ⊙ or higher. The other subpopulation with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at 30–40 M ⊙ and is consistent with BBHs formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around 30 M ⊙ . We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels.

The metal enrichment factor at low altitudes above the galactic disk is higher by around 20% when the metal diffusion model is included. Specifically, we find more efficient cooling in the cold interstellar medium, due to more efficient metal mixing that leads to shorter cooling times of the warm gas, which becomes available more quickly for star formation. The most striking effect of the metal diffusion model is that, without metal diffusion, there is more rapid cooling in the hot phase and a reduced sound speed by a factor of 2. Specifically, we find that the hot phase is more metal enriched in the case without metal diffusion leading to more rapid overcooling of that phase, which is consistent with the higher sound speed we find in the runs with metal diffusion.},

  abstract     = {Interior to the orbits of Jupiter’s iconic Galilean moons are four small satellites with individual mean radii R ≲ 84 km. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that these bodies formed at a more distant location in Jupiter’s circumplanetary disk before coming to reside at their current short-period orbits. However, how these moons dynamically evolved to such a location has yet to be explained in the emerging paradigm of Jovian satellite formation. Here, we present a quantitative model for the origin of the largest of these inner moons, Amalthea, that can be extended to its neighbor, Thebe, and to other small bodies in astrophysical disks. We propose that Amalthea’s anomalous features are due to it having formed alongside the Galileans in a reservoir of satellitesimals located at a large Jovian-centric distance. As the innermost Galilean, Io, migrated inward from this reservoir, it captured the satellitesimal Amalthea into resonance and shepherded the small body to its modern neighborhood. During this migration through the disk, dissipative forcing from aerodynamic drag induces overstable librations in the Io–Amalthea resonance, such that only a narrow range of nebular parameters can accommodate the requisite long-range transport. In particular, the disk aspect ratio, h / r , emerges as the key variable. Our calculations indicate that the circumjovian disk had a scale height of h / r ≳ 0.08, implying a relatively hot, actively accreting disk during the epoch of satellite formation. These results thus shed light on the evolution of the Jovian system, along with the more general phenomenon of satellite–disk interactions.},

In this study, we examine two potential scenarios: the gas inflow along the bar and the formation of a bar-induced gaseous nuclear ring. By applying a classical galactic dynamics model, we calculate the radii and rotational velocities of the nuclear rings for all barred DPGs and compare them with the observed properties of their DPSs. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the predicted radii of the nuclear rings and the maximum centric distances of the DPSs, as well as a marginal correlation between the predicted rotational velocities of the nuclear rings and the observed maximum velocity differences of the DPSs. These findings provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that the DPSs of a barred DPG in MaNGA primarily originate from the convolution of the point-spread function effect with its bar-induced fast-rotating gaseous nuclear ring.},

In this study, we investigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a representative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in the low-accretion regime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long Baseline Array, supplemented by archival Very Large Array data, we trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from ∼10 2 to ∼10 7 Schwarzschild radii ( r s ). Our analysis reveals a well-defined transition from a semiparabolic profile, W ( r ) ∝ r 0.71 , to a conical shape, W ( r ) ∝ r 1.16 , occurring at approximately 1.67 × 10 4 r s . This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those in other known LLAGN sources. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between jet collimation and accretion rate, offering crucial constraints for jet formation models of LLAGNs.},

The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with ZAMS masses of 85–140 M ⊙ and metallicities of Z ⊙ and 0.1 Z ⊙ . Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy, as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to H-poor, C- and O-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally induced chemical mixing, PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite . We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed superluminous supernova I events.},

In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of a PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as a parameter assuming the deflagration–detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics, and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts light curves which align with the Phillips relation ( {B}_{\max } versus Δ M 15 ).

  abstract     = {An international team of researchers has come together to undertake an ultra-broadband exploration of the deep radio sky. The superMIGHTEE project combines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre Array MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep images at several μ Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz–2.5 GHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the initial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum images covering a total of 9.9 deg 2 at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg 2 at 400 MHz in the XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source catalogues include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The redshift distribution of the sources extends to z ∼ 4 with a median value of z = 1. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with the MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral properties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated population to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities of a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population exhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy injection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten significantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with peaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release. Subsequent releases will include spectro-polarimetric and spectral line image cubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE ultra-wideband data set is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of active galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, shed light on the evolution of neutral hydrogen, and explore the origins and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in clusters, filaments, and galaxies.},

The anisotropy induced by strong magnetic fields is analyzed through angular-dependent scaling of the cascade terms. Moreover, the increment calculation method significantly influences the relative contributions of the flux and nonflux terms, with absolute methods tending to overestimate the latter.

A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because of portions of the survey data missing in the archive and our early-stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the reanalysis, PSR J0540−69, which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L -band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540−69.

In particular, we carry out a numerical calculation of magnetar-powered shock breakouts (SBOs) and supernova (SN) light curves. We find that an early SBO peak in the bolometric light curves provides a likely signature of a magnetar central engine, which can help constrain the magnetar’s spin period and magnetic dipole. Moreover, our results show that GW emission by the magnetar has only a minor effect on the SBO light curve. Such SBOs can be detected by ULTRASAT at a rate ∼1–2 yr −1 , provided that the magnetar wind is not efficiently thermalized during the early phases of the evolution. We additionally find that the subsequent SN light curves can be more luminous than SBOs in the ULTRASAT band and can thus be detected at a higher rate. Finally, we find a possible late-time signature of GW emission in the SN light curves, which may provide an additional tool for the detection of GW signals. Our results demonstrate that future ULTRASAT observations will provide crucial insights into the magnetar formation process and unique information for direct searches of long-transient signals with current and future generation GW detectors. In particular, we estimate a rate of multimessenger (UV+GW) detections of newly formed magnetars ≳1 every 2 yr with ULTRASAT and the Einstein Telescope.},

Motivated by this possibility, we present a comprehensive assessment of potential contributions from unresolved globular clusters to the DGE. In our analysis, a nonparametric method is employed to estimate the luminosity function and spatial distribution function of globular clusters using the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) fourth source catalog (4FGL) combined with a reference globular cluster catalog. Based on these distributions, we calculate the cumulative contribution of unresolved globular cluster populations to the DGE observed by Fermi-LAT and the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory. Our results reveal that globular clusters account for only ∼2% of the DGE at the TeV range, and smaller than 1% in the GeV regime, which is effectively negligible.},

  abstract     = {Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars and gas changes with distance from the center of a galaxy, it has been confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxies’ outer regions, as their rotation curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point, suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman break analogs at z ∼ 0.2 and artificially redshifted them as if they were at z ∼ 2.2. By comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low- z galaxies. In low- z galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more disturbance in the galaxy’s gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling—when in reality they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised when using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the gravitational potential of the galaxy.},

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite’s (TESS's) large field of view and continuous observation capabilities make it uniquely positioned to detect and characterize prompt optical flashes from GRBs. In this work, we fit phenomenological models to the gamma-ray through optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 24 bursts with arcsecond-level localizations that fell within the TESS field of view between 2018 July and 2024 December. In four cases, the extrapolation of the high-energy SED agrees with the observed optical flux to within 1 σ . In one case, there is a significant excess of optical flux relative to the extrapolation. In two cases, upper limits from TESS did not constrain the optical portion of the SED. In the remaining 17 cases, the optical flux is overpredicted by the extrapolation from high energies. This discrepancy could be explained by dust extinction in the host galaxy.},

  abstract     = {Meridional circulation in stratified stellar/planetary interiors in the presence of stable molecular-weight gradients remains poorly understood, thereby affecting angular momentum transport in evolutionary models. We extend the downward control principle of atmospheric sciences to include compositional stratification. Using a linearized analysis, we show that stable μ -gradients slow down the penetration of circulation into the depths, emphasizing the importance of time-dependent solutions. However, additional effects such as horizontal turbulence or magnetic fields are needed to halt it completely. We also find limits demarcating linear and nonlinear regimes in terms of Schmidt and Rossby numbers. Nonlinear simulations exhibit compositional mixing due to meridional currents, enabling deeper penetration than otherwise. We propose slowly evolving and steady-state scenarios for the solar tachocline, and helioseismically observed heavy element abundances, while acknowledging the absence of constraints on the radial variation of the Schmidt number. In the context of stellar evolution, differential rotation profiles of solar-type main-sequence stars may follow analytical solutions extending from D. Banik & K. Menou, thereby aiding further probes into magneto/hydrodynamic instabilities and outward angular momentum transport.},

We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 μ m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1 \mathop{.}\limits^{^{\prime\prime} } 6 (∼5000 au). This outflow originates from a 9.7 M ⊙ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its redshifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2–1), SiO (5–4), and H 2 CO (3 0,3 –2 0,2 ). It has a momentum of 13 M ⊙ km s −1 , an energy of 107 M ⊙ km 2 s −2 , and a dynamical timescale of ∼10 4 yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H 2 CO, and CH 3 OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core >0.1 M ⊙ . Moreover, CO (2–1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02, and 0.15 M ⊙ ) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, and 1.8 M ⊙ km s −1 ), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 μ m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10 3 –10 4 yr) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.},

  abstract     = {Direct collapse of pristine gas in early galaxies is a promising pathway for forming supermassive black holes (SMBHs) powering active galactic nuclei at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This seeding mechanism requires suppression of molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) cooling during primordial star formation via intense far-ultraviolet radiation from nearby starburst galaxies clustered in overdense regions. However, nondetection of 21 cm signals from the EoR reported by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) experiment suggests that such galaxies may also emit X-rays more efficiently than in the local Universe, promoting H 2 production and thereby potentially quenching massive black hole (BH) seed formation. In this study, we examine the thermal and chemical evolution of collapsing gas in dark matter halos using a semi-analytic model incorporating observationally calibrated X-ray intensities. We find that strong X-ray irradiation, as suggested by HERA, significantly suppresses direct collapse and leads most halos to experience H 2 cooling. Nevertheless, massive BH seeds with M BH ≳ 10 4 M ⊙ still form by z ≃ 15, particularly in regions with baryonic streaming motion, and their abundance reaches ∼ 10 −4 Mpc −3 , sufficient to explain the SMBHs identified by James Webb Space Telescope spectroscopy at 3 < z < 6. While the formation of highly overmassive BHs with masses comparable to their host galaxies is prohibited by X-ray ionization, our model predicts that BH-to-stellar mass ratios of ≃0.01–0.1 were already established at seeding.},

  abstract     = {The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems, this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability (MRI). The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end, we perform three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study, we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical “elevator” flows that resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI, and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases, we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.},

  abstract     = {Understanding turbulence within the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters is pivotal for comprehending their evolution and dynamics. Employing 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, we examine the statistical properties of gas density, magnetic fields, and velocity, particularly emphasizing the central regions spanning 400 kpc. The simulations are designed to resemble massive cool-core clusters such as Perseus, while varying the initial plasma β values (100, 200, and 500). Our findings indicate that while the statistical histogram distributions of gas density and velocity appear similar across different β scenarios, their spatial distributions and morphological patterns exhibit noticeable differences. Through the application of the second-order structure function, we identified a scaling relation in velocity fluctuations, characterized by a slope of 1/2 and predominantly dominated by solenoidal components. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with more significant fluctuations along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields. This anisotropy is scale-dependent, becoming more pronounced at smaller scales, and exhibits a decreasing trend in scenarios where the magnetic field is relatively weak, particularly at β = 500. This suggests that the anisotropic nature of these fluctuations is predominantly regulated by the magnetic fields. Additionally, we test the efficacy of the synchrotron intensity gradient (SIG) method for tracing magnetic fields in these environments. The SIG shows a global agreement with the magnetic field across all three β scenarios, confirming the SIG’s insensitivity to the medium’s magnetization level.},

For comparison, we define our “baseline” protocluster population as galaxies with M ⋆ > 10 8.5 M ⊙ at any redshift. We find that M ⋆ -limited ( M ⋆ > 10 9.5 M ⊙ ) and SFR-limited (SFR > 10 M ⊙ yr −1 ) subpopulations recover the baseline highest galaxy density peak in roughly ∼60% of cases within an accuracy of 1.0 pMpc (corresponding to an angular scale of \sim {2}^{{\rm{{\prime} }}}-2\mathop{.}\limits^{{\rm{^{\prime} }}}5 ) at z > 2. This recovery fraction drops to ∼40%−50% when restricting to galaxies with M ⋆ > 10 10.0 M ⊙ . We find that the baseline highest galaxy density peaks typically coincide with the highest dark matter and stellar mass density peaks, with separations less than 0.5 pMpc in ∼60%−75% of cases at z > 2. This agreement drops to ∼45%−50% when restricting to galaxies with M ⋆ > 10 10.0 M ⊙ . These results indicate that identifying the densest regions of protoclusters—i.e., the core—is highly sensitive to stellar mass and SFR completeness limits. Nevertheless, at z > 2, we find that the baseline highest galaxy density peaks are generally sites of enhanced star formation and accelerated mass growth relative to the remainder of the protocluster, consistent with some observational studies.},

  abstract     = {A subset of low-mass giants (<2.2 M ⊙ ) exhibit anomalous lithium enhancement behavior, which is still an open topic. Given that more massive giants retain more surface lithium, increasing mass by accreting circumstellar matter could be a channel to enriching lithium. We evaluate this process in the current work. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we construct a model of matter accretion, including mass loss, that evolves a star from the main-sequence turnoff to the red giant branch tip. The mean accretion rate is estimated from the upper limit of the accreted mass and the evolutionary time of the star during this period, and a grid of accretion rates is constructed. We separately consider their effects on the lithium enhancement of giants, both in terms of the mass and the composition of accretion. Accreting matter with higher lithium abundances has a promoting effect on the lithium enhancement of giants. The accreted matter with excess lithium alleviates the dilution of lithium in the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The added mass results in lower temperatures at the bottom of the convective envelope, which likewise weaken the depletion of surface lithium. The weak accretion of circumstellar matter is a possible route to lithium enhancement for giants, and it predicts an upper limit on the lithium abundance of ∼2.5 dex. However, the mass increment it requires poses a potential challenge to real astrophysical environments. Such accretion suppresses lithium dilution and depletion of the star during the first dredge-up, thus exhibiting lithium enhancement behavior.},

  abstract     = {The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform 3D simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affect the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity—even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force. During a limited time interval, an exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time is interpreted as clear evidence of dynamo action.},

  abstract     = {Modeling the broadband emission of blazars has become increasingly challenging with the advent of multimessenger observations. Building upon previous successes in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leptonic emission scenarios, we present an efficient CNN-based approach for modeling blazar emission under proton synchrotron and hybrid lepto-hadronic frameworks. Our CNN is trained on extensive numerical simulations generated by SOPRANO , which span a comprehensive parameter space accounting for the injection and all significant cooling processes of electrons and protons. The trained CNN captures complex interactions involving both primary and secondary particles, effectively reproducing electromagnetic and neutrino emissions. This allows for rapid and thorough exploration of the parameter space characteristic of hadronic and hybrid emission scenarios. The effectiveness of the trained CNN is demonstrated through fitting the spectral energy distributions of two prominent blazars, TXS 0506+059 and PKS 0735+178, both associated with IceCube neutrino detections. The modeling is conducted under assumptions of constant neutrino flux across distinct energy ranges, as well as by adopting a fitting that incorporates the expected neutrino event count through a Poisson likelihood method. The trained CNN is integrated into the Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center ( www.mmdc.am ), offering a robust tool for the astrophysical community to explore blazar jet physics within a hadronic framework.},

  abstract     = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Total Power CO(1–0) mapping of Stephan’s Quintet (SQ), a prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial scale of ∼25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a wide area (∼120 × 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC 7318B and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1–0) luminosity is (2.47 ± 0.12) × 10 9 K km s −1 pc 2 , corresponding to a molecular gas mass of (1.07 ± 0.05) × 10 10 M ⊙ assuming the Galactic CO-to-H 2 conversion factor. The global star formation efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29–0.70 Gyr −1 , comparable to or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a velocity range of ∼1300 km s −1 , which can be divided into three components (low, mid, and high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC 7318B and the ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity component, associated with NGC 7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our mapping reveals molecular gas extending ∼100 kpc in projection along the inner tail and north of it, containing (1.64 ± 0.08) × 10 9 M ⊙ (15% of total) with low velocity dispersion (∼20 km s −1 ) and ongoing star formation. While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail, our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC 7319.},

  abstract     = {Galactic outflows shape galaxy evolution, but their mass, energy, and momentum transfer remain uncertain. High-resolution spectroscopy can help, but systematic discrepancies hinder model interpretation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of semianalytical line transfer (SALT) and empirical partial covering models (PCMs) to recover the properties of outflows in the FIRE-2 simulation suite from synthetic Si II lines (1190 Å, 1193 Å, 1260 Å, 1304 Å, 1527 Å). When applicable, we assess each model’s ability to recover mass, energy, and momentum outflow rates, as well as radial density and velocity profiles, column densities, and flow geometries. We find that the PCM underestimates column densities by 1.3 dex on average in the range 15\lt {\mathrm{log}}\,N\,[{{\rm{cm}}}^{-2}]\lt 17 with dispersion 1.3 dex. We attribute this bias to instrumental smoothing. Since the PCM underestimates column densities, it also underestimates flow rates, though its predictions are independent of radius, with a dispersion of 0.55 dex. We detect no bias in the SALT estimates of the column density with dispersion 1.3 dex. When the velocity and density field obey power laws, SALT can constrain the mass, momentum, and energy outflow rates to 0.36(0.63), 0.56(0.56), and 0.97(0.80) dex at 0.15(0.30) R vir , respectively. However, certain profiles in FIRE-2 fall outside the SALT framework, where the model breaks down. We find that SALT effectively tracks the flow geometry, capturing the temporal evolution of the photon escape fraction that is out of phase with the star formation rate, fully consistent with hydrodynamic simulations. We advocate for integral field unit spectroscopy to better constrain flow properties.},

  abstract     = {Type-I thermonuclear bursts (TNBs) from neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) originate on the neutron star’s surface from the unstable burning of the accreted material. On the other hand, kHz quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought to originate in the innermost regions of the inspiralling accretion disk. Type-I TNBs are expected to impact the inner accretion flow, and consequently the kHz QPOs, due to the intense radiation pressure. In this work, we systematically study the evolution of the upper and the lower kHz QPOs immediately before and after a type-I TNB on 4U 1636−536 using AstroSat observations in the 3–20 keV band. The analysis of the power density spectra shows the presence of kHz QPOs within 200 s before the onset of the type-I burst. However, we have not detected any prominent signature of the same within 100–200 s after the burst. The kHz QPOs then reemerge after ≈200 s. The fractional rms variation in the 3–20 keV band drops by ≈5%–6%, supporting the nonexistence of kHz QPOs in the 200 s postburst zone. The timescale of 200 s coincides with the viscous timescale, highlighting a scenario where the inner disk is temporarily disrupted by the intense radiation from the type-I TNB. The kHz QPO then reestablishes as the inner disk is restored.},

X-ray colors and spectral fitting allow for clear separation of foreground sources (with less extinction than the cluster), quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries (qLMXBs), and sources with harder spectra. We identify 22 candidate qLMXBs, over twice that found in any other cluster. This is consistent with Terzan 5’s stellar interaction rate, the highest among Galactic globular clusters. We do not see qLMXBs dominated by thermal emission below L X ∼ 10 32 erg s −1 , though qLMXBs with stronger nonthermal emission could be missed. We find that more than 50% of the qLMXB sources have a neutron star thermal component contributing over 80% of the total luminosity. We report an unusual spectral feature around 1.75 keV in the combined spectrum of Ter 5 X-3. The concentration of the qLMXBs within the cluster is consistent with that of a population of mass 1.46 ± 0.14 M ⊙ . We identify secure X-ray counterparts to millisecond pulsars Terzan 5 ar and Terzan 5 at, using positional coincidence and orbital X-ray light curves matching those expected for spider pulsars.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of the origin of gamma-ray emissions in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an enigma. Through a joint analysis of GRB 180427A, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and AstroSat’s Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager, we identify emissions from two distinct regions with varying polarization properties. Time-resolved polarization analysis reveals a synchronous evolution of the polarization angle (PA) and fraction with two emission pulses, peaking with a delay of 5.09 ± 0.29 s. Spectral analysis indicates that the first pulse is characterized by a stronger blackbody component, while the second pulse exhibits a more prominent nonthermal spectrum (power law with an exponential cutoff). Using a bottom-to-top approach through simulations, we decouple the polarization properties of the individual spectral components, revealing polarization fractions (PFs) of 25%–40% for the blackbody spectrum and 30%–60% for the nonthermal spectrum. At a redshift of z ∼ 0.22, the blackbody emission originates from the jet photosphere at ∼a few 10 11 cm, whereas the nonthermal emission arises from an optically thin region at a few 10 13 cm. The changing dominance of these emissions explains the observed PA shift of 60° ± 22°. The spectral cutoff at 1 MeV suggests pair opacity due to the jet’s relatively lower bulk Lorentz factor (Γ∼ a few tens). The high PF and hard low-energy spectral slopes ( α > −0.5) imply a top-hat jet structure observed off-axis, near the jet’s edge. This off-axis viewing introduces anisotropy in the observed radiation within the viewing cone (1/Γ), accounting for the observed polarization.},

The source was in an outburst state during this period. We searched for intraday variability (IDV), using two powerful statistical tests: the power-enhanced F-test and the nested ANOVA test. The source displayed IDV in the R band for five of the 10 nights, yielding a duty cycle of 34%. During the entire monitoring of the source, it showed variations of over two mag in all B , V , R , and I data bands. We obtained a variability timescale for a variable light curve, giving us an upper limit for the size of the emission region. We generated optical spectral energy distributions of the blazar for these 25 nights, fitted a power law of form ( F {}_{\nu }\propto {\nu }^{-{\alpha }_{o}} ) and found the weighted mean spectral index to be 1.471 ± 0.004. An analysis of the color–magnitude diagram shows that, contrary to the redder-when-brighter trend typically observed in FSRQs, this source exhibits a bluer-when-brighter trend on short-term variability timescales—a behavior more commonly associated with BL Lac objects. We explore potential physical mechanisms responsible for the observed spectral variability.},

Using the 16.8 yr Fermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 σ and a radius 0 \mathop{.}\limits^{\unicode{x000b0}} 24 in 0.2–500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the adjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular clump at local-standard-of-rest velocity ∼−48 to −43 km s −1 was revealed, appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found located in a cavity encircled by a “C”-shaped ring-like molecular shell at −45 to −43 km s −1 . This morphological agreement, together with the position-velocity diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests that the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the stellar wind of the progenitor with a mass ≳15 M ⊙ . The giant molecular cloud, visible at around −46 km s −1 , and the associated SNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the H i absorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the radiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the evolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission reported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between the accelerated protons escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large molecular clump.},

For this, we have developed a novel numerical method where we construct a reference binary, by evolving the post-Newtonian ( { \mathcal P }N ) evolution equations backwards from a point near merger without the inclusion of the third object, that can be compared to the perturbed binary that evolves under the influence from the third BH. From this, we quantify how the interplay between dynamical tides, { \mathcal P }N -effects, and the time-dependent Doppler shift of the eccentric GW source results in unique observable GW phase shifts that can be used to probe the dynamical assembly mechanism of individual GW sources. We further find an analytical expression for the GW phase shift, which has a universal functional form that only depends on the time-evolving BBH eccentricity. The normalization scales with the BH masses and initial separation, which can be linked to the underlying astrophysical environment. GW phase shifts from a chaotic 3-body BH scattering taking place in a cluster, and from a BBH inspiraling in a disk migration trap near a supermassive BH, are also shown for illustration.},

Many works have focused on the mergers of sBHs in the disk that produce gravitational waves; however, sBHs in hyperbolic orbits also emit gravitational-wave bremsstrahlung that can be detected by ground-based interferometers like LIGO. In this work, we analyze the scattering of sBHs in an AGN disk as they migrate inside the disk, focusing on gravitational-wave bremsstrahlung emission. We determine how the gravitational-wave emission depends on the different parameters of the scattering experiments, such as the mass of the supermassive black hole and the sBH migration rate and mass ratio. We find that scattering with detectable gravitational-wave bremsstrahlung is more frequent around lower-mass supermassive black holes (∼10 5−6 M ⊙ ). We then conduct a suite of Monte Carlo simulations and estimate the rate for ground-based gravitational-wave detections to be in the range of 0.08–1194 Gpc −3 yr −1 , depending on migration forces and detection thresholds, with large uncertainties accounting for variations in possible AGN environments. The expected rate for our Fiducial parameters is 3.2 Gpc −3 yr −1 . Finally, we provide first-principle gravitational-wave templates produced by the encounters.},

  abstract     = {Photodissociation regions (PDRs) are key to understanding the feedback processes that shape interstellar matter in galaxies. One important type of PDR is the interface between H ii regions and molecular clouds, where far-ultraviolet radiation from massive stars heats gas and dissociates molecules. Photochemical models predict that as metallicity decreases, the C/CO transition occurs at greater depths in the PDR compared to the H/H 2 transition, increasing the extent of CO-dark H 2 gas in low-metallicity environments. This prediction has been difficult to test outside the Milky Way due to the lack of high-spatial-resolution observations tracing H 2 and CO. This study examines a low-metallicity PDR in the N13 region of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), where we spatially resolve the ionization front, the H 2 dissociation front, and the C/CO transition using 12 CO J = 2−1, 3−2, and [C I ] 1–0 observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and near-infrared spectroscopy of the H 2 2.12 1–0 S(1) vibrational line, and H recombination lines from the James Webb Space Telescope. Our analysis shows that the separation between the H/H 2 and C/CO boundaries is approximately 0.043 ± 0.013(stat.) ± 0.0036(syst.) pc (equivalent to 0\mathop{.}\limits^{^{\prime\prime} }146\pm 0\mathop{.}\limits^{^{\prime\prime} }042({\rm{stat.}})\pm 0\mathop{.}\limits^{^{\prime\prime} }012({\rm{syst.}}) at the SMC’s distance of 62 kpc), defining the spatial extent of the CO-dark H 2 region. Compared to our plane-parallel PDR models, we find that a constant-pressure model matches the observed structure better than a constant-density one. Overall, we find that the PDR model does well at predicting the extent of the CO-dark H 2 layer in N13. This study represents the first resolved benchmark for low-metallicity PDRs.},

  abstract     = {The potential habitability of tidally locked planets orbiting M stars remains uncertain. However, recent observations with JWST and numerous theoretical studies investigating atmospheric evolution over time suggest that thick atmospheres (>1 bar) with abundant surface water are increasingly unlikely. A significant challenge to habitability for tidally locked systems is the prevention of atmospheric collapse. For tenuous atmospheres, this challenge is even more extreme, since low-pressure atmospheres cannot transport heat effectively from the day- to nightside. Previous studies find that collapse is likely for CO 2 atmospheres with surface pressures less than 100 mbar for planets in the habitable zone of Trappist-1, which would significantly reduce the likelihood for long-term habitability in that system. In this study, we find that modest levels of atmospheric mineral dust mitigate this collapse for a tenuous 7.05 mbar atmosphere on a small Mars-sized planet. Dust heating modifies the vertical and zonal thermal gradients and wind sheers. Due to the rapid planetary rotation (1 yr = 6 sols), this change is reflected in the magnitude of rotational components of the global circulation, including the equatorial jet and midlatitude eddies. We find that heat transport by these components is increased in dusty simulations, and atmospheric collapse on the permanent nightside is prevented. This dust-dominated climate is consistent with a planetary atmosphere evolving towards low pressure and high aridity with time. Our findings therefore provide an alternative target to Earth-like climates around M stars and reopens the possibility of habitability in M star systems.},

Models in the literature cannot closely match the observed element ratios, where Si, S are overproduced and Ar, Ca are underproduced. In this article, we explore the impact of the model parameters during the evolution of massive stars on the final explosive nucleosynthesis. We investigate the effects of a parameterized model of the convective process, including the mixing length parameter and the semiconvection parameter, on the production of Si-group elements. We search for the value pair that can reduce the discrepancy in the models. We conclude that a mixing length parameter of 2.2 and a semiconvection parameter of 0.03 are required to fit these criteria. Using this updated value pair, we compute a sequence of massive star models from M ZAMS = 15–40 M ⊙ . The high-resolution data from future observations, such as XRISM, will provide further details on less constrained processes in stellar evolution and supernova explosions. Future comparison with supernova models of various progenitor metallicity will further shed light on the supernova population and their relative rates on cosmological scales.},

  abstract     = {In 2023 November, the Fermi Large Area Telescope detected a γ -ray flare from the high-redshift blazar GB6 B1428+4217 ( z = 4.715). We initiated a multiwavelength follow-up campaign involving Swift, NuSTAR, the Sierra Nevada and Perkins Observatories, and the Effelsberg 100 m radio telescope. This source, also known as 5BZQ J1430+4204, has shown an anomalous soft X-ray spectrum in previous observations, including possible ionized absorption features or signatures of bulk Comptonization of thermal electrons, which are also detected during the flaring episode. Simultaneous optical data revealed a polarization fraction of ∼8% in the R band, confirming that synchrotron emission dominated over thermal emission from the accretion disk. The hard X-ray flux was enhanced during the flare. Modeling of the broadband spectral energy distribution suggests that the high-energy component is dominated by Compton scattering by external seed photons from the accretion disk. The origin of the flare is consistent with the injection of a hard-spectrum electron population in the emission region. With a γ -ray luminosity among the top 5% of flaring events, GB6 B1428+4217 exemplifies a prototypical MeV blazar. Its Compton-dominated spectral energy distribution and extreme luminosity are in line with expectations from the blazar sequence. High-redshift flares like this are critical for understanding jet physics in the early Universe and may improve detection prospects with future missions such as the Compton Spectrometer and Imager.},

  abstract     = {Starspots are ubiquitous in young, low-mass stars, yet their impact on the spectral classification and fundamental parameter inference of pre-main-sequence stars (PMS) has been largely overlooked. In this study, we demonstrate that cool starspots systematically distort spectral morphology and bias the effective temperatures, surface gravities, and luminosities derived for nonaccreting weak-lined T Tauri stars (WTTSs). Using a sample of 56 WTTSs with high-resolution, broadband X-Shooter spectra, we perform two-temperature spectral fits that explicitly account for spot coverages and temperature contrasts. These composite models consistently outperform traditional single-temperature fits, particularly in the 3350–4000 K regime, where spot contributions dominate the red-optical and near-IR flux. Moreover, we propose that surface gravity discrepancies between optical and IR measurements are a natural consequence of spot-dominated emission in PMS stars. We find that single-temperature models can overestimate effective temperatures by up to 700 K and underestimate {\mathrm{log}}\,g by 1–2 dex. Using spot-corrected effective temperatures, we derive masses and ages from traditional, magnetic, and spotted evolutionary models, finding that spot corrections systematically raise inferred masses by up to 80% and stellar ages by up to 0.5 dex. These discrepancies are strongest for stars in the 0.3–0.8 M ⊙ range. Using starspots as a proxy for magnetic topology, we find evidence that a shift from largely axisymmetric to nonaxisymmetric magnetic fields dominated by small-scale structures coincides with the formation of a radiative core during PMS evolution, effectively distinguishing between the convective and interface dynamo regimes.},

  abstract     = {For three decades, adaptive optic surveys have revealed an excess of T Tauri binaries across a = 10–100 au in nearby star-forming regions compared to the field population of main-sequence (MS) stars. Such an excess requires that most stars are born in dense clusters and subjected to significant dynamical processing that disrupts such binaries across intermediate separations. However, we demonstrate that the apparent excess is due to an observational selection bias. Close binaries within a < 100 au clear out their dusty circumstellar disks on faster timescales compared to wide binaries and single stars. A magnitude-limited sample is therefore biased toward close binaries that have preferentially cleared out their obscuring disks. We reexamine the separation distribution of pre-MS binaries in low-density Taurus, moderately dense Upper Scorpius (Upper Sco), and the extremely dense Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). By limiting the samples to primary spectral type/mass instead of magnitude, the artificial excess across a = 10–100 au disappears in all three environments. Across wider separations a = 100–4000 au, Taurus exhibits an excess of companions (mostly tertiaries), the ONC displays a deficit, and Upper Sco matches the field MS population. The field derives from an amalgam of all three environments, where Upper Sco corresponds to the average birth environment of solar-type stars. The total binary fraction within a < 10,000 au in Taurus is only 52% ± 7%, substantially lower than the 100% inferred from the biased observations and only slightly higher than the field MS value of 45%. N -body interactions preferentially disrupt outer tertiaries with only marginal dynamical processing of the inner binaries, especially those within a < 100 au.},

  abstract     = {The evolutionary history of the Milky Way disk is imprinted in the ages, positions, and chemical compositions of individual stars. In this study, we derive the intrinsic density distribution of different stellar populations using the final data release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. A total of 203,197 red giant branch stars are used to sort the stellar disk ( R ≤ 20 kpc) into subpopulations of metallicity (Δ[M/H]  = 0.1 dex), age ( {{\rm{\Delta }}}\,{\mathrm{log}}\,(\frac{{{\rm{age}}}}{{{\rm{yr}}}})\,=\,0.1 ), and α -element abundances ([ α /M]). We fit the present-day structural parameters and density distribution of each stellar subpopulation after correcting for the survey selection function. The low- α disk is characterized by longer scale lengths and shorter scale heights, and is best fit by a broken exponential radial profile for each population. The high- α disk is characterized by shorter scale lengths and larger scale heights, and is generally well-approximated by a single exponential radial profile. These results are applied to produce new estimates of the integrated properties of the Milky Way from early times to the present day. We measure the total stellar mass of the disk to be 5.2{7}_{-1.5}^{+0.2}\times 1{0}^{10} M ⊙ , and the average mass-weighted scale length is R d = 2.37 ± 0.2 kpc. The Milky Way’s present-day color of ( g − r ) = 0.72 ± 0.02 is consistent with the classification of a red spiral galaxy, although it has only been in the “green valley” region of the galaxy color–mass diagram for the last ∼3 Gyr.},

  abstract     = {By assuming the inverse square law of solar wind plasma density as representative of other stars, it is shown that just outside a star, the outward deflection of a passing radio signal at ν ≈ 1 GHz (which is capable of penetrating the plasma) is about 5 times larger than the gravitational inward deflection by the star, and the ensuing lens equation, which takes both effects into account is a cubic polynomial with three roots and a new strong lensing caustic. The geometric optics approach is valid for a radio source size ≲1 pc. Microlensing magnification of a steady background source occurs typically over a timescale of milliseconds, resulting in ≈80 fast radio bursts (FRBs) per day over the whole sky, which can only perturb the isotropy of FRB distribution at the several percent level. Moreover, repeating FRBs could be triggered by the periodic interception of the line of sight of the background source by members of a binary system. The temporal signatures of such FRBs are consistent with the power spectrum of solar wind density fluctuations on corresponding scales, except that the mean density of the wind is a few times higher than the solar value.},

  abstract     = {We present the Virtual Research Assistant (VRA) of the ATLAS sky survey, which performs preliminary eyeballing on our clean transient data stream. The VRA uses histogram-based gradient-boosted decision tree classifiers trained on real data to score incoming alerts on two axes: “Real” and “Galactic.” The alerts are then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most “real” and “extragalactic” receive high scores; the scores are updated when new lightcurve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the training we use the recall at rank K , which is more informative to our science goal than general metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-scores). We also establish benchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure our models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS pipeline. Then, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most promising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove bogus alerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing workload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity <0.08%. It also allows us to automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope, paving the way toward automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST. Finally, this is a demonstration that feature-based methods remain extremely relevant in our field, being trainable on only a few thousand samples and highly interpretable; they also offer a direct way to inject expertise into models through feature engineering.},

CLASP2.1 provided polarization profiles of the Mg ii h and k lines, as well as of the Mn i lines around 2800 Å, across various magnetic structures in an active region, containing a plage, a pore, and the edges of a sunspot penumbra. By applying the weak-field approximation to the circular polarization profiles of these spectral lines, we obtain a longitudinal magnetic field map at three different heights in the chromosphere (lower, middle, and upper). This is complemented by data from Hinode (photospheric magnetic field), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (high spatial resolution observations of the chromosphere and corona). We quantify the height expansion of the plage magnetic fields and find that the magnetic fields expand significantly in the middle chromosphere, shaping the moss observed above in the transition region and corona. We identified an area with polarity reversal at the upper chromosphere around the edge of the pore, suggesting the presence of a magnetic discontinuity in the upper chromosphere. Transient and recurrent jetlike events are observed in this region, likely driven by magnetic reconnection. Around the penumbral edge, we find large-scale magnetic fields corresponding to the superpenumbral fibrils seen in the upper chromosphere. In the superpenumbral fibrils, we find Zeeman-induced linear polarization signals, suggesting the presence of a significantly inclined magnetic field, as strong as 1000 G in the upper chromosphere.},

We study systematically the dynamical stability of differentially rotating neutron stars within a broad range of masses, rotation rates, and degrees of differential rotation, modeled as polytropes with Γ = 2. We pay particular attention to quasi-toroidal configurations that are outside the parameter space region explored in previous works. We estimate the limits of the region of stability against quasi-radial perturbations by performing an extensive set of numerical simulations. We find that some of the stability criteria proposed in the past are not sufficient or necessary to determine stability if differential rotation is present, and propose a new, more general criterion. We show that there is a large parameter space that allows for quasi-toroidal configurations that will not collapse immediately to a black hole and that can sustain masses up to ∼2.5 times the maximum mass of a nonrotating neutron star.},

Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star’s tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction γ of the star’s gravitational binding energy (with \gamma \sim { \mathcal O }(1) ), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter γ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution d M / d E and fallback rate d M / d T while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/ZihanZhou26/PerTDE ).},

To this end, early-type galaxies are selected from the simulated galaxy catalogs based on stellar mass and kinematic morphology. The shapes of galaxies and subhalos are computed using the reduced inertia tensor derived from mass-weighted particle positions. We find that the misalignment between galaxies and their corresponding dark matter subhalos decreases over time. We further analyze the two-point correlation between galaxy or subhalo shapes and the large-scale density field traced by their spatial distribution, and quantify the amplitude using the nonlinear alignment model across a wide redshift range from z =  0.625 to z =  2.5. We find that the IA amplitude, A NLA , of galaxies remains largely constant with redshift, whereas that of dark matter subhalos exhibits moderate redshift evolution, with a power-law slope that deviates from zero at a significance level exceeding 3 σ . Additionally, A NLA is found to depend on both the stellar mass and kinematic morphology of galaxies. Notably, our results are broadly consistent with existing observational constraints. Our findings are in good agreement with previous results of other cosmological simulations.},

Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints; however, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We seek to determine whether improvements to the lens model and reconstructed source merit the difficulty of handling the extra constraints. We choose the spatially extended z = 0.725 giant arc in the z = 0.375 Abell 370 galaxy cluster field for our study. We present (1) a series of pixel-based source reconstructions (PBSRs) for cluster mass models exploring the range of uncertainties in our fiducial model, (2) a similar analysis done using a prototype Python de-lensing code for cluster mass models from each of the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) modeling teams, (3) an optimized model with PBSR, and (4) and an investigation of how our optimized model affects the cluster mass model locally and globally in the highest-magnification regions. We find that our optimized model (1) is able to correct resolution-limited assumptions in cluster model inputs local to the arc, (2) has significantly smaller arc model residuals than results from the standard HFF models, and (3) affects the critical curves and therefore the information derived from highest-magnification zones most significantly in regions local to the arc.},

Most importantly, the emerging fields offer valuable insights into how energy and mass are transferred to the upper solar atmosphere. As a result, they have garnered significant attention from both observational and theoretical perspectives. In this article, we present two models of quiet-Sun-like magnetic fields generated by the Bifrost code. We compare these models with observations from the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope (SST) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). By tracking the magnetic features in both the SST and Bifrost data, we determine the similarities and differences between the fields identified in the models and those observed. We conduct a quantitative comparison of various properties, such as flux content, flux densities, horizontal and line-of-sight velocities, lifetimes, sizes, and surface interactions. Additionally, we identify and analyze the properties of the largest emerging bipoles in the SST and Bifrost data. Our findings indicate that the magnetic bipoles in the Bifrost simulations are generally stronger than those observed with the SST. However, a qualitative comparison of the chromospheric and transition region responses to the emerging fields in the Bifrost models, SST, and IRIS observations shows similar heating processes occurring above and around the emerging fields. Finally, we outline our plans for future work aimed at studying the emergence of magnetic fields in the quiet Sun, with a particular focus on the chromosphere and upper atmospheric layers.},

The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Σ X and temperature T X . The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy ( L X and 〈 T X 〉) and within five optical effective radii ( L X,5 and 〈 T X,5 〉) and the circularized profiles Σ X ( R ) and T X ( R ). The values for L X , L X,5 , 〈 T X 〉, and 〈 T X,5 〉 compare very well with those observed. The Σ X ( R ) and T X ( R ) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC 5129 and those of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for T X ( R ): Σ X ( R ) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii R e , and T X ( R ) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R = (1 ÷ 3) R e . Inside the peak position, T X ( R ) declines toward the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ≃30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Σ X ( R ) and T X ( R ) as large as those observed outside R ≃ R e are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.},

Within that region, the simulated gas flow developed into an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The nucleus’ luminosity density L 22 GHz = 5.4 × 10 17 W Hz −1 is about 60 times that of Sagittarius A ⋆ . The nucleus’ spectral index {\alpha }_{10\,{\rm{GHz}}}^{22\,{\rm{GHz}}}=-1.85\pm 0.18 ( S ν ∝ ν α ) indicates optically thin synchrotron emission. The spectral energy distribution of the nucleus peaks near ν peak = 9 GHz. Modeling this radio peak as an ADAF implies a BH mass M ADAF = (1.2 ± 0.2) × 10 9 M ⊙ , consistent with previous estimates of (1–2) × 10 9 M ⊙ from stellar or hot-gas dynamics. Also, the Eddington-scaled accretion rate for NGC 3115, {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{ADAF}}}/{\dot{M}}_{{\rm{Edd}}}=1.{2}_{-0.6}^{+1.0}\times 1{0}^{-8} , is about 4–8 times lower than recent estimates for Sagittarius A ⋆ .},

  abstract     = {The reflection effect is here incorporated within an earlier analytic binary system light- and velocity-curve model that includes a circumstellar equipotential disk. The modeled disk is semitransparent, to explore the attenuation and reemission of irradiance within the disk, as well as the irradiance of the companion star. The reflection functions defined in R. E. Wilson ensure efficient computation and allow multiple reflection. A capsule summary of the general binary system potential problem provides a foundation for close binary morphological ideas. Chief among these ideas is that many or perhaps most postnovae may be of the double contact morphological type. The location of an outer-disk null point of effective gravity accurately quantifies a limit on disk size. The disk should not extend beyond the outer null point, as the local material would then be unbound to the disk. The disk’s inner extent is set by another null point. The inner and outer null locations are computed at each solution iteration, thus obviating any need for the arbitrary cutoffs seen in other postnova disk models. Remarkably, impersonal light-curve solutions find the disk edge quite close to the outer null point for U Scorpii (U Sco). Other reflection-related topics include irradiation heating and measurement of disk interior density and temperature. Analyses find white dwarf masses about 3%–6% lower than in nongravitating disk models that implicitly include disk mass as part of the white dwarf. The results from CI Aquilae and U Sco analyses are tabulated and prospects for further progress are outlined.},

  abstract     = {In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by photolysis of common ice components such as H 2 O, CO 2 , CO, and O 3 , offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of metastable, highly reactive O( 1 D) atoms. We examine the reactivity of these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O 3 with methyl cyanide (CH 3 CN). These studies are conducted in an ultra-high vacuum chamber at cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH 3 CN to produce primarily methyl isocyanate (CH 3 NCO) in matrix-free ices. Over the range from 10 to 40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH 3 CN destruction or CH 3 NCO production. When placing CH 3 CN:O 3 in H 2 O and CO 2 ice matrices, we find that CH 3 NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H 2 O ice, we also observe a shift in product branching ratios toward alternative pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH 2 CN). Overall, our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where radical mobility is limited.},

The five consecutive HST orbits span a full 7.34 hr binary orbital period. We detect a 24.939 ± 0.006 s far-UV modulation, confirming that J0240 contains the fastest spinning white dwarf (WD) in a CV. A high N v /C iv emission line ratio is considered an indicator of a recent episode of thermal-timescale mass transfer. The observed ratio in J0240 is higher than seen in typical magnetic CVs, but far less than observed in the only other confirmed propeller, AE Aquarii (AE Aqr). We also find that J0240 is significantly less luminous than AE Aqr during both low- and high-flux states. Around orbital phase 0.5, the Si iv emission line displays a P-Cygni absorption profile, likely related to the gas accelerated in the propeller. We derive new mass-dependent limits for the surface temperature of the WD of T ≤ 11,000–15,000 K. This temperature is low enough to allow for WD core crystallization, which may be linked to magnetism in WDs, particularly those in CVs.},

  abstract     = {Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are the most common exoplanets, with a “radius valley” suggesting that super-Earths may form by shedding sub-Neptunes’ gaseous envelopes. Exoplanets that lie closer to the super-Earth side of the valley are more likely to have lost a significant fraction of their original H/He envelopes and become enriched in heavier elements, with CO 2 gaining in abundance. It remains unclear which types of haze would form in such atmospheres, potentially significantly affecting spectroscopic observations. To investigate this, we performed laboratory simulations of two CO 2 -rich gas mixtures (with 2000 times solar metallicity at 300 and 500 K). We found that under plasma irradiation organic hazes were produced at both temperatures, with a higher haze production rate at 300 K, probably because condensation occurs more readily at lower temperature. Gas-phase analysis demonstrates the formation of various hydrocarbons, oxygen- and nitrogen-containing species, including reactive gas precursors like C 2 H 4 , CH 2 O, and HCN, for haze formation. The compositional analysis of the haze particles reveals various functional groups and molecular formulas in both samples. The 500 K haze sample has larger average molecular sizes, a higher degree of unsaturation with more double or triple bonds present, and higher nitrogen content incorporated as N–H and C=N bonds, indicating different haze formation pathways. These findings not only improve the haze formation theories in CO 2 -rich exoplanet atmospheres but also offer important implications for the interpretation of future observational data.},

One such measurement that has been largely overlooked is that of the elemental abundances, which potentially provide insights into the origin of the ejected material. Using the Chandra/HETG grating spectrometer we measure and present elemental abundances in four low-mass X-ray binaries. We compare two measurement methods. One is by fitting line series of individual ions and reconstructing the absorption measure distribution (AMD), and the other is a global fit with one or two individual ionization components. All outflows feature a steep AMD strongly favoring high ionization degrees. The present abundances are consistent with previous works suggesting the abundances in the outflows are nonsolar. We find a tentative trend of increasing abundances with atomic number, which fits some core-collapse supernova models, but there is no exact match to a specific one.},

We find a striking correlation between a magnetar’s characteristic age and both its typical burst energy and its burst activity level. Arguing that this bursting behavior also correlates with true age, we interpret it as the result of a reducing high-stress volume of the crust in an aging magnetar: Previous giant flares cause relaxation of large regions of its crust and inhibit burst clustering, while the reducing burst energy reflects the progressively shallower region of the crust where Hall drift can build stresses effectively, as the field decays through the range ∼10 12 –10 13 G. Low-energy bursts from very young magnetars may represent failures of weak regions of the crust that have only recently solidified.},

We find that stars on bar-supporting x 1 -like orbits exhibit characteristic sawtooth-like radial velocity patterns and archlike tangential velocity patterns as a function of azimuth. In contrast, stars on box and disk orbits show little azimuthal variation, effectively smoothing the overall velocity distribution. When averaged over all orbital families, the resulting kinematics are broadly consistent with the bisymmetric model of Sellwood and Spekkens, with the amplitudes of bar-induced velocity perturbations increasing with bar strength. In addition, bars amplify the radial pressure gradient associated with enhanced random stellar motions, leading to a noticeable reduction in the mean rotational velocity. This effect becomes more pronounced with increasing bar strength, resulting in a shallower rotation curve within the bar region. We discuss our results in the context of the kinematic properties of observed barred galaxies.},

Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we constrain key dust properties, including temperature, surface density, maximum grain size, composition, filling factor, and size distribution. The full fitting, with all parameters free, shows a preference for organics-rich dust with a low filling factor in the outer region ( r ≳ 40 au), where the spectral index is ∼3.7, but amorphous-carbon-rich dust also reasonably reproduces the observed intensity profiles. Considering the scattering polarization observed at 0.87 mm, compact, amorphous-carbon-rich dust is unlikely and moderately porous dust is favored. Beyond 40 au, the maximum dust size is likely ∼100 μ m if dust is compact or amorphous-carbon rich. However, if the dust is moderately porous and organics-rich, both the predicted dust surface density and dust size can be sufficiently large for the pebble accretion rate to reach ∼10 M ⊕ Myr −1 in most regions, suggesting that pebble accretion could be a key mechanism for forming planets in the disk. In contrast, if the dust is amorphous-carbon-rich, forming a giant planet core via pebble accretion is unlikely due to the combined effects of low dust surface density and small dust size required to match the observed emission, suggesting other mechanisms, such as disk fragmentation due to gravitational instability, may be responsible for planet formation in the HL Tau disk.},

Here, we present a study of the escape velocity curve using a sample of high-velocity K giants with full 6D phase-space information and of relatively good quality, selected from LAMOST DR8 and cross-matched with Gaia DR3. To expand the high-velocity stars to larger distances, we used radius-dependent criteria of total velocity, i.e., v GC > 300 km s −1 for the solar neighborhood and {v}_{{\rm{GC}}}\gt {v}_{{\rm{\min }}}\sim 0.6\times {v}_{{\rm{esc}}}({r}_{{\rm{GC}}}) for the outer region. We also selected halo stars based on v ϕ − [Fe/H] information to ensure that the sample is isotropic. We modeled the velocity distribution with traditional power-law models to determine the escape velocity in each radial bin. For the first time, we have directly measured a relatively continuous escape velocity curve that can extend to Galactocentric radii of ∼50 kpc, finding a decline in agreement with previous studies. The escape velocity at the solar position yielded by our measurements is 523.7{4}_{-13.47}^{+12.83}\,{\rm{km}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1} . Combined with the local circular velocity, we estimated the mass of the MW assuming a Navarro–Frenk–White DM profile, which resulted in a total mass of {M}_{200,\,{\rm{total}}}=0.9{0}_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times 1{0}^{12}\,{M}_{\odot } , with a concentration of {c}_{200}=13.4{7}_{-1.70}^{+1.85} . The small uncertainty implies that including the escape velocities beyond the solar neighborhood can result in a more precise mass estimate. Our derived MW mass is consistent with some recent studies using the escape velocity as well as other tracers, which may support a lower mass of the DM halo than in the past.},

Combining remote observations of extreme-ultraviolet images and white-light coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs) obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, STEREO-A, and Solar Orbiter, we present an analysis of the continuous tracking from the corona to interplanetary space of the substructures of a CME associated with a prominence that erupted on 2022 September 23. The prominence is found to remain bright and compact during the CME propagation for more than three days. We investigate the kinematic evolution of the CME substructures as the CME propagated to around 0.5 au. We find that for the first 0.28 au, both the CME front and prominence propagated coherently, indicating that the prominence was tied to the CME magnetic structure. Beyond 0.28 au, the CME bright front was seen to be distorted. However, the prominence continued to propagate at a nearly constant velocity up to at least 0.5 au. STEREO-A/HI images further show a dark ridge-like feature trailing the CME that passed over the prominence, and the prominence appeared tilted. We deduce that the prominence propagated independently of the CME at larger distances from the Sun. Overall, this study shows that both previously proposed hypotheses—namely, that the prominence is tied to or propagates independently of the CME—are valid but within different distance ranges.},

  abstract     = {Although shock waves have been well documented in fundamental-mode RRab stars, their existence in first-overtone pulsator stars, RRc stars, has remained uncertain. Building upon the spectroscopic frameworks established by M. Chadid et al., we present the first direct detection of multistructured shock phenomena in RRc stars. Using high-resolution phase-resolved spectroscopy, we identify unambiguous shock signatures, including H α emission, line-doubling, and large-scale variations in radial velocity and line broadening.Our analysis reveals a structured sequence of distinct shock fronts: the main outward shock, Sh He+H , the ballistic shock, Sh Ball , and a gravitational collapse shock, Sh Gravity . These phenomena produce measurable dynamical and spectroscopic effects at both photospheric and higher atmospheric layers. We find that RRc stars sustain hypersonic shock regimes despite the absence of He I or He II emission typically used in RRab classification schemes. This discrepancy is attributed to the compact and low-opacity nature of RRc atmospheres, which promotes rapid shock dissipation. These discoveries challenge conventional models of RRc atmospheres and update the classification scheme. We propose an extension to existing classification frameworks to accommodate the unique shock dynamics of RRc stars. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that first-overtone RR Lyrae pulsators lack strong shocks and demonstrate that RRc stars exhibit complex, multiphase atmospheric dynamics. Altogether, our findings reshape the current understanding of RRc atmospheric dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We explore constraints on the size of cool gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) obtainable from the presence, or lack thereof, of refractive scattering in fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our refractive analysis sets the most conservative bounds on parsec-scale CGM clumpiness as it does not make assumptions about the turbulent density cascade. We find that the bulk of low-redshift cool CGM gas, constrained to have densities of n e ≲ 10 −2 cm −3 , likely cannot produce two refractive images and, hence, scattering. It is only for extremely small cloud sizes ≲ 0.1 pc (about 100 times smaller than the so-called shattering scale) that such densities could result in detectable scattering. Dense n e ≳ 0.1 cm −3 gas with shattering-scale cloud sizes is more likely to inhabit the inner several kiloparsecs of the low-redshift CGM; such clouds would result in multiple refractive images and large scattering times ≳ 1−10 ms, but a small fraction of FRB sight lines are likely to be affected. We argue that such large scattering times from an intervening CGM would be a signature of subparsec clouds, even if diffractive scattering from turbulence contributes to the overall scattering. At redshift z ∼ 3, we estimate ∼0.1% of FRBs to intersect massive protoclusters, which may be the most likely place to see scattering owing to their ubiquitous n e ≈ 1 cm −3 cold gas. While much of our discussion assumes a single cloud size, we show similar results hold for a CGM cloud-size distribution motivated by hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract     = {Using measurements from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) aboard the International Space Station, we have examined the long-term variations in galactic cosmic ray (GCR) proton fluxes in 2011–2018. The AMS-02 data allow for the study of time profiles and the rigidity dependence of the long-term variations observed directly in space in a wide rigidity range from 1 to 100 GV. We have investigated the rigidity dependence of the amplitude of the long-term GCR variations described by the power-law fitting over the solar cycle. For a physical interpretation, we have considered the relationship between long-term GCR variations and heliospheric magnetic field turbulence using power spectral density frequency exponents. The apparent solar cycle variability can be seen in the time profile of the spectral index γ of the power-law rigidity spectrum of long-term GCR variations for 2006–2018 during solar cycle 24. The spectral index γ shows a tendency to be higher for the solar maximum phase compared to the solar minimum phase. Furthermore, we find evidence of the energy-dependent rigidity spectrum of the long-term GCR variations observed by AMS-02. We reveal the soft rigidity spectrum of the GCR isotropic intensity variations for the solar maximum and the hard rigidity spectrum for the solar minimum owing to the essential temporal rearrangements of the structure in the heliospheric magnetic field turbulence from the maxima to minima epoch of solar activity. The long-term GCR variations by AMS-02 show the softening of the spectra toward higher energies.},

  abstract     = {Nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies have been documented within the solar protoplanetary disk for several isotopes, including 48 Ca, 50 Ti, 54 Cr, 94 Mo, and 96 Zr. However, the existence of isotopic heterogeneities for short-lived radionuclides such as 26 Al remains debated. Here, we investigate potential heterogeneity in the 26 Al distribution by examining nucleosynthetic 50 Ti and 26 Al– 26 Mg isotope systematics in high-temperature early solar system solids—Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) and hibonites from CM chondrites—and comparing these with presolar grain data. We present high-precision titanium isotope measurements for 13 CAIs, comprising 11 26 Al-rich “normal”-type and two 26 Al-poor fractionation and unidentified nuclear effect (FUN)-type CAIs. Our data, combined with previously published results, reveal a fundamental decoupling between significant nucleosynthetic 50 Ti anomalies and high abundances of 26 Al, a pattern also present in presolar grains. We propose that this mutual exclusivity of 50 Ti and 26 Al observed in CAIs and CM hibonites is inherited directly from protosolar molecular cloud material. Specifically, this isotopic signature reflects the mixing of newly formed, 26 Al-rich molecular cloud material with older, Galactically inherited 26 Al-poor dust characterized by large nucleosynthetic 50 Ti variability. Consequently, solids exhibiting substantial 50 Ti anomalies ( 26 Al-poor FUN-type CAIs and CM hibonites) predominantly inherited older, 26 Al-poor presolar dust, whereas those with minimal 50 Ti anomalies and abundant 26 Al ( 26 Al-rich normal CAIs and CM hibonites) incorporated more of the younger, 26 Al-rich component. This inherited isotopic signature provides a consistent explanation for disk-scale nucleosynthetic heterogeneity in bulk meteorites, challenging the widely accepted notion that the canonical 26 Al/ 27 Al ratio of 5.25 × 10 −5 in 26 Al-rich CAIs represents the solar system average.},

  abstract     = {We consider if outflowing winds that are detected via narrow absorption lines (NALs) with FWHM of <500 km s −1 (i.e., NAL outflows) in quasar spectra contribute to feedback. As our sample, we choose 11 NAL systems in eight optically luminous quasars from the NAL survey of T. Misawa et al. (2007a), based on the following selection criteria: (i) they exhibit “partial coverage” suggesting quasar origin (i.e., intrinsic NALs), (ii) they have at least one low-ionization absorption line (C ii and/or Si ii ), and (iii) the Ly α absorption line is covered by available spectra. The results depend critically on this selection method, which has caveats and uncertainties associated with it, as we discuss in a dedicated section of this paper. Using the column density ratio of the excited and ground states of C ii and Si ii , we place upper limits on the electron density as n e < 0.2–18 cm −3 and lower limits on their radial distance from the flux source R as greater than several hundreds of kpc. We also calculate lower limits on the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of \mathrm{log}(\dot{M}/{{M}_{\odot }\,{\rm{s}}}^{-1})\gt 1.9–5.5 and \mathrm{log}(\dot{{E}_{{\rm{k}}}}/{{\rm{erg}}\,{\rm{s}}}^{-1})\gt 42.9 –49.8, respectively. Taking the NAL selection and these results at face value, the inferred feedback efficiency can be comparable to or even larger than those of broad absorption line and other outflow classes, and large enough to generate significant active galactic nucleus feedback. However, the question of the connection of quasar-driven outflows to NAL absorbers at large distances from the central engine remains open and should be addressed by future theoretical work.},

  abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are brief, high-energy bursts of radio waves from extragalactic sources, and their origin remains an open question. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the FRB population using the first CHIME/FRB catalog, focusing on their energy and redshift distributions, with careful consideration of selection effects. We investigate a range of models, including the Schechter function and the broken power-law function for the energy distribution, and several redshift evolution models, such as the star formation history (SFH) model, as well as models incorporating time delays relative to the SFH or additional redshift evolution factors. Our results indicate that the energy distribution of FRBs is best described by the Schechter function, with a power-law index of \gamma =-1.4{9}_{-0.27}^{+0.37} and a characteristic cutoff energy of {E}_{{{\rm{c}}}}=2.8{2}_{-1.47}^{+2.43}\times 1{0}^{41} erg. Furthermore, we find no evidence for redshift evolution in the energy distribution of FRBs. As for their redshift distribution, our analysis shows that it follows the cosmic SFH, without requiring additional delayed components or redshift evolution factors, suggesting that most FRBs likely originate from young stellar populations. Simultaneously, we infer a local volumetric rate of {{{\rm{\Phi }}}}_{0}=4.6{8}_{-2.39}^{+4.66}\times 1{0}^{4}\,{{{\rm{Gpc}}}}^{-3}\,{{{\rm{yr}}}}^{-1} for E > 10 39 erg.

  abstract     = {The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of t Q ≲ 10 6 yr, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed in the quasars’ rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based on the extents of the PZs may be underestimated, as time-variable obscuration effects might have limited the quasars’ emission along our sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime measurements for six quasars at z ∼ 6 leveraging the extended nebular emission perpendicular to our line of sight. We use observations from the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer to search for extended Ly α emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small PZs and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar’s PZ, which thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our results provide further evidence that the quasars’ current accretion episode has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.},

  abstract     = {Star formation is a fundamental, yet poorly understood, process of the Universe. It is important to study how star formation occurs in different galactic environments. Thus, here, in the first of a series of papers, we introduce the Low-metallicity Star Formation (LZ-STAR) survey of the Sh2-284 (hereafter S284) region, which, at Z ∼  0.3–0.5 Z ⊙ , is one of the lowest-metallicity star-forming regions of our Galaxy. LZ-STAR is a multifacility survey, including observations with JWST, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra, and Gemini. As a starting point, we report JWST and ALMA observations of one of the most massive protostars in the region, S284p1. The observations of shock-excited molecular hydrogen reveal a symmetric, bipolar outflow originating from the protostar, spanning several parsecs, and fully covered by the JWST field of view and ALMA observations of CO(2–1) emission. These allow us to infer that the protostar has maintained a relatively stable orientation of disk accretion over its formation history. The JWST near-infrared continuum observations detect a centrally illuminated bipolar outflow cavity around the protostar, as well as a surrounding cluster of low-mass young stars. We develop new radiative transfer models of massive protostars designed for the low metallicity of S284. Fitting these models to the protostar’s spectral energy distribution implies a current protostellar mass of ∼10 M ⊙ has formed from an initial ∼100 M ⊙ core over the last ∼3 × 10 5 yr. Overall, these results indicate that massive stars can form in an ordered manner in low-metallicity, protocluster environments.},

  abstract     = {High rates of stable mass transfer likely occur for some binary star systems, but the resulting flow of mass and angular momentum (AM) is unclear. We perform hydrodynamical simulations of a polytropic donor star and a point-mass secondary to determine the mass, AM, and velocity of gas that leaves the system, and the dependence on binary parameters such as mass ratio. The simulations use an adiabatic equation of state and do not include radiative cooling or irradiation of the outflow. Mass transfer is initiated by injecting heat into the stellar envelope, causing it to gradually inflate and overflow its Roche lobe. The transferred mass flows into an accretion disk, but soon begins to escape through the outer Lagrange point (L2), with a lesser amount escaping through the L3 point. This creates an equatorially concentrated circumbinary outflow with an opening angle of 10°–30° with a wind-like density profile ρ ∝ r −2 . We find that the ratios of the specific AM of the outflowing gas over that of the L2 point are approximately {0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.65} for mass ratios q = {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2} (accretor/donor). The asymptotic radial velocity of the outflowing gas, in units of the binary orbital velocity, is approximately 0.1–0.2 for the same mass ratios, except for q = 0.25, where it might be higher. This outflow, if ultimately unbound from the binary, may be a source of circumstellar material that interacts with ejecta from a subsequent supernova or stellar merger.},

We test several radiation mechanisms, including the pp interaction, proton synchrotron emission, photomeson process, and two-zone leptonic model. We find that only the pion decay gamma rays in pp interactions can interpret this feature in the framework of the one-zone model. With analytical analysis, we prove that proton synchrotron emission cannot generate a hard spectrum above 0.17 TeV. The photomeson model requires an emission zone compressed near the Schwarzschild radius of the central supermassive black hole, incompatible with broadband optical-GeV spectral constraints.

This work presents a complementary approach—the polarization frequency analysis (PFA)—allowing for the properties of the turbulent magnetic field, which are difficult to include in B. J. Burn’s original approach. Based on synthetic polarization observation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulation data, we study the influence of the coupling effect between density and magnetic field on synchrotron polarization dispersion. By applying the PFA to different simulated interstellar turbulence environments, we find that the PFA technique can reveal the scaling slope of the turbulent magnetic field in the case of a weak coupling effect and can also reflect the scaling slope of the RM in the case of a strong coupling effect. Since it avoids the influence of Faraday depolarization, the PFA technique is a promising way to uncover turbulence properties using observational data from the Low-Frequency Array for Radio Astronomy and the Square Kilometre Array.},

  abstract     = {Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam narrowband imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover “Oxyster”—a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at z = 0.924. The nebula is traced by extended [O ii ] λλ 3726, 3729 (∼30 kpc) and [O iii ] λ 5007 (∼20 kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity–size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low- z AGNs, resembling a higher- z analog of “Hanny’s Voorwerp.” However, its uniformly low [O iii ]/[O ii ] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, Hubble Space Telescope and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral “arm.” Spectral energy distribution fitting suggests the (2–6) × 10 10 M ⊙ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the “arm,” and has <5% luminosity contribution from AGNs, consistent with X-ray nondetection and the radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster’s emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the nondetection of the H β line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent (<10 8 yr) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ( L bol ∼ 1 × 10 42 erg s −1 ). While Oxyster’s nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrowband imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.},

  abstract     = {Type IIn supernovae (SNe) resembling SN 2009ip (09ip-like SNe) originate from the interaction between circumstellar material (CSM) and the ejecta. This subclass not only shares similar observational properties around the maximum but is also commonly characterized by a long-duration precursor before its maximum. Investigating the observed properties of the precursor provides constraints on the mass-loss history of the progenitor. We present observational data of SN 2023vbg, an 09ip-like type IIn SN that displayed unique observational properties compared to other 09ip-like SNe. SN 2023vbg showed a long-duration precursor at M g ∼ −14 mag lasting for ∼100 days, followed by a bright bump at M g ∼ −17 mag at 12–25 days before the maximum. The luminosity of the precursor is similar to those of other 09ip-like SNe, but the bright bump has not been observed in other cases. After reaching the peak luminosity, the light curve exhibited a relative smooth decline. While the H α profile displays two velocity components (∼500 and 3000 km s −1 ), a broad component observed in other 09ip-like SNe was not seen, but it may emerge later. We suggest that these properties are explained by the difference in the CSM structure as compared to other 09ip-like SNe; SN 2023vbg had an inner denser CSM component, as well as generally smooth CSM density distribution in a more extended scale than in the others. Such diversity of CSM likely reflects the diversity of pre-SN outbursts, which in turn may mirror the range of evolutionary pathways in the final stages of the progenitors.},

  abstract     = {The active suppression of star formation in galaxies is critical for preventing the growth of overly massive systems and explaining the formation of present-day elliptical galaxies. We present a high-resolution, spatially resolved, multiwavelength study of two z ∼ 0.7 massive post-starburst galaxies, SDSS J1448+1010 and SDSS J2258+2313, from the Studying Quenching in Intermediate- z Galaxies: Gas, angu \overrightarrow{L} ar momentum, and Evolution (SQuIGG \overrightarrow{L} E) survey, providing new insights into the role of mergers in driving quenching. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO(2–1) observations show that both galaxies removed ∼50% of their molecular gas into extended tidal tails, spanning up to 65 kpc, following recent mergers. Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 imaging and grism spectroscopy show that while SDSS J1448+1010 exhibits H α emission in its northern tidal tail consistent with ongoing star formation, SDSS J2258+2313 lacks detectable star-forming activity outside the central galaxy. Very Large Array 6 GHz continuum data reveal compact radio emission in SDSS J2258+2313, while SDSS J1448+1010 hosts small radio jets indicative of active galactic nucleus activity. Both galaxies retain substantial molecular gas reservoirs in their central regions, which appear more turbulent than “normal” star-forming galaxies, likely contributing to the observed low star formation rates in the hosts. Despite the similarities in their cold gas content and tidal features, the galaxies are distinct from each other in their star formation, gas–star alignment, and radio morphology, highlighting the complexity of tidal gas removal as a quenching mechanism at intermediate redshifts.},

  abstract     = {The dynamics of star-forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star-forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson’s Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.},

  abstract     = {MeerKAT observations of the recently discovered, extremely low mass galaxy Pavo have revealed a neutral gas (H i ) reservoir that was undetected in archival H i single dish data. We measure Pavo’s H i mass as {\mathrm{log}}\,{M}_{{\mathrm{HI}}}/{M}_{\odot }=5.79\pm 0.05 , making it the lowest mass H i reservoir currently known in an isolated galaxy (with a robust distance measurement). Despite Pavo’s extreme isolation, with no known neighbor within over 700 kpc, its H i reservoir is highly disturbed. It does not show clear signs of rotation, and its center of mass is offset from the stellar body center by 320 pc, while its peak is offset by 82 pc (both in projection). Despite this disturbed morphology, Pavo still appears to be consistent with the H i size–mass relation, although it is not possible to accurately determine a suitable inclination correction. Such disturbed, offset, and disorganized H i reservoirs are predicted by simulations of low-mass, star-forming dwarfs in which supernova-driven outflows efficiently disrupt the interstellar medium after a star formation (SF) event. It is likely that we are witnessing Pavo in precisely this period, tens to a few hundred Myr after a SF episode, when internal feedback has disrupted its gas reservoir.},

  abstract     = {We present the results of astrochemical modeling of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice and gas of the prestellar core L1544 with the recently updated MONACO rate equation-based model. The model includes, in particular, nondiffusive processes, new laboratory verified chemical routes for acetaldehyde and methane ice formation, and variations of H and H 2 desorption energies depending on the surface coverage by H 2 molecules. For the first time, we simultaneously reproduce the abundances of several oxygen-bearing COMs in the gas-phase, the approximate location of the peak of methanol emission, as well as the abundance of methanol in the icy mantles of L1544. Radical–radical reactions on the grain surface between species such as CH 3 , CH 3 O, and HCO efficiently proceed nondiffusively. COMs are delivered to the gas-phase via chemical desorption amplified by the loops of H-addition/abstraction surface reactions. However, gas-phase chemical reactions as well provide a noticeable input to the formation of COMs in the gas, but not to the COMs solid-state abundances. This particularly applies for CH 3 CHO and CH 3 OCH 3 . The simulated abundances of COMs in the ice are in the range 1%–2% (for methyl formate ice) or ∼0.1% (for CH 3 CHO and CH 3 OCH 3 ) with respect to the abundance of H 2 O ice. We stress a similarity between the simulated abundances of icy COMs in L1544 and the abundances of COMs in the gas-phase of hot cores/corinos. We compare our nondiffusive model with the diffusive model and provide constraints for the species’ diffusion-to-desorption energy ratios.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we study how the abundance and dynamics of populations of disrupting satellite galaxies change systematically as a function of host galaxy properties. We apply a theoretical model of the phase-mixing process to classify intact satellite galaxies and stellar streamlike and shell-like debris in ∼1500 Milky Way–mass systems generated by a semi-analytic galaxy formation code, SatGen . In particular, we test the effect of host galaxy halo mass, disk mass, ratio of disk scale height to length, and stellar feedback model on disrupting satellite populations. We find that the counts of tidal debris are consistent across all host galaxy models, within a given host mass range, and that all models can have streamlike debris on low-energy orbits, consistent with that observed around the Milky Way. However, we find a preference for streamlike debris on lower-energy orbits in models with a thicker (lower-density) host disk or on higher-energy orbits in models with a more massive host disk. Importantly, we observe significant halo-to-halo variance across all models. These results highlight the importance of simulating and observing large samples of Milky Way–mass galaxies and accounting for variations in host properties when using disrupting satellites in studies of near-field cosmology.},

Our results indicate that Pop III TDEs significantly accelerate the growth of relatively lighter massive black holes (∼10 4 −10 5 M ⊙ ), allowing them to increase their mass by roughly an order of magnitude within the first 10 Myr. Cosmological evolution modeling further supports such Pop-III-TDE-driven growth scenarios being consistent with the formation pathways of observed luminous high-redshift quasars originating from seed black holes at 10 < z < 15. We also discuss future observational probes of these early-stage growth processes that future facilities, including space-based gravitational-wave observatories and infrared telescopes like JWST, could potentially conduct. These findings provide a clear observational framework to test the critical role of Pop III star interactions in the rapid buildup of SMBHs during the earliest epochs.},

After converting the out-axis energy relations to the in-axis situations, we find that the corresponding in-axis energy relations are universally steeper, of which all of them can be roughly interpreted by the synchrotron radiation mechanism as shown in Xu et al. Meanwhile, we notice that the in-axis means of isotropic energies are about 1 order of magnitude larger than the out-axis means for both short and long bursts except the supernova-associated GRBs. Furthermore, we apply all the newly found energy relations to construct the Hubble diagrams of out/in-axis bursts. It is found that the in-axis Hubble diagrams are better cosmological indicators.},

However, their optical emission, either from the outer accretion disk or companion surface, tends to be nearly isotropic. Based on a sample of luminous and very soft X-ray sources that are argued to be supercritical accretion systems viewed close to edge-on, we identify the optical counterparts for some of them and compare the optical properties with those of ultraluminous X-ray sources, which are supposed to be supercritical accretion systems viewed close to face-on. The optical luminosity is found in a wide range, with the absolute visual magnitude ranging from dimmer than −1.2 in some sources to about −7 in one case. Most sources show a power-law-like spectrum, while four of them display a blackbody shape. One of them shows an optical spectrum resembling a B-type main sequence, suggesting that it may be a Be white dwarf system. Strong variability in flux at timescales as short as 10 days are revealed, indicating that some of these sources are powered by accretion onto compact objects. These suggest that the luminous and very soft X-ray sources in nearby galaxies have a diverse population, and some of them are indeed consistent with emission from supercritical accretion, with consistent optical magnitudes and colors. Future optical spectroscopic observations are needed to further constrain their natures.},

Parameterizing the radial velocity profile of the MJC region with an exponential function and assuming a uniform magnetic field configuration, we show that the synchrotron radiation of the shear-accelerated electrons can produce a bright optical flash. Emission of the self-synchrotron Compton process of the electron population can result in an X-ray excess and an extra MeV–GeV gamma-ray flash relative to the Band function component in the keV–MeV band, which is attributed to the synchrotron radiation of the shock-accelerated electrons in the jet core. Our model reasonably represents the extremely bright optical flash and spectral characteristics of GRBs 990123, 080319B, and 130427A. The inferred magnetic field strength of the MJC region is above 10 5 G, potentially suggesting that the jets of these GRBs are highly magnetized.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational waves (GWs) can convert into electromagnetic waves in the presence of a magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein–Zeldovich effect. The characteristics of the magnetic field substantially affect this conversion probability. This paper confirms that strong magnetic fields in neutron stars significantly enhance the conversion probability, facilitating detectable radio signatures of very high-frequency (VHF, \left(1{0}^{6}\,\unicode{x02013}\,1{0}^{11}\,{\rm{Hz}}\right) ) GWs. We theoretically identify two distinct signatures using single-dish telescopes (FAST, TMRT, QTT, GBT) and interferometers (SKA1/2-MID): transient signals from burst-like GW sources and persistent signals from cosmological background GW sources. These signatures are mapped to graviton spectral lines derived from quantum field theory by incorporating spin-2 and mass constraints, resulting in smooth, featureless profiles that are critical for distinguishing GW signals from astrophysical foregrounds. FAST attains a characteristic strain bound of h c < 10 −23 , approaching 10 −24 in the frequency range of 1–3 GHz with a 6 hr observation period. This performance exceeds the 5 σ detection thresholds for GWs originating from primordial black holes and nears the limits set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Additionally, projections for SKA2-MID indicate even greater sensitivity. Detecting such GWs would improve our comprehension of cosmological models, refine the parameter spaces for primordial black holes, and function as a test for quantum field theory. This approach addresses significant deficiencies in VHF GW research, improving detection sensitivity and facilitating the advancement of next-generation radio telescopes such as FASTA and Square Kilometre Array, which feature larger fields of view and enhanced gain.},

  abstract     = {We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble [HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multiwavelength approach. E71 is located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images (250–500 μ m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the velocity range [−20, −14] km s −1 . It hosts a stellar cluster (radius ∼ 1.26 pc, distance ∼1.81 ± 0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter “m2”), along with an enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR images and molecular line maps reveal a photodissociation region surrounding “m2,” exhibiting an arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust condensations are identified along this structure. The position–velocity map of 12 CO (1–0) emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO) located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the center of E71. These findings support that “m2” has shaped an arc-like morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by “m2” and the velocity structure of the 12/13 CO (1–0) emission suggest that the stellar feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the “collect and collapse” process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.},

  abstract     = {The accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are widely considered the ideal environments for binary black hole mergers and the only plausible sites for their electromagnetic counterparts. M. J. Graham et al. (2023) identified seven AGN flares that are potentially associated with gravitational wave (GW) events detected by the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA Collaboration during the third observing run. In this article, utilizing an additional three years of Zwicky Transient Facility public data after their discovery, we conduct an updated analysis and find that only three flares can be identified. By implementing a joint analysis of optical and GW data through a Bayesian framework, we find two flares exhibit a strong correlation with GW events, with no secondary flares observed in their host AGN up to 2024 October 31. Combining these two most robust associations, we derive a Hubble constant measurement of {H}_{0}=72.{1}_{-23.1}^{+23.9}\,\mathrm{km}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}\,{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1} and incorporating the multimessenger event GW170817 improves the precision to {H}_{0}=73.{5}_{-6.9}^{+9.8}\,{\rm{km}}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}{{\rm{Mpc}}}^{-1} .

  abstract     = {Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, typically classified as repeat or nonrepeat, but their origins remain uncertain. In this work, we focus on the timing characteristics of the pulses in 536 FRBs observed by CHIME with improved pulse-finding and fitting algorithms. The results show that the fitted mean of rise time, decay time, FWHM, and minimum variable timescale distributions for the repeat FRBs are larger. Furthermore, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test reveals significant differences (>5 σ ) for some parameters between repeat and nonrepeat FRBs, implying that the former may have more stable and longer-lived sources (e.g., magnetars). However, we do not find significant differences in waiting times, which may be a limitation of the sample. We also investigate the relationship between these parameters, identifying some correlations, e.g., a negative power-law correlation between pulse amplitude and FWHM. Our findings suggest that the repeat and nonrepeat FRBs originate from different progenitors, environments, and/or emission mechanisms. Interestingly, both of their observations do not contradict that they originate from within the magnetosphere of a magnetar.},

J164653.72+243942.2 ( z em ∼ 3.04) shows variable C iv λλ 1548,1551 absorption at speeds larger than 0.1 c , accompanied by Si iv , N v, and Ly α , and disappearing absorption at lower speeds. We perform absorption measurements using the apparent optical depth method and SimBAL. We find the absorption to be very broad (Δ v ∼  35,100 km s −1 in the first epoch and 13,000 km s −1 in the second one) and fast ( v max ∼  –50,200 km s −1 and −49,000 km s −1 , respectively). We measure large column densities ( {\mathrm{log}}\,{N}_{{\rm{H}}}\,\gt 21.6 (cm −2 )) and are able to place distance estimates for the EHVO (5 ≲ R ≲ 28 pc) and the lower-velocity outflow (7 ≲ R ≲ 540 pc). We estimate a mass outflow rate for the EHVO to be {\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{out}}\sim 50\mbox{--}290\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1} and a kinetic luminosity of {\mathrm{log}}\,\,{L}_{\mathrm{KE}}\sim 46.5\mbox{--}47.2\,(\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}) in both epochs. The lower-velocity component has a mass outflow rate {\dot{M}}_{\mathrm{out}}\sim 10\mbox{--}790\,{M}_{\odot }\,{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1} and a kinetic luminosity of {\mathrm{log}}\,\,{L}_{\mathrm{KE}}\sim 45.3\mbox{--}47.2\,(\mathrm{erg}\,{{\rm{s}}}^{-1}) . We find that J164653.72+243942.2 is not an outlier among EHVO quasars in regard to its physical properties. While its column density is lower than typical BAL values, its higher outflow velocities drive most of the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity. These results emphasize the crucial role of EHVOs in powering quasar feedback, and failing to account for these outflows likely leads to underestimating the feedback impact on galaxies.},

Using an automated matched-kernel convolution method with adaptive signal-to-noise thresholds, we identify 101,487 C iv systems in the redshift range 1.4 < z < 4.5 from 300,637 quasar spectra. Completeness is estimated via Monte Carlo simulations, and the catalog is 50% complete at EW C IV ≥ 0.4 Å. The differential equivalent width frequency distribution declines exponentially and shows weak redshift evolution. The absorber incidence per unit comoving path increases by a factor of 2–5 from z ≈ 4.5 to z ≈ 1.4, with stronger redshift evolution for strong systems. Using column densities derived from the apparent optical depth method, we constrain the cosmic mass density of C iv , Ω C IV , which increases by a factor of ∼3.8 from (0.82 ± 0.05) × 10 −8 at z ≈ 4.5 to (3.16 ± 0.2) × 10 −8 at z ≈ 1.4. From Ω C IV , we estimate a lower limit on intergalactic medium metallicity {\mathrm{log}}({Z}_{{\rm{IGM}}}/{Z}_{\odot })\gtrsim -3.25 at z ∼ 2.3, with a smooth decline at higher redshifts. These trends trace the cosmic star formation history and He ii photoheating rate, suggesting a link between C iv enrichment, star formation, and UV background over ∼3 Gyr.

  abstract     = {The radical hydrocarbon molecule C 2 H is widely detected in various stages of star and planet formation, and has emerged as a useful tracer of high-C/O gas within the photochemically active surface layers of mature (Class II) protoplanetary disks. However, the chemistry and evolution of C 2 H within younger (Class 0/I) protostars remains much more poorly understood. Here, using data observed as part of the PEACHES survey along with new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Atacama Compact Array observations, we investigate the C 2 H emission toward an unbiased sample of 35 Class 0/I low-mass protostars in Perseus. With this large sample, we identify a clear association between C 2 H emission and the protostellar outflow cavity walls, and a consistent spatial anticorrelation between C 2 H and SO emission. Together, these trends confirm that C 2 H is tracing photochemically active, O-poor gas in these younger sources. We fitted the C 2 H spectra with a simple LTE model to yield column density maps, and find values ranging from 10 14 to 10 15 cm −2 in these sources. We also looked for trends in the C 2 H emission morphology as a function of various protostellar evolutionary metrics, but find no clear patterns; the C 2 H emission remains spatially extended in most sources, independent of age. This indicates that the transition to the compact C 2 H emission observed on the surfaces of Class II disks must happen rapidly, sometime just after the embedded stage.},

  abstract     = {The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes. TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ( z ≲ 1), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST’s NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We outline a methodology for identifying high- z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging the unique spectral energy distributions and morphologies of these transients. While focused on TDEs, this methodology could also be applied to find other UV-bright transients, such as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate a photometric redshift of z\,=\,5.0{2}_{-1.11}^{+1.32} . HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or active galactic nuclei models. However, an SLSN at z ≳ 3 can also plausibly explain this transient and would be the highest-redshift SLSN yet known. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift Universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with the JWST and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at z > 4 and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.},

  abstract     = {We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to 1 yr after explosion. We find that, when compared to two preexisting model grids, the bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of MESA+STELLA single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ( {E}_{{\rm{\exp }}}\approx 7\times 1{0}^{50} erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor (≳16.5 M ⊙ ) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope (≲3 M ⊙ ) at the time of explosion, with a radius ≳950 R ⊙ and a synthesized 56 Ni mass of ≈0.068 M ⊙ . We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf’s progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.},

  abstract     = {The detection of gravitational waves has brought to light a population of binary black holes that merge within a Hubble time. Multiple formation channels can contribute to this population, making it difficult to definitively associate particular population features with underlying stellar physics. Black hole spins are considered an important discriminator between various channels, but they are less well measured than masses, making conclusive astrophysical statements using spins difficult thus far. In this paper, we consider the distribution of the effective inspiral spin χ eff —a quantity much better measured than individual component spins. We show that non-Gaussian features like skewness, asymmetry about zero, and multimodality can naturally arise in the χ eff distribution when multiple channels contribute to the population. Searching for such features, we find signs of skewness and asymmetry already in the current catalogs, but no statistically significant signs of bimodality. These features provide robust evidence for the presence of a subpopulation with spins preferentially aligned to the binary’s orbital angular momentum; and we conservatively estimate the fraction of this subpopulation to be at least 12%–17% (at 90% credibility). Our models do not find a sharp excess of nonspinning systems and instead find that at least ∼20% of the binaries have some degree of negative χ eff . The data also suggest that, if preferentially aligned mergers form a significant fraction of the population, they must have small spins.},

  abstract     = {We present a multiepoch spectroscopic study of the broad absorption line (BAL) quasar J115636.82+085628.9 ( z em = 2.1077), based on five spectra spanning nearly two decades in the observer’s frame. This source exhibits remarkable variability in both low-ionization (LoBAL: Al iii and Mg ii ) and high-ionization (HiBAL: C iv and Si iv ) absorption features. For the first time, we detect the emergence and subsequent disappearance of LoBAL troughs at high velocities (∼20,000 km s −1 ), coinciding with the strengthening and weakening of the corresponding HiBAL absorption. The C iv BAL profile extends from ∼6700 km s −1 to a conservative upper limit of 30,000 km s −1 and is composed of narrow, variable absorption features embedded within a broad, smooth envelope. Both C iv and Si iv BAL troughs exhibit dramatic equivalent width (EW) changes—among the most extreme reported to date. Notably, these EW variations are strongly anticorrelated with continuum flux changes inferred from optical photometric light curves. We interpret this variability as the result of a new absorbing flow transiting into our line of sight, increasing the shielding of a more distant, preexisting outflow and giving rise to transient LoBAL absorption. This scenario supports a unified picture in which LoBAL and HiBAL features arise from similar outflow structures, with observed differences governed primarily by line-of-sight column densities consistent with previous findings.},

In comparison to disk models with constant forced eccentricities, negative eccentricity gradient models broaden disk widths at pericenter versus apocenter, and increase disk surface densities at apocenter versus pericenter, both of which are seen in the Fomalhaut disk, and which we collectively term “Eccentric Velocity Divergence.” We propose single-planet architectures consistent with the model and investigate the stability of the disk over 440 Myr to planet–disk interactions via N -body modeling. We find that Fomalhaut’s ring eccentricity plausibly formed during the protoplanetary disk stage, with subsequent planet–disk interactions responsible for carving the disk morphology.},

However, the multiscale periodic variations, in particular the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBOs), of solar active regions are not fully understood. In the present study, the flux, area, and number of solar active regions, as well as the sunspot number data in the period from 1996 May to 2023 November, are studied in detail. The multiscale periodic components in the above four data sets are investigated by the techniques of ensemble empirical mode decomposition and cross-correlation analysis. The main results are as follows. (1) The four data sets exhibit similar periodic components, including the 11 yr Schwabe cycle, the QBOs, and a Rieger-type period. (2) The multiscale periodicity of solar active regions shows different physical characteristics. Under different periodic scales, the highest correlation is between active region flux and area, indicating that active region flux and area better reflect the evolution of active regions. (3) By superimposing the QBOs on the 11 yr Schwabe cycle, the Gnevyshev gap phenomenon was clearly observed, implying that the Gnevyshev gap may be caused by the modulation of the 11 yr Schwabe cycle. (4) The active region flux in both hemispheres shows similar periodic components to the full disk, but the periodic variations are uneven between the northern and southern hemispheres. The results of our analysis could be beneficial for the understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of solar active regions, and could also provide statistical constraints on solar dynamo theories.},

  abstract     = {Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback plays a vital role in shaping the formation and evolution of galaxies through their interaction with magnetohydrodynamic waves. In the CR self-confinement scenario, the waves are generated by the CR gyroresonant instabilities via CR streaming or CR pressure anisotropy and saturate by balancing wave damping. The resulting effective particle scattering rate by the waves, ν eff , critically sets the coupling between the CRs and background gas, but the efficiency of CR feedback is yet poorly constrained. We employ 1D kinetic simulations under the magnetohydrodynamic-particle-in-cell framework with the adaptive δ f method to quantify ν eff for the saturated state of the CR pressure anisotropy instability with ion-neutral friction. We drive CR pressure anisotropy by expanding/compressing the box, mimicking the background evolution of magnetic field strength, and the CR pressure anisotropy eventually reaches a quasi-steady state by balancing quasi-linear diffusion. At the saturated state, we measure ν eff and the CR pressure anisotropy level, establishing a calibrated scaling relation with environmental parameters. The scaling relation is consistent with quasi-linear theory and can be incorporated to CR fluid models, in either the single-fluid or p -by- p treatments. Our results serve as a basis for accurately calibrating the subgrid physics in macroscopic studies of CR feedback and transport.},

Previously, this PWN was estimated to have an age of ≳8 kyr, contain a candidate pulsar detected in X-rays, and have a distance of ∼6 kpc. More importantly, and related to the PWN’s possible neutrino emission, surrounding molecular materials are seen to interact with the PWN. On the basis of these properties, we examine the proton–proton interactions as the process for the neutrino production. The PWN (or the pulsar) can provide sufficient energy to power the required high-energy (HE) protons. This possibly first neutrino-emitting case in our Galaxy, with problems or other possibilities to be solved or examined, may reveal to us that PWNe are the significant Galactic HE neutrino sources.},

  abstract     = {Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are close interacting binaries in which a white dwarf accretes materials from a low-mass main-sequence companion. CVs can experience nova eruptions due to low mass transfer rates. In the standard theory of CV evolution, the ejected materials during nova eruptions are assumed to leave the system in the form of fast, isotropic, optically thick winds, which predicts that novae only result in positive variation (expansion) of the orbital period (i.e., positive Δ P ). In addition, the angular momentum losses (magnetic braking and gravitational radiation) only predict a steady long-term decay in the orbital period of CVs, i.e., \dot{P} is negative. Interestingly, an observation lasting over 30 yr reveals positive and negative values for both Δ P and \dot{P} in CVs, strongly conflicting with the standard evolutionary patterns. However, it cannot be excluded that these observations originate from short-term phenomena caused by nova eruptions because of a short timescale of observations. In this paper, we model the effect of instantaneous nova eruptions on the evolution of CVs, considering three mechanisms associated with mass loss in nova eruptions, including fast wind, the Frank jet, and binary-driven mass loss. By assuming that the observed Δ P and \dot{P} are dominated by short-term phenomena, our results show that the binary-driven mass loss can explain almost all of the observations of normal CVs. However, the Frank jet may be needed for some long-period CVs with evolved companions.},

  abstract     = {Bars are one of the most prominent galactic structures. The classical swing-amplification theory can qualitatively describe the spontaneous bar instability of stellar disks. Still, it cannot quantify the bar formation process or explain why some disk galaxies do not have a bar. Recent studies found that the bar formation timescale depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction of the host galaxy (dubbed as “Fujii relation”), but they only explored a limited parameter space, where the physical effects of Toomre Q (local disk stability parameter) and disk scale height of the host galaxies are not fully explored. In this work, we check the robustness of the Fujii relation in a higher-dimensional parameter space of disk mass fraction, Toomre Q , and scale height. We find that the Fujii relation holds for disk galaxies with physically reasonable Toomre Q and scale height. Furthermore, the bar formation timescale also approximately linearly depends on both Toomre Q and scale height, with a more prolonged bar formation in a hotter or thicker disk. We propose an empirical relation to combine the dependency of the bar formation timescale on the three parameters. Based on the empirical relation and recent observations, we estimate that the bar formation timescale in pure stellar disks ranges from 0.2{0}_{-0.06}^{+0.09} to 12.2{0}_{-2.80}^{+3.37} Gyr or even significantly beyond the Hubble timescale in some extreme cases.},

The classification pipeline demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD preprocessing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our pipeline also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a subminute-to-minute light curve, providing information on its short-timescale variability. This automated pipeline for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.},

  abstract     = {An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modeling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the “Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model”), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalized cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep “transition-range” spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron–ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a “winner takes all” picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.},

We present a comprehensive study of the early evolution of binaries within AGN disks as their orbits are influenced by the surrounding gas, focusing on eccentric and unequal-mass binaries. Nearly equal-mass binaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: Prograde binaries inspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped; retrograde binaries inspiral ∼2–3 times faster than their prograde counterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly toward near-unity eccentricities. However, the primaries in retrograde binaries with mass ratios of m 2 / m 1 ≲ 0.4 experience significantly weaker headwinds and retain substantial accretion disks that help damp binary eccentricities, slowing binary inspirals. Additionally, we find that while accretion drives prograde binaries toward equal masses thanks to the exchange of material between the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are driven slowly toward more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and generally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple e -folding timescales before merger. On the other hand, high-mass-ratio retrograde binaries may merge before accreting substantially, potentially approaching merger with detectable eccentricity. Future ground-based GW observatories, with their broader frequency coverage, should be particularly useful for studying these populations.},

We identify three or more distinct galaxies within II ZW 096, revealing rotational patterns and complex interactions consistent with a collapsing small galaxy group. The kinematics and ionization structures suggest high star formation rates and shock-driven processes, which align with this proposed scenario.

  abstract     = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has opened a window on many new puzzles in the early Universe, including a population of high-redshift star clusters with extremely high stellar surface density, suggesting unique star formation conditions in the Universe’s early evolution. We study the formation and evolution of these first star clusters and galaxies using an AREPO cosmological simulation box designed to resolve the intricate environments of the smallest halos hosting Population III star clusters at z ≥ 12. Our approach, which prioritizes baryonic structure identification through a friends-of-friends algorithm, provides new insights into early star cluster formation and delivers predictions directly relevant to observations. We investigate the dynamical properties of these first star clusters and use numerical and analytical methods to understand the populations of virialized and nonvirialized systems. Our findings indicate that high- z star clusters in a feedback-free regime can achieve extreme surface densities, consistent with the systems detected by JWST. These results imply that JWST may have the opportunity to uncover stellar systems at high redshift whose dynamical state preserves evidence of the hierarchical structure formation process.},

The Hanle effect in the core of Mg II k enables access to a regime of field strengths where the Zeeman effect has little diagnostic value (especially at the solar poles, where most of the field is transverse to the line of sight). Synthetic Stokes spectra computed from a radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a CH emulating a high viewing angle are inverted with the HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code, which accounts for the physical processes that lead to scattering-induced polarization and its modification due to the magnetic field and other symmetry-breaking mechanisms. We find that, while degeneracies in the atmospheric model lead to poor inferences of the thermodynamical properties, the magnetic inferences are highly consistent with the model values. The mean magnetic field strength in the simulation cube is typically retrieved with a relative error of δB ∼ 20% and an absolute error of Δ B ∼ 2 G at the top of the chromosphere. This opens up an avenue for promising chromospheric constraints for magnetic extrapolation models that ingest photospheric magnetograms, whose biases and uncertainties are troublesome to the reconstruction of the heliospheric magnetic field.},

We used Absorption Line Fitter ( ALF ), Python Stellar Absorption Feature Fitting ( PyStaff ), Starlight, and Penalized PiXel-Fitting ( pPXF) to fit a set of optical+near-IR spectroscopic data from the Magellan telescope of the two brightest galaxies in the Fornax cluster, NGC 1399 and NGC 1404. By fitting the same data set with the same models, we can compare the radial trends (out to ∼1 R e ) of IMF slope, age, metallicity, and 19 elemental abundances when allowed with the four codes. To further test the robustness of our analysis, we carried out parallel simulations by creating inputs with different star formation history (SFH) complexity. The results from simulations show that codes such as ALF and PyStaff , which both assume a simple stellar population (SSP), return greater precision and accuracy only when the underlying population is a pure SSP; however, in cases where the SFH is more complex, these codes return erroneous results. Although codes like Starlight and pPXF , which retrieve the best-fit SFH without prior assumptions, tend to produce results with greater scatter and bias, they are generally more reliable in identifying secondary components. Our analysis on the two targets shows that ALF and PyStaff , which assume an SSP, give results pointing to a single old age, a decreasing metallicity with radius, and a flat super-Salpeter IMF. In contrast, Starlight and pPXF suggest the presence of a secondary component with different metallicity and IMF characteristics.},

Previous studies (M15, M92, and NGC 2298) have shown r -process dispersion in varying amounts, hinting at the source of the r -process in those clusters. We extend these dispersion studies to the more metal-rich cluster M5 by studying the rare-earth peak, specifically the elements Ba, Nd, and Eu. We separately analyze the different stellar generations, as traced by the abundance of Na and O. Based on the Nd and Eu abundances, we report a tenuous detection of r -process dispersion that is dependent on the generation and element. Based on a log-likelihood dispersion study accounting for measurement errors, Nd has an intrinsic first-generation abundance spread of {\sigma }_{1{\rm{G}}}(\,\rm{Nd}\,)=0.1{5}_{-0.07}^{+0.10} and a 2 σ upper limit on the second-generation spread of σ 2G (Nd) < 0.28. The upper limits on the Eu intrinsic spread are σ 1G (Eu) < 0.34 and σ 2G (Eu) < 0.16. A potential dispersion implies the cluster gas was inhomogeneously polluted, either due to an event concurrent with the formation of the cluster or due to clouds of disparate composition that coalesced to form the cluster.},

  abstract     = {We present the properties of a nuclear star cluster (NSC) in the low-surface-brightness galaxy AGC 223218. The disk of the galaxy can be modeled using two Sérsic components with distinct central positions: one representing the inner bright disk and the other corresponding to the extended outer disk. We estimate the stellar masses of the NSC and the host galaxy using two methods: spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting and mass-to-light versus color relations (MLCRs). The stellar mass ratio of the NSC to AGC 223218 is 0.094 based on the SED method and 0.072 using MLCRs. The NSC presents a younger stellar population and a lower [Fe/H] value than the host, as determined from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and LAMOST spectra analysis using pPXF fitting. AGC 223218 is located at the boundary between the Seyfert and star-forming regions in the [S II ]-Baldwin–Phillips–Terlevich (BPT) diagram, whereas in the [N II ]-BPT diagram, it falls in the track of star-forming SDSS galaxies. This suggests the presence of strong shocks in AGC 223218. We propose that the NSC in AGC 223218 may have formed as a result of a merger event. Furthermore, the observed X-ray luminosity of AGC 223218 with eROSITA is 2 orders of magnitude higher than the expected X-ray luminosity from X-ray binaries, suggesting the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the NSC. To account for the observed X-ray luminosity, we estimate the IMBH accretion rate to be approximately 0.001.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we apply a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) within the PKDGRAV N -body integrator to investigate the formation of planetesimal systems through the gravitational collapse of clouds of superparticles. Previously published numerical models have demonstrated that the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds is an efficient pathway to produce binary planetesimal systems. However, such investigations were limited by their use of a perfect-merger and inflated-radii superparticle approach, which inhibits any analysis of planetesimal shapes and spin states, precludes the formation of the tightest binary orbits, and produces significantly underdense planetesimals. The SSDEM enables superparticles to rest upon each other through mutual surface penetration and by simulating contact physics. Superparticles do not need to be inflated, and collisions are not treated as perfect mergers; we can thus track the evolution of planetesimal shapes, spins, and tight binary orbits. We demonstrate that the SSDEM is an excellent method to model the collapse process, and is capable of producing many binary planetesimal systems from a single cloud. The most massive systems often exhibit low-inclination ( i ≲ 15°) and moderately eccentric ( e ≲ 0.40) orbits within a tight range of semimajor axes normalized by their Hill radii ( a / R Hill ∼ 0.02–0.15). Conversely, less massive planetesimal systems display a wider range of eccentricities and inclinations and maintain a wider range of a / R Hill (0.15 to ≥0.50). These results confirm the findings of previously published perfect-merging models while also producing novel results about planetesimal spin and shape properties. Newly formed planetesimals exhibit 10 hr rotation periods on average and can be characterized by a wide variety of shapes (spherical, oblate, top-shaped, flattened, egg-shaped, or prolate), with the most massive planetesimals primarily forming as spheres and oblate spheroids.},

  abstract     = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are powered by the radioactive decay of isotopes such as 56 Ni and 56 Co, making their γ -ray spectra useful probes of the explosion mechanism and ejecta structure. Accurate interpretation of γ -ray observables, including line ratios and continuum fluxes, requires a detailed understanding of the microphysical processes that shape the spectra. One such process is positronium formation during electron–positron annihilation, which can redistribute flux from the 511 keV line into the surrounding continuum. To assess the impact of positronium on the emergent spectra, we developed a new open-source module, tardis-He , for time-dependent three-dimensional γ -ray transport, integrated into the radiative transfer code tardis . The code simulates γ -ray spectra and light curves from one-dimensional supernova ejecta models and allows for flexible incorporation of decay chains and opacity treatments. Using tardis-He , we explore the effect of positronium formation by varying the positronium fraction from 0% to 100%, and assuming an extreme case where 75% of positronium decays result in three-photon emission. We find that full positronium formation can reduce the 511 keV line flux by ≈70% and modestly enhance energy deposition by up to 2% at around 100 days postexplosion, compared to models without positronium. These results demonstrate that, while the effect is not dominant, positronium formation introduces measurable changes to γ -ray observables. Future observations with missions such as the Compton Spectrometer and Imager may offer constraints on positronium formation in SNe Ia and help refine models of their radioactive energy transport.},

This focusing term leads to the effect of convection, but it also alters the parallel spatial diffusion coefficient. Over the past few decades researchers have tried to derive analytical forms for the parallel diffusion coefficient as a function of the focusing length. Two different results have been derived contradicting each other. In the current paper we revisit this problem and provide the final solution. We combine previously developed numerical methods such as the subspace approach, allowing us to compute the parallel diffusion coefficient as a function of the focusing length with very high precision within a very short computational time. Most importantly, we derive an exact formula for the diffusion coefficient by employing analytical theory. The new formula agrees perfectly with the numerically obtained results proofing its validity.},

In this paper, we use the Illustris , IllustrisTNG 100, and IllustrisTNG 300 simulations to compare how different stellar aperture masses trace halo mass. For massive central galaxies ( M ⋆ ≥ 10 11.2 M ⊙ ), we find that a 2D outskirt stellar mass measured between 50 and 100 kpc ( M ⋆,[50,100] ) consistently outperforms other aperture-based stellar masses. We further show that M ⋆,[50,100] correlates better with halo mass than the total mass of accreted stars (the ex situ mass), which suggests that not all accreted stars connect to halo assembly equally. While the galaxy formation recipes differ between Illustris and IllustrisTNG 100, the two simulations yield consistent ex situ outskirt fractions for massive galaxies (∼70% in M ⋆,[50,100] ).

In the case of NGC 3516, a nearby Seyfert 1 galaxy, these AGN winds have historically proven difficult to disentangle from galactic rotation. Using long-slit spectroscopy at multiple position angles from Hubble Space Telescope’s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Apache Point Observatory’s Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, we separate these kinematic components by fitting multiple Gaussians to the H α , [N II ], H β , and [O III ] emission lines along the slits. We present a biconical outflow model that agrees well with the observed kinematics of the outflowing gas in the narrow-line region (NLR). Our results indicate that the structure of the [O III ] emission is explained by dusty gas spirals in the galactic disk that are illuminated by the ionizing bicone, which is viewed along one edge, resulting in the complex nuclear kinematics. Our view into the bicone edge is consistent with the multiple, deep components of ionized absorption lines seen in UV and X-ray spectra of NGC 3516. The observed turnover in the velocity of the NLR clouds matches that from a simple dynamical model of radiative acceleration by the AGN and gravitational deceleration by the AGN and galaxy, indicating they are the principal forces at work on the gas clouds. Finally, the model launch radii indicate that the outflowing clouds originate primarily from the inner dusty spirals near the AGN.},

Most stars with no overabundance in r -process elements, as well as the strongly r -process-enhanced (RPE) r -II stars ([Eu/Fe] > +0.7), are formed in dwarf galaxies accreted by the Milky Way within the 6 Gyr after the Big Bang. In contrast, over half of the moderately enhanced r -I stars (+0.3 < [Eu/Fe] ≤ +0.7) are formed in the main in situ disk after 6 Gyr. Our results suggest that the fraction of r -I and r -II stars formed in disrupted dwarf galaxies is larger the higher their [Eu/Fe] is. Accordingly, the most strongly enhanced r -III stars ([Eu/Fe] > +2.0) are formed in accreted components. These results suggest that non- r -process-enhanced stars and r -II stars are mainly formed in low-mass dwarf galaxies that hosted either none or a single neutron star merger, while the r -I stars tend to form in the well-mixed in situ disk. We compare our findings with high-resolution spectroscopic observations of RPE metal-poor stars in the halo and dwarf galaxies, including those collected by the R -Process Alliance.

  abstract     = {Tidal synchronization plays a fundamental role in the evolution of binary star systems. However, key details such as the timescale of synchronization, efficiency of tidal dissipation, rotation period, and dependence on stellar mass are not well constrained. We present a catalog of rotation periods, orbital periods, and eccentricities from eclipsing binaries (EBs) that can be used to study the role of tides in the rotational evolution of low-mass dwarf (FGKM spectral type) binaries. This study presents the largest catalog of EB orbital and rotational periods ( P orb and P rot ) measured from the Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS). We first classify 4584 light curves from the TESS EB catalog according to out-of-eclipse stellar variability type: starspot modulation, ellipsoidal variability, nonperiodic variability, and “other” variability (e.g., pulsations). We then manually validate each light curve’s classification, resulting in a sample of 1039 candidates with 584 high-confidence EBs that exhibit detectable starspot modulation. From there, we measure and compare the rotation period of each starspot-modulated EB using three methods: a Lomb–Scargle periodogram, autocorrelation function, and phase dispersion minimization. We find that our period distributions are consistent with previous work that used a sample of 816 starspot EBs from Kepler to identify two populations: a synchronous population (with P orb ≈ P rot ), and a subsynchronous population (with 8 P orb ≈ 7 P rot ). Using Bayesian model comparison, we find that a bimodal distribution is a significantly better fit than a unimodal distribution for the Kepler and TESS samples, both individually or combined, confirming that the subsynchronous population is statistically significant.},

However, there exists a diversity in galaxy morphologies at a fixed stellar mass and star formation rate. In this study, using spatially resolved properties from the MaNGA final data release, we classify MS galaxies into late type (MS-late) and early type (MS-early). In addition, we further divide the MS-early galaxies into two distinct subgroups based on their internal star formation and stellar mass distributions within the galaxies. The first group—“MS-early_SF”—shows centrally concentrated star formation without prominent stellar bulges and resides preferentially in dense environments, suggesting environmentally driven evolution. The second group—“MS-early_stellar”—exhibits significant stellar bulges with suppressed central star formation, maintains disk-like star formation patterns, and inhabits environments similar to those of late-type galaxies, indicating evolution through internal secular processes. Our findings demonstrate that spatially resolved observations play critical roles in revealing the diverse evolutionary pathways hidden within galaxies that share similar global properties.},

The method utilizes an encoder–decoder network architecture and combines the telescope’s point-spread function or beam as prior information, while integrating Fast Fourier Transform–accelerated convolution techniques into the deep learning network. This enables the effective removal of beam effects from astronomical observation images. PI-AstroDeconv can handle multiple point-spread functions or beams, tolerate imprecise measurements to some extent, and significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of image deconvolution. Therefore, this architecture is particularly suitable for astronomical data processing that does not rely on annotated data. To validate the reliability of the architecture, we used the Square Kilometre Array Science Data Challenge 3a data sets and compared it with the CLEAN deconvolution method at the 21 cm power spectrum level. The results demonstrate that our algorithm not only restores details and reduces blurriness in celestial images at the pixel level, but also more accurately recovers the true neutral hydrogen power spectrum at the power spectrum level.},

The study examines the evolution of 10 morphological parameters that serve as indicators of pre-eruptive conditions—not only at the photosphere but also in higher layers of the solar atmosphere. We found that active regions with a greater number of parameters exceeding their threshold values at higher altitudes tend to exhibit a higher eruptive potential. Specifically, in active regions associated with X-class flares and fast CMEs, at least 8 out of 10 parameters exceeded their thresholds at elevated layers, whereas in the 2 active regions linked to M-class flares and fast CMEs, fewer than 7 parameters did so. These results suggest that assessing the height-dependent behavior of pre-eruptive proxy parameters could significantly improve the identification and prediction of eruptive active regions. Future studies should extend this approach to a larger data set to better determine the maximum atmospheric height at which the predictive thresholds of different parameters are met, thereby enhancing the accuracy of solar eruption prediction.},

  abstract     = {We present new results from the ASTRID simulation from z = 3 to z = 0.5, covering the epoch of cosmic noon. The galaxy stellar mass function, as well as the black hole mass and luminosity functions in ASTRID , exhibit good agreement with recent observational constraints. We study the M BH – M * scaling relation and its connections to active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity, galaxy color, and star formation rate, demonstrating that AGN feedback plays a crucial role in the quenching of massive galaxies ( M * > 10 10.5 M ⊙ ). Although AGN feedback ultimately suppresses star formation through quenching, AGN-host galaxies can still exhibit statistically higher star formation rates than inactive ones, reflecting a positive correlation driven by their shared dependence on a common cold gas reservoir. The fraction of quiescent galaxies in ASTRID increases with both galaxy mass and redshift evolution, aligning well with observational trends. We find that different quenching mechanisms can leave distinct morphological imprints on quenched galaxies. Massive, compact quiescent galaxies typically experience shorter quenching timescales, have younger central regions, and host overmassive black holes. This is usually due to a compaction-like quenching mechanism that funnels gas into the galactic center, leading to starbursts and triggering AGN kinetic feedback. In contrast, quiescent galaxies with more diffuse morphologies generally experience “inside-out” quenching, which is characterized by older central regions compared to the outskirts. These galaxies typically experience longer quenching timescales due to quenching processes operating on a larger halo scale, which gradually deplete the galactic star-forming gas.

Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1–0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.},

In this work, we investigate Milky Way–like galaxies from the TNG50 simulation to characterize the properties, morphology, and accretion rates of the warm and hot ionized material comoving with neutral HVCs visible in H i . We find that the ionized gas forms an envelope around the neutral material, and in most cases (73% of the HVCs), it is prolate in morphology. We also find that the ionized mass is ∼6 times greater than the neutral mass, which leads to significantly more accretion being possible from the ionized gas ( {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{ion}}} ) than the neutral gas ( {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{neut}}} ), consistent with estimates made from observations of our own Galaxy. We investigate the accretion rates from both phases of HVCs around 47 Milky Way–like galaxies, finding that {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{ion}}} scales with {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{neut}}} and both scale with the star formation rate of the galaxy. Finally, we find that, on average, {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{ion}}} could account for 81% of the galactic star formation rate (assuming the material can sufficiently cool and condense), while {\dot{M}}_{{\rm{neut}}} can only balance 11%. Thus, the diffuse, ionized, high-velocity circumgalactic medium plays a defining role in the evolution and growth of galaxies at low redshift.},

The orbit is also likely to play a role in shaping the response of a planetary atmosphere to the influx of material from an icy cometary impact. To investigate this response, we model the impact of an icy cometary body with an Earth-analog exoplanet (i.e., an Earth-like planet orbiting a Sun-like star with a diurnal cycle) using a cometary impact and breakup model coupled with the 3D Earth system model WACCM6/CESM2. To quantify the role that the atmospheric dynamics play in setting the response to a cometary impact, we compare our results with a previous study investigating an impact with a tidally locked terrestrial exoplanet. We find that the circulation regime of the planet plays a key role in shaping the response of the atmosphere to an icy cometary impact. The weak multicelled circulation structure that forms on Earth-like planets is efficient at mixing material horizontally but not vertically, limiting the transport of water from the deep breakup site to higher altitudes. In turn, this limits the rate of water photodissociation at low pressures, reducing the magnitude of postimpact changes to composition. It also reduces the potential observability of an impact due to weakened cloud ice formation, and hence scattering, at low pressures. Despite this, small changes to the overall composition of the planet persist to a quasi steady state, reinforcing the idea that ongoing bombardment may help to shape the composition/habitability of terrestrial worlds.},

According to the physical parameters involved in this “drag-force” model, the best estimate of the dynamic viscosity of the ambient solar wind is 1.27 ± 0.98 × 10 −4 g cm −1 s −1 .

Ion moments for the core population are derived by fitting measured three-dimensional ion velocity distributions with bi-Maxwellian functions, whereas those for the total population are obtained by directly computing weighted sums over the distributions. The core population accounts for a median of approximately 80% of the total number density and dominates the bulk flow of the total population. In contrast, the total population exhibits significantly higher temperature, thermal pressure, and plasma beta, primarily due to the presence of suprathermal ions. Both populations exhibit greater temperature anisotropies downstream of quasi-perpendicular shocks compared to quasi-parallel shocks, consistent with stronger shock compression and a greater contribution from gyrating reflected ions under quasi-perpendicular conditions. Notably, the core population consistently exhibits significantly higher temperature anisotropy than the total population under both shock geometries, suggesting the presence of additional perpendicular heating mechanisms acting on the core population beyond shock compression. One plausible mechanism is stochastic energization by kinetic Alfvén waves. Overall, this systematic comparison of ion parameters between the core and total populations provides new insights into the thermodynamic structure and governing processes of the Martian magnetosheath.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the impact of dust on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is crucial for inferring their physical properties and for studying the nature and evolution of interstellar dust. In this study, we analyze dust attenuation curves of ∼6400 galaxies ( M ⋆ ∼ 10 9 –10 11.5 M ⊙ ) at z = 0.07 from the IllustrisTNG50 & TNG100 simulations. Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generate synthetic attenuation curves and fit them with a versatile parametric model that encompasses both known extinction and attenuation curves (e.g., Calzetti, MW, SMC, and LMC) and more exotic forms. We present the distributions of the best-fitting parameters—UV slope ( c 1 ), optical-to-near-IR (NIR) slope ( c 2 ), far-UV (FUV) slope ( c 3 ), 2175 Å bump strength ( c 4 ), and normalization ( A V )—accounting for scatter from orientation effects. Key correlations emerge between A V and the star formation rate surface density Σ SFR , as well as the UV slope c 1 . Furthermore, the UV and FUV slopes ( c 1 , c 3 ) and the visual attenuation and bump strength ( A V , c 4 ) exhibit robust internal correlations (anticorrelation in the latter case). The optical-to-NIR slope exhibits minimal variations. Using these insights from simulations, we provide a set of scaling relations that predict a galaxy’s median (averaged over line of sight) dust attenuation curve based solely on its Σ SFR and/or A V . These predictions agree well with observed attenuation curves from the GALEX–Sloan Digital Sky Survey–Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Legacy Catalog, although there are minor differences in bump strength. This study delivers the most comprehensive library of synthetic attenuation curves for local galaxies, and provides a foundation for physically motivated priors for SED fitting and galaxy inference studies, such as those performed as part of the Learning the Universe Collaboration.},

  abstract     = {We present initial results from a planned 10 yr survey of Ca II H and K emission, using observations made with the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. The primary goal of the survey is to investigate activity cycles in low-mass stars. The sample includes stars chosen from the legacy Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO) survey carried out by Olin Wilson more than 50 yr ago, together with newly identified planet-hosting stars and a select sample of early to mid M dwarfs. This paper presents the first 4 yr of data, comprising 1040 observations of 271 stars, with a specific focus on K and M stars. We identify a subsample of 153 stars for continuing observations over the full 10 yr survey. Early results indicate that our data are consistent with the MWO cycle periods over a time span of more than 50 yr; that there is a bifurcation in activity in the late K range with separate populations of low- and high-activity stars at lower masses; and that M dwarf planet hosts tend to be mainly found in the population of low-activity stars, even in the unbiased (by activity) TESS sample, potentially indicating a link between activity and planet formation. We have also found indications of possible cyclic variability in some of the lower-mass stars in the sample. Our ultimate goal is to link the activity cycle and rotation periods in a robust sample of stars spanning the FGKM spectral types and to investigate the implications for the underlying magnetic dynamo.},

  abstract     = {We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch , and couples it in Amuse to the preexisting modules for collisional stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts for the effects of mass transfer on the stars’ mass-loss rates, their radiation spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost through nonconservative mass transfer and CE ejection into the interstellar medium (ISM). We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples with the surrounding ISM. It increases the size of H ii regions, increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure within H ii regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution. Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by 3 orders of magnitude, resulting in H ii regions that expand due to thermal pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution, impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young star clusters.},

From optical and mid-IR oxygen emission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of oxygen, including O 3+ /H + . In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18 the high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical inhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and metal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18’s star-forming complexes having possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback effects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization density tracer, and T e ([O ii ]) derived from a temperature relationship commonly used in high- z galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and underestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion densities and estimated T e ([N ii ]). Finally, we compared O 3+ /H + abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF) against observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the O 3+ /H + abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional ionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to produce the requisite ionizing flux.},

  abstract     = {Gamma-ray bursts are expected to be generated by structured jets, whose profiles significantly impact their afterglow emission. Previously, we developed a numerical code jetsimpy , to model the afterglow of jets with arbitrary angular profiles. In this study, we extend the code to incorporate a stratified radial profile, enabling it to model jets with arbitrary axisymmetric two-dimensional structures. The radial profile leads to the formation of a reverse shock. We modeled the shock system using an energy conservation prescription, which differs from the pressure balance approach. This leads to remarkably different predictions for reverse shock emission. In particular, we find that the reverse shock emission in the thin shell case is significantly overestimated in analytic models. We also explore the off-axis reverse shock emission from structured jets, where the cores belong to thick shell cases and the wings belong to thin shell cases. We have confirmed the prediction that off-axis observers may see a thin-to-thick transition, but we find that the light curve morphology is hard to distinguish from pure thin or thick shell cases. A radial profile also introduces hydrodynamic energy injection. As such, our code can naturally apply to refreshed shock cases, where the modeling of kilonova afterglows is demonstrated as an example. To validate our method, we fit the optical flash of GRB 990123, showing good agreement with the data. The upgraded jetsimpy provides unprecedented flexibility in modeling the afterglow emission of jets with various profiles, including those derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations.},

This evolution is accompanied by an entropy increase, and the final state is characterized by a distribution function (DF) that depends only on integrals of motion (Jeans’ theorem). We present a method to constrain a gravitational potential assuming a stationary (phase mixed) sample by minimizing the entropy that the sample would have if it were allowed to phase-mix in trial potentials. This method avoids modeling the DF and is applicable to any sets of integrals. We provide expressions for the entropy of DFs depending on energy, f ( E ), energy and angular momentum, f ( E , L ), or three actions, f ( J ), and investigate the bias and statistical uncertainties in their estimates. We show that the method correctly recovers the parameters for spherical and axisymmetric potentials. We also present a methodology to characterize the posterior probability distribution of the parameters with an approximate Bayesian computation, indicating a pathway for application to observational data. Using 10 4 tracers with 10%(20%) uncertainties in the 6D coordinates, we recover the flattening parameter q of an axisymmetric potential with σ q / q ∼ 5%(10%).

NGC 55 is one of four isolated, Magellanic analogs in the Local Volume around which DELVE-DEEP aims to identify faint dwarfs and other substructures. We employ two complementary detection methods: one targets fully resolved dwarf galaxies by identifying them as stellar overdensities, while the other focuses on semiresolved dwarf galaxies, detecting them through shredded unresolved light components. As shown through extensive tests with injected galaxies, our search is sensitive to candidates down to M V ≲ −6.6 and surface brightness μ ≲ 28.5 mag arcsec 2 , and ∼80% complete down to M V ≲ −7.8. We do not report any new confirmed satellites beyond two previously known systems, ESO 294–010 and NGC 55-dw1. We construct the satellite luminosity function of NGC 55 and find it to be consistent with the predictions from cosmological simulations. As one of the first complete luminosity functions for a Magellanic analog, our results provide a glimpse of the constraints on low-mass-host satellite populations that will be further explored by upcoming surveys, such as the Vera C.

  abstract     = {We report new spectroscopic and interferometric observations of the Pleiades binary star Atlas, which played an important role nearly 3 decades ago in settling the debate over the distance to the cluster from ground-based and space-based determinations. We use the new measurements, together with other published and archival astrometric observations, to improve the determination of the 291 day orbit and the distance to Atlas (136.2 ± 1.4 pc). We also derive the main properties of the components, including their absolute masses (5.04 ± 0.17 M ⊙ and 3.64 ± 0.12 M ⊙ ), sizes, effective temperatures, projected rotational velocities, and chemical compositions. We find that the more evolved primary star is rotationally distorted, and we are able to estimate its oblateness and the approximate orientation of its spin axis from the interferometric observations. The spin axis may well be aligned with the orbital axis. Models of stellar evolution from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (or MESA) that account for rotation provide a good match to all of the primary’s global properties, and point to an initial angular rotation rate on the zero-age main sequence of about 55% of the breakup velocity. The current location of the star in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram is near the very end of the hydrogen-burning main sequence, at an age of about 105 Myr, according to these models. Our spectroscopic analysis of the more slowly rotating secondary indicates that it is a helium-weak star, with other chemical anomalies.},

  abstract     = {High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) of exoplanet atmospheres has successfully detected many chemical species and is quickly moving toward detailed characterization of the chemical abundances and dynamics. HRS is highly sensitive to the line shape and position; thus, it can detect three-dimensional (3D) effects such as winds, rotation, and spatial variation of atmospheric conditions. At the same time, retrieval frameworks are increasingly deployed to constrain chemical abundances, pressure–temperature ( P – T ) structures, orbital parameters, and rotational broadening. To explore the multidimensional parameter space, we need computationally fast models, which are consequently mostly one-dimensional (1D). However, this approach risks introducing interpretation bias since the planet’s true nature is 3D. We investigate the robustness of this methodology at high spectral resolution by running 1D retrievals on simulated observations in emission within an observational framework using 3D global circulation models of the quintessential HJ WASP-76 b. We find that the retrieval broadly recovers conditions present in the atmosphere, but that the retrieved P – T and chemical profiles are not a homogeneous average of all spatial and phase-dependent information. Instead, they are most sensitive to spatial regions with large thermal gradients, which do not necessarily coincide with the strongest emitting regions. Our results further suggest that the choice of parameterization for the P – T and chemical profiles, as well as Doppler offsets among opacity sources, impact the retrieval results. These factors should be carefully considered in future retrieval analyses.},

TDEs are being detected at an ever-increasing rate, motivating the need for accurate models of their lightcurves. The “maximum gravity” (MG) model posits that a star is completely destroyed when the tidal field of the SMBH exceeds the maximum self-gravitational field within the star, {g}_{{{\rm{\max }}}} , and predicts the peak fallback rate {\dot{M}}_{{{\rm{peak}}}} and the time to peak t peak . Here we perform hydrodynamical simulations of the complete disruption of 24 stars with masses ranging from 0.2 to 5.0 M ⊙ , at different stages of their main sequence evolution, to test the predictions of this model. We find excellent agreement between the MG model predictions and our simulations for stars near the zero-age main sequence, while the predictions are less accurate (but still within ∼35%–50% of the simulation results) for highly evolved stars. We also generalize the MG model to incorporate the Paczyński–Wiita potential to assess the impact of strong-gravity effects, which are especially important for deep encounters that are required to completely destroy evolved and centrally concentrated stars, and find good agreement with recent works that include relativistic gravity. Our results demonstrate that this model provides accurate constraints on the peak timescale of TDE lightcurves and their correlation with black hole mass.},

  abstract     = {Understanding stars and their evolution is a key goal of astronomical research and has long been a focus of human interest. In recent years, theorists have paid much attention to the final interior processes within massive stars, as they can be essential for revealing neutrino-driven supernova mechanisms and other potential transients of massive star collapse. However, it is challenging to observe directly the last hours of a massive star before explosion, since it is the supernova event that triggers the start of intense observational study. Here, we report evidence for a final phase of stellar activity known as a “shell merger,” an intense shell burning in which the O-burning shell swallows its outer C-/Ne-burning shell, deep within the progenitor’s interior moments before the supernova explosion. In the violent convective layer created by the shell merger, Ne, which is abundant in the stellar O-rich layer, is burned as it is pulled inward, and Si, which is synthesized inside, is transported outward. The remnant still preserves some traces of such Ne-rich downflows and Si-rich upflows in the O-rich layer, suggesting that inhomogeneous shell-merger mixing began just hours (≲10 4 s) before its gravitational collapse. Our results provide the first observational evidence that the final stellar burning process rapidly alters the internal structure, leaving a pre-supernova asymmetry. This breaking of spherical symmetry facilitates the explosion of massive stars and influences various supernova and remnant characteristics, including explosion asymmetries and the neutron star’s kick and spin.},

At higher redshifts, images of radio emission, cold dust, and molecular gas have suggested that (U)LIRGs at cosmic noon and even earlier may be relatively less concentrated than their z ∼ 0 counterparts. Prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), quantifying the extent of obscured star formation in (U)LIRGs at z ∼ 1 was not possible due to the low spatial resolution of previous instruments in the MIR. With JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), it is now possible. We use MIRI imaging to identify a sample of 24 LIRGs at 0.5 ≤ z ≤ 1.22 in the Systematic Mid-Infrared Legacy Extragalactic Survey and find that they are generally less centrally concentrated than their z ∼ 0 counterparts. Compared to high-mass star-forming galaxies that are not LIRGs, we find little evidence that LIRGs are more likely to be morphologically disturbed at rest-frame UV, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths at z ∼ 1. This also differs from the local counterparts where strong disturbances and major mergers are closely associated with LIRGs. These results support suggestions that smaller disturbances and perhaps even internal processes can trigger the collapse of gas clouds outside of galactic cores and cause very high levels of extended star formation at z ≳ 1.},

  abstract     = {A major open issue concerning the active Sun is the effectiveness with which magnetic reconnection accelerates electrons in flares. A paper published by Nature in 2022 used microwave observations to conclude that the Sun is an almost ideal accelerator, energizing nearly all electrons within a coronal volume to nonthermal energies. Shortly thereafter, a paper published in Astrophysical Journal Letters used hard X-ray measurements of the same event to reach the contradictory conclusion that less than 1% of the available electrons were accelerated. Here we address this controversy by using spatially resolved observations of hard X-ray emission and a spectral inversion method to determine the evolution of the electron spectrum throughout a set of flares. We use the spatial variation of the electron spectrum to deduce the density of the medium where electrons propagate and, from this and the total intensity of the flare, the ratio of accelerated to ambient electron densities. Results show that this ratio never exceeds 1% or so in all the events analyzed.},

  abstract     = {Type III radio bursts are signatures of the fluxes of near-relativistic electrons ejected during solar flares. These bursts are frequently observed by spacecraft such as the Parker Solar Probe. It has been traditionally believed that these electron beams generate Langmuir waves through the two-stream instability, which are then converted into electromagnetic waves. In this study, we revise that model, by examining how the electron distribution becomes truncated due to the “time-of-flight” effect, as the beam travels through a randomly inhomogeneous and gently varying solar wind plasma. Rather than the two-stream instability, this truncation destabilizes the distribution and leads to the generation of Langmuir waves via a linear instability; we confine our analysis to this linear regime and do not take into account the backreaction of the generated Langmuir waves on the electron distribution, which is nonlinear. The instability grows until slower electrons arrive and dampen the waves. Our qualitative analysis shows that the resulting wave intensity growth and decay closely match the intensity–time profile of observed type III radio bursts at the fundamental frequency, supporting this modified theory.},

  abstract     = {The past few years have seen the emergence of a wide array of novel techniques for analyzing high-precision data from upcoming galaxy surveys, which aim to extend the statistical analysis of galaxy clustering data beyond the linear regime and the canonical two-point (2pt) statistics. We test and benchmark some of these new techniques in a community data challenge named “Beyond-2pt,” initiated during the Aspen 2022 Summer Program “Large-Scale Structure Cosmology beyond 2-Point Statistics,” whose first round of results we present here. The challenge data set consists of high-precision mock galaxy catalogs for clustering in real space, in redshift space, and on a light cone. Participants in the challenge have developed end-to-end pipelines to analyze mock catalogs and extract unknown (“masked”) cosmological parameters of the underlying ΛCDM models with their methods. The methods represented are density-split clustering, nearest neighbor statistics, BACCO power spectrum emulator, void statistics, LEFTfield field-level inference using effective field theory (EFT), and joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using both EFT and simulation-based inference. In this work, we review the results of the challenge, focusing on problems solved, lessons learned, and future research needed to perfect the emerging beyond-2pt approaches. The unbiased parameter recovery demonstrated in this challenge by multiple statistics and the associated modeling and inference frameworks supports the credibility of cosmology constraints from these methods. The challenge data set is publicly available, and we welcome future submissions from methods that are not yet represented.},

The baryon cycle—how mass and metals reach the CGM from the inner regions of the galaxy and how gas from the CGM replenishes star-forming activity in the inner regions—is an essential question in galaxy evolution. In this paper, we study the flow of mass and metals in a stacked sample of 2770 isolated halos from the IllustrisTNG100 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The mean gas flow as a function of radius and angle is similar across a large galactic mass range when accounting for different feedback modes. Although both star formation and black holes cause powerful outflows, the flows from star formation are more angularly restricted. Black hole feedback dominates mass flow throughout the halo, while star formation feedback mainly affects the inner region. When scaling by virial radius ( R v ), large dynamical changes occur at 0.2 R v for most halos, suggesting a characteristic size for the inner galaxy. Despite kinetic-mode feedback from black holes being the primary quenching mechanism in IllustrisTNG, a small population of high-mass kinetic-mode disks are able to form stars.},

Mesoscale structures often form at the Sun, survive to 1 au, and are geoeffective. Identifying their origins, release, and acceleration mechanisms is critical to advancing heliophysics. We investigate a 6 day interval (2022 March 4 00:00:00 UT–2022 March 9 23:59:59 UT) in which Solar Orbiter (SO) was radially aligned with Earth. We characterize mesoscale structures observed in SO Heavy Ion Sensor (HIS) Fe/O and O 7+ /O 6+ in situ measurements, and confirm their survival to L1. A subset of these structures are periodic, suggesting that they formed at the Sun. We use the ADAPT-WSA model to connect in situ measurements to their remotely observed sources at the Sun. We characterize the SW sources using model-determined proxies for SW formation (e.g., the S-web). We compare Fe/O observed at SO/HIS, with S/O abundances derived by the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SO/SPICE), at the WSA-determined SW sources. We find (1) SO and ACE/Wind observe similar many-hour structures, linking mesoscale structures from their source to two well-separated locations in situ for the first time. (2) Observed periodicities are consistent with those observed in prior studies of mesoscale structures throughout the inner heliosphere. (3) SW originating from only one of the four SPICE rasters can be interpreted as plasma originating from open fields. The SW from the other three require a different interpretation, and we suggest interchange reconnection as the most natural solution.},

IHL particles are identified by carefully considering both their binding energies and positions with respect to the tidal radii of individual galaxies. By analyzing more than 1200 galaxy groups and clusters with ≳10 13 M ⊙ and tracing their individual IHL particles back in time, we classify the origin of each IHL particle at each epoch, based on the status of the originating galaxy, into one of three categories: brightest halo galaxy (BHG) formation/merger, satellite galaxy stripping, and preprocessing. Our study reveals that IHL production through BHG formation/merger is the predominant production channel, contributing over 60% of the total IHL mass across all redshifts. The second most significant IHL production channel is preprocessing, providing more than 20% in the final HR5 snapshot. Stripping is negligible at z > 4 but becomes gradually more important as the halos mature at z < 4. Finally, we verify that the IHL production through the disruption of dwarf galaxies and in situ formation is negligible, contributing less than ∼3% and ∼0.5% to the total IHL production, respectively.},

Our simulation results suggest that the disk size and mass are a few tens of astronomical units and ∼0.01 M ⊙ at 10 5 yr after protostellar formation. These values were relatively consistent with observations. The disk evolves through magnetic braking, and its radial profiles are consistent with the analytical solutions of previous studies.

In this work, we focus on seven high Eddington ratio DOGs ( {\mathrm{log}}{\lambda }_{{\rm{Edd}}}\gtrsim -0.5 ) to examine their X-ray obscuration properties using new and archival X-ray observations. We confirm that these systems are generally heavily obscured, with six out of seven having N H ≳ 10 23 cm −2 and three out of seven having N H ≳ 10 24 cm −2 . Based on the observed similarity with the rare Hot DOG population, we argue that both high- λ Edd DOGs and Hot DOGs likely trace the postmerger phase, during which AGNs are enshrouded by large columns of dust-rich material.},

Given this potential connection, we conducted deep radio observations of two nearby FBOTs (AT2018cow and CSS161010) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, but detected no FRB-like signals. Our observations establish the most stringent upper limits on millisecond radio transients from FBOTs, reaching ∼10 mJy flux density. Assuming a log-normal luminosity function analogous to the repeating FRB 121102, we constrain the burst rate from potential magnetars in FBOTs to < 0.01 hr −1 . The short ejecta escape timescale (∼2.6 yr) compared to our observation epochs (4−6 yr post-explosion) suggests that nondetection may not be attributed to FBOT’s ejecta absorption. These findings impose useful constraints on the FRB activity emanating from newborn magnetars within FBOTs. They indicate that if there is a burst phase, it is either characterized by weaker bursts, occurs less frequently compared to those in known repeating FRB sources, or takes place beyond the time frame of our current observations. To gain deeper insights into the birth-related activity of magnetars, it is of importance to conduct timely and sustained FRB searches in FBOTs that emerge in the future.},

Designing nanoparticles (NPs) to cross the BBB and deliver drugs could greatly improve the treatment of NDDs; however, current approaches to designing materials for drug delivery are generally slow. This study introduces an approach integrating information fusion, Python encoding, perturbation theory, and machine learning to predict the behaviour of NPs as drug delivery systems. Using an extensive pharmacokinetic database, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and decision tree algorithms are trained and optimised. The random forest model achieves accuracies of 95.1% and 89.7% on training and testing data, respectively. As a proof of concept for the model’s utility, four novel Fe 3 O 4 NP systems are synthesised via thermal decomposition and functionalised for water solubility. Structural, morphological, and magnetic characterisations are performed. The ML model is then applied to these synthesised NPs, with predictions identifying PMAO-coated NPs as promising candidates for BBB and neuronal cell lines. This design framework offers significant advancements in the efficient identification of promising potential NP candidates for NDDs drug delivery, enabling predictions of desirable bioactivity profiles.},

Both potentials successfully reproduce key thermophysical properties of interest, such as temperature-dependent lattice parameter, specific heat capacity, and bulk modulus. We also evaluated the energy of stoichiometric defect reactions and defect migration barriers and found close agreement with DFT predictions, demonstrating that our potentials can be used for modeling defects in UN. Additional tests provide evidence that our potentials are reliable for simulating diffusion, noble gas impurities, and radiation damage.},

  abstract     = {Olfaction—how molecules are perceived as odors to humans—is a relatively less understood sensory system compared to vision or hearing. Recently, the principal odor map (POM) was introduced to digitize the olfactory properties of single compounds. However, smells in real life are not pure single molecules, but complex mixtures of molecules, whose representations remain relatively under-explored due to limited data in olfactory mixtures. We introduce POMMix , a mixture model extension of POM which leverages mono-molecular olfactory data to build meaningful mixture representations of smells. Our model builds upon the symmetries of the problem space in a hierarchical manner: (1) graph neural networks for building mono-molecular embeddings, (2) attention mechanisms for aggregating molecular representations into mixture representations, and (3) cosine prediction heads to encode olfactory perceptual distance in the mixture embedding space. POMMix achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets. We perform comprehensive ablation studies of the components of POMMix to understand the contribution of each component. We evaluate the generalizability of the model, explore olfactory phenomena with the representations, and analyze the interpretability of the representations. Our work advances the effort to digitize olfaction, highlighting the synergy of domain expertise and deep learning in crafting mixture representations in low-data regimes.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting blood glucose dynamics is crucial for understanding metabolic regulation and advancing bioelectronic medicine. The vagus nerve (VN) plays a key role in glucose homeostasis, yet its real-time relationship with blood glucose fluctuations remains underexplored. We introduce neural controlled differential equations (NCDEs) as a novel data-driven approach for modelling the complex interaction between VN activity and blood glucose levels in rats. We utilise data collected from 12 rats including high-frequency neural recordings from single-channel microwire electrodes implanted around the left cervical VN, alongside capillary blood glucose measurements taken every 5 min. We compare the performance of the NCDE against traditional machine learning models–feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs)— for forecasting future blood glucose levels. The input features comprised the frequency and mean amplitude of detected VN spikes, combined with initial glucose concentration over the prediction window. Results demonstrate that NCDE significantly outperforms FFNNs, CNNs, and GRUs achieving a mean squared error (MSE) below 10%, compared to over 15% for the baseline models. Furthermore, replacing the real neural recordings with random noise led to a sharp increase in MSE (over 20%), confirming the ability of the NCDE in extracting meaningful neural signal information. These findings underscore the potential of NCDEs to enhance physiological time-series modelling, particularly for applications in bioelectronic medicine and precision neural signal decoding.},

  abstract     = {As quantum computing continues to advance alongside machine learning, Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs) have gained attention as a compelling generative modeling approach in quantum machine learning. Despite their potential, most existing QGAN implementations rely on manually designed quantum circuits, which often suffer from high complexity and limited scalability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) method built upon the SuperCircuit framework. This approach enables the automatic discovery of efficient quantum circuit structures tailored for generative tasks, thereby reducing gate count. However, applying SuperCircuit-based QAS directly to QGANs presents two primary challenges: an expansive search space and a lack of guarantees regarding circuit efficiency. To mitigate these issues, we incorporate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a PCA-guided feature distribution mechanism during preprocessing. This strategy both compresses the search space and ensures balanced allocation of principal components across sub-generators. Extensive experiments confirm the viability of the proposed framework. When employing the discovered quantum circuits, QAS-QGAN achieves image quality comparable to a state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline (Silver et al 2023 2023 IEEE/CVF Int. Conf. on Computer Vision (ICCV) pp 7007–16) on both the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Notably, our model reduces the number of two-qubit gates by 52.08% on MNIST and 52.92% on Fashion MNIST, highlighting substantial improvements in quantum resource efficiency. Furthermore, the model successfully generates high-resolution facial images ( 109 \times 89 ) on the CelebA dataset, demonstrating strong scalability and practical applicability.},

While PINNs typically use multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as their underlying architecture, recent advancements have explored alternative neural network structures. One such innovation is the Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN), which has demonstrated benefits over traditional MLPs, including faster neural scaling and better interpretability. The application of KANs to physics-informed learning has led to the development of Physics-Informed KANs (PIKANs), enabling the use of KANs to solve PDEs. However, despite their advantages, KANs often suffer from slower training speeds, particularly in higher-dimensional problems where the number of collocation points grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the system. To address this challenge, we introduce Separable Physics-Informed Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (SPIKANs). This novel architecture applies the principle of separation of variables to PIKANs, decomposing the problem such that each dimension is handled by an individual KAN. This approach drastically reduces the computational complexity of training without sacrificing accuracy, facilitating their application to higher-dimensional PDEs. Through a series of benchmark problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SPIKANs, showcasing their superior scalability and performance compared to PIKANs and highlighting their potential for solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs in scientific computing.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of scene depth from monocular images has become crucial in fields such as spatial perception and computer vision. However, unsupervised depth estimation methods based on view synthesis often ignore the significant impact of non-Lambertian surfaces and ghosting artifacts. In this study, we propose a self-learning depth reconstruction framework. This framework introduces a depth consistency loss to compensate for the failure of the photometric assumption in non-Lambertian regions. Additionally, we design an intrinsic consistency loss that leverages variance as a game-theoretic strategy to ensure the robustness of our model. Finally, we introduce a physics-inspired ghosting mask to eliminate ghosting artifacts. We also design a multi-path transformer layer that integrates the Transformer’s global dependency modeling capability into CNNs, thereby enhancing the model’s performance. Experimental results show that our model demonstrates excellent performance in non-Lambertian regions. Compared with state-of-the-art methods that merely rely on the photometric assumption, our method achieves average improvements of 9.29% and 2.86% on the Sq Rel and RMSE metrics across three network models. Furthermore, it exhibits outstanding zero-shot generalization capability on external datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/IkeFwd/Icdepth .},

Assessment through Shannon entropy and uniform manifold approximation and projection confirms the comprehensiveness of D–MOPH–25 while highlighting the importance of robust classification to filter out unphysical data points in regression tasks. Although future enhancements in model architecture and sampling criteria could improve predictive performance, our dataset already spans the target space using only 2.31% of total possibilities.

The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with \mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10\,000\} , the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At \mathrm{Re} = 1000 and 3000, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ( \mathrm{Re} = 10\,000 ), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.},

However, existing approaches often under-utilize domain-specific adaptations that could enhance performance in specialized medical tasks. In this study, we systematically evaluate three modular, post-hoc enhancements to standard zero-shot VLM pipelines: (1) cosine similarity calibration for affinity matrix construction, (2) prompt template enhancement via diverse clinical prompts, and (3) adaptive hyperparameter tuning using a Gaussian mixture model-based method for adjusting pseudo-labeling weights ( λ ) and support set contributions ( γ ), following Zanella et al We conduct extensive zero-shot experiments on the NCT-CRC-HE-100 K dataset, using 60 000 patches for validation of inference-time hyperparameters and reserving 40 000 patches as an independent test set. No training or fine-tuning was performed. The evaluation was carried out across five VLMs: CLIP, CONCH, PLIP, Quilt-B16, and Quilt-B32. Results show that each enhancement module yields significant accuracy gains. Cosine calibration improves CLIP (+7.8%), CONCH (+1.53%), PLIP (+14.3%), Quilt-B16 (+16.1%), and Quilt-B32 (+11.4%). Prompt enhancement yields accuracy gains in PLIP (+16.8%) and Quilt-B32 (+29.9%), with limited effect on CLIP or CONCH. Adaptive tuning yields large improvements in PLIP (+28.4%). The best performance is achieved with the full combination of enhancements, with PLIP reaching 87.88% (+27.88%, p < 0.001) and Quilt-B32 reaching 88.38% (+36.1%) over their baselines. CLIP showed significance only with cosine calibration ( p < 0.001), reflecting its contrastive learning backbone. Although CONCH reached the highest raw accuracy (92.63%) under the full enhancement setting, this performance appears primarily driven by its histopathology-specific pretraining; statistically significant gains emerged only in cosine-based combinations, indicating limited responsiveness to prompt or tuning. Our findings highlight the critical role of structured modular enhancements in optimizing VLM performance for specialized clinical domains.},

Mo3ENet is end-to-end equivariant, meaning the learned representation can be manipulated on O(3), a practical bonus. An appropriately trained Mo3ENet latent space comprises a universal embedding for scalar, vector, and tensorial molecule property prediction tasks, as well as other downstream tasks incorporating the 3D molecular pose, and we demonstrate its fitness on several such tasks.},

Learning amounts to tuning the residual parameters, in order to shape a non-equilibrium path which bridges the input (the data to be classified) and the output (the target memory slot). The imposed attractors are unaltered by the training, and this enables for ex post comparisons to be eventually drawn, e.g. as it concerns the size of their associated basins of attraction. A stochastic variant of the CVFR model is also studied and found to be robust to non-targeted adversarial attacks, which corrupt with a random perturbation the items to be eventually classified.

  abstract     = {A critical challenge in particle physics is combining results from diverse experimental setups that measure the same physical quantity to enhance precision and statistical power, a process known as a global fit. Global fits of sterile neutrino searches, hunts for additional neutrino oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, present an intriguing case study. In such a scenario, the key assumptions underlying Wilks’ theorem, a cornerstone of most classic frequentist analyses, do not hold. The method of Feldman and Cousins, a trials-based approach which does not assume Wilks’ theorem, becomes computationally prohibitive for complex or intractable likelihoods. To bypass this limitation, we borrow a technique from simulation-based inference (SBI) to estimate likelihood ratios for use in building trials-based confidence intervals, speeding up test statistic evaluations by a factor \gt\!\!\!10^4 per grid point, resulting in a faster, but approximate, frequentist fitting framework. Applied to a subset of sterile neutrino search data involving the disappearance of muon-flavor (anti)neutrinos, our method leverages machine learning (ML) to compute frequentist confidence intervals while significantly reducing computational expense. In addition, the SBI-based approach holds additional value by recognizing underlying systematic uncertainties that the Wilks approach does not. Thus, our method allows for more robust ML-based analyses critical to performing accurate but computationally feasible global fits. This allows, for the first time, a global fit to sterile neutrino data without assuming Wilks’ theorem. While we demonstrate the utility of such a technique studying sterile neutrino searches, it is applicable to both single-experiment and global fits of all kinds.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach called multi-modal cascade model with feature transfer for polymer property prediction. Polymers are characterized by a composite of data in several different formats, including molecular descriptors and additive information as well as chemical structures. However, in conventional approaches, prediction models were often constructed using each type of data separately. Our model enables more accurate prediction of physical properties for polymers by combining features extracted from the chemical structure by graph convolutional neural networks with features such as molecular descriptors and additive information. The predictive performance of the proposed method is empirically evaluated using several polymer datasets. We report that the proposed method shows high predictive performance compared to the baseline conventional approach using a single feature.},

We present D ynamic and IN terpretable A nomaly MO nitoring: a novel, interpretable, robust, and scalable DQM framework designed to automate anomaly detection in time-dependent settings. Our approach constructs evolving histogram templates with built-in uncertainties, featuring both a statistical variant—extending the classical exponentially weighted moving average—and a machine learning-enhanced version that leverages a transformer encoder for improved adaptability.

  abstract     = {Nuclear physics experiments are aimed at uncovering the fundamental building blocks of matter. The experiments involve high-energy collisions that produce complex events with many particle trajectories. Tracking charged particles resulting from collisions in the presence of a strong magnetic field is critical to enable the reconstruction of particle trajectories and precise determination of interactions. It is traditionally achieved through combinatorial approaches that scale worse than linearly as the number of hits grows. Since particle hit data naturally form a point cloud and can be structured as graphs, graph neural networks (GNNs) emerge as an intuitive and effective choice for this task. In this study, we evaluate the GNN model for track finding on the data from the GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab. We use simulation data to train the model and test on both simulation and real GlueX measurements. We demonstrate that GNN-based track finding outperforms the currently used traditional method at GlueX in terms of segment-based efficiency at a fixed purity while providing faster inferences. We show that the GNN model can achieve significant speedup by processing multiple events in batches, which exploits the parallel computation capability of graphical processing units (GPUs). Finally, we compare the GNN implementation on GPU and field-programmable gate array and describe the trade-off.},

  abstract     = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum computing offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, quantum GNNs (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the guided graph compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. We compare GGC to a model that uses the autoencoder as a preprocessing step and to a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.},

  abstract     = {A high-dimensional neural network potential (HDNNP) is developed to accurately model the potential energy surface of boron carbide. The HDNNP is trained on an extensive dataset of structures generated using a Monte Carlo algorithm, covering a wide range of stoichiometries and structural configurations. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provided energy and atomic force data, which were encoded using atom-centered symmetry functions to capture local atomic environments. The resulting HDNNP exhibits exceptional predictive performance, accurately estimating energies and forces across diverse structural configurations of boron carbide. The model effectively captures essential structural, energetic, and mechanical properties, including elastic behavior and the influence of stoichiometry on stability. The HDNNP development followed an iterative refinement strategy, in which the initial training set was systematically expanded to 2931 structures by incorporating finite-temperature AIMD snapshots at 300 K, 600 K, and 1000 K, as well as extrapolative configurations from MD simulations and defect-containing cells. This approach resulted in an HDNNP model that is numerically stable and physically consistent up to 500 K, with only minor drift observed at 600 K. The HDNNP achieves exceptional accuracy in predicting energies, forces, and mechanical properties across temperatures, reproducing Young’s modulus values of 416 GPa at 10 K and 420\pm20 GPa at 300 K, in close agreement with DFT and experimental ranges. The predicted ultimate tensile strength of 43 GPa at a failure strain of 0.14 at 300 K is consistent with atomistic simulations (40.23 GPa, strain 0.12). Comparative MD simulations show that the HDNNP outperforms Tersoff and ReaxFF in both accuracy and computational efficiency, enabling timesteps up to an order of magnitude larger, achieving 43% faster performance than Tersoff and 79% faster than ReaxFF. These results highlight the HDNNP as a robust and efficient tool for simulating boron carbide across a range of temperatures and deformation conditions, offering quantum-level accuracy for large-scale atomistic modeling in extreme environments.},

  abstract     = {A novel quintile multi-model ensemble (QMME) framework is introduced to improve future precipitation projections from MMEs. The QMME method divides daily precipitation into five quintiles, thereby capturing not only extreme rainfall but also the full spectrum of precipitation intensities. This approach surpasses conventional ensembles, such as the equal MME (EMME) and the weighted MME (WMME), in accurately reflecting the distinct characteristics of individual climate models. To develop the QMME, this study first applies empirical quantile mapping to correct biases in daily precipitation outputs from 14 coupled model intercomparison project 6 (CMIP6) general circulation models (GCMs). Historical observations (1980–2014) from 61-gauge stations in South Korea are then used to evaluate GCM performance within each quintile. The QMME framework integrates each GCM’s historical performance and future uncertainty into a quintile-specific weights and combines them with XGBoost to generate enhanced precipitation time series. Four shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are considered to assess a range of future scenarios. As a result, the QMME consistently outperforms both EMME and WMME in capturing both extreme precipitation events and moderate rainfall conditions. An evaluation using reliability ensemble averaging confirms that the QMME more effectively accounts for inter-model variability and reduces uncertainty, thus providing robust projections of future precipitation. This quintile-based methodology can be readily extended to other hydroclimatic variables and geographic regions, offering significant potential for improving climate impact assessments and guiding risk management in water resources planning.},

  abstract     = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted increasing attention in gravitational wave (GW) data analysis due to their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features from raw strain data. However, the physical meaning of these learned features remains underexplored, limiting the interpretability of such models. In this work, we propose a hybrid architecture that combines a CNN-based feature extractor with a random forest (RF) classifier to improve both detection performance and interpretability. Unlike prior approaches that directly connect classifiers to CNN outputs, our method introduces four physically interpretable metrics-variance, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), waveform overlap, and peak amplitude-computed from the final convolutional layer. These are jointly used with the CNN output probability in the RF classifier to enable more informed decision boundaries. Tested on long-duration strain datasets, our hybrid model outperforms a baseline-CNN model, achieving a relative improvement of 21% in sensitivity at a fixed false alarm rate of 10 events per month. Notably, it also shows improved detection of low-SNR signals (SNR \unicode{x2A7D} 10), which are especially vulnerable to misclassification in noisy environments. Feature importance analysis and ablation studies reveal that handcrafted features play a significant role in classification decisions and contribute to improved performance. These findings suggest that physically motivated post-processing of CNN feature maps can serve as a valuable tool for interpretable and efficient GW detection, bridging the gap between deep learning and domain knowledge.},

Traditional methods like group additivity and rate rules have limitations, prompting the exploration of machine learning methods to predict these coefficients. These machine learning models are often combined with quantum chemical calculations to improve their performance. While often accurate, these approaches slow down predictions due to the need for quantum chemical calculations, particularly for transition states. This study addresses the issue by introducing a quantum chemical property that does not require transition state calculations but still correlates well with the rate coefficient. We further enhance the prediction speed by training a machine learning model to predict this property.
