  abstract     = {The unrelenting growth in the memory demands of datacenter applications, combined with DRAM’s volatile prices and ever-increasing costs, has made DRAM a major infrastructure expense. Alternative technologies, such as NVMe SSDs and emerging NVM devices, offer higher capacity than DRAM at a fraction of the cost and power. A promising approach is to transparently offload colder memory to cheaper memory technologies via kernel or hypervisor techniques. The key challenge, however, is to develop a datacenter-scale solution that is robust in dealing with diverse workloads and large performance variance of different offload devices, such as compressed memory, SSD, and NVM. This paper presents TMO, Meta’s transparent memory offloading solution for heterogeneous datacenter environments. TMO introduces a new Linux kernel mechanism that directly measures, in realtime, process stalls due to resource shortages across CPU, memory, and I/O. Guided by this information and without any prior application knowledge, TMO automatically adjusts how much memory to offload to heterogeneous devices (e.g., compressed memory or SSD) according to the device’s performance characteristics and the application’s sensitivity to memory-access slowdown. To maximize memory savings, TMO targets both anonymous memory and file cache, balancing the swap-in rate of anonymous memory and the reload rate of file pages that were recently evicted from the file cache. Moreover, it identifies offloading opportunities not only from the application containers but also from the sidecar containers that provide infrastructure-level functions. TMO has been in production since 2021, saving 20–32% of total memory across millions of servers in our hyperscale datacenter fleet. We have successfully upstreamed TMO into the Linux kernel.},

  abstract     = {Economics studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources and the interactions among these agents. Game theory had a substantial impact on economic modeling because it allows us to model the outcome of such economic interaction while taking the incentives of individual agents into account. Mechanism design does the same when designing the rules of economic institutions. Unfortunately, these economic models have turned out to be computationally hard to solve. For example, finding equilibrium in some incomplete-information models of markets with continuous valuation and action spaces are hard in PP, and designing a revenue-maximizing multi-item auction is # P -hard. This computational complexity poses a fundamental barrier in modeling economic systems but is worst-case and considers non-generic instances. Differentiable economics describes a new approach to solving these central problems in the economic sciences. It uses learning algorithms to find or approximate solutions to equilibrium computation or economic design problems. In particular, neural networks and learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent have been shown to be very effective. Machine learning has led to breakthroughs in many sciences, and it also holds the potential to fundamentally alter how we analyze and design economic systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, society has witnessed accelerated advancement in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies, which may be viewed as a double-edged sword. On one hand, GenAI tools can be used to create synthetic content legitimately. For example, advertising agencies may, with permission, generate celebrities’ images or videos using GenAI tools without putting them in front of cameras and thus reducing the overall cost of media construction. On the other hand, scammers may utilize GenAI tools to craft or edit artificial content (for example, texts, images, videos, or audio), so-called deepfakes, to mislead or deceive netizens with robocalls or voice cloning phishing, potentially causing detrimental consequences for society. This article briefly debates emerging socioeconomic threats of deepfakes in today’s society and how cyber-wellness (or digital media literacy) education can help netizens mitigate their risks.},

These are sometimes called grey publishers (MDPI, Frontiers, Hindawi). We show that the citation landscape for these grey publications is significantly different from the mainstream landscape and that affording grey publications the same status as mainstream journals may significantly distort metrics such as the FWCI.},

This landmark conference, held November 16–19, 2003, at Airlie House in Northern Virginia, brought together 50 technology and policy experts in security, privacy, and networking to identify transformative research challenges. The resulting report became a cornerstone for researchers and funding agencies at a pivotal moment in the evolution of cybersecurity. In 2023, participants met online for a six-week period to review the progress made on these challenges, assessing successes, failures, and lessons learned. This article distills those discussions, offering insight for a new generation of cybersecurity professionals who face many of the same threats today in an ever-evolving landscape. As many of the original participants remain active in the field, this retrospective not only provides a historical perspective but also serves as an inspiration to tackle new challenges and secure the future of computing infrastructure.},
