  abstract     = {We consider solutions to the space-homogeneous Landau equation with a general family of interaction potentials. We prove that their Fisher information is monotone decreasing in time. The class of interaction potentials covered by our result includes the case of the Landau equation with Coulomb interactions. As a consequence of the global boundedness of the Fisher information, we deduce that solutions to the space-homogeneous Landau equation never blow up.},

  abstract     = {The formation of codimension- 1 interfaces for multi-well gradient-driven problems is well known and established in the scalar case, where the equation is often referred to as the Allen-Cahn equation . The proof relies for a large part on a monotonicity formula for the energy density, which is itself related to the vanishing of the so-called discrepancy function. The vectorial case in contrast is quite open. This lack of results and insight is to a large extent related to the absence of known appropriate monotonicity formulas. In this paper, we focus on the elliptic case in two dimensions , and introduce methods, relying on the analysis of the partial differential equation, which allow us to circumvent the lack of monotonicity formula for the energy density. In the last part of the paper, we recover a new monotonicity formula which relies on a new discrepancy relation . These tools allow us to extend to the vectorial case in two dimensions most of the results obtained for the scalar case. We also emphasize some specific features of the vectorial case.},
