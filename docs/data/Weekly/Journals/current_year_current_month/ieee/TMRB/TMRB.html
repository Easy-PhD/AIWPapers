  abstract     = {Force sensing for multi-degree-of-freedom articulated forceps is challenging for several reasons, including size constraints, the harsh environment inside the patient’s body, and sterilizability. This paper proposes a sensing method that overcomes the fragility and production cost disadvantages of conventional force/tension sensors that use flexure elements. Vibration-based tension sensing induced vibrations in forceps’ driving cables. The resulting fundamental frequencies were measured using photo interrupters. A rotating shaft was mounted on an axis parallel to cables suspended between two pulleys, with a small protrusion in the radial direction that plucked at the middle of those concentrically arranged cables. Cable tensions were estimated from the measured fundamental frequencies with satisfactory accuracy, repeatability, and vibration-to-noise magnitude ratio. The plucking negatively affects the wear of the protrusion and cables while inducing undesired vibration transmission and changes in the contact/grasping force at the forceps tip. A nylon protrusion and nylon-coated cables were used because nylon is wear-resistant, low-friction, biocompatible, and sterilizable. The results revealed minimal wear after 106 plucking cycles, minimal vibration transmissions and changes in contact force, and little interference with the photo interrupter signal from the plucking on another cable.},

  abstract     = {Bladder cancer and urinary dysfunctions present significant challenges to patient health and quality of life. Considering that radical cystectomy remains the standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, there is an urgent need for the implantation of artificial bladders (ABs). In this study, we present the optimization and validation of a novel, collapsible, origami-based AB through Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We evaluated various materials and wall thicknesses to improve unfolding capability and minimize structural stress concentrations. Simulations were conducted under different filling conditions, replicating the in-body constraints posed by surrounding organs. The optimal material-thickness combination, namely MoldStar 15 with a 2:1 wall-to-fold ratio, effectively maintained low intravesical pressures during filling (0.5-1.96 kPa), meeting the clinical requirements for renal function preservation. Stress analysis showed Von Mises stresses lower than 2.5 MPa, well below the material’s tensile stress limit, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the device. The AB model was validated by comparing FEM simulation results with a physical prototype, showing a pressure difference of approximately 15% and a volumetric overlap deviation under 10%.},

In this study, a compact and versatile soft fluidic sensor-actuator (SA) capable of measuring both force and displacement in static and dynamic conditions is presented. Pressure and resistance are shown to be interchangeable, although best used in combination, when predicting the load on the SA, and show good repeatability and distinction between the loaded and constrained conditions. Using a single sensing medium and across the different diameters tested, the best estimated resolution of just under 4g and 0.07mm is achieved with the 12mm sensor, filled with 1.5mL using pressure sensing only. Furthermore, the SA is demonstrated in two probe applications and as part of a soft robotic implant for tissue-loading based tissue regeneration. The SA showed the ability to distinguish between different objects or areas of varying stiffness, as part of both a rigid-bodied and soft-bodied probe, as well as being able to predict force and displacement from the lengthening and retraction of a soft implant. Overall, this SA has the potential to be a key building block for biomedical robots’ monitoring of both displacement and force.},

In this paper, a high-accuracy hybrid continuum manipulator (HCM) consisting of a notch continuum manipulator section and a concentric tube manipulator section is proposed. The static model of the manipulator is established, and an optimization algorithm of the manipulator has been carried out to enhance the precision of the kinematic model. This algorithm can optimize the accuracy of the model while retaining the high computational speed. Then, three different modes, namely the trajectory planning mode, operation mode, and hybrid mode are introduced to cater to distinct surgical requirements. The mechanical structure of the HCM is specifically designed to realize the modes above. The experimental results demonstrate a repetition positioning error of 0.4745 mm and an operation error of 1.7801 mm. The kinematic model error of the optimized manipulator was reduced by 77.4% compared to its pre-optimization state. Finally, the feasibility of the manipulator is demonstrated through function testing experiments. The proposed manipulator design provides a more versatile and adaptable solution to meet the diverse requirements of surgical procedures.},

  abstract     = {Echocardiography is a critical tool for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, offering detailed insights into heart functions. However, its accessibility is currently limited by a shortage of trained sonographers, specific skill requirements, and the physical strain imposed on professionals during repetitive procedures. This article introduces a new robotic system designed to automate the acquisition of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) images. The system autonomously adjusts the position and orientation of the ultrasound transducer based on analysing real-time ultrasound images, without relying on tomographic data or depth sensors. Initially, the transducer is manually placed on the subject’s skin, and the system uses a deep learning approach to grade the quality of ultrasound images captured at each position. The robot then adjusts its position by spiralling outwards from the starting point, moving to the location with the highest image quality score. Next, the system fine-tunes the transducer’s orientation in 5-degree increments along all three axes of rotation, informed by another deep learning module to identify the field of view. The robotic system was tested using a cardiac simulator, achieving approximately 80% accuracy in acquiring the A4Ch view when the probe was initially positioned randomly in a 6 by 6 cm area beneath the left nipple. The impact of this work would be rapid diagnostics in the Emergency Departments to reduce the length of stay in hospitals, a reduction of hospital admissions related to heart disease by accessing local healthcare communities, acceleration of clearing the post-Covid backlog, and improved quality of life and longevity of patients.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, an existing physiological muscle model that predicts muscular force in response to electrical stimulation is adapted to be compatible with gradient-based optimization, in particular with numerical optimal control/estimation problems. The objective is to integrate biomechanical models with those that correlate muscle force generation with electrical pulses from a physiological perspective, with the aim of achieving optimal stimulation patterns in activities assisted by functional electrical stimulation. To this end, the activation dynamics of the original model, initially constrained to a stimulation train of predefined and constant length, is reformulated to account for stimulation sequences that dynamically change over time. This is typically necessary to simulate complex motions, which would otherwise be impossible to achieve with the earliest formulation. To identify the model parameters, experimental torque data of 3 participants with spinal cord injury performing electrically evoked isometric quadriceps contractions at different knee angles are used. We then employ an optimal control framework to demonstrate the model’s ability to predict knee torques and the possibility of achieving optimized stimulation patterns in simulation for controlling muscle force and knee extension. Our results reveal that the identified model allows accurate prediction of knee torque and optimization of stimulation patterns while satisfying the system’s dynamics at the skeletal and physiological muscle levels. This proof of concept is a first step towards physiological muscle model-based control of functional electrical stimulation to achieve movements that best exploit an individual’s physiological and biomechanical characteristics.},

The sensor exhibits high linearity over the bending range of 0°-65° and offers 100% elongation at break and excellent mechanical properties, also showing good biocompatibility and environmental adaptability. A $3{\times }3$ array of these sensors is attached to the continuum surgical robot to realize shape sensing. The angle change of the continuum at each position is determined from the resistance change of each sensor during bending. The position information of five key points can be obtained from these angles, and the shape is reconstructed by fitting each point. Experimental results show that the proposed sensor can accurately sense various bending shapes of the continuum within the stable linear bending range, and the position error of the distal end fluctuates about 2% of the overall shape. This study provides a new solution for shape sensing of continuum surgical robots, demonstrating strong application potential.},

  abstract     = {In robot-assisted endoscopic procedures, a guiding sheath must be flexibly advanced through anatomic paths via natural orifices, while maintaining sufficient rigidity to serve as a base for the surgical instruments used in dexterous diagnostic and therapeutic tasks. Therefore, developing a guiding sheath with the capacity of both flexible access and variable stiffness is imperative and challenging. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel robotic guiding sheath. Its stiffness can be managed using the innovatively-manufactured variable stiffness coating layer (VSCL), which has a thickness of only 1 mm and is composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and conductive graphene. An active water heating and cooling mechanism was designed to regulate the temperature of the VSCL, thereby controlling the stiffness of the guiding sheath. Through detailed performance evaluation, the guiding sheath achieved a fixed-end bending stiffness gain of 25.76 and a mid-span bending stiffness gain of 25.01, reaching a fixed-end bending stiffness of 739.63 N/m and a mid-span bending stiffness of 5779.33 N/m. The fast switching between the rigid and flexible states was realized with switching times of 6.5 s (from rigid state to flexible state) and 10.0 s (from flexible state to rigid state). The sheath was also validated with phantom and ex-vivo experiments. The capability of this guiding sheath to traverse the tortuous digestive tract in a flexible state was proved. Additionally, the guiding sheath in a rigid state can significantly improve instrument manipulation stability during the ex-vivo trials. The experimental results demonstrated the potential clinical value of this system.},

We measured energy expenditure, joint work, and user preferences during treadmill walking. Results showed a 15.6% reduction in metabolic rate with stance flexion decreasing from 12° to 5° (p<0.05). User preferences favored lower stance flexion and personalized swing initiation. Personalized-best settings reduced the metabolic rate by 4.1% (stance flexion) and 9.8% (swing initiation) compared to the best-on-average settings (p<0.05). These reductions were also significant when compared to the device default and clinically tuned settings (p<0.05). We proposed an offline learning approach using anthropometric, gait, and prosthesis-related data to estimate optimal settings, yielding a 7.1% reduction in metabolic rate (p<0.05). Our results suggest that this approach achieves comparable energy efficiency without lengthy experiments, enabling automatic parameter tuning with initial measurements.},

This study bridges this gap by integrating a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) into real-time lower-limb prosthesis control with preliminary clinical tests on the above-knee amputee, enabling a more reliable volitional control of the prosthesis. Cerebral hemodynamic responses were measured using a 56-channel fNIRS headset, and lower-limb kinematics were recorded with a optical motion capture system. Artifacts in fNIRS were mitigated using short-separation regression, and eight features of the fNIRS data were extracted. ANOVA revealed the means, slope, and entropy as top-performing features across all subjects. Among eight classifiers tested, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) emerged as the most accurate. In this study, we recruited eleven healthy subjects and one unilateral transfemoral amputee. Classification rates surpassed 97% for all classes, maintaining an average accuracy of $99.86\pm 0.01$ %. Notably, the amputee exhibited higher precision, sensitivity, and F1 scores than healthy subjects. Maximum temporal latencies for healthy subjects were $120.00\pm 49.40$ ms during sit-down and $119.09\pm 45.71$ ms during stand-up, while the amputee showed maximum temporal latencies of 90 ms and 190 ms, respectively.

This study introduces a novel neuromechanical control framework integrating a passivity observer with Quantum-Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (QDRL) for adaptive impedance scaling in wrist rehabilitation robotics. The passivity observer continuously monitors energy exchanges to classify patient states into passive (patient requiring robotic assistance) and non-passive (patient actively participating) categories, dynamically guiding the robot’s impedance adjustments. Experiments were conducted with ten unimpaired human subjects (eight male and two female), who were instructed to simulate rehabilitation scenarios, focusing on three key wrist movements, flexion/extension (FL/EX), abduction/adduction (AB/AD), and pronation/supination (PR/SU). Experimental results showed high correlations (> 0.83) between energy-based and electromyography (EMG)-based passivity classifications, confirming the reliability of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the designed QDRL model significantly outperformed traditional reinforcement learning methods, achieving superior adaptability, stability, and higher average rewards during robotic impedance control. The framework offers advancement in optimizing robotic assistance during motor recovery, promoting personalized rehabilitation by tailoring interventions to the specific needs of each patient.},

The modular and variable stiffness structure of exoskeleton enable the adaptation to different human joint, improving the characteristics of physical human-robot interaction. The DTS-VSA is designed based on the pulley-cable-spring preloading principle and tendon sheath transmission, and its stiffness model is developed through quasi-static force balance analysis. To realize coordinated and active power argumentation, a fuzzy adaptive assistive controller integrated with human joint torque and stiffness estimation is proposed based on surface electromyography. Feasibility is experimentally verified via three typical load-carrying experiments and ten volunteers. The experimental results show that the average assistance efficiencies of elbow motion and knee motion in different experiment conditions are higher than 44.72% and 38.41%.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for responsive and intuitive assistive walking devices, driven by an aging population, underscores the need for intelligent systems powered by emerging machine learning (ML) technologies. This study introduces a novel feature fusion framework based on the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) to fuse surface electromyography (sEMG) signals with inertial measurement unit (IMU) data and a high-level control architecture, enabling accurate and robust motion intention detection for robotic assistive walking systems. The proposed feature fusion method consistently outperformed statistical filter-based techniques such as mutual information (MI), minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR), correlation coefficient (CC), and Fisher score (FS). It significantly improved the classification metrics of random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbour (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers across varying feature counts. For example, the feature fusion algorithm improved RF’s accuracy by 6.74%, 7.67%, 6.35%, and 3.60% and enhanced precision by 6.77%, 7.67%, 6.36%, and 3.61% relative to FS, CC, MRMR, and MI, respectively. Similarly, the algorithm increased RF’s recall by 6.79%, 7.71%, 6.38%, and 3.62%. The proposed feature fusion and high-level and low-level control frameworks were implemented on SoloWalk for real-time interaction, enabling participants to perform daily walking activities. Real-time validation confirmed system stability across gait patterns and user variations, demonstrating its effectiveness in assistive walking robots.},

  abstract     = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals from the coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscles can provide precise and powerful control of a lower limb prosthesis along with proprioceptive sensory feedback. However, the analysis of coactivation is challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity of the signals and the nonlinear interactions within the muscular systems during dynamic contractions. In this study, a novel nonlinear approach based on symbolic transfer entropy (STE) is proposed to characterize the coactivation of muscles at different speeds of gait. For this purpose, the sEMG is recorded from the rectus femoris (RF) and vastus lateralis (VL) of the quadriceps, as well as the biceps femoris (BF) and semitendinosus (SEM) of the hamstring muscles. The signals are collected from 20 healthy subjects walking on a treadmill at gait speeds of 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5 kilometres per hour (km/h). In addition, the knee joint angles are also obtained from the inertial measurement units. The sEMG signals are pre-processed, and eight distinct phases of gait are segmented using joint angles. A suitable symbolic scale is selected after a detailed analysis, and STE is extracted to characterize the coactivation of agonist and antagonist muscle pairs: RF-BF, RF-SEM, VL-BF and VL-SEM. The results show that STE increases with gait speed irrespective of muscle combinations, which indicates the stronger coactivation during faster locomotion. The variation of STE with respect to each phase exhibits a complex dynamic pattern in muscle coactivation. The information transfer is bidirectional and the distribution of STE is found to have significant differences across directions, phases and speeds (p¡0.001). Furthermore, the proposed STE is superior to traditional transfer entropy in terms of capturing nonlinear interactions. The study facilitates researchers in developing gait phase-based features that account for coactivation, enabling them to achieve significantly more natural and efficient gait patterns in prosthetic lower limbs.},

  abstract     = {Electrical stimulation-based therapies are vital in managing post-spinal cord injury complications, particularly during physical rehabilitation. However, the nonlinear muscle response to electrical stimuli and the subjective, physiological variability make it challenging to predict stimulation levels for precise limb movements. The electromechanical delay (EMD), corresponding to the lag between electrical stimulation and muscle actuation, also alleviates rehabilitation outcomes. We propose a dynamic linearization-based sliding mode controller with Smith predictor configuration, compensating for EMD and regulating limb movement using electrical stimulation. Unlike model-based approaches, the proposed controller relies solely on real-time input/output data, eliminating the need for complex system modelling. Experiments with thirteen healthy and two spinal cord-injured participants demonstrated a root mean square error in the range of 2.31° to 8.63° and 1.22° to 3.21° in stimulus-assisted trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection scenarios, respectively. The proposed controller significantly outperformed (Man-Whitney U Test, p¡0.05) the conventional dynamic linearization-based sliding mode controller with an average (SD) RMSE improvement of 2.13°(0.96°). Additionally, the results indicate the robust performance of the proposed controller during impulsive disturbances during seated knee flexion and extension tasks. The proposed controller may potentially eliminate the need for extensive mathematical modelling of the subject while giving excellent trajectory-tracking performance.},

However, depending on the scanning speed and the physician’s experience, the size of the physical features in the body can be miscategorized or overlooked entirely. By designing tactile sensors and signal processing algorithms that mimic the body’s ability to account for variations in speed when scanning an object, we can solve the problem described above in an artificial system. We utilized a piezoresistive tactile sensor attached to a robotic arm to palpate fractures at different speeds. The analog tactile signals generated from the tactile sensor are converted into spike trains which are then scaled in time to encode the sensor data invariant of the speed of palpation. With a few principal components, the scaled dataset achieves a higher classification accuracy compared to the original dataset. Additionally, the scaled data was more robust to both spike timing noise and untrained speed conditions compared to the original data. Lastly, we demonstrated that this system could be applied in a medical setting by discriminating between 3 different fracture conditions (none, transverse, and communicated) in the ulna of a chicken wing with 99.8% accuracy at 3 different speeds.},

In this study, we aimed to design a hinge-less exosuit knee brace that combines flexible materials to improve comfort at the brace-body interface while providing dynamic support forces during walking tasks using an offboard actuation system. We recruited 11 participants: 5 for design tests and 6 for walking tests. Our active exosuit knee brace was able to produce up to 88.9 N of cable force during a portion of the stance phase with a rise time of 111-150 milliseconds at different load settings and under 10N during the swing phase. Comfort scores were high (> 7) during most walking tests. The range of knee flexion was reduced by about 5 degrees when the exosuit knee brace was activated during walking, and brace migration was within 10 mm in most cases.},

Adopting exoskeletons is emerging as a preventive measure in alleviating the musculoskeletal system’s workload. This work investigates the effect of a semi-active exoskeleton, a new class of wearable devices, in a simulated industrial environment. The study found a consistent decrease in the average activity of the Anterior Deltoid, Upper Trapezius, and Rectus Abdominis in four different material handling and lifting tasks when the exoskeleton was used. Using the exoskeleton to move a weight between two shelves reduced the activity of 10 measured muscles belonging to the arm and trunk, with a notable 42.6% reduction for the Anterior Deltoid and 46.4% for the Upper Trapezius. The study also showed reduced peak force and slower lifting motion, potentially decreasing the likelihood of WRMSDs. Lastly, using the exoskeleton did not require additional cognitive exertion from the subjects, who also consistently reported a 44.9% reduction in their perceived Effort and a 34.0% reduction in Physical Demand. Despite some negative feedback regarding limited mobility, the study demonstrated the potential of semi-active exoskeletons, achieving good results in tasks and with weights where passive upper-limb exoskeletons are not typically used.},

We thus present a neural-network-informed scheduler methodology that monitors patient exercise performance and dynamically assigns patients to robots based on their performance. These schedulers were trained and tested using synthetic datasets from a simulated rehabilitation gym. They were evaluated in 36 scenarios that differed in several ways (e.g., number of robots/patients, degree of stochasticity). Results showed that our neural-network-informed schedulers led to greater mean skill improvement compared to several baseline schedulers (e.g., only switching robots once). Additionally, the outcome difference between neural-network-informed schedulers and baseline schedulers increased as skill improvement became more stochastic. We also performed secondary studies where we showed that our schedulers still outperform baselines when patients can arrive or leave midsession and analyzed how the training dataset size affects scheduler performance. While several limitations need to be addressed before the scheduler is ready for use in real-world gyms, our study represents a step toward the use of artificial intelligence for patient monitoring in group settings.},

  abstract     = {Surgical training remains a crucial milestone in modern medicine, with procedures such as laminectomy exemplifying the high risks involved. Laminectomy drilling requires precise manual control to mill bony tissue while preserving spinal segment integrity and avoiding breaches in the dura–the protective membrane surrounding the spinal cord. Despite unintended dural tears occurring in up to 11.3% of cases, no assistive tools are currently utilized to reduce this risk. Variability in patient anatomy further complicates learning for novice surgeons. This study introduces CAPTAiN, a critical anatomy-preserving and terrain-augmenting navigation system that provides layered, color-coded voxel guidance to enhance anatomical awareness during spinal drilling. CAPTAiN was evaluated against a standard non-navigated approach through 110 virtual laminectomies performed by 11 orthopedic residents and medical students. CAPTAiN significantly improved surgical completion rates of target anatomy (87.99% vs. 74.42%) and reduced cognitive load across multiple NASA-TLX domains. It also minimized performance gaps across experience levels, enabling novices to perform on par with advanced trainees. These findings highlight CAPTAiN’s potential to optimize surgical execution and support skill development across experience levels. Beyond laminectomy, it demonstrates potential for broader applications across various surgical and drilling procedures, including those in neurosurgery, otolaryngology, and other medical fields.},

Although human Activities of Daily Living (ADL) tasks differ substantially from surgical tasks, they encompass fundamental motor skills that can serve as a foundation for robot learning. Notably, skilled surgeons often develop their advanced surgical abilities by building upon these basic motor skills acquired through daily activities. Inspired by this progressive learning trajectory, we propose a novel surgical skill training framework that enables robots to learn basic motor skills from the ADL dataset and quickly adapt to advanced surgical skills. Specifically, we propose a unified predictive representation space, constructed using probabilistic successor features, which capture the dynamic patterns of motion primitives common to both ADL and surgical tasks. To investigate the transferability of skills from human ADL tasks to robotic surgical tasks, we conducted a mathematical analysis to evaluate transferable policies and performed simulation experiments to assess transfer performance. Furthermore, we validated the practicality and effectiveness of our method through real-world experiments. Results show that our method significantly reduces the need for extensive surgical datasets, and enables efficient learning in robotic surgical tasks.},

The novel navigation frames enable in-bore stereotactic targeting through multiple burr holes with a single registration procedure and 3-degree-of-freedom pivoting about each burr hole, while simultaneously support the actuator-equipped manipulator across a large workspace. Kinematic modeling and design optimization were performed for the navigation components to achieve Pareto balance between large laser coverage and sufficient stiffness for the manipulator support. The unique setting enables in the clinical workflow intuitive navigation frames adjustment for stereotactic targeting and iterative laser tip steering to adapt to targeting error and various tumor geometries. Experiments demonstrate high tip positioning accuracy (RMSE 1.45 mm), minimal MR imaging interference ( $\lt 1.71\%~\Delta $ SNR, <0.71 mm distortion), and precise MRI-guided tip steering (RMSE 2.1 mm). Compared to existing MRI-guided neurosurgical systems, our system offers practical and accurate navigation, distal robot dexterity, and minimal MR image disruption, potentially improving clinical LITT outcomes and facilitating autonomous MRI-guided ablation strategies.},

Results: The proposed system is evaluated using precise registration instruments, human phantom models, and ex vivo ovine models, demonstrating less than 2 mm of error with fiducials and less than 4 mm of error without fiducials. Conclusion: The registration procedure takes less than one minute and can be performed intuitively by a single operator without an assistant.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based non-rigid 3D point set registration method, Learning Coherent Point Drift Network (LCNet), for image-guided liver surgery. We reformulate the classical probabilistic registration approach, i.e., Coherent Point Drift (CPD) into a learning-based paradigm. We first utilise the feature extraction module (FEM) to extract the features of two original point sets, which are robust to rigid transformation. Subsequently, we establish reliable correspondences between the point sets using the optimal transport (OT) module by leveraging both original points and learned features. Then, rather than directly regressing displacement vectors, we compute the displacements by solving the involved matrix equation in the transformation module, where the point localization noise is explicitly considered. In addition, we present three variants of the proposed approach, i.e., LCNet, LCNet-ED and LCNet-WD. Among these, LCNet outperforms the other two, demonstrating the superiority of the Chamfer loss. We have extensively evaluated LCNet on the simulated and real datasets. Under experimental conditions with the rotation angle lies in the range of $[{-}45^{\circ },45^{\circ }]$ and the translation in the range of $[{-}30 mm, 30 mm]$ , LCNet achieves the root-mean-square-error (rmse) value being 3.46 mm on the MedShapeNet dataset, while those using CPD and RoITr are 7.65 mm $(p\lt 0.001)$ and 6.71 mm $(p\lt 0.001)$ respectively. Experimental results show that LCNet exhibits significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art registration methods and shed light on its promising use in image-guided liver surgery.},

Additionally, it improves image stability when zooming with an oblique-viewing scope by developing a custom laparoscope integrated with an embedded distance sensor, allowing the LapARM to dynamically adjust the scope’s orientation during zooming, ensuring that the imaged object remains centered in the image throughout the zooming process. Furthermore, an eye tracker provides surgeons with a contactless interface for intuitive solo control of the laparoscope via head movements.

  abstract     = {Vascular interventional robot enables surgeons to perform percutaneous coronary interventions remotely from the cardiac catheterization room, significantly reducing their radiation exposure. However, the teleoperation mode inherently causes the loss of force perception, increasing surgical risks and limiting the clinical application of vascular interventional robots. Furthermore, existing robot systems lack the ability to enhance surgeons’ force perception and operational transparency. To address these limitations, we developed an intuitive interface with enhanced haptic feedback for vascular interventional robot. Our approach involved three key innovations: Firstly, we designed a magnetism-based feedback mechanism based on the equivalent magnetic charge method to provide high-precision and real-time force feedback. Secondly, we proposed a feedback enhancement model based on surgeons’ experience to reduce damage to vulnerable vascular areas. Thirdly, a dynamic feedback compensation strategy was presented, aiming at addressing the issue of vascular wall rupture resulted from the rapid decay of feedback force during instantaneous guidewire penetration through lesions in surgical procedures. Finally, we conducted a series of experiments to assess the accuracy, dynamic tracking ability, and overall effectiveness of our system. The results demonstrate the developed haptic interface not only improves surgical transparency but also reduces the risk of vascular injury and puncture, thereby advancing the clinical applicability of vascular interventional robots.},

  abstract     = {Oral cavity cancer, a common head and neck cancer, is typically treated through precise tumor excision via electrosurgery. Autonomous robotic electrosurgery has demonstrated the potential to achieve more accurate and consistent resection margins compared to manual methods, thereby improving surgical outcomes. However, current autonomous systems face challenges in tracking tissue deformation during electrosurgical cutting due to unpredictable and complex soft tissue dynamics. Failure to monitor and adapt to tissue deformation can significantly compromise resection precision. This paper presents an autonomous closed-loop robotic electrosurgery system to enhance surgical precision via 3D tissue tracking and image-based feedback control utilizing a Red Green Blue – Depth (RGB-D) sensor. The developed 3D tissue tracker employs CoTracker, a deep learning-based model for markerless tracking, complemented by a tool-occlusion algorithm to achieve tissue deformation tracking with no prior knowledge of the tissue model. The estimated deformation is fed into a fuzzy logic controller, which dynamically adjusts the cutting velocity to minimize cutting error during electrosurgery. The system’s efficacy was validated using ex vivo porcine tongues, demonstrating a 55% reduction in average cutting error (from 1.2 mm to 0.54 mm, $p\lt 0.001$ ) in closed-loop operations (N=6) compared to open-loop cutting without feedback control (N=3). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based closed-loop control in improving margin accuracy, a key factor in reducing the likelihood of cancer recurrence.},

  abstract     = {Endovascular surgeries generally rely on push-based catheters and guidewires, which require significant training to master and can still result in high stress being exerted on the anatomy, especially in tortuous paths. Because these procedures are so technically challenging to perform, many patients have limited access to high-quality treatment. Although various robotic systems have been developed to enhance navigation capabilities, they can also apply high stresses due to sliding against the vascular walls, impeding movement and raising the risk of vascular damage. Soft growing robots offer a promising alternative since their method of movement via eversion minimizes interaction forces with the environment and enables follow-the-leader navigation through tortuous paths. However, reliable steering of small-scale growing robots remains a significant challenge. We propose a robot architecture that combines a hydraulically-actuated, soft growing robot with a soft, tendon-driven notched continuum robot to overcome the challenges of steering for small-scale growing robots in endovascular procedures. The soft notched continuum robot successfully steers around the most difficult aortic arch type, and a 2.67 mm diameter growing robot—comparable in size to current catheters—deploys from the tip, pulling an aspiration catheter through extremely tortuous vessels. We present the design, manufacturing, and control of the notched continuum robot, growing robot, and proximal actuation subsystem. Overall, this robotic architecture facilitates active steering in proximal anatomy and navigation in tortuous distal vessels, with potential to reduce procedure times and expand access to care.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a widely adopted surgical approach in contemporary medicine, significantly reducing patient trauma. However, it imposes demands on the surgeon’s operation. To reduce the surgical complexity, this study developed a highly dexterous operative tool for MIS procedures. The tool utilizes the widely adopted radiofrequency ablation (RFA) technology in surgical to separate tissues by generating heat through high-frequency currents. It consists of three sets of grippers and radiofrequency (RF) transmitters at their tips. The tool enables intact capture and separation the lesion, thereby eliminating the need for an additional abdominal incision compared to traditional methods and reducing the complexity of liver tumor resection in confined spaces. To minimize the impact on healthy tissue, this paper proposed a calculation method that determines the tool’s key structural parameters and singularity position based on the lesion size, resulting in a lesion volume that constitutes approximately 48.4% of the excised area. Given the high-resistance lever mechanisms in the usage scenario, auxiliary tensiles utilizing RF transmitters are introduced. Simulation analysis confirms that this method reduces the tool’s maximum hinge forces and torques to one-quarter of its original value. Finally, comprehensive experiments validate the feasibility of the gripping tool in MIS.},

This paper investigates surgical robots’ optimal configuration by considering variations in the operator’s suturing accuracy and muscle burden across trials and between individual operators. The design factors were the motion scale, viewing angle, pivot point, tip length, and needle gripping angle. We developed a virtual surgical simulator implementing haptic feedback. As 20 participants manipulated the simulator in three trials for 27 surgical robot configurations, we evaluated each participant’s suturing error and joint burden. Considering the variation among trial and individual differences, we investigated the best-fitted probability distribution model, calculated the expectation and deviation in each index using the reliability design method, and constructed the response surface for the relationship between factors. Furthermore, we optimized the surgical robot using the satisficing trade-off method. Finally, when comparing theoretical and experimental values for the best solution, relative errors in suturing error and muscle burden were less than 7.14% and 15.1%, respectively. Moreover, the optimized surgical robot improved suturing error and joint energy by 18% relative to the average values across the 27 configurations.},

  abstract     = {Little attention has been paid to how scoliosis movements deviate from intact spines and the consequent response to surgical instrumentation. Embedding such deviations into scoliosis simulation models can significantly improve their predictive capability for surgical outcome and to mitigate complication risks and thus bring more satisfaction to patients and clinicians. Scoliosis models are mainly intact spine models adapted by merely adjusting model parameters to produce scoliotic-like asymmetry, overlooking that the scoliosis condition results in significant deviations of movements. Thus, these adapted models might provide misleading predictive information. This paper aims to uncover the behaviors emerging out of scoliotic spine movements for simulation. A multibody model with micro-scale motion segments was utilized to study movement of nine adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients. Statistical analysis was used to identify the shared movement behavior and to test their significance in terms of occurrence and their effects on the simulation results and prediction accuracy. Four movement behaviors were uncovered: (1) negligible change of spinal length, (2) bounded rotational displacements, (3) unilateral rotational displacements of certain vertebrae, (4) negligible rotational displacements around inflection vertebrae. Simulation results were improved significantly by incorporating these findings: location and orientation errors of vertebrae from $2.9\pm 2$ .5 mm to $1.1\pm 0$ .4 mm and $2.0\pm 1.3^{\circ }$ to $1.0\pm 0.4^{\circ }$ , respectively, approximation error of spine curvature from $2.1\pm 2$ .0 mm to $0.6\pm 0$ .3 mm. Therefore, scoliosis exhibits unique movements, and it is essential that scoliosis models comply for improved predictive capability.},

All sensors are manufactured using inexpensive off-the-shelf components. The proposed sensor system was characterized on a robotic test bench and validated in a colon phantom study. The results demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed sensor fusion approach in colonoscopy which has the potential for safer and more effective inspection of the bowels.

To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation approach for surgical instruments, leveraging Dropout-enhanced Dual Heads and Coarse-Grained classification branch (D2HCG). The proposed approach comprises dropout-enhanced dual heads for diverse feature representation, and a coarse-grained classification branch for capturing complexities across varying granularities. This incorporates consistency loss functions targeting fine-grained features and coarse-grained granularities, aiming to reduce cross-scene domain gaps. Afterwards, we perform experiments in cross-scene surgical-instrument semantic segmentation cases, with the experimental results reporting the effectiveness for the proposed approach, compared with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation ones.},

  abstract     = {Skin cancer affects over 2 million people worldwide each year. Although dermoscopy is the gold standard screening technique, it only assesses the superficial features of skin lesions. Novel approaches based on thermal investigation have revealed a correlation between thermal recovery and vascular pattern alterations, which is an important factor in discriminating malignant and benign lesions. In this study, a dynamic thermal-imaging system was designed, developed, and validated in a real clinical scenario. The system is non-invasive, compact, and cost-effective, comprising a cooling probe and an image acquisition system equipped with RGB and thermal cameras. The system incorporates a machine-learning classification algorithm for skin cancer screening. The system showed an accuracy of 89.7% in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions in a case study involving 58 patients and classified sub-classes of lesions (i.e., melanoma and nevi) with an accuracy of 95.5%. These findings underscore the potential benefit of the proposed dynamic thermal-imaging system as a support tool for non-invasive screening and early detection of malignant skin lesions.},

  abstract     = {The optimized hardware implementation of neurons and biological cells in the neuromorphic domain is of significant importance. In this paper, a novel method is presented that reduces any number of nonlinear terms in the differential equations describing the behavior of neurons or biological cells with a common variable to a single nonlinear term with high precision. This approach significantly improves implementation efficiency by reducing hardware resource consumption while maintaining high frequency and accuracy. The proposed method was applied to Cardiac Purkinje Fiber Cells, and its validity was demonstrated through time-domain analysis, noise condition analysis, Lyapunov stability analysis, and bifurcation analysis to validate the model under various conditions. These validations ensure the accuracy and stability of the proposed approach across different operating conditions. To assess large-scale applicability, the model was tested in a 300-cell Purkinje fiber network, demonstrating accurate synchronization, equilibrium states, and cross-spectral consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. The digital hardware implementation on a Virtex-7 FPGA board demonstrated a frequency improvement of 3.49 times compared to the original model and 1.79 times compared to the best implementation of this model to date. We also simulated a network of 4500 cells to analyze correlation and implemented it on hardware to demonstrate that the proposed model, based on the method presented in this paper, can efficiently and accurately scale to large-scale applications. This efficient and scalable approach paves the way for applications in medical research, bioengineering, and neuromorphic hardware development, including the creation of hardware-accelerated tools for simulating biological systems, designing bio-inspired devices, and enabling large-scale real-time simulations for understanding and treating cardiac or neurological conditions.},

  abstract     = {Colonoscopy is considered the gold standard for detecting and diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. While colonoscopy is generally safe and effective at reducing CRC mortality, lesions can be missed during procedures, with adverse impacts on the patient. Latest innovations in hardware and software led to the development of adjunct tools for complementing standard colonoscopy to ensure optimal outcomes. Such tools aim to enhance the detection of lesions, standardize procedures, enhance safety, and minimize discomfort. Ultimately, they contribute to reducing the morbidity and mortality rates associated with CRC. This survey comprehensively explores both clinically tested and emerging advanced hardware and software adjunct tools, categorizing them based on their role in targeting three clinical challenges: mucosal visualization, lesion detection and classification, and navigation and procedure assessment. Moreover, this analysis allows exploring synergistic strategies for the future of the practice, with a focus on the promising role of AI-embedded robotic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) replaced traditional open surgeries to reduce scarring and blood loss. This procedure involves making small abdominal incisions for the placement of instruments and a laparoscope that provides visual access for the surgeon. Initially, an assistant held the laparoscope throughout the procedure, however, with technological advances, teleoperated systems have emerged where surgeons controlled it with bodily impulses. More recently, automated systems have been introduced where the camera is repositioned using image processing and artificial intelligence. This study systematically reviews the advancements in laparoscope camera control over the past decade. It involved searching PubMed and Web of Science until 1st September 2023, using keywords such as “MIS control”, “MIS holders” and “robotics in MIS”, yielding 905 publications. After reviewing abstracts, 71 studies were selected for full reading and classified into manual, teleoperated, automated, or hybrid control systems. This results found diverse innovative approaches to laparoscope camera control, however, few automatic methods have yet been validated in clinics. In the last five years, automatic and hybrid systems have increased significantly, approaching the number of teleoperated solutions. In the future, it is expected that these systems will improve precision and reduce the workload of medical teams.},

  abstract     = {The development of procedure-specific surgical robots has become essential for tackling complex clinical challenges. Flexible bronchoscope robots (FBRs) have emerged over the past decade, revealing broad prospects for the safe, precise, and reliable diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPNs), which is crucial for enabling early lung cancer treatment. However, in advancing FBR development, roboticists sometimes stray from or overlook practical surgical considerations, which might impede its clinical implementation. This review aims to bridge this gap by offering an engineering-focused perspective enriched with critical medical insights to drive the clinical translation of next-generation FBRs. We begin by highlighting the medical significance and current state of FBR research. Then, we outline the “ambient environments” of FBRs: the supported procedure, robotic system, steering tools, and deployment modes. Subsequently, we summarize recent progress in FBR technology, focusing on two key areas: procedure-specific design and modeling to improve intervention capabilities, and autonomous navigation and control strategies to enhance autonomy. Based on the given analysis, we discuss the development directions of next-generation FBRs according to the current clinical challenges and the engineering approaches to their realization.},

  abstract     = {Contact force sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling precise and safe manipulations in surgical robotics. While traditional force sensing methods predominantly rely on physical sensors, they encounter significant limitations including integration complexity, limited durability, and scalability constraints in surgical environments. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of vision-based force sensing approaches that leverage computer vision and image processing techniques to infer contact forces without dedicated physical sensors. The survey systematically analyzes state-of-the-art methodologies encompassing vision-based force estimation, surface deformation analysis, and machine learning-driven perception frameworks. The underlying principles, algorithmic architectures, and surgical applications of these approaches are examined in detail. Critical challenges including real-time processing requirements, robustness to environmental variations, and cross-task generalizability are thoroughly investigated. The survey highlights the distinctive advantages of purely vision-based approaches, including reduced hardware complexity, enhanced adaptability, and seamless integration potential with existing surgical robotic platforms. Furthermore, this work identifies critical open research questions and promising future directions for advancing vision-based force sensing technologies in next-generation surgical robotics.
