  abstract     = {Synchronous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and autonomous navigation technology are fundamental to the intelligence and automation of robots and they represent important research directions in intelligent transportation. This paper proposes an enhanced mapping algorithm based on Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to address the high precision demands of indoor robot autonomous navigation. The proposed system integrates a Kalman filter to fuse output data from multiple sensors, including a laser odometer, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and wheel odometer, achieving precise multi-sensor fusion for localization. Additionally, the system combines the A $^{\ast }$ algorithm with the pure pursuit autonomous navigation algorithm to optimize autonomous navigation performance. Visual information processing incorporates Yolov5 for data augmentation and scene recognition, thereby improving the system’s environmental perception. Experimental validation demonstrates an average mapping accuracy of 0.032 meters and an average navigation accuracy of 0.05 meters. The CPS architecture is highly effective for high-precision mapping and autonomous navigation in unknown and complex indoor environments, demonstrating the ability to improve localization and mapping accuracy in complex indoor environments.},

  abstract     = {Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) enhance safety and mobility by integrating cyber and physical transportation systems. A key component of T-CPS is the Digital Twin (DT), a virtual representation that enables simulation, analysis, and optimization through real-time data exchange and communication. Although existing studies have explored DTs for vehicles, communications, pedestrians, and traffic, real-world validations and implementations of DTs that encompass infrastructure, vehicles, signals, and communications remain limited due to several challenges. These include accessing real-world connected infrastructure, integrating heterogeneous, multi-sourced data, ensuring real-time data processing, and synchronizing the digital and physical systems. To address these challenges, this study develops a traffic DT based on a real-world connected vehicle corridor. Leveraging the Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) infrastructure in the corridor, along with communication, computing, and simulation technologies, the DT accurately replicates physical vehicle behaviors, signal timing, communications, and traffic patterns within the virtual environment. Building upon the previous data pipeline, the digital system ensures robust synchronization with the physical environment. Moreover, the DT’s scalable and redundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting future large-scale C-V2X deployments. Lastly, the DT’s ability to provide feedback to the physical system is demonstrated through applications such as signal timing adjustments, vehicle advisory messages, and incident notifications. The proposed DT is a vital tool in T-CPS, enabling real-time traffic monitoring, prediction, and optimization to enhance the safety and mobility of transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and reliable traffic speed data prediction is crucial for Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS), as it directly impacts real-time traffic management, safety control, and overall system efficiency. However, existing deep learning-based traffic speed data prediction methods often require extensive training data and lack interpretability in their predictions. Although matrix and tensor factorization-based approaches enhance interpretability, the performance of these approaches is challenged in scenarios with extremely sparse observed data. These challenges greatly undermine the reliability of predictions and compromise the safety control of T-CPS. To alleviate these shortcomings, this paper proposes a Collaborative Bayesian Tensor Factorization (CBTF) method and applies it to the cloud-edge collaborative traffic speed data prediction scenario. By utilizing a shared factor matrix for collaborative tensor factorization, the proposed method can effectively predict missing data even with extremely limited observed data. For model learning, a posterior estimation method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is developed within a Bayesian framework. This approach not only provides point estimates for traffic speed predictions but also offers interval estimates, greatly improving the reliability and interpretability of the results. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several existing approaches. Moreover, collaborative learning experiments reveal the superiority of the proposed approach, particularly in scenarios with a large number of edge nodes in a collaborative learning framework, and each edge node’s data is extremely sparse. Finally, the evaluation of the prediction interval validates the reliability of the proposed method.},

A distributed intelligent trust management strategy (ITMS), is presented to mitigate potential internal attackers and false messages in VTCPS. Given the attributes of VTCPS, the system assesses the trustworthiness of vehicle nodes within the network with an enhanced subjective logic model that integrates both direct and indirect trust, thereby building trust connections among nodes based on their contact histories. The reliability of communications is assessed based on node trust and inter-node distance, while deceptive messages and malevolent nodes inside the network are detected according to the trust evaluation outcomes. To assess the efficacy of the proposed method, four distinct assault scenarios were devised, and comparative experiments were executed on the Veins vehicular network simulation platform to evaluate the performance of the ITMS scheme under diverse attack conditions. The experimental findings indicate that the ITMS scheme can proficiently counteract diverse attacks in VTCPS and can still detect the majority of fraudulent messages and malevolent nodes, even with a 40% ratio of malicious nodes. Furthermore, the efficacy of the ITMS scheme markedly surpasses that of the baseline scheme, which consists of a subjective logic model and a distance-based weighted voting mechanism.},

Invisible watermarking, which ensures reliable information traceability without compromising carrier quality, holds significant potential for TCPS. However, achieving high robustness in the real world while maintaining imperceptibility is a challenge. To address this, we propose DGWW (Dual-discriminator GAN-based WaveFusion Watermarking), a novel invisible watermarking method that balances robustness and imperceptibility. The GAN-based approach is well suited for TCPS, as it enables adaptive watermark embedding aligned with the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of transportation data, effectively handling diverse noise conditions and data types. DGWW integrates a WaveFusion Encoding Module, a Dual-Focus Discriminator, and a contrastive learning-based optimization strategy to enhance watermark embedding without degrading robustness. These components leverage multi-frequency information, assess local and global impacts on image quality, and guide model optimization. Experimental results show that DGWW outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and robustness under various noise conditions, offering a robust and scalable solution for image watermarking in TCPS environments. By maintaining data usability and strong resistance to noise attacks, DGWW advances digital watermarking in intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) offer a promising glimpse into a future where transportation is smarter, safer, and more streamlined. Nevertheless, as AVs continue to interact with conventional vehicles (CVs), the potential for increased complexities and challenges cannot be overlooked, such as the frozen robot problem. This study proposes a regret-based model for motion planning responsibilities, encompassing self-respect and courtesy for conflicting personal interests. By incorporating these reciprocal responsibilities, socially compatible driving behaviors are promoted, and uncertainties in behavior are also reduced. A Self-Respect-Courtesy (SR-C) plane is further introduced, illustrating the interaction intensity and tendency. To navigate the trade-offs of responsibilities in varying situations, the concept of environmental niche is provided. Niches help to characterize the outcomes of specific actions with the resulting conditions to fulfill responsibilities. Finally, a hierarchical multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to calibrate the proposed model with NGSIM highway lane-changing cases. We found that the proposed model can significantly improve the calibration results and reduce the predictions error of mandatory lane changes by up to 20%. Moreover, the cross-entropy error also significantly decreases in a stable stage, indicating that responsible actions can safely reduce the behavior uncertainties of interactions. Our research revealed that drivers prioritize courtesy responsibility in discretionary lane changes with more consistency, whereas their self-respect preferences are stronger but show more variability in mandatory lane changes. These findings provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of interactions.},

  abstract     = {In underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs), source nodes serving as data centers hold significant commercial value and strategic importance, and the leakage of their location information may result in immeasurable negative consequences. Presently, the methods employed to protect the location privacy of source nodes within UASNs face challenges such as limited network security duration, high node energy consumption, and prolonged data transmission delays. Additionally, security research has predominantly focused on passive attacks, with insufficient provisions against active threats. To address these issues, this study proposes a polygonal phantom source position privacy protection algorithm based on a secure zone (PPSZ) in autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV)-aided UASNs. First, a polygonal secure zone is defined with the source node at its center. Phantom nodes are strategically selected from nodes situated outside this zone, leveraging the relative angles between nodes to deter passive attacks while mitigating data transmission delays. Next, the selection of relay nodes is optimized using the Q-learning algorithm, where each node adjusts its selection strategy based on real-time feedback, further lowering node energy consumption. Finally, auxiliary nodes are deployed using a nonuniform clustering strategy to collectively transmit interference signals, effectively disrupt active attacks, and ensure the secure transmission of source data. Simulation results demonstrate that the PPSZ algorithm can better balance the relationships among safety time, node energy consumption, and data transmission delays.},

This methodology initially implements batch normalization techniques to enhance the training process of the deep neural network, subsequently utilizing the quasi-Newton method for optimization to successfully approximate the ideal answer. According to the experimental results, the QNRLO algorithm’s loss function and normalized computation rate have converged after 2,000 iterations, demonstrating the algorithm’s excellent stability and dependability. The findings demonstrate that the computational load and training time can be further optimized by appropriately adjusting certain parameters without compromising convergence performance. Furthermore, the technique incorporates system transmission time allocation into the TCPS model, hence augmenting the model’s practicality.

This paper proposes an Entity and Relation-Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval (ERA-CR) framework, addressing the limitations of traditional video retrieval methods in representing entity relationships and aligning complex semantics in traffic scenarios. In the visual modality, DETR3D and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) are utilized to extract object-level features and construct spatial relationship graphs, capturing interactions among dynamic entities.

A Transformer-based dynamic multi-scale fusion module integrates global and local features, facilitating fine-grained semantic alignment. Additionally, a contrastive learning-based alignment loss ensures robust consistency in the shared embedding space. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ERA-CR, achieving R@1 of 62.7% and MAP of 75.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

However, these systems face significant challenges, such as computational complexity and the ability to handle ambiguous inputs like shadows in complex environments. This paper introduces a Quantum Deep Convolutional Neural Network (QDCNN) designed to enhance the safety and reliability of CPS in transportation by leveraging quantum algorithms. At the core of QDCNN is the UU $\dagger $ method, which is utilized to improve shadow detection through a propagation algorithm that trains the centroid value with preprocessing and postprocessing operations to classify shadow regions in images accurately. The proposed QDCNN is evaluated on three datasets on normal conditions and one road affected by rain to test its robustness. It outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, achieving a shadow detection time of just 0.0049352 seconds, faster than classical algorithms like intensity-based thresholding (0.03 seconds), chromaticity-based shadow detection (1.47 seconds), and local binary pattern techniques (2.05 seconds). This remarkable speed, superior accuracy, and noise resilience demonstrate QDCNN’s —key factors for safe navigation in autonomous transportation in real-time. This research demonstrates the potential of quantum-enhanced models in addressing critical limitations of classical methods, contributing to more dependable and robust autonomous transportation systems within the CPS framework.},

  abstract     = {Digital twins-enabled transportation cyber-physical systems are employed in the transportation sector to enhance environmental quality, mobility, and safety. They are digital representations of transportation networks, enable the simulation of these networks’ behavior under various conditions. They can be employed in various transportation sectors, including forecasting traffic congestion, facilitate the optimization of flow and safety, enhance the efficiency of public transportation, improve the efficiency of freight transportation by offering support in this process, facilitates the consideration of future multimodal infrastructure development requirements, furnish drivers with up-to-date information about weather alerts, road closures, and traffic situations in real time, assess numerous aspects like, impacts of various mobility operators, transport users, and environmental conditions. However, the real-time data synchronization in digital twins-enabled transportation cyber-physical systems is accomplished using an open communication channel. Regrettably, the utilization of virtual-reality synthesizing security threats in the network necessitates the implementation of stringent privacy and security procedures, including authentication, encryption, and signature approaches. This study proposes a quantum-key-distribution (QKD)-based authentication protocol for secure communication of digital twins-enabled transportation cyber-physical systems. The integrated quantum in the system ensures the compactness and verifiability of data. The protocol’s security is examined using the Scyhter tool and is verified to be secure by informal security analysis. The proposed scheme achieves its efficiency over current solutions. Moreover, the latest technology and techniques are used to examine the operational capabilities and security features.},

However, the increasing interconnectedness of T-CPS exposes them to sophisticated cyberattacks, necessitating robust intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard against evolving threats. This paper aims to enhance the security of T-CPS by addressing two key challenges: effective anomaly detection and handling imbalanced datasets in intrusion detection tasks. In this paper, we propose ReMeNet (Reconstruction Memory Network), a novel intrusion detection model that combines a memory module with a GAN-based architecture to enhance anomaly detection and data reconstruction. To address the challenge of imbalanced datasets, we incorporate a Vector Quantized Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-WGAN) to generate additional samples for underrepresented attack categories, thereby balancing the dataset and improving detection performance. Experimental evaluation on the UNSW-NB15 dataset demonstrates that ReMeNet achieves an accuracy of 91.70%, and an F1-score of 91.63% which outperforms Random Forest by 8.02% and EC-GAN by 3.01%. The results show that ReMeNet effectively handles imbalanced data, improving detection rates across all attack categories in T-CPS.},

  abstract     = {In transportation cyber-physical systems, real-time calculations of crowd density can provide traffic managers with important decision support to help optimise traffic flow and prevent congestion and safety accidents. However, crowd density estimation in complex traffic scenarios requires a comprehensive response to the challenges of background noise interference, dense occlusion, and scale variation. To address these issues, we propose a novel cross-level attention multi-scale context-enhanced crowd counting network (CAMCNet). First, we explore the feasibility of the ResNeXt network as a backbone for crowd counting. The residual structure of the ResNeXt model facilitates the generation of hierarchical scale features. Second, the high-level features extracted by this backbone lack detailed information, hindering the acquisition of accurate spatial location information of the crowd. Therefore, we present a high-level feature enhancement module to further refine the perception of multi-scale context and orientation features. Third, we design a cross-level attention feature fusion module to adaptively aggregate enhanced deep features and shallow features to better cope with the challenges of complex background interference and scale variations simultaneously. Finally, to enhance the robustness of network training, we introduce smooth L1 loss into the overall loss function. On four benchmark datasets, extensive experiments show that CAMCNet outperforms the vast majority of the most advanced methods. In particular, CAMCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale mainstream benchmarks (UCF-QNRF and NWPU) in terms of the MAE.},

  abstract     = {Driver fatigue detection is a critical challenge in Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS), where existing methods often face significant limitations. Conventional approaches typically struggle with issues such as limited accuracy, slow convergence, and high computational costs. These methods often fail to capture the complex temporal and spatial patterns inherent in multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG and EOG, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that leverages Depthwise Separable Convolutional Neural Networks (DSCNNs) for driver fatigue detection. Our method integrates electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) signals through an innovative feature extraction and fusion process, enhancing the system’s ability to detect fatigue with high accuracy and efficiency. The DSCNN model is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional methods by utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which reduce computational complexity while maintaining robust performance. We validate our approach using the SEED-VIG dataset and the NTHU drowsy driver dataset, which encompasses a range of driving conditions. The DSCNN model outperforms conventional models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, DSCNN achieves the highest F1 score and the lowest time per epoch, making it highly suitable for real-time applications in T-CPS. This advancement represents a significant improvement in driver safety by providing more timely and reliable fatigue warnings, thus advancing the capabilities of intelligent transportation systems.},

These challenges stem from the multidomain nature of the IoV and threats such as data leaks and model-finding attacks, which complicate data processing and model training. To address these issues, in this study, we proposed federated multi-domain learning for IoV (FMD-IoV). FMD-IoV addresses data heterogeneity by employing clustered techniques to group similar viewpoints and multidomain machine learning to map diverse data types into a unified feature space. To address the system heterogeneity caused by diverse vehicle types, the framework introduces a similarity-based aggregation method and model weight de-regularization to enhance robustness and generalizability. Experimental results demonstrated that FMD-IoV reduced the mean square error (MSE) by 0.05 on the Synthia dataset and 0.13 on the CityScape dataset compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it maintained or improved the MSE as the number of nodes increased, demonstrating its adaptability to complex scenarios and large-scale data.

  abstract     = {In the context of transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS), backdoor attacks leveraging traffic images have emerged as a significant security threat. As T-CPS increasingly relies on visual information, such as real-time images captured by traffic cameras, for tasks like traffic sign recognition and autonomous driving, the risk of image-based backdoor attacks has grown substantially. Although various detection-based defense techniques have shown some success in identifying backdoored models, they often fail to fully eliminate backdoor effects, leaving residual security risks. To address this challenge, we propose a Frequency-Domain Hybrid Distillation (FDHD) method for backdoor defense, which effectively weakens the association between backdoor triggers and target labels by combining distillation mechanisms in both the frequency and pixel domains. Furthermore, we design a loss function that integrates feature reconstruction with adaptive alignment, enhancing the student network’s ability to mimic the teacher network and thereby bolstering the backdoor defense capability. Extensive experiments conducted by FDHD on multiple benchmark datasets against the five latest attacks demonstrate that our proposed defense method effectively reduces backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting clean samples. This approach will protect against image-based backdoor attacks in T-CPS and lay the foundation for enhancing future traffic safety.},

However, transportation cyber-physical systems often employ a highly centralized architecture, which inherently exposes them to the risk of single point failures. Moreover, the advent of quantum computing presents a formidable challenge, as quantum computers can exploit the parallelism of quantum bits and quantum entanglement to swiftly decrypt conventional encryption algorithms, thereby jeopardizing system security. Blockchain technology, distinguished by its decentralized and immutable nature, offers a robust foundation of trust for transportation cyber-physical systems. It mitigates the risks associated with centralized systems and quantum computing threats. In this paper, we introduce a supervised blockchain system tailored for transportation cyber-physical systems. Our proposed system harnesses the power of group signature techniques to leverage blockchain’s supervisory capabilities. To surpass the limitations of traditional signature schemes, particularly in the face of quantum computing, we present a novel post-quantum group signature scheme. Building on this post-quantum signature scheme, we unveil a controllable anonymous blockchain model equipped with a supervision mechanism. This model strikes a delicate balance between anonymity and control, making it an ideal solution for the unique challenges faced by transportation cyber-physical systems. The resulting blockchain system is not only secure and reliable but also adaptable and anonymous, ensuring its suitability for the intricate demands of transportation cyber-physical systems.},

The aim of this work is to develop a secure and efficient control method for EMS in transportation CPS (T-CPS) that can maintain optimal performance while defending against sophisticated, stealthy cyber-attacks. We propose a novel secure output-feedback control method for EMS (SOFC-EMS) in T-CPS that leverages the Kullback-Leibler divergence to characterize attack stealthiness and employs dynamic output-feedback control to maintain system stability and performance. Our approach utilizes ellipsoidal invariant reachable sets to analyze system behavior under various attack scenarios and optimizes controller parameters through convex optimization techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed SOFC-EMS method significantly reduces the reachable set volume, indicating improved system security. The method also performs better in practical EMS scenarios, reducing average ambulance response time and maintaining higher system safety scores under increasing attack frequencies. We demonstrate the method’s adaptability to different urban traffic patterns and attack intensities through consistent performance across various system parameters.

CPS integrates computational algorithms with physical components, offering advantages over traditional manual inspections, which are slow and prone to false positives, especially in complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents the LEE-YOLO model, a novel and lightweight solution that leverages drones within a CPS framework to enable efficient road crack detection. The model incorporates a streamlined network built upon the YOLOv8n model and introduces an innovative lightweight fusion structure, SGC2f, which uses grouped convolutions and linear operations to reduce model weight and complexity markedly.

Furthermore, the Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (EMA) module in the model’s backbone layer is designed to reduce redundant data and improve the extraction of relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the LEE-YOLO model outperforms YOLOv8n, achieving a 4.3% higher precision and a 4.0% improvement in mean average precision (mAP). Importantly, it achieves a 43.5% reduction in weight and a 39.5% decrease in computational demand, effectively balancing performance and efficiency.

  abstract     = {In the context of rapidly growing city road networks, understanding complex traffic patterns and implementing effective safety monitoring through advanced Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems (T-CPS) has become increasingly challenging. This involves understanding spatial relationships and non-linear temporal associations. Accurately predicting traffic in such scenarios, particularly for long-term sequences, is challenging due to the complexity of the data. Traditional ways of predicting traffic flow use a single fixed graph structure based on location. This structure does not consider possible correlations and cannot fully capture long-term temporal relationships among traffic flow data, thereby limiting the system ability to ensure safety and reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel traffic prediction framework called Attention-based Spatio-temporal Multi-scale Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (ASTMGCNet). This study introduces a novel framework designed to improve prediction accuracy in dynamic urban traffic systems by effectively capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations through multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms. ASTMGCNet records changing features of space and time by combining Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). Its design incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and dual attention mechanisms, effectively capturing informative patterns at different levels of detail. This strategic design allows ASTMGCNet to effectively capture complex spatio-temporal correlations within traffic sequences, enhancing prediction accuracy. We have tested this method on two different real-world datasets and found that ASTMGCNet predicts significantly better than other methods, demonstrating its potential to advance traffic flow prediction and improve safety and reliability in T-CPS applications.},

Previous attempts to enhance security, such as dynamic anonymization and trusted key management, have introduced new challenges, including complex authentication processes, high resource demands, and inadequate privacy protection. To overcome these issues, we propose a lightweight and efficient authentication scheme that enhances vehicle privacy and security through a combination of signatures, pseudonyms, batch verification, and flexible certificate management. Our approach also employs Bloom filters to improve authentication efficiency, addressing the limitations of traditional certificate management systems that suffer from large lists and slow query times. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme ensures comprehensive security by providing two-way authentication and guaranteeing anonymity.

  abstract     = {The rapid evolution of transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS) has led to unprecedented advancements in mobility and efficiency. However, ensuring the safety and reliability of these complex systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in verifying and refining their temporal behaviors. This paper presents a novel compositional approach for temporal behavior analysis and synthesis in safety-critical T-CPS, the safety-critical temporal analysis, and refinement for the T-CPS (STAR-TCPS) framework, which combines iterative compositional verification with L*-based learning techniques to analyze and refine timing behaviors efficiently. The method leverages the clock constraint specification language for high-level timing specifications and introduces a systematic refinement process to transform abstract requirements into implementable task models. The framework incorporates innovative constraint handling mechanisms tailored for T-CPS, addressing unique challenges such as vehicle-to-infrastructure communication delays and adaptive traffic management timing. Experimental evaluations, including a case study on an intelligent vehicle system, demonstrate STAR-TCPS’s superiority over existing methods. Results show significant improvements in verification time (up to 63% reduction), memory usage (44% decrease), and task generation efficiency (18-25% fewer tasks) compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The STAR-TCPS framework enhances T-CPS’s safety and reliability by enabling more efficient verification and refinement of critical timing properties, paving the way for safer and more robust transportation systems.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the smooth operation of road traffic is a momentous target in Intelligent Transportation Systems, which can be expedited by a secure and reliable Internet of Vehicles (IoV). As prominent carriers of the IoV, intelligent vehicles (IVs), that bear the promising potential for alleviating traffic congestion, have become the core road traffic participants. However, the mixed-traffic environment escalates the risk of IVs, as the discretionary lane change behaviors of nearby human-driven vehicles may result in collisions with IVs, compromising the robust performance of the IoV. Recent studies have utilized advanced deep learning techniques to achieve proactive lane change intention prediction, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer. Although attaining reasonable prediction performance, they adopt the data-driven paradigm, which excessively focuses on learning from data while neglecting the domain knowledge. Against this background, we propose to employ the knowledge-driven paradigm and design KLEP, a knowledge-driven lane change prediction framework. KLEP incorporates driving knowledge into lane change modeling, presenting the top-down hierarchical cognitive process of drivers when performing lane change maneuvers. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world natural driving datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KLEP. Compared to state-of-the-art lane change prediction baselines, KLEP consistently outperforms them and achieves average improvements of 6.2-7.1% and 53.0-67.2% on intention classification and intention forecast tasks across different datasets, respectively. We also validate that KLEP has strong interpretability that aligns with real-world physical laws in lane change scenarios and is lightweight enough to fulfill online prediction.},

  abstract     = {Interest in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) has increased significantly with the development of 6G. Owning an extremely high transmission speed, 6G is able to support low-latency service for edge-intelligence applications by Machine Learning(ML) techniques. However, traditional centralized learning is not suitable for this scenario due to the requirement for users to upload local data to the server, which can compromise data privacy. To overcome this challenge, Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL), as progressive distributed learning techniques, have been proposed as a solution. They enable the training of ML models while preserving data privacy. However, conventional FL has poor convergence when data heterogeneity occurs, also fails to meet personalized demands. To address these issues, We propose a novel personalized Federated Learning(pFL) framework, which trains models in SL and collaborates in FL. It offers a personalized solution for each client while retaining a global solution for newcomers. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other advanced baselines on benchmark datasets.},

This method is particularly suitable for adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in cyber-physical system (CPS) environments, as it can effectively handle the dynamic uncertainty and external disturbances of the system. Thus, this paper develops a novel online adaptive $H_{\infty }$ control scheme for ACC systems. The main contribution of our study lies in achieving model-free learning by using the homotopy strategy, removing the necessity of prior model knowledge of initial stabilizing control policies, which has been a significant challenge in existing policy learning and ACC studies. This resolves a long-standing issue and enhances the applicability of our findings. For this purpose, a continuous time ACC system is first constructed with unknown system dynamics. Then, based a designed offline policy learning algorithm, a novel online policy algorithm based on system input-output data is introduced to solve the Riccati equation without any model information. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control method significantly improves system performance, especially in terms of computational speed, it has improved by about 45% compared to classical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.},

T-CPS covers land, air, and underwater domains involving vehicles, drones, and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), facilitating our lives and creating productivity. However, underwater T-CPS faces greater difficulties and challenges than the first two areas. On the one side, underwater equipment is generally expensive and thus requires a high level of safety. On the other side, the complexity of the marine environment causes uncertainty in the control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an expert experience-enhanced control approach designed to enhance AUV reliability and safety. Firstly, we model AUV cluster control, including the complex underwater environment and cooperative control strategy, and refine this problem into a Markov decision problem (MDP) model based on the leader-follower strategy. Subsequently, a multi-agent reinforcement learning cluster control algorithm is developed on the framework of Centralized Training Distributed Execution (CTDE) to improve the learning and exploration capabilities of AUVs. Finally, we propose an expert experience-enhanced strategy that reduces the impact of non-smooth environments and also ameliorates the limitation of relying exclusively on rule-based experience. Experiments compare the linear and triangular AUV formation control tasks, and the proposed approach shows promising superiority and possesses sound stability in dynamically changing environments.},

This paper proposes a novel giant armadillo optimized model predictive controller (GAO-MPC) method for dynamically controlling the phases and cycles of traffic lights in a remote intersection. The GAO strategy is applied to enhance the parameters of the MPC. The goal of the effort is to create an enhanced, adaptable technology that could be acquired off-the-shelf, eschewing intricate and costly computational techniques that would make it more difficult to use in real-world situations. An IEEE 802.15.4-based WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) during actual traffic surveillance is combined into several MPCs, one for every stage, that operate simultaneously to create the suggested traffic light adaptive management system. Every MPC controls the turning motion of automobiles and continually alters the traffic light’s phase and green period. The suggested system integrates the pros associated with employing simultaneous MPCs enhanced effectiveness, tolerance for faults, and assistance for phase-specific management with the advantages of the WSN, including ease of installation and management, inexpensiveness, and adaptability. The GAO-MPC approach improves traffic flow, decreases vehicle paths, and adjusts dynamically to different traffic situations, making it superior to conventional fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and programmable logic controller (PLC) systems. The suggested technique outperforms the current alternatives in published research and opens the door for increased adoption because it drastically cuts down on car queues.},

Due to its open-access environment, vehicular networking presents significant security problems in assuring message reliability and vehicle trustworthiness. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a framework for managing trust in cars for safe transportation in cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). This framework builds on existing blockchain-based trust management systems to address issues with scalability and ineffective consensus approaches. The framework is divided into three modules: message trust evaluation, vehicle trust update, and trust block generation and agreement. The message trust evaluation module evaluates message reliability by taking into account both direct and indirect vehicle trust over T-CPS. This assessment leads to the identification of misleading messages originating from malicious nodes. Within the T-CPS trust update module, the aim is to mitigate any malicious actions vehicles perform successfully by adjusting the level of trust assigned to each vehicle in T-CPS, which is determined by evaluating the messages received and considering the vehicle’s past behaviour. Ultimately, the effectiveness of the framework is confirmed through simulation studies. The experimental results show clear enhancements in scalability and resilience using the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Safety is of vital importance to transportation cyber-physical systems (T-CPS). With the deeper integration of automated vehicles (AVs) in road traffic, safe control algorithms for AVs have become a crucial demand for maintaining the overall safety of T-CPS. One of the major concerns with respect to the DRL-based cyber systems of AVs is the lack of safety guarantees, which may cause physical collisions. Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is a promising way to enhance the safety performance of traditional DRL. However, current SRL methods are designed in a time-triggered (TT) paradigm, where the controller is uniformly triggered in the time domain. Despite the safety enhancement, this TT-SRL paradigm lacks data efficiency in safety-critical scenarios, and most importantly, still cannot guarantee safety during the intervals between time steps. The main objective of this paper is to address the safety issue of the existing TT-SRL methods while improving the data efficiency by proposing an event-triggered SRL (ET-SRL) framework. In the proposed method, safety is guaranteed by designing an additional safe controller to correct the unsafe actions generated by DRL. Event-triggered control barrier functions (CBFs) are used to provide safety constraints in a discrete manner. A state and dynamics synchronization module is also designed to estimate model uncertainties considering both the state dynamics and the input dynamics. The proposed method is trained and applied in simulated car-following experiments. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparison to both DRL-based and model-based baselines in both artificial safety-critical scenarios and a real trajectory dataset.},

  abstract     = {Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser), offering a robust solution for adaptive, safe, and multi-task driving in signal-free intersections. The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios.

  abstract     = {Formation control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) has been regarded as the basis of many sophisticated marine missions. However, the complex marine environment and the weak acoustic communication on AUVs make it hard to achieve the formation task. This paper attempts to overcome the above challenge from graph theory and intelligent learning perspectives. A local topology estimator is first designed by observing the coupled state evolution of AUVs, such that the unknown interaction relationship of AUVs can be inferred on the basic of local sensing. Based on this, we adopt the graph direction and contraction to generate an optimally persistent topology for AUVs, whose aim is to reduce the communication redundancy and guarantee the topology connectivity. With the optimized network topology, a model-free inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) formation controller is developed for AUVs to keep the desired formation shape. The innovations can be summarized as follows: 1) the local topology estimator can reveal the interaction topology relationship of AUVs with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF); 2) the optimally persistent topology can balance energy efficiency and topology connectivity as compared to the neighboring rule-based solutions; 3) the IRL-based formation controller has better adaptability to the underwater unknown environment as compared to the traditional reinforcement learning solutions. Finally, simulation and experimental results are both conducted to verify the effectiveness of our solution.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the challenges of Last Mile Delivery (LMD) in crowdsourced platforms under time and budget constraints. LMD service providers face a continuous increase in demand with limited resources, such as workers and budgets. With tasks that vary in urgency, limited resources often lead to task failures. Furthermore, the increasing number of requesters and workers complicates the governance of the LMD platform, making it difficult to maintain credibility, integrity, and transparency. Current LMD solutions generally focus on route optimization and service acceleration, overlooking the challenge of combined time-critical and budget-constrained tasks. This creates the need for an agile, accelerated, and decentralized LMD framework that can 1) handle tasks instantly upon submission, 2) motivate successful completion based on urgency, and 3) compensate for tasks with deficient budgets to fortify long-term success and avoid failure due to constrained resources. For this purpose, this paper introduces the first Blockchain Hybrid Crowdsourced Auction-based LMD framework (BHCA-LMD), which is designed to effectively manage time and budget constraints. Built on-chain for transparency and decentralization, the framework uses drones and ground vehicles as a hybrid delivery mode for their capabilities in speeding up deliveries. BHCA-LMD incorporates an auctioning system to alleviate failures due to limited budgets, with a feedback mechanism to prevent entities from abusing the platform’s profit for their benefit, ensuring the credibility and reliability of the framework. The evaluation shows an on-time task completion rate of up to 74% with the presence of malicious behavior and a 15% lower gas consumption compared to the closest benchmark.},

  abstract     = {Lane detection is a critical and challenging task in autonomous driving, particularly in real-world scenarios where traffic lanes can be slender, lengthy, and often obscured by other vehicles, complicating detection efforts. Existing anchor-based methods typically rely on prior lane anchors to extract features and subsequently refine the location and shape of lanes. While these methods achieve high performance, manually setting prior anchors is cumbersome, and ensuring sufficient coverage across diverse datasets often requires a large amount of dense anchors. Furthermore, the use of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant predictions complicates real-world deployment and may under-perform in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose Polar R-CNN, an end-to-end anchor-based method for lane detection. By incorporating both local and global polar coordinate systems, Polar R-CNN facilitates flexible anchor proposals and significantly reduces the number of anchors required without compromising performance. Additionally, we introduce a triplet head with heuristic structure that supports NMS-free paradigm, enhancing deployment efficiency and performance in scenarios with dense lanes. Our method achieves competitive results on five popular lane detection benchmarks—Tusimple, CULane, LLAMAS, CurveLanes, and DL-Rail—while maintaining a lightweight design and straightforward structure.

  abstract     = {Recent years have witnessed the growing popularity of e-bike sharing systems (EBSS) due to their enhanced riding comfort and suitability for longer rides, compared to conventional bike sharing systems (BSS). However, similar to BSS, EBSS also suffer from the spatiotemporal supply-demand imbalance. Additionally, the demand loss in EBSS could be caused by not only the shortage of e-bikes but also the insufficiency of battery power. Currently, operators address this imbalance by employing staff-driven trucks to relocate e-bikes and replace batteries, which is costly and environmentally unfriendly. This paper proposes a user-based relocation policy as a complement to the staff-based relocation, aiming to effectively mitigate current challenges. This policy incentivizes users to select e-bikes with more systematically favored battery power levels, taking both the future system states and user preferences into account. This approach aims to achieve better e-bike distribution and utilization across different power levels within the system. Specifically, a multi-battery-state Markov model is developed to estimate the utilities of incentivized relocations, utilizing an approximate state reduction method to simplify high-dimensional calculations. Additionally, an optimization model considering user choice patterns is formulated to determine incentives and e-bike recommendations for concurrent orders, solved by a variable neighborhood search algorithm. Numerical experiments conducted on a real-world EBSS demonstrate that the proposed policy can increase profits by around 10% when implemented independently or integrated with existing staff operations, with only 1% of the revenue used as incentive costs.},

  abstract     = {Demand variations throughout the day and area popularity differences across the city result in spatiotemporal changes in traffic flow. One of the well-known phenomena arising from these changes is tidal traffic, characterized by an imbalance between inbound and outbound traffic on a given road. It reflects the fluctuation in the alignment between transportation system supply and demand. Lane reversal control has been a common supply-side measure for dealing with this urban traffic “sickness” by adapting road capacity allocation to the demand imbalance between two directions of a road. This study investigates the dynamic network capacity allocation control problem in the era of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), which integrates dynamic traffic signal splits and lane reversal controls. Considering the high dimensionality and non-linearity of urban transportation systems, we apply the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) technique to construct a sparse yet sufficiently accurate surrogate model. This model estimates the forthcoming network traffic state based on the current state and implemented control decisions. The surrogate model is integrated into a model predictive control (MPC) method, forming a SINDy-MPC framework to assist in optimal decision-making in real time. The experiments show that the system identified by SINDy exhibits stability in the presence of Gaussian noise disturbances. The proposed dynamic network allocation control scheme can effectively reduce traffic imbalance, improve traffic efficiency, and enhance traffic resilience against cyberattacks.},

Subsequently, the obstacle area of each threatening ice floe is programmed considering the underwater portion. Then the ice floes avoidance guidance with auto-select mechanism for ice-zone traversal mission is constructed by setting the hazard threshold and target point. For the latter, a robust adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) system is designed for the path-following mission, where the control accuracy increases with the number of iterations. The stability of the closed-loop control system is proved with utilization of the Lyapunov theorem.

  abstract     = {Long-tail scenarios are of great significance in improving the testing efficacy of autonomous vehicles, but they are difficult to collect due to their inherent randomness and high risk. The low-cost, high-value videos of vehicle-perspective accidents stored in tachographs provide a potentially important source for long-tail data collection. However, the lack of multisource synchronization information and the unknown, diverse camera parameters in tachograph videos make it difficult for the existing methods to accurately extract key information. In response to these issues, this work proposes a vehicle-perspective accident scenario restoration framework based on tachograph videos. First, using preprocessed accident videos as the input, a scenario semantic understanding module was constructed to help extract the pixel trajectories, conduct parameter calibration, and obtain pixel road boundaries. Then, robust detection and tracking algorithms were used to extract the pixel trajectories. Furthermore, a high-precision calibration algorithm was proposed based on the Geometrically Salient Feature Bundle Adjustment (GSFBA). Finally, the camera parameters were used to perform an inverse perspective transformation on the pixel coordinates, the actual road boundaries were extracted based on the mapping strength of the pixel road boundaries, and the trajectory information was optimized using a systematic trajectory processing module. The proposed method was verified at multiple levels based on both two simulation scenarios and two real-world scenarios. The results show that the proposed framework in this work can obtain the key information of the scenario with a high degree of restoration accuracy. It was effectively applied to the restoration process of accident scenarios.},

Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction model (FMTP) inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, a learnable memory array is designed by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using vector quantization operations during the training phase. The array further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, an advanced reasoning engine based on language models is developed to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.},

First, the vehicle dynamics, which incorporate steering characteristics, are built to quantify human driver’s steering behavior. Additionally, the scenario-oriented driving constraints (SODCs) are established to demonstrate driving constraints from traffic participants, roadside obstacles, and traffic signs. Second, to enhance the rationality and reliability of steering behaviors, the human driver’s steering behavior is evaluated using a fuzzy logic strategy, and HSRL is proposed to simultaneously determine steering actions and allocate driving authority between the human driver and machine. The main advantage of HSRL is its ability to perform both continuous domain learning (CDL) and discrete domain learning (DDL) simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method is validated using a human and hardware-in-the-loop (HHiL) experimental platform. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods in terms of driving safety, comfort and experience.},

However, the widespread implementation of multi-CAV cooperative lane-change is hindered by the lack of efficient verification strategies. This issue is exacerbated by the “curse of dimensionality,” stemming from numerous scenario variables and complex algorithms. To overcome this, we propose an efficient verification strategy that accelerates the process through optimal feature selection. By eliminating variables that have minimal impact on evaluation outcomes yet significantly increase testing complexity, our approach streamlines the verification process, minimizing information loss while maintaining high efficiency. We validated this strategy in various urban and highway scenarios involving multiple CAVs. During the verification process, the dimensionality of scenario variables was reduced, resulting in an exponential decrease in the number of testing scenarios, with information loss limited to no more than 6%. The results demonstrate that our proposed strategy significantly improves the efficiency of verifying cooperative lane-change algorithms in high-dimensional scenario variables, with minimal loss of essential information.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative positioning (CP) is able to improve the vehicular positioning performance by introducing the data of multiple vehicles into the position estimation. However, CP methods are vulnerable to measurement outliers in dense urban areas. The existing outlier-resistant CP methods are easy to trap in local optimum and may wrongly reject the outliers when the ratio of outliers to inliers is relatively high. To deal with this problem, a factor graph optimization (FGO) based CP method using Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC) Welsch cost is proposed in this paper. The state-of-art FGO algorithm is used to integrate multi-node and multi-epoch measurements including the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) pseudoranges, inter-epoch baselines estimated by GNSS time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP), and inter-vehicle ranging measurements in a centralized framework. The least-square cost in traditional FGO is replaced with the GNC-based Welsch cost so as to enhance the robustness of the proposed method to any kind of outliers in our CP system. The use of GNC can reduce the risk of local optimum by gradually increasing the non-convexity of the Welsch cost. The proposed method can de-weight the outliers correctly even if a large number of outliers exist. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over the existing CP methods in resisting multiple outliers.},

  abstract     = {Appropriate interaction with human-driven vehicles is crucial for advancing autonomous vehicles from demonstrations in controlled environments to applications in open-road scenarios. Accurately recognizing and quantifying driver interaction behaviors is essential for understanding their interaction intentions and subsequently formulating suitable responses. Previous studies have primarily focused on the generation of interaction behaviors. However, insufficient attention has been paid to the recognition and quantification of driver interaction behaviors. We establish a higher-order traffic flow network and present mathematical definitions for driver interaction behaviors and their strengths based on this framework. Furthermore, we find that humans identify interaction behaviors during driving by perceiving conflicts between different drivers’ intentions. Therefore, we propose a driver resistance field model (DRFM) to characterize driving intentions and describe these conflicts through operations within the resistance fields, enabling the recognition of interactions. Through computational social experiments and real-world experiments, the DRFM is demonstrated to accurately quantify the strength of driver-driver interactions. The analysis of extensive cases indicates that the quantification from the DRFM effectively capture the dynamics of interaction behaviors, aligning with human cognition of driver interactions, with remarkably higher correlation coefficients compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {While several methods for short-term traffic prediction have been proposed in the literature, modeling the interaction between short-term and long-term traffic dynamics remains a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning architecture named High and Low Frequency Attention Network (HLFNet) with the capability to capture multi-scale spatio-temporal dynamics. HLFNet takes inspiration from the frequency domain analysis in signal processing, where short-term (fast) and long-term (slow) dynamics are characterized in terms of high and low frequency, respectively. Specifically, we design a multi-scale attention block considering multi-grained feature information at different frequencies. The attention block comprises: a high-frequency attention operation for extracting fine-grained information within a local window; a low-frequency attention operation for extracting coarse-grained information within average pooled features. To capture the spatial interactions within the traffic network, HLFNet further considers three spatial embeddings: distance-based, attribute-based and potential-based. Experimental results with real-world traffic datasets using different prediction horizons and granularities show that, no matter how state-of-the-art methods are good at predicting in the short term, they fail to capture long-term trends. On the other hand, HLFNet retains a consistent prediction performance in both the short and the long term, outperforming all tested state-of-the-art methods in long-term traffic prediction.},

  abstract     = {Route planning for a fleet of vehicles is an important task in applications such as package delivery, surveillance, or transportation, often integrated within larger Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This problem is commonly formulated as a Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) known as the Team Orienteering Problem (TOP). Existing solvers for this problem primarily rely on either linear programming, which provides accurate solutions but requires computation times that grow with the size of the problem, or heuristic methods, which typically find suboptimal solutions in a shorter time. In this paper, we introduce TOP-Former, a multi-agent route planning neural network designed to efficiently and accurately solve the Team Orienteering Problem. The proposed algorithm is based on a centralized Transformer neural network capable of learning to encode the scenario (modeled as a graph) and analyze the complete context of all agents to deliver fast, precise, and collaborative solutions. Unlike other neural network-based approaches that adopt a more local perspective, TOP-Former is trained to understand the global situation of the vehicle fleet and generate solutions that maximize long-term expected returns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented system outperforms most state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computation speed.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-assisted Internet of Vehicles (IoV) utilizes flexible mobility of UAVs to improve communication issues in traditional IoV model. In UAV-assisted IoV, UAVs expand the communication coverage of roadside units (RSUs) and support the tasks of RSUs. Therefore, UAV-assisted IoV can contribute to the development of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). However, an adversary can still attempt various attacks because UAV-assisted IoV networks perform wireless communication over open channels. In 2024, Miao et al. proposed an elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based authentication scheme for UAV-assisted IoV. Unfortunately, we discover that their scheme cannot prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) and ephemeral secret leakage (ESL) attacks. Furthermore, Miao et al.’s scheme incurs high computational costs using ECC which is unfavorable for UAVs considering their computational restrictions. In this article, we propose a secure and lightweight authentication scheme for UAV-assisted IoV, considering the computational limitations of UAVs. We apply physical unclonable function (PUF) and fuzzy extractor to mutual authentication, developing the security level. Moreover, the proposed scheme uses only one-way hash functions and exclusive-or (XOR) operations which are compatible with UAVs. To prove the robustness of the proposed scheme, we perform “Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic”, “Real-or-Random (RoR) model”, and “Automated Verification of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA)” based formal security analysis, and informal analysis. Furthermore, we estimate the performance of the proposed scheme and compare with other relevant works, including computational costs, communication costs, energy consumption, security properties, and storage costs. Consequently, we establish that the proposed scheme is appropriate and efficient for UAV-assisted IoV.},

  abstract     = {In a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP), multiple vehicles are planned to travel for serving customers so as to reduce transportation costs in logistics. Taking each CVRP as a task, multiple CVRPs can form a multi-task optimization problem. Based on the similarity between tasks, knowledge transfer methods are developed to improve optimization performance by utilizing the search experience of related tasks. However, existing methods tend to use one task only for knowledge transfer. Indeed, in a target task, the different parts of customer distributions are similar to that of multiple related tasks. The information of multiple source tasks can be fused to assist the optimization of target tasks. Thus, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm with fragment-based knowledge transfer (FKT-GA), which fuses route fragments from multiple related tasks to assist the optimization of target tasks. In FKT-GA, multiple source tasks are selected for each target task based on distribution features that are invariant to rotation, shift, and scaling. Solutions of source tasks are aligned to target spaces for sampling route fragments, which are integrated to construct high-quality solutions for target tasks. In addition, mutation and crossover operators are developed to enhance solution diversity. Experimental results on fifteen 6-task instances show that FKT-GA outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution optimality. The proposed FKT can improve algorithm performance.},

  abstract     = {Efficiency is critical for autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially emergency AVs. However, most existing methods focus on regular vehicles, overlooking the different strategies required by emergency vehicles to address the challenge of maximizing efficiency while ensuring safety. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Agile Decision-Making with Active and Safety-Critical Motion Planning System (IDEAM). IDEAM focuses on enabling emergency AVs, such as ambulances, to actively achieve efficiency in dense traffic scenarios with safety in mind. Firstly, the speed-centric decision-making algorithm named the long short-term spatio-temporal graph-centric decision-making (LSGM) is given. LSGM comprises conditional depth-first search (C-DFS) for multiple path generation as well as methods for speed gains and risk evaluation for path selection, which presents a robust algorithm for high efficiency and safety consideration. Secondly, with an output path from LSGM, the motion planner reconsiders environmental conditions to decide constraint states for the final planning stage, among which the lane-probing state is designed for actively attaining spatial and speed advantage. Thirdly, under the Frenet-based model predictive control (MPC) framework with final constraints state and selected path, the safety-critical motion planner employs decoupled discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs) and linearized discrete-time high-order control barrier functions (DHOCBFs) to model the constraints associated with different driving behaviors, making the optimization problem convex. Finally, we extensively validate our system using scenarios from a randomly synthetic dataset, which reveal that IDEAM improves average route progress by approximately 5.25% to 12.93% and increases average speed by about 4.5% to 9.8% compared to the benchmark method, demonstrating its capability to achieve speed benefits and assure safety simultaneously.

Recently, the task of text-based vehicle retrieval has garnered increasing attention, which is more applicable compared to image-based vehicle retrieval, i.e., vehicle re-identification. However, the text-based vehicle retrieval is also facing great challenges due to the huge semantic gap between images and texts. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called multi-level alignment over aggregation semantic graph with attribute enhancement (MAGAE), for text-based vehicle retrieval task. Specifically, we employ large language models (LLMs) and pretrained visual models to extract global vision and text feature embeddings, respectively. Then, an F-Encoder architecture is developed to dynamically integrate local and global features of vehicles. Furthermore, we design a co-attention learning mechanism to extract and enhance the robustness of vehicle attribute embeddings. Additionally, a multi-level semantic graph alignment module is introduced to effectively bridge the significant gap between vision and text through attribute aggregation and interaction. Finally, to improve the learning capacity of the network, we employ the merits of multi-task learning by incorporating four learning loss functions. Experimental results on the CityFlow-NL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Findings of this study may assist urban traffic management, particular in providing guidance in capturing hit-and-run vehicles.},

The presence of time-varying traffic conditions and redundant traffic information may impede the efficiency and effectiveness of the vehicle-infrastructure system.

  abstract     = {Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed for data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) owing to their flexibility and real-time operational capabilities. However, effective UAV path planning remains a critical research challenge, requiring the design of optimal routes to efficiently complete data collection in WSNs. This paper introduces a novel constrained UAV data collection model tailored to address real-world challenges in this domain. Traditional mathematical optimization methods often face significant difficulties in derivation and computational complexity. Similarly, classical evolutionary computation (EC) algorithms are limited by their dependence on serial computations, resulting in substantial time costs. To address these issues, we propose a matrix-based differential evolution algorithm (MDE), leveraging matrix index operations to facilitate parallel computation and solve the problem efficiently. Given that existing matrix-based evolutionary computation (MEC) algorithms have limited applications in constrained optimization problems, we further introduce a constraint-guided optimization (CGO) method, enabling the MDE algorithm to inherently support constrained optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MDE-CGO outperforms other representative EC methods in optimizing the model of constrained UAV data collection from WSNs. Only our proposed approach successfully optimizes the model to generate feasible UAV paths in all the experiments. Moreover, a computational speed comparison highlights that the MDE-CGO not only delivers superior optimization performance but also achieves high computational efficiency.},

First, the design process of the quadrotor’s position and attitude controller based on the VP-DIMND method is presented. Second, theoretical analysis demonstrates that the VP-DIMND controller ensures rapid convergence and robust performance against various noise conditions, including bounded and unbounded noises. This is achieved through the use of variant-parameter multi-layer zeroing neural dynamics and double integral design mode. Finally, simulation experiments show that the VP-DIMND controller effectively enables the quadrotor track the given time-varying tasks in various noisy environments. Moreover, compared with similar methods, the proposed VP-DIMND method improves the convergence speed by about 40%, and the tracking results under the VP-DIMND controller outperforms the existing controllers, including convergence and robustness. These results also highlight the potential of the VP-DIMND controller for enhancing the stability and reliability of quadrotor in noisy environments.},

  abstract     = {The winter season worldwide causes serious driving issues due to heavy fog on the roads. In situations like these, having an intelligent transportation system is crucial for safe driving. Therefore, to ensure safe and stable driving in such a natural weather situation, this paper proposes a machine learning-based software-defined vehicular network (SDVN). The SDN main controller (MC) is responsible for selecting the optimal controller (OC) from among several local controllers (LCs). The OC is accountable for sharing the load with the MC and regulating vehicular speed by disseminating alarming messages (AMs) in the form of a speed reduction, lane change, and low visibility alerts. It is also responsible for providing optimal paths from source to destination, thereby ensuring the exchange of data between vehicles in such foggy weather conditions. OC and LCs assist vehicles in calculating link visibility time (LVT) to ensure stable links in the network. To guarantee safety, the paper considers two types of vehicles: normal and stubborn (who do not follow OC’s instructions). The objective is to enable all types of vehicles to travel safely in foggy weather. To achieve this goal and evaluate its validity, the scheme considers different cases following the selection of an OC and the optimal path. Considering different cases in foggy weather, our findings indicate that vehicles can demonstrate safety and stability in low visibility conditions.},

And comprehensive consideration of driving heterogeneity, decision synergy, and game interaction is also the cornerstones. Accordingly, this paper constructs a cooperative decision-making framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) that integrates driving styles within a hierarchical architecture based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The upper layer adopts the action shielding mechanism-based dueling-double deep Q-network (D3QN) algorithm incorporating the lane advantages into shared state space to complete the prompt lane-changing (LC) decision, the lower layer applies the soft actor-3-critic (SA3C) algorithm based on the clipped triple Q-learning to provide the continuous speed adaptive control. Three personalized collaborative decision strategies are formulated for particular driving styles in multi-objective optimization preference combined with style-incentive prioritized experience replay (SIPER). The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework can satisfy the personalized driving demands in complex traffic scenarios, effectively explore the prospective LC opportunities, and enhance the driving efficiency by 35.40% with aggressive strategy and the comfort by 56.46% with defensive strategy compared with normal strategy, while maintaining the safety.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep learning has increasingly gained attention in the field of traffic prediction. Existing traffic prediction models often rely on GCNs or attention mechanisms with $O(N^{2})$ complexity to dynamically extract traffic node features, which lack efficiency and are not lightweight. Additionally, these models typically only utilize historical data for prediction, without considering the impact of the target information on the prediction. To address these issues, we propose a Pattern-Matching Dynamic Memory Network (PM-DMNet). Unlike traditional attention and graph convolution-based approaches, PM-DMNet employs a novel dynamic memory network that stores the most representative traffic patterns from historical data in a memory matrix through training. It captures traffic pattern features by comparing the similarity between the memory matrix and the current traffic state. This method not only achieves excellent predictive performance but also significantly reduces computational complexity to $O(N)$ . The PM-DMNet also introduces two prediction methods: Recursive Multi-step Prediction (RMP) and Parallel Multi-step Prediction (PMP), which leverage the time features of the prediction targets to assist in the prediction process. Furthermore, a transfer attention mechanism is integrated into PMP, transforming historical data features to better align with the predicted target states, thereby capturing trend changes more accurately and reducing errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over existing benchmarks. The source codes are available at: https://github.com/wengwenchao123/PM-DMNet},

  abstract     = {Vehicle trajectories from different directions within intersections intersect and create conflicts on a two-dimensional plane. Compared to highways, the lateral movement of vehicles within intersections is irregular and difficult to predict. This risk from lateral trajectories extends to the surrounding areas, impacting other vehicles within the intersection and subsequently reducing both safety and efficiency. To address this issue, a framework for identifying the conflict risk of vehicle trajectory based on lateral movement at intersections is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the concept of virtual lanes is employed to extract abnormal trajectories of lateral vehicle movement within intersections. Subsequently, a spatio-temporal hexahedral conflict detection algorithm, based on the vehicle border, is developed. Finally, the causes of abnormal lateral trajectories within intersections and their relationship with conflict events are discussed in detail, and hotspot areas of vehicle safety risks within intersections are identified. To validate the proposed model, typical intersection vehicle trajectory data captured by uncrewed aerial vehicles is utilized. The research results indicate that abnormal lateral movements of vehicles within intersections are common and pose significant risks to neighboring vehicles. The data reveal a specific pattern in the abnormal trajectory and trajectory density at intersections, with abnormal lateral trajectories of left-turning vehicles accounting for as much as 95.02% of cases. Furthermore, abnormal lateral movement in risky trajectories accounted for up to 86.6%. The proposed method in this paper provides support for intersection safety assessments, abnormal lateral trajectory warning systems, and real-time risk calculations for connected autonomous vehicles and Car2Car communication.},

  abstract     = {The increasing severity of traffic congestion has driven the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in traffic signal control. It utilizes spatial states to interact with environments and develop control policy, which has been extensively studied and demonstrated to be efficient. However, the periodic fluctuations in traffic flow may produce states with the same spatial state but different trends. Relying solely on spatial states for interactions will mix up interactive experiences of these states, and bring instability to control policy learning for dynamic traffic flows. Moreover, many studies concentrate on vehicles as the main focus of traffic signal control, overlooking the demands of pedestrians, who are also vital participants in traffic. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed DRL traffic signal control method Graph Forecast-Vector Dueling Deep Q Network (GF-VDDQN) based on state vector. This method combines graph neural networks prediction and deep reinforcement learning, with the key idea being construction of state vector for agents to understand environments and learn policy accurately. Considering the principle of ‘people-oriented’, a comprehensive reward with green duration loss and vehicle waiting time is designed. A continuous duration control action set is introduced to enhance intersection utilization. Additionally, the distributed GF-VDDQN allows agents to collaborate with each other. To evaluate performances of GF-VDDQN, we conduct experiments in the SUMO traffic simulator, comparing it with advanced and traditional traffic signal control methods. Results show that state vector can assist agents in accurately understanding environments and avoiding experience mixture problem. GF-VDDQN performs superior than other methods.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of autonomous driving, LiDAR-based object detection using deep neural networks (DNNs) has shown exceptional performance. However, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially on LiDAR sensors. Existing attacks face challenges in terms of (i) effective - they’re generally effective in white-box scenarios, but suffer significant performance degradation in black-box scenarios; (ii) robustness - they’re much less effective when exposed to the diverse changes in the real world (i.e., angle and distance changes); (iii) concealing - most attacks overlook the crucial stealth aspect, making them susceptible to detection and defense. To address these issues, LiDAttack is introduced as a robust black-box attack that leverages genetic algorithms with simulated annealing to precisely control perturbation points, ensuring both stealth and efficacy. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and a custom dataset demonstrate LiDAttack’s high attack success rate (ASR) of up to 90% across diverse detection models (PointRCNN, PointPillar, PV-RCNN++). Practical robustness is validated in real world tests, both indoors and outdoors. For concealment, the generated adversarial object volume is restricted to under 0.1% of the target object’s volume, achieving ASR up to 90%.

How to identify vehicle signals, classify vehicle types, and estimate vehicle speeds from DAS signals has significant potential for the development of intelligent urban transportation. Addressing the challenges of high-noise environments and dense traffic, we develop an end-to-end two-stage deep learning process to identify and classify various vehicle signals in urban traffic rapidly.

Then, the YOLOv8 segmentation model is employed to segment and classify the vehicle signal. Finally, the vehicle speeds are estimated using the segmented vehicle trajectory time and location information. We use the urban DAS field data recorded in the downtown area of Changchun to test the proposed workflow. The test result has good generalization and over 90% accuracy in identifying different vehicle types and speeds in high-density traffic environments. Moreover, transfer learning successfully applies the model to other datasets, proving its excellent generalization ability.

  abstract     = {Object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle perception systems. However, domain shifts between training environments and real-world scenarios often degrade detector performance. Cross-domain object detection aims to adapt detectors to unlabeled target domains utilizing only labeled source data. Recent popular cross-domain object detection methods employ the mean teacher framework, which uses pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model to guide training on unlabeled real-world data. Despite its effectiveness, continuous training with noisy pseudo-labels leads to abnormal performance degradation in the later stages of training. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hybrid Matching Teacher (HMT) framework for cross-domain visual detection transformers, which enhances cross-domain knowledge transfer across pseudo-label generation, filtering, and training processes. Specifically, we design a Feature Sparse Alignment (FSA) module to adapt DETR tokens and queries, generate domain-adaptive weights to initialize the teacher-student models, and mitigate the inherent initial source bias in the teacher model. Next, a Localization-aware Pseudo-label Filtering (LPF) module ensures high-quality pseudo-labels by considering the consistency between localization and classification tasks. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of pseudo-label training, the Cross-view Hybrid Matching (CHM) module introduces an auxiliary matching branch to increase the number of positive queries that match with pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous benchmarks by 3.1%, 8.5%, and 4.4% in adverse weather, diverse scenes, and synthetic-to-real, respectively.},

Most existing DRF models are established from the so-called birds-eye-view (BEV), which limits their accuracy for distributed vehicle-level tasks such as trajectory planning since the interactions between ego vehicle (EV) and its surrounding traffic environment have not been fully considered. To fill this research gap, we establish a novel DRF model from ego-vehicle-view (EVV) and apply it in trajectory planning in this paper. Firstly, the collision boundary between EV and its surrounding obstacles is defined by introducing the elliptical model to fully consider the geometry characteristics of vehicles. Secondly, the relative motion influence coefficient is designed to accurately characterize the relative motion between EV and obstacles, instead of using only basic driving state information such as location and velocity. On this basis, the unified DRF is established from EVV for driving safety assessment, which contains vehicle risk field (VRF) and lane marking risk field (LMRF). Based on the established DRF model, we then design a rolling trajectory planning method (RTPM) with a rolling horizon strategy, which not only ensures a long prediction horizon but also effectively reduces the computational complexity. Multiple simulation results under different traffic scenarios jointly verify the accuracy and applicability of the proposed RTPM and DRF model established from this new perspective.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a method for the joint detection and tracking of weak targets in automotive radars using the multi-frame track-before-detect (MF-TBD) procedure. Generally, target tracking in automotive radars is challenging due to radar field of view (FOV) misalignment, nonlinear coordinate conversion, and self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are caused by platform motion. These issues significantly hinder the implementation of MF-TBD in automotive radars. To address these challenges, a new MF-TBD detection architecture is first proposed. It can adaptively adjust the detection threshold value based on the existence of moving targets within the radar FOV. Since the implementation of MF-TBD necessitates the inclusion of position, velocity, and yaw angle information of the ego-vehicle, each with varying degrees of measurement error, we further propose a multi-frame energy integration strategy for moving-platform radar and accurately derive the target energy integration path functions. The self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are usually not considered in some previous target tracking approaches, are well addressed. Numerical simulations and experimental results with real radar data demonstrate large detection and tracking gains over standard automotive radar processing in weak target environments.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the joint optimization of multi-objective dependent task scheduling, resource allocation, and service caching in an aerial-ground integrated mobile edge computing system that includes multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). These UAVs, in coordination with a high-altitude platform, work together to process numerous dependent tasks collected by the UAVs. The optimization problem involves two conflicting objectives that need to be minimized simultaneously: the average execution delay of all dependent tasks and the average energy consumption of all UAVs. The conflict between the two objectives makes the problem quite challenging. Recently, some multi-objective approaches, such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), have been introduced to address dependent task scheduling. However, these approaches often suffer from premature convergence and tend to fall into local optima. To address these issues, we propose a modified MOEA based on decomposition that incorporates two performance-improving strategies. The first one is a probability-based neighborhood search strategy that selects two individuals to update neighborhood individuals based on the neighborhoods and external population, thereby improving population updating efficiency. The second one is a dynamic voltage and frequency scaling-based energy reduction strategy that further enhances the quality of solutions by adjusting the computing frequencies. Experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm obtains a number of outstanding nondominated solutions and achieves a better balance between objectives compared with several algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Accurately predicting whether pedestrians will cross in front of an autonomous vehicle is essential for ensuring safe and comfortable maneuvers. However, developing models for this task remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse datasets containing both crossing (C) and non-crossing (NC) scenarios. Therefore, we propose a procedure that leverages synthetic videos with C/NC labels and an untrained model whose architecture is designed for C/NC prediction to automatically produce C/NC labels for a set of real-world videos. Thus, this procedure performs a synth-to-real unsupervised domain adaptation for C/NC prediction, so we term it S2R-UDA-CP. To assess the effectiveness of S2R-UDA-CP in self-labeling, we utilize two state-of-the-art models, PedGNN and ST-CrossingPose, and we rely on the publicly-available PedSynth dataset, which consists of synthetic videos with C/NC labels. Notably, once the real-world videos are self-labeled, they can be used to train models different from those used in S2R-UDA-CP. These models are designed to operate onboard a vehicle, whereas S2R-UDA-CP is an offline procedure. To evaluate the quality of the C/NC labels generated by S2R-UDA-CP, we also employ PedGraph+ (another literature referent) as it is not used in S2R-UDA-CP. Overall, the results show that training models to predict C/NC using videos labeled by S2R-UDA-CP achieves performance even better than models trained on human-labeled data. Our study also highlights different discrepancies between automatic and human labeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate synth-to-real self-labeling for C/NC prediction.},

  abstract     = {BEV-based 3D perception with multi-frame images input is crucial for autonomous driving. However, current methods for temporal BEV perception fail to fully utilize long sequence features because of local fusion or high complexity. Recently, Mamba, a powerful temporal modeling network with linear complexity, has shown exceptional performance in various 2D vision tasks, but its application to 3D perception tasks remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a general BEV perception backbone named BEVMamba, which is the first work to leverage State Space Model for 3D perception. Built upon the BEVFormer, to adapt Mamba for 3D perception we first add Hybrid Positional Encoding to the BEV features, enabling the networks to be aware of their spatial-temporal position. In the Temporal SSM block, the proposed 3D Factorized Scan ensures that historical BEV features are enriched with global temporal-spatial information. Subsequently, the Spatial-Temporal Corridor Fusion aggregates all BEV features in a physically meaningful manner, achieving precise feature fusion. The reliable BEV features obtained by BEVMamba are used for various perception tasks, including 3D object detection and 3D occupancy prediction. Results on the nuScenes and Occ-3D nuScenes datasets show that BEVMamba outperforms its baseline BEVFormer in both dense and sparse perception tasks and demonstrates competitive performance compared to other methods, highlighting the potential of Mamba in 3D perception tasks.

In view of the absence of exact model based information in real time, this study harnesses the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) procedure to establish the reward function for the automation model using expert data. In contrast to existing shared control studies that focus on automation counteracting driver behavior uncertainties, the novelty of the proposed study lies in developing human-like behavior within the shared control environment. Additionally, to achieve the overall objective of human like driving, RL based approach is employed to generate the automation road steer angle and driver automation (DA) relative weights, ensuring fulfillment of lane-keeping, vehicle lateral stability, and driver comfort objectives simultaneously. The reward function formulated for generating the DA relative weights and the automation model is integrated with the human arm muscular characteristics of the driver behavior model in the RL framework to develop the optimal shared steer angle. Comprehensive evaluations were performed to compare the driving performance of the suggested RL-based shared control system with existing adaptive shared control methods. Simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed control technique outperforms others by closely replicating human driving behavior. Additionally, a hardware-in-loop (HIL) setup was employed to validate the proposed shared control scheme under varying longitudinal speeds.},

However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously satisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical structure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure reliable sharing of local sensing information among UAVs, each UAV generates a safe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV. Subsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is designed as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the desired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs. Furthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed trajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures the smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory. To validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation comparisons are conducted.

  abstract     = {The integration of battery swapping station (BSS) with renewable energy further promotes the electric vehicle (EV) industry in urban governance. However, the complex uncertainty of the environment and limited information hinders the optimization of multi-action battery charging management in BSS. The current research also lacks consideration for renewable energy procurement actions. To address this problem, a dynamic simulation environment incorporating battery charging characteristics and transportation processes for BSS multi-action charging management is introduced. On this basis, a multi-step dynamic battery charging management model based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is proposed. The goal includes cost reduction considering both price and carbon emissions, minimizing queue lengths and avoiding wastage of charging bays. First, a prediction module estimates the real-time energy price. Then, two decision modules sequentially determine the optimal reservation number of charging bays and the procurement of renewable energy. Unlike traditional methods, the model optimizes the charging management process across multiple actions, particularly in analyzing the impact of renewable energy. Additionally, equivalent energy price coefficients are proposed as a straightforward measure to assess cost disparities between renewable energy and grid energy. The proposed model enhances decision-making efficiency compared to classical methods and demonstrates stability and performance across various scales in experiments.

  abstract     = {Bus platooning on urban bus corridors can improve the efficiency of dedicated bus lanes and reduce energy consumption. However, due to the multiple routes operating on the bus corridor, bus platooning may induce congestion at the bus stops and disturb regular headway. To address these bus operational issues, this paper proposes a two-stage dynamic bus platooning model considering bus routes and provides safe and efficient trajectory planning for buses in each platoon. To solve the proposed model, a Particle Swarm Optimization embedded Dynamic Programming algorithm is customized to find the time of leaving and joining the platoon, and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Sequential Quadratic Programming method is used to control the trajectories of bus platooning in real time. Using the SUMO simulator, a real-world case study is conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method over traditional methods. The results show that the fuel consumption is reduced by 18.23%, operational efficiency is improved by 8.15%, and the average passenger waiting time is decreased by 5.73%. Sensitivity analysis reveals the impact of the number of routes, fleet size and stop spacing on system performance. The proposed dynamic platooning method outperforms the CACC method across different fleet sizes. Results show that the desired fleet size is greater than 60 buses, the stop spacing is greater than 500 m, especially in large cities or long-distance bus systems.},

The surrounding environment of the remote vehicle needs to be recreated for the teleoperator using video images received over wireless channels. To handle the significant time delays in receiving remote video data, this paper develops a predictive display system that uses deep learning to estimate the current video display for the teleoperator from old (delayed) camera images. First, old camera and Lidar data are fused to create a 3D reconstruction of the remote vehicle environment using conventional and deep-learning-based algorithms. Then the ego-vehicle’s real-time position and orientation variables are estimated using an extended Kalman filter. Predictive modification of the reconstructed old 3D scene is performed using the ego-vehicle’s estimated new trajectory variables. Deep-learning based image in-painting is used to improve image quality. Furthermore, this paper also introduces a new image comparison metric for evaluating the accuracy of the object detection and localization performance in the predictive display image. Real-world experimental data from the nuScenes and Kitti datasets are used for evaluation of the proposed system. The predictive display images are compared with ground truth images using various image comparison metrics and shown to provide significantly superior performance compared to the actual delayed images received over wireless channels.},

However, existing studies have not considered longitudinal-lateral slip dynamics, which affect yaw angle measurements due to general disturbances rather than Gaussian noise. This paper, therefore, aims to design an $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {H}}_{\boldsymbol {\infty } }$ optimal tracking formation control scheme resisting the unfavorable factors. Firstly, the event-triggered (ET) observers are proposed to estimate unavailable states and measurement disturbances, simultaneously such that the parameters are adjusted only when a triggering condition is violated. Secondly, a robust optimal control algorithm is built based on the development of a three-player zero-sum game theory and the integral reinforcement learning principle, where the control input player cooperates with the dead-zone compensation player to minimize a $\boldsymbol {\mathcal {L}_{2}}$ -gain consensus cost function while the external disturbance player tries to maximize it. The algorithm guarantees that the compensation laws of the dead-zone disturbance are approximated, and the largest unknown upper bounds to reject external disturbances are determined. In addition, the Zeno phenomenon and the persistence of excitation are excluded, and errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, the utilities of the observers and controllers are comparatively validated by the numerical simulation results of a networked ITS group.},

  abstract     = {In Part I of this study, we proposed a TSAGE-based horizontal federated learning (HFL) paradigm tailored for ride-hailing demand forecasting. While HFL allows ride-hailing platforms to collaborate on demand prediction without sharing data, it only expands the sample space and does not utilize complementary features from different providers. To address this limitation, in Part II, we propose vertical federated learning (VFL), which enables multiple platforms to share different feature sets for one client while preserving data privacy by homomorphic encryption. Furthermore, to guarantee data integrity and trustworthiness, we integrate a consortium blockchain framework that records data transactions and model updates, ensuring transparency and preventing malicious data manipulation. Through a case study, in addition to the two insights obtained in Part I, namely that the prediction accuracy is positively correlated with the ride-hailing demand volume and negatively correlated with the demand volatility, we have also discovered two new insights: compared to scenarios where each platform individually predicts ride-hailing demand, both HFL and VFL showed significant performance enhancements. Notably, HFL is slightly faster than VFL in training and inference, whereas VFL slightly outperforms HFL in the metrics considered in the case study. Interestingly, VFL provides more substantial benefits for ride-hailing platforms with lower demand levels (i.e., Lyft), demonstrating VFL’s capability to offer more equitable benefits across stakeholders, even under asymmetric data distributions. This underscores the enhanced accuracy and fairness properties of VFL compared to HFL.},

  abstract     = {The burgeoning demand for ride-hailing services, coupled with the complexity of traffic patterns, underscores the need for advanced demand prediction models. Traditional approaches often suffer from data silos, which prevent the effective utilization of big data separately owned by multiple ride-hailing platforms. In this study, we propose TSAGE, a novel spatiotemporal deep learning model that combines GraphSAGE for spatial feature extraction and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for capturing temporal dependencies. To enable privacy-preserving collaborative learning, horizontal federated learning (HFL) is integrated into TSAGE, so that multiple ride-hailing platforms are allowed to jointly train models without sharing raw data. Moreover, we implement HFL using differential privacy technique to protect data privacy by adding noise to the locally trained model parameters before sharing them with the central server. Through a detailed case study in New York City for Uber and Lyft, we found that prediction accuracy for each ride-hailing platform correlates positively with the volume of ride-hailing demand and negatively with the volatility in demand. Consequently, areas with high demand demonstrate superior performance, and larger platforms with less demand volatility also exhibit better performance. Moreover, compared to scenarios where each platform individually predicts ride-hailing demand, HFL showed significant performance enhancements. Additionally, compared with other HFL methods, the HFL applied with TSAGE can effectively address the challenges posed by the non-independent and identically distributed data across different platforms.},

  abstract     = {The integrated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS) system has been widely used in vehicular positioning and navigation. However, the complex unstructured environments would lead to positioning degradation due to the GNSS outage. This paper proposed a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) assisted 21-dimensional GNSS/INS integrated navigation system using a Recomputed Method based on the Bias and Scale factor (BS-RM) error of the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). When GNSS is available, the obtained accurate GNSS/INS integrated navigation information is used as the input of the proposed BS-RM model to calculate the precise theoretical bias and scale factor error, which are trained as the target values of CNN-LSTM. When GNSS is unavailable, the trained CNN-LSTM is utilized to predict the accurate bias and scale factor. The consistent system positioning could be obtained with the suppressed INS error divergence by applying the IMU dead reckoning. To verify the performance of the proposed BS-RM model, three GNSS signal failure segments at different periods were randomly selected to evaluate the system. In addition, two GNSS failure segments were selected in the straight and curved roads respectively to further evaluate the performance of the CNN-LSTM assisted 21-dimensional GNSS/INS navigation system based on BS-RM. Compared with the traditional model of predicting position and velocity, the horizontal Distance Root Mean Square Error (DRMS) of BS-RM in the straight and curve tracks is improved by 83.85% and 88.06%, respectively, which confirms the improvement and consistent accuracy capability of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {The primary goal of an autonomous driving system is to achieve full autonomy by integrating the capability of adaptive decision-making across a wide range of driving scenarios. Despite recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enabling the development of policies for adaptive behaviors, current solutions are typically tailored for specific driving scenarios (e.g., highway, tollgate) rather than providing a scenario-free solution. To address this limitation, this study focuses on developing an autonomous driving policy that can operate across diverse driving scenarios through a generalized decision-making model. Specifically, an autonomous vehicle learns a unified multi-task policy by utilizing a shared replay buffer across all scenarios, thereby enhancing sample and learning efficiencies. Furthermore, we adopt an offline-to-online RL approach to leverage both the sample efficiency of offline RL and the performance improvements of online RL. The proposed solution involves an algorithmic shift aimed at maximizing the objectives of each RL method, incorporating three key techniques: Q re-initialization, Q adaptation, and policy variance re-initialization. To validate our solution, we compare its performance with existing RL methods and analyze driving behavior using objective-aware and safety-aware metrics. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves superior performance across most metrics, irrespective of dataset quality.},

  abstract     = {Urban rail trains frequently encounter various unexpected situations during operation, rendering the original speed trajectory inapplicable to the current scenario. In response to this challenge, this paper proposes a real-time optimization approach which adaptively adjusts train trajectories according to environmental changes. The approach, named Environment-Adaptive Double-Dueling-Deep Q-Network (EA-D3QN), consists of three parts: intelligent train operation (ITO) model, environment interaction, and value learning. First, the ITO model is established based on the Markov decision process. Its state encompasses external environmental information and train operation information to address various unexpected situations. Then, the environment interaction process is designed, proposing an adjustment policy for optimizing control commands to generate high-quality experience data that adapts to environmental changes. Finally, by constructing double-dueling-deep Q-networks to learn the value function, real-time generation of optimized speed trajectories is achieved. The effectiveness and environmental adaptability of the proposed approach are verified via simulations with the actual data from a Beijing Subway operating line. An optimal combination of hyperparameters is determined via sensitivity analysis.},

  abstract     = {Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) refers to an arbitrarily distributed network that is an integral subset of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) and plays a vital role in providing convenient transportation, improving traffic safety, etc. VANET realizes interactive communication through wireless medium among Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I). But, owing to the open/public communication nature of the wireless medium, it is often prone to different security threats. On the other hand, security is a significant aspect of the VANET framework. Thus, to address the security concerns, it is a common practice to establish an authentication and key agreement protocol among the communicating entities that ensures to provide the essential security requirements. However, after extensive literature survey, it is identified that all the existing authentication protocols are prone to different security threats. Moreover, the implementation of these protocols in real-world scenarios becomes impractical as it bears higher computation and/or communication overheads. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a trust-extended mutual authentication protocol for the VANET framework using a Puncturable Pseudorandom Function (PPRF). The informal and formal security verification of our protocol proves that it provides comparably higher security than the existing schemes. Further, our protocol is simulated using a well-known AVISPA simulation tool and the results show that our protocol is SAFE against replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. Additionally, in comparison to the existing literature our protocol provides higher computation and communication efficiency. Therefore, our protocol is reliable and secure for real-world implementation in the VANET framework.},

  abstract     = {Accurately interpreting regional traffic situations plays a pivotal role in emerging intelligent transportation systems, particularly in the evaluation of traffic states to realize the implementation of rational interventions. Nonetheless, existing studies face challenges when it comes to unveiling the complex nested interactions among multiple ships while simultaneously factoring in various influential elements for precise collision risk evaluation. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive methodology for collectively modeling, evaluating, and mitigating maritime traffic complexity, to enhance the comprehension of traffic patterns and guide anti-collision management in complex waters. First, a novel ship domain-based approach is proposed, incorporating individual ship attributes, relative bearing, ship motion dynamics, and restricted water geography to realize the accurate evaluation of ship-pair conflict risk. Subsequently, advanced motif structure-based indicators and a network disintegration model are merged to provide a thorough and nuanced characterization of the topological dependencies among multiple conflicts within a specified maritime region. Simultaneously, a comprehensive complexity evaluation approach, combining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and a Fuzzy Clustering Iterative (FCI) method, is employed to achieve dependable parameterization and classification of traffic complexity levels. Finally, the collective impact of multiple interdependent conflicts on overall traffic complexity mitigation is investigated to support the identification of key influential conflicts that should take precedence in joint resolution efforts. Extensive experimental analyses based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. These analyses demonstrate its applicability in accurately assessing conflict risk, hierarchically categorizing traffic complexity levels, and providing guidance for joint conflict resolution endeavors. Consequently, this methodology holds significant promise for bolstering the growth of intelligent transportation service systems and facilitating the automation of maritime traffic management.},

First, using the predicted trajectories at previous instants, the real-time states of VCTS are estimated from delayed states obtained through communication. Then, compatibility constraints are designed to regulate predicted control inputs, such that the error between the predicted and actual trajectories in the prediction horizon can be confined in a sequence of sets. Next, linear matrix inequalities are derived to tune cost functions, terminal sets and terminal controllers, which guarantee the stability and recursive feasibility of DMPC. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the performance of our approach in both cruising and speed-varying operations.

However, many studies overlook the significance of topological communications caused by the rapid movement of vehicles, privacy, and communication intentions. To achieve efficient task offloading when facing various topological link structures, we first propose a novel topological link-aware task co-offloading (TLCO) method designed for partially offloading in the joint V2V and V2I system.

Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed TLCO-DDQN algorithm in comparison to other Deep Reiforcement Learning (DRL)-based and Greedy-based approaches.

Although UAVs can significantly achieve enhanced flexibility and extensibility for large-scale intelligent systems, they result in a serious path planning problem. Especially in complex environments with a large number of irregular obstacles, UAVs have to efficiently find near-optimization flight paths and automatically move to target positions to finish the group task while avoiding collisions and satisfying various constraints. In this work, we focus on the cooperative path planning problem of homogeneous UAVs and present a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based approach to solve the problem. First, with the UAV and obstacle models, we analyse the collision avoidance, motion continuity, and energy consumption constraints in UAV flying, and formulate the cooperative path planning problem as a multi-constraint combinatorial optimization one with a high computational complexity. Then, inspired by the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm where clipped dual Q-networks are used to decrease the overestimation error of critic networks, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based approach with a dual-centralized Q-network mechanism to automatically produce feasible and collision-free flight path for each UAV. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted in a multi-agent particle environment to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

Differently, we propose a novel multi-view hypergraph OD demand prediction framework, which utilizes hypergraphs to associate multiple OD pairs from static and dynamic views simultaneously. In the static hypergraph view, we explore spatial-temporal correlations from three perspectives: points of interest, time series, and motifs. Among them, motifs can capture local higher-order network structures in the OD network. In the dynamic view, we utilize real-time OD demand as prior information to learn representations of multiple OD pairs directly and capture evolving spatial-temporal dependencies. Moreover, a gate mechanism and probability constraints are designed to enhance accuracy and reliability. Finally, experimental results on two large-scale ride-sourcing datasets from Hangzhou and Ningbo verify the superiority of our proposed model over seven baseline models.

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been proven to be effective in traffic signal timing scheme optimization and helpful for urban traffic congestion alleviation. Recently, the centralized control strategy has attracted great attention for coordinated signal control of multiple intersections overpassing the decentralized methods. However, this strategy has the problems of state space dimension disaster and credit assignment. Namely, the dimension of the global action space increases exponentially with an increase in the number of agents, and individual traffic signals cannot realize their contributions to the optimization of regional traffic. To solve the two aforementioned problems, this study proposes a centralized DRL algorithm for multiple signals using the sequential decision named the Sequential Light (SeqLight). First, a centralized DRL framework with a sequential-decision logic is constructed to decouple the joint actions of multiple agents, reducing the complexity of the action space to a polynomial level. Second, the multi-agent advantage value is decomposed into sequential advantage evaluations of every local agent, thus alleviating the credit assignment problem and improving the monotonic performance. Third, an adaptive optimization model for decision order is developed for traffic signal control, which coordinates the signal actions of local agents to learn the globally optimal policy. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations using an actual road network. The simulation results show that compared to the other centralized RL method, the proposed method can reduce the average vehicle queue length by 12.64% and 14.20% under medium and high traffic demand conditions, respectively.},

The dominant USV chooses a motion control policy based on the responses of all following USVs, and then each following USV takes corresponding optimal responses to the dominant USV’s policy. This paper converts the ETRHS control problem to an event-triggered optimal synchronization control problem by designing novel value functions for the dominant and following USVs. Subsequently, critic-only structures are established and the ETRHS control laws of all USVs are obtained to form the Stackelberg equilibrium. In order to reduce the computing and communication burden, a novel event-triggering condition is designed for each USV, and the corresponding control law is updated when the condition is triggered. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the developed reinforcement learning-based ETRHS controllers guarantee all following USVs synchronize with the dominant USV even when dynamic uncertainties exist.

  abstract     = {Understanding pedestrian behavior and predicting their intentions near roads are crucial for enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. In intelligent transportation systems, especially where computational and energy resources are limited, real-time inference is vital. To address this, our study focuses on pedestrian skeletal information, which offers lower dimensionality and reduces computational demands. We introduce EffIntentGCN, a lightweight graph convolutional network designed to analyze pedestrian poses using a part-based graph and an adaptive graph, emphasizing features crucial for intention prediction and enhancing the learning of local and global interactions. An expansion layer added before each convolution block increases feature dimensionality for a broader representation, without excessive parameter increase. We further incorporate spatial-temporal joint attention, focusing on crucial joints in dynamic skeletal sequences. The model also integrates second-order information, representing joint connections, to provide complementary information. To balance model complexity with computational efficiency, essential for applications in resource-constrained environments like autonomous vehicles, we employ depthwise separable convolution and low-rank approximation techniques, aimed to reduce parameter count and maintain computational efficiency. The model is evaluated on the JAAD dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting pedestrian crossing intentions while optimizing computational resources.},

  abstract     = {In the face of a sudden public health emergency caused by a new infectious disease, it is necessary to establish a multi-level emergency medical facility (including primary and superior facilities) to address the surge in medical needs. In this context, traditional hospitals are responsible for patient screening, primary emergency medical facilities are responsible for treating mild cases, and superior emergency medical facilities are responsible for treating severe cases. Against the backdrop of uncertainties such as patient self-referral and the autonomous progression of the disease, we address an important problem of integrated emergency medical facility location and patient dispatching under uncertainty and propose a multi-stage stochastic programming model to formulate the problem. For a deterministic model under a given set of scenarios, a Decomposition-based Dual-level Heuristic (DDH) algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the problem, where the upper level employs tabu search to optimize the location scheme, and the lower level utilizes a patient allocation heuristic to provide an optimized patient dispatching solution. Numerical experiments are conducted using Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, as an example. The results show that the DDH algorithm achieves high quality solutions close to those obtained by state-of-the-art solver CPLEX but with significantly reduced computational overload. The DDH algorithm is also compared with the progressive hedging algorithm and genetic algorithm, showing its superior performance in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Through extensive data analysis, valuable conclusions and managerial insights are obtained, providing useful references for emergency response in similar public health emergencies in the future.},

  abstract     = {Traffic flow forecasting is a strongly supportive component of intelligent transportation services. While in light of the expanding road networks or city grids, there is a critical concern to enhance both the accuracy and efficiency of prediction models. Despite the remarkable improvements in prediction accuracy, existing research continues to face three limitations in practical engineering scenarios. Firstly, current research often overlooks the time delay characteristics when capturing spatial relationships between global nodes. Secondly, most approaches have a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of nodes, resulting in significant training overhead and poor scalability. Furthermore, studies that do consider dynamic spatial relationships typically require complex model structures, resulting in higher computational costs. To address these issues, we propose a Time-Lag Aware Spatial-temporal Transformer (TLAST), a lightweight yet effective traffic flow forecasting model. TLAST introduces a cross-time strategy into the embedding stage and the attention extraction to capture the time-lag aware spatial-temporal features. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial Proxy Attention (SPA) module. It utilizes proxy representations to efficiently capture time-varying spatial dependencies with linear complexity, significantly reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on seven real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that TLAST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.84% improvement in prediction accuracy (MAE) while reducing memory usage and time cost by 85.21% and 75.14%, respectively. Results from the empirical analysis not only demonstrate the model’s efficiency and scalability but also highlight its practical usability in real-world traffic forecasting scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have the potential to improve traffic performance on urban roads, especially at signalized intersections. Several studies have developed signal control strategies for isolated intersections considering CAVs’ capabilities. However, few studies have been conducted on complex applications such as arterials. Therefore, there are still several questions that need to be addressed. To our knowledge, existing strategies reported in the literature require long computational times which are not feasible for field implementation. This study proposes a novel computation-efficient joint optimization algorithm for signalized arterials to facilitate deployment. This algorithm enables both trajectory and Signals Phasing and Timing (SPaT) optimization in a fully automated environment. In the first level of optimization (trajectory optimization), the vehicles’ optimal trajectories are determined to form platoons with vehicles following the pre-determined saturation headway. The trajectories are built in a piecewise fashion respecting safety and comfort-related parameters. In the second level of optimization, the SPaT is adjusted according to a novel heuristic that weighs the deviation between the ideal and actual travel time for all vehicles. Comparing the trajectory optimization and joint optimization methods, both perform similarly in low-demand scenarios. However, for moderate-to-high-demand scenarios, the joint optimization method outperforms, reducing average travel times by 3 to 16%, and improving the green interval utilization. Generally, both the trajectory and the joint optimization methodologies achieve higher performance than the baseline scenario with conventional vehicles and a semi-actuated SPaT control.},

  abstract     = {When Automated Vehicles (AVs) navigate dynamic, interactive driving scenarios, they must consider the spatio-temporal layout of surrounding traffic, including social interactions among agents, to accurately predict their trajectories. Existing approaches often fail to handle complex inter-agent interactions with the necessary adaptive attention to dynamic contexts. This paper introduces a multi-agent trajectory prediction algorithm that leverages attentive spatio-temporal modelling to capture interactions among agents. Our approach integrates weighted Distance Graph Attention Networks (wDGAT) with dynamic attention assignment and Multi-Head Attention (MHA)-based Transformers to learn multi-headed social interaction patterns, preserving this critical information throughout the learning pipeline. This enables efficient aggregation of information from any number of neighbouring agents, allowing for robust processing of complex, time-dependent data and consistent retrieval of spatio-temporal knowledge across extended prediction horizons. We validate our model through extensive experiments on the NGSIM (US-101 and I-80) highway datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves the lowest prediction error over a 5-second horizon, producing diverse outcomes for different agents and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Numerical results demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art models, the proposed model reduces the average prediction root-mean-square error over a five-second time horizon by 40% and achieves a median performance gain of 20% on large-scale public datasets. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The assessment of road conditions is important in ensuring the safety and efficiency of transportation infrastructure. However, current methods of evaluation suffer from subjectivity, delayed response, and high costs. To address these limitations, this study proposes the development of an autonomous system that utilizes crowdsourcing RGB-D data to comprehensively and efficiently assess road conditions. The system includes an affordable vehicle-based data acquisition system, allowing for the collection of 3D pavement surface data while driving. By utilizing RGB-D sensors, the system captures both 2D color and 3D depth information of the entire lane width, with precise frame registration facilitated by a high-precision global positioning system (GPS) sensor. To evaluate the pavement conditions, the Pavement Surface Evaluation Rating (PASER) for asphalt pavement is used as a case study in this study. The establishment of an expert system for pavement condition evaluation involves the classification and quantification of pavement data using deep learning and computer vision approaches. The pavement surface data is classified into eight classes, including healthy surface, open joint, manhole, crack sealant, transverse crack, longitudinal crack, alligator cracking, and pothole. Moreover, the quantification results provide detailed information on distress and offer a more accurate understanding of pavement conditions. The system also facilitates the tracking of identified defects and repair work, providing up-to-date information on pavement deterioration and maintenance. It can be used for quality control of the pavement rehabilitation processes where the road authorities can evaluate the quality of the work that is done by the contractors.},

  abstract     = {Planning paths for Frenet-based autonomous vehicles (AVs) at roundabouts is difficult without complete and smooth reference paths. In such situations, the interpolating curve planner is often used to create segmented reference paths from simplified geometric roundabout data. While this method ensures curvature continuity within each curve segment, the continuity at the junctions of these segments is poor. Additionally, the determination of merging and diverging point positions at roundabouts has not been thoroughly explored. This paper introduces a novel approach using 5th-order Bézier curves to plan piecewise reference paths for AVs at roundabouts. The proposed method enhances endpoint curvature continuity of the Bézier curves and improves adaptability to non-standard roundabouts. A well-designed objective function is created to optimize both the geometric continuity parameters of the Bézier curves and the positions of merging and diverging points in the circulatory roadway. This function takes into account key factors, including path length and smoothness. Case studies validate the feasibility of maintaining curvature continuity at the endpoints and the method’s ability to generalize across various scenarios, proving its effectiveness for different roundabout structures. The results also confirm the method’s efficacy in generating paths from original geometric roundabout data. Lastly, the acceptable transverse deviations between real-world trajectories and reference paths demonstrate the rationality and practical applicability of this method.},

  abstract     = {Generalizable semantic segmentation, aims to excel on unseen target domains, as a critical focus due to the widespread practical applications requiring high generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, which depict class-wise centroids, as a type of domain-invariant information are key to improving the model generalizability due to its stability and representativeness. However, this manner faces some challenges. First, the existing methods adopt a coarse prototypical alignment form, potentially compromising performance. Second, the naive prototype generally serves as the class centroid generated by an average operation from source data batches, risks source domain overfitting, and may be detrimentally impacted by unrelated source data. Third, from a broader perspective, rather than just from a prototypical alignment perspective, the existing methods treat all samples equally, which is against the conclusion that different source features have different adaptation difficulties. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel method for generalizable semantic segmentation called Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting (PPAR) depending on the strong generalized representation of the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model. In particular, we first define the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and Visual Text Prototype (VTP) generated by the CLIP model, laying the foundation for the subsequent effective alignment strategy. Then, we propose a prototypical progressive alignment strategy by an easy-to-difficult alignment form to reduce domain-variant information progressively instead of directly. Finally, we propose a prototypical reweighting learning strategy that estimates the importance of the source data and corrects its learning weight to alleviate the influence of unrelated source features, i.e. alleviate negative transfer. Moreover, we also offer a theoretical insight into our method and it shows that our method compiles well on the domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments on several popular datasets demonstrate that our PPAR method achieves superior performance, proving the effectiveness of our method.

WSNs deployed in the intelligent tunnel are often affected by environmental interference or malicious intrusions, which lead to untrusted paths and affect the reliability of transmission. A trusted path ensures that the collected information can be successfully and reliably transmitted to the sink node. To solve the transmission reliability problem of wireless sensor networks, a trusted multi-source shortest path-based transmission reliability (TMSPR) algorithm is proposed in this paper. A lightweight trust management model with a node relation matrix (RM) is applied to identify and exclude untrusted nodes, thereby establishing secure transmission links. Meanwhile, the shortest transmission path is selected based on the minimum path to save the energy of the nodes. The information transmitted through trusted multi-source shortest paths (TMSPs) can successfully reach the sink node, which significantly improves the transmission reliability of the network. Furthermore, a transmission reliability index TRel is defined as a probabilistic measure to assess reliability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exponentially reduces both computation time and memory usage, while enhancing transmission reliability by approximately 5%.},

  abstract     = {Several studies have been conducted to investigate the security and reliability of object detection systems in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), which rely on sensors such as cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). These studies demonstrate the low hurdle for adversaries to execute spoof attacks on LiDAR signals, deceiving non-existing objects (ghosts) as real objects in the surroundings. However, existing approaches to detect such attacks primarily depend on 3D point clouds to analyze LiDAR signals and decide whether an object is real or spoofed, thereby requiring additional processed data. Since decisions in AVs must be made in real-time to ensure safe driving and minimize the risk of exposing road users to danger, reducing the processed data without negatively impacting the reliability and precision of object detection is a significant factor in meeting real-time requirements. Furthermore, reducing the required data to achieve reliable and accurate detection enables efficient edge data processing, thus optimally utilizing available computing power in proximity. To this end, this paper introduces Shadow-Analyzer, a technique that leverages a reduced 2D dataset derived from the 3D point cloud to detect ghost object attacks. The results obtained indicate that the Shadow-Analyzer effectively identifies ghost objects with an accuracy of up to 99.17%, achieving this within an average processing time of 5.9 milliseconds. These findings suggest that our solution fulfills the criteria for real-time detection and significantly improves the standard performance of AVs.},

It aims to detect the temporal activity of sound events in road traffic auditory scenes and classify their occurrences. Current state-of-the-art algorithms have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies between different audio features to achieve robust performance. Additionally, these models suffer from external noise and variation in audio intensities. Therefore, this study proposes a spectrogram-specific transformer model employing a multi-head attention mechanism using the scaled product attention technique based on softmax in combination with Temporal Convolutional Networks to overcome these difficulties with increased accuracy and robustness. It also proposes a unique preprocessing step and a Deep Linear Projection method to reduce the dimensions of the features before passing them to the learnable Positional Encoding layer. Rather than monophonic audio data samples, stereophonic Mel-spectrogram features are fed into the model, improving the model’s robustness to noise. State-of-the-art One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-term Memory models were used to compare the proposed model’s performance on two well-known datasets. The results demonstrated its superior performance by achieving an improvement in accuracy of 1.51 to 3.55% compared to the studied baselines.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud completion concerns the inference of the completed geometries for real-scanned point clouds that are sparse and incomplete due to occlusion, noise, and viewpoint. Previous methods usually learn a one-shot partial-to-complete mapping, which is incapable of generating fine structure details for the complex point cloud distributions. In this paper, a Hierarchical Geometry Generation point completion Network (HGG-Net) is proposed to hierarchically generate the fine-grained completed point cloud with a skeleton-to-details strategy, which consists of three fundamental modules, namely Transformer-enhanced Feature Encoder (TFE), Multi-level Geometry Representation Decoder (MGRD), and Hierarchical Dynamic Geometry Generator (HDG). Specifically, TFE first extracts geometry features of the incomplete input and obtains a coarse prediction via self-attention mechanism and edge convolution. Second, MGRD obtains the multi-level decoded geometry representations by Geometric Interactive Transformer (GIT) and Channel-Attention-based Geometry Features Fusion (CAGF), where GIT is proposed to decode the complete prompt by capturing the semantic relationship between geometry features of the incomplete and the decoded complete objects, and CAGF aims to fuse them for the high-quality representation. Third, HDG generates the complete points hierarchically from skeleton to details based on the Dynamic Graph Attention mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed HGG-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several point cloud completion datasets.

  abstract     = {A bike-sharing system (BSS) is easily unbalanced due to the uncertainty of user demand at each bike station during the day, which appeals for an effective bike reposition solution based on the accurate prediction of user demand. However, there is a discrepancy between the bike pickup/drop-off record (satisfied demand) and the user’s first choice of origin/destination stations (i.e., true user demand) since the BSS cannot capture the unsatisfied user demand (i.e., abandoned rentals and transferred rentals/returns) that occurs at either empty stations (failed rentals) or full stations (failed returns). To efficiently rebalance the BSS, this paper focuses on accurately forecasting the true user demand of the BSS. First, we extract the spatial-temporal features of bike usage and establish a spatio-temporal model for true user demand prediction. Then, an XGBoost-based three-stage prediction approach is proposed to accurately predict the true user demand including the station clustering, the system record rectification, and the true user demand prediction. The real data from the Citi Bike in New York is applied to verify the proposed method and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods.},

  abstract     = {3D lane detection provides richer spatial information than 2D lane detection planar position results. It improves vehicle perception in complex scenes, which is becoming increasingly important in intelligent driving. However, existing frameworks mainly focus on mapping front-view (FV) and bird’s-eye view (BEV) features and ignore the intrinsic correlations between different perspectives and scales. It can lead to incomplete feature extraction, affecting the perception accuracy of lane detection and adaptation ability to complex scenes. To alleviate these problems, we present a novel Freq-3DLane framework, an efficient end-to-end 3D lane detector. Instead of directly superimposing deeper and lower-level features, we propose a strategy for multi-scale information integration that exploits the frequency characteristics of features for image feature extraction. To enhance perception, we fuse image features at each scale through frequency processing to ensure that detailed information and global structure are fully utilized. Next, spatial transformation fusion captures the association between the FV and the BEV feature at any two-pixel position of both, thus enabling view feature transformation. In addition, attentional guidance enhances the lane semantic information to ensure recovery of the lane geometry for accurate 3D lane detection. Extensive results on two challenging benchmarks (Apollo 3D Lane Synthetic, and OpenLane) show that our model performs favorably against the state of the arts.},

However, accurately predicting pedestrian crossing intention is non-trivial due to the interweaving of pedestrian personalities and traffic scene elements. Despite the significant achievement of previous studies, challenges remain in effectively extracting and integrating diverse features from different modalities of observation data. In response, this paper proposes a novel model leveraging pedestrian bounding boxes, poses, and ego-vehicle speed to predict crossing intention. We introduce mixture expert feature embedding (MEFE) to project raw data into high-dimensional space based on different types of inputs. A multi-branch spatial and temporal graph convolutional network (MB-STGCN) is applied to capture multi-scale spatial and temporal features of pedestrian pose skeleton joints. A multi-token temporal aggregation (MTTA) method is devised to preserve abundant temporal information of observation data. Additionally, a progressive multimodal feature fusion (PMFF) method based on symmetric channel split attention (SCSA) is employed to enhance the interaction between different modalities when integrating different features. Extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies on public benchmark datasets substantiate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements over existing models.},

  abstract     = {3D lane detection based on multi-frame point clouds is a critical task for autonomous driving. The challenge lies in efficiently performing temporal fusion using multiple data frames with incomplete yet complementary contexts. Existing methods either directly concatenate consecutive frames, avoiding intrinsic limitations of the raw data, or fuse entire feature maps, without distinguishing lane-related features from backgrounds. These solutions exhibit room for improvement in both precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end lane detection network with hierarchical queries, which decodes lane features at different levels in a top-down manner for high-precision localization. This framework can be deployed on multi-frame inputs, as it efficiently achieves lane-related sequence fusion with reduced computational costs and improved inference speed. Specifically, we design semi-parametric lane geometry representations to model lanes as parametric curves and discrete points. Accordingly, hierarchical queries are proposed to focus on two-level lane geometries, including curve queries and point queries. Curve queries capture global structures of lanes projected onto the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) flat ground, while point queries aggregate multi-frame sequences obtained through curve-guided sampling, acquiring comprehensive and reliable point-level features. In the training stage, our proposed curve matching and point localization loss optimizes the detected lane geometries at both levels. Experiments conducted on the self-collected MultiBEV dataset validate that our method outperforms previously published single-frame and multi-frame methods.

  abstract     = {3D object detection is an essential scene perception capability for autonomous vehicles. In intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicles require minimal inference latency to sense their surroundings in real-time. However, advanced 3D detection methods often suffer from high inference latency. This limits the real-time deployment of 3D detection models in the real world. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fast and deployable 3D object detection method from the LiDAR point cloud for autonomous driving, named Fade3D. Firstly, we propose a Lightweight Input Encoder (LIE) to extract the most critical features from point clouds. Then, we develop a Spatial Feature Enhancement BEV backbone (SFENet) that efficiently encodes geometry features into compact representations. Additionally, we design an IoU-aware Loss Re-weighting (ILR) that enhances performance by shifting more attention to hard samples. Leveraging LIE and SFENet, our approach is independent of point cloud density and number, achieving significant speed advantages in processing large-scale point clouds and being deployment-friendly. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) datasets comparing various baseline detectors demonstrate its universality and superiority. Specifically, our method demonstrates impressive real-time inference capabilities, achieving 51.5 Hz on an RTX3090 GPU and 12.4 Hz on a Jetson Orin embedded development board.

  abstract     = {The accurate prediction of traffic flows, defined as the aggregate forecasting of combined departure and arrival volumes across multiple airports within a designated air traffic control zone during the pre-tactical phase, is crucial for effective air traffic flow management, particularly given the rapid growth of aviation transportation. However, existing methods face significant challenges in modeling the complex spatial-temporal dependencies due to difficulties in constructing appropriate graph structures, as well as limitations inherent in the algorithms and periodic trend-based prediction mechanisms. To address these challenges, a novel framework termed Transformation into Image (TiI) is proposed in this study. Initially, data from multiple airports are transformed into images, effectively compressing spatial-temporal features into grid-based distribution representations. Subsequently, the proposed multi-kernel convolution module and parallel patch-transformer module are integrated into each resolution stream of the U-Net architecture to accurately capture spatial-temporal dependencies at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. Finally, the predicted images are converted and partitioned into traffic flow data for individual airports, yielding the desired results. To the best of our knowledge, TiI represents the first approach to synchronously extract both spatial and temporal dynamics by encoding traffic flow data into image representation. Extensive experiments validate the feasibility of TiI, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms comparative methods. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the effectiveness of the two core components within the TiI regression model.},

By integrating both current and predicted target states, a dynamic attractive potential field is established to guide hunting vehicles toward favorable hunting positions. To ensure navigation safety, a repulsive potential field is designed in compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). An obstacle speed-regulated mechanism is proposed to dynamically adjust the repulsive influence region. Moreover, a global prescribed-time control algorithm is proposed based on the hybrid mapping scheme to achieve strong convergence. A finite and continuous gain function prevents the typical singularity problem. Furthermore, a prescribed-time disturbance observer is constructed to compensate for model uncertainties and disturbances, improving system robustness in dynamic ocean environments. Through Lyapunov theory, all signals of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be globally uniformly bounded at the prescribed time.

  abstract     = {The traditional operational maintenance (O&M) tasks for marine equipment involve the continuous collection of operational status data and full data transmission between the ship and shore. While this method provides comprehensive monitoring information, it often incurs significant data monitoring, storage, and transmission costs. These issues are particularly pronounced in marine environments where bandwidth is limited or the power supply for monitoring devices is constrained. This study proposes a Deep Learning-based method for Dynamic Collection of operational maintenance data and Transmission of data features between the Ship and Shore, termed the DLDCTSS. By employing a deep learning anomaly detection model, DLDCTSS establishes a closed-loop feedback mechanism for dynamic sampling. Specifically, vibration sensors are activated for data collection only when abnormalities are detected, and critical state feature data are selectively transmitted based on O&M requirements. A theoretical analysis demonstrates that the DLDCTSS approach effectively reduces onboard storage overhead, lowers communication energy consumption between ship and shore, and improves data transmission efficiency, cutting overall system expenses. This study first assesses various anomaly detection models on open-source datasets, evaluating their suitability in maritime contexts. Subsequently, tests on a custom water-lubricated stern bearing platform validate both the anomaly detection model and the DLDCTSS approach. This dynamic sampling strategy not only diminishes redundant data collection but also ensures vital information is captured at critical moments, maximizing monitoring quality while enhancing operational efficiency. Meanwhile, transmitting only essential feature data markedly lowers bandwidth usage, and onboard feature extraction safeguards data privacy and security, meeting shipowners’ requirements.},

  abstract     = {Within autonomous driving research, the intricate variability of the road surface is frequently overlooked, while the tire-road interactions critically impact vehicle stability. This paper comprehensively reviews traditional and emerging tire-road adhesion coefficient (TRAC) estimation methods for intelligent vehicles. We initially categorize traditional methods into cause-based and effect-based approaches, which are founded on vehicle responses and road surface characteristics, respectively. Then, we classify emerging methods into learning-based approaches and hybrid models combining physical principles with data-driven strategies. We eventually point out areas for improvement and future research directions. The proposed systematic taxonomy summarizes the independent and collaborative operations of dynamics analysis and learning methods in TRAC estimation, offering insights for further research.},

  abstract     = {Misbehavior detection systems (MDS) play a crucial role in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to guarantee their secure operation. Most recent studies focus on applying machine learning methods to detect misbehavior messages. However, these studies are mainly proposed in the complete VANETs datasets. The MDS with incomplete messages (IMDS) is an inevitable issue that was rarely discussed in previous studies. This survey paper aims to explore the performance of missing value treatments in IMDS. It comprehensively introduces the current missing value treatments as well as the data amputation method from previous studies. Furthermore, this survey simulates the incomplete environments for VANETs datasets and conducts experiments over simulated incomplete datasets with various performance metrics. The experimental results are analyzed and discussed to indicate the best match of missing value treatments for IMDS. Finally, the potential challenges and promising future research directions are also highlighted in this paper.},
