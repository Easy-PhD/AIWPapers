  abstract     = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Schizophrenia (SCZ) are prominent neurodegenerative conditions and leading causes of dementia, resulting in progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. Several studies reveal that early detection and intervention can slow the progression of AD and SCZ. Numerous machine learning algorithms including twin support vector machine (TSVM) have been proposed for the early diagnosis of AD and SCZ. However, TSVM grapples with significant challenges: 1) TSVM relies on the hinge loss function, resulting in susceptibility to noise and instability; 2) TSVM encounters challenges in effectively handling large datasets, attributed to its computational complexity and dependence on matrix inversions. Keeping in view the aforementioned challenges, in this article, we propose a novel granular ball twin support vector machine with pinball loss function (Pin-GBTSVM). Pin-GBTSVM employs granular balls, as opposed to individual data points, as inputs for constructing a classifier, while also leveraging the pinball loss function to attain a heightened level of noise insensitivity. The proposed Pin-GBTSVM persists in facing challenges associated with the absence of integration of the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and the requirement for matrix inversions. We further propose a novel large-scale Pin-GBTSVM (Pin-LGBTSVM). Pin-LGBTSVM achieves two crucial objectives: 1) it eliminates the necessity for matrix inversions, streamlining the computational efficiency of Pin-GBTSVM; and 2) it integrates the SRM principle by incorporating regularization terms, effectively addressing the concern of overfitting. Experiments are conducted on University of California Irvine (UCI), knowledge extraction based on evolutionary learning (KEEL), and normally distributed clustered (NDC) benchmark datasets, where both the proposed Pin-GBTSVM and Pin-LGBTSVM models consistently outperform the baseline models in terms of generalization performance. Furthermore, we implemented the proposed Pin-GBTSVM and Pin-LGBTSVM models on SCZ and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) datasets, showcasing the model's efficacy in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Online platforms are nurturing social interactions, yet regrettably, they have also led to the proliferation of antisocial behaviors such as cyberbullying, trolling, and hate speech on a global scale. The identification of hate speech and aggression has become indispensable in the fight against cyberbullying and online harassment. Cyberbullying encompasses the use of aggressive and offensive language, including rude, insulting, hateful, and teasing comments, to inflict harm on individuals through social media platforms. Human moderation is both sluggish and costly, rendering it impractical in light of the exponential growth of data. Consequently, automated detection systems are imperative to effectively combat trolling. This study addresses the challenge of automatically discerning cyberbullying in tweets sourced from a publicly available cyberbullying dataset. The proposed methodology leverages the robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representations from transformers approach (RoBERTa), integrating principle component analysis (PCA) extracted global vectors for word representation (GLOVE) word embedding features. Furthermore, our proposed approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based methods, utilizing the GLOVE word embedding technique. Statistical analyses reveal that our proposed model outperforms its counterparts, achieving a 0.98 accuracy and recall rate with 0.97 of precision and F1 score in detecting cyberbullying tweets. Results from $k$-fold cross validation further corroborate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

  abstract     = {As a bridge between the deaf people and the outside, sign language primarily involves hand movements, complemented by intricate facial and body expressions. To enhance the engagement of sign language users in today's prevalent online social activities, it is necessary to incorporate video sign language recognition (SLR) technology into social multimedia. However, current multimodal video SLR methods predominantly rely on limited data, leading to poor robustness and susceptibility to overfitting. Additionally, most works employed simple concatenation, failing to explore effective interaction among different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a cross-attention modal fusion network (CAMFuse) based on red-green-blue (RGB) and skeleton to achieve more robust video SLR. First, CAMFuse introduces a comprehensive bimodal framework that considers coarse-grained features from body and fine-grained features from hands and face. Second, departing from previous skeleton-based video SLR methods represented through graphs, CAMFuse adopts heatmap volumes to reduce storage and promote subsequent interaction. Last, a space-time cross-attention fusion (ST-CAF) module is applied to the deeper feature extraction stages of RGB and skeleton, aiming to mine complementary relationships between them and learn the excellent information from each other, reducing the independence among modalities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CAMFuse, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on the popular isolated video sign language datasets WLASL-2000 (53.12%) and AUTSL (96.18%) dataset.},

  abstract     = {With the widespread adoption of multimedia web APIs (API) in web and mobile applications, a substantial proliferation of these APIs is observed. These APIs have streamlined development processes, reducing both time and costs. Nevertheless, identifying the required APIs from the vast array of options has emerged as a significant challenge. Collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation technologies have demonstrated their efficiency in presenting developers with potentially useful APIs. However, these methods often suffer from popularity bias, i.e., popular APIs tend to dominate the recommendation lists. This imbalance in recommendation opportunities among APIs hinders the growth of the multimedia API ecosystem. To mitigate the popularity bias produced by CF-based API recommendation methods, this article introduces a novel debiasing strategy that combines a log postprocessing adjustment (LPA) with determinant point process (DPP). Specifically, the LPA is employed during the prediction phase to yield a more balanced set of candidate APIs. Then, DPP is utilized to generate recommendation lists that are not just relevant but also diverse in terms of API popularity. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in multimedia API recommendation, excelling in both accuracy and the capability to mitigate popularity bias effectively.},

  abstract     = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify specific sentiment elements in social multimedia content. To address aspect extraction and sentiment prediction together, recent studies have utilized a sequence tagging approach, mainly leveraging pretrained language models (PLMs) with specific architecture and auxiliary subtasks. However, these approaches often overlook task-related knowledge and struggle to scale across different domains. With advances in large language models (LLMs), there is a rising trend in constructing generative ABSA models. Nevertheless, these techniques tend to emphasize specific frameworks and overlook comprehensive knowledge representation. To address these challenges while leveraging the advantages of LLM and PLM-based methods, we propose a hybrid knowledge integration framework (HFABGKI). It employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, allowing for plug-and-play integration with existing LLMs. To bridge the LLM and PLM-based models, HF-ABGKI incorporates a global label semantic representation for potential aspect tokens, in which a simplified gating mechanism is proposed to filter useful information. Experimental results from six public social multimedia datasets demonstrate that our approach can accurately extract aspect terms and predict their sentiment polarity, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing ABSA methods.},

  abstract     = {Analyzing multimedia data, which often comprises diverse views such as text, images, and videos, presents unique challenges for data processing. Deep matrix factorization (DMF) provides an elegant way to obtain reduced-dimensional representation of the multiview data produced by multimedia. Compared with single-layer matrix factorization, DMF can better discover the hierarchical information in a layerwise technique. However, the existing multiview DMF methods still have several problems: 1) the standard DMF using Frobenius norm fails to process data containing noises and outliers; 2) most DMF methods neglect to exploit the feature diversity to learn a more discriminative representation; and 3) in graph learning methods for DMF, the $k$NN method is utilized to construct data graphs, which results in many incorrect neighbor assignments. To address these issues, a robust multiview deep nonnegative matrix factorization with feature diversity and optimal graph learning (RMvDNMF-FG) is proposed for clustering in this article. Specifically, a noise-insensitive logarithmic loss function is designed to measure the factorization error, inner products of basis vectors are minimized to achieve feature diversity for obtaining discriminative representation, and an optimal graph construction strategy is proposed to maintain the geometric structure of the data. To solve the proposed model, we explore an iterative updating algorithm that makes the objective function decrease consistently as the number of iterations increases. Additionally, the convergence proof of the iterative updating algorithm is provided with detailed mathematical analysis. Furthermore, through numerous comparative experiments with eleven state-of-the-art algorithms on five multiview datasets, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.},

Despite these promising findings, many of these studies are limited by small sample sizes and traditional observational methods, leaving a gap in our understanding of music’s broader impact on mental health. In response to these limitations, this study introduces a novel approach that combines generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with propensity score matching (PSM) to explore the relationship between music listening and stress levels among social media users diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our research not only identifies associative patterns between music listening and stress but also provides a more rigorous examination of potential causal effects, taking into account demographic factors such as education level, gender, and age. Our findings reveal that across all mental health conditions, music listening is significantly associated with reduced stress levels, with an observed 21.3% reduction for anxiety, 15.4% for depression, and 19.3% for PTSD. Additionally, users who listened to music were more likely to report a zero stress score, indicating a stronger relaxation effect. Further, our analysis of demographic variations shows that age and education level influence the impact of music on stress reduction, highlighting the potential for personalized interventions. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of music’s therapeutic potential, particularly in crafting interventions tailored to the diverse needs of different populations.},

At the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth optimization. To address these issues, we propose adaptive social metaverse streaming (ASMS), a novel streaming system based on federated multiagent proximal policy optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy. Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14% compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions. Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks, while ensuring that sensitive user data remain on local devices.},

  abstract     = {The massive expansion of social media and the rapid growth in multimedia content on it has resulted in a growing interest in visual content analysis and classification. There are now a good number of studies that focus on identifying hateful and offensive content in social media posts. The social media content is often analyzed through automated algorithmic approaches, with respect to being unsuitable or harmful for different groups such as women and children. There is, however, a noticeable gap in the exploration of positive content, particularly in the case of multimodal content such as GIFs. Therefore, the present work attempted to address this gap by introducing a high-quality annotated dataset of animated GIFs. The dataset provides for two subtasks: 1) subtask 1 involves binary classification, determining whether a GIF provides emotional support; and 2) subtask 2 involves multiclass classification, wherein the GIFs are categorized into three different emotional support categories. The data annotation quality is assessed using Fleiss' kappa. Various unimodal models, utilizing text-only and image-only approaches, are implemented. Additionally, an effective multimodal approach is proposed that combines visual and textual information for detecting emotional support in animated GIFs. Both sequence and frame-level visual features are extracted from animated GIFs and utilized for classification tasks. The proposed multimodal long-term spatiotemporal model employs a weighted late fusion technique. The results obtained show that the proposed multimodal model outperformed the implemented unimodal models for both subtasks. The proposed LTST model achieved a weighted F1-score of 0.8304 and 0.7180 for subtask 1 and subtask 2, respectively. The experimental work and analysis confirm the suitability of the dataset and proposed algorithmic model for the task.},

  abstract     = {Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) usually suffers from the problem of insufficient annotated data, due to the difficulty in labeling the intuitive signals of wearable sensors. To this end, recent advances have adopted handcrafted operations or generative models for data augmentation. The handcrafted operations are driven by some physical priors of human activities, e.g., action distortion and strength fluctuations. However, these approaches may face challenges in maintaining semantic data properties. Although the generative models have better data adaptability, it is difficult for them to incorporate important action priors into data generation. This article proposes a differentiable prior-driven data augmentation framework for HAR. First, we embed the handcrafted augmentation operations into a differentiable module, which adaptively selects and optimizes the operations to be combined together. Then, we construct a generative module to add controllable perturbations to the data derived by the handcrafted operations and further improve the diversity of data augmentation. By integrating the handcrafted operation module and the generative module into one learnable framework, the generalization performance of the recognition models is enhanced effectively. Extensive experimental results with three different classifiers on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

However, this surge also heightens the risks of unauthorized access, privacy breaches, and cyberattacks. Consequently, ensuring the secure and efficient transmission and storage of multimedia content is of paramount importance. This article presents a robust encryption scheme for secure image transmission, utilizing a novel one-dimensional chaotic map characterized by random and complex dynamics, validated through NIST test and meticulous evaluation. Key matrices are derived from the chaotic map, with the SHA-256 hash of random, nonoverlapping blocks of the input image influencing the initial conditions, thereby ensuring resistance to differential cryptanalysis. The encryption process encompasses a dual shuffling mechanism: an adaptive shuffling guided by the chaotic key, followed by orbital shuffling, which rearranges pixel positions by segmenting the image into distinct orbital patterns. This is complemented by a feedback diffusion technique that ensures each pixel’s encryption is influenced by neighboring values and the keys employed. Extensive evaluation with multimodal images demonstrates the scheme’s versatility, with significant resilience against various cryptographic attacks, as evidenced by thorough assessments. Comparative analysis further highlights the superiority of the proposed scheme over state-of-the-art approaches. These attributes position the proposed scheme as a highly effective solution for contemporary digital security challenges.},

  abstract     = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated potential in enhancing keyframe selection and video reconstruction via adversarial training among unsupervised approaches. Nevertheless, GANs struggle to encapsulate the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in videos, which is essential for producing coherent and informative summaries. To address these challenges, we introduce an unsupervised video summarization framework that synergistically integrates temporal–spatial semantic graphs (TSSGraphs) with a bilinear additive attention (BAA) mechanism. TSSGraphs are designed to effectively model temporal and spatial relationships among video frames by combining temporal convolution and dynamic edge convolution, thereby extracting salient features while mitigating model complexity. The BAA mechanism enhances the framework’s ability to capture critical motion information by addressing feature sparsity and eliminating redundant parameters, ensuring robust attention to significant motion dynamics. Experimental assessments on the SumMe and TVSum benchmark datasets reveal that our method attains improvements of up to 4.0% and 3.3% in F-score, respectively, compared to current methodologies. Moreover, our system demonstrates diminished parameter overhead throughout training and inference stages, particularly excelling in contexts with significant motion content.},

  abstract     = {Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to train a model using a minimal number of samples and subsequently apply this model to recognize unseen classes. Recently, metric-based methods mainly focus on exploring the relationship between the support set and the query set through attention mechanism in solving FSL problems. However, these methods typically employ unidirectional computation when calculating the attention relationship between support and query. This unidirectional approach not only limits the depth and breadth of knowledge acquisition but may also lead to mismatched patches between support and query, thereby affecting the overall performance of the model. In this article, we propose a bidirectional patch-aware attention network for few-shot learning (BPAN) to address this issue. First, we extract subimages via grid cropping and feed them into the learned feature extractor to obtain patch features. Moreover, self-attention is used to assign different weights to patch features and reconstruct them. Then, PFCAM is proposed to mutually explore the patch feature relationship between the support set and the support set, further reconstruct the patch features, and aggregate multiple patch features of each image into one feature through a learnable parameter matrix for the purpose of prediction. Finally, the template for each class is constructed to extend the results of PFCAM to the few-shot classification scenario. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that BPAN achieves superior performance.},

  abstract     = {Addressing the bias problem in multimodal zero-shot learning tasks is challenging due to the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, as well as the semantic gap across different modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multimodal disentangled fusion network (MDFN) that unifies the class embedding space for multimodal zero-shot learning. MDFN exploits feature disentangled variational autoencoder (FD-VAE) in two branches to distangle unimodal features into modality-specific representations that are semantically consistent and unrelated, where semantics are shared within classes. In particular, semantically consistent representations and unimodal features are integrated to retain the semantics of the original features in the form of residuals. Furthermore, multimodal conditional VAE (MC-VAE) in two branches is adopted to learn cross-modal interactions with modality-specific conditions. Finally, the complementary multimodal representations achieved by MC-VAE are encoded into a fusion network (FN) with a self-adaptive margin center loss (SAMC-loss) to predict target class labels in embedding forms. By learning the distance among domain samples, SAMC-loss promotes intraclass compactness and interclass separability. Experiments on zero-shot and news event datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MDFN, with the harmonic mean improved by 27.2% on the MMED dataset and 5.1% on the SUN dataset.},

Nevertheless, LLMs face inherent challenges in tasks involving both natural language and molecular modalities. Although there has been some research progress on these tasks, two challenges remain unresolved: modeling the differences in representation format between natural language and molecular modalities, and capturing subtle differences under an instruction-tuned paradigm. To address these two challenges, this article proposes a two-stage training framework to build molecular knowledge-enhanced LLM, named Mol-LLM. The first stage utilizes the multitask instruction tuning method to tackle the modality differences between natural language and molecular sequence. The second stage is the direct preference optimization training strategy with three random preference actions to capture subtle differences under the instruction-tuned paradigm. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performances of the model Mol-LLM proposed in this study, including mol2mol, text2text, mol2text, and text2mol task. The effectiveness of the module has been further verified through ablation studies, and the generalizability has been confirmed by additional supportive experiments.},

Traditionally, rating the expressive language level and use (EXLA) item in JERI relies on retrospective video analysis conducted by qualified professionals, thus incurring substantial labor costs. This study introduces a multimodal behavioral signal-processing framework designed to analyze both child and caregiver behaviors automatically, thereby rating EXLA. Initially, raw audio and video signals are segmented into concise intervals via voice activity detection, speaker diarization and speaker age classification, serving the dual purpose of eliminating nonspeech content and tagging each segment with its respective speaker. Subsequently, we extract an array of audio-visual features, encompassing our proposed interpretable, hand-crafted textual features, end-to-end audio embeddings and end-to-end video embeddings. Finally, these features are fused at the feature level to train a linear regression model aimed at predicting the EXLA scores. Our framework has been evaluated on the largest in-the-wild database currently available under the CST program. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.768 against the expert ratings, evidencing promising performance comparable to that of human experts.},

To address this issue, we propose multimodal mortality prediction-multilevel semantic hypergraph (MMP-MSH), a medical multimodal model based on a multilevel semantic hypergraph. Specifically, we approach clinical text in two ways. First, we employ a CNN to extract textual features directly. Second, the text processed into hypergraph is subjected to multilevel GCN to obtain global hypergraph information, which is then introduced into the model training process and combined with the features of each batch of clinical texts.

However, the scarcity of labeled data has hindered the application of deep graph learning in brain network analysis, accelerating the usage of extra label-free self-supervised contrastive graph learning. However, existing augmentation strategies commonly used in contrastive learning (CL), such as edge and node drop, do not fully benefit brain network learning due to the distribution differences between different modalities of brain neural imaging. To this end, we introduce a novel approach namely spatial–temporal hierarchical augmentation-based contrastive learning (ST-HACL) to enhance the representation learning of functional brain networks. ST-HACL leverages augmentation methods tailored specifically to brain networks. Our method employs an augmentation strategy from both spatial and temporal level during the brain network construction process to generate contrastive samples, enabling label-free self-supervised learning. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the orthostatic hypotension dataset (OH) and the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative dataset (ADNI). Results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing graph neural network (GNN) models and graph-CL methods, achieving F1 scores of 80.61% in OH and 73.01% in ADNI.

Specifically, we apply this method to two datasets: 1) one related to physical and cognitive frailty in the elderly; and 2) another focusing on identifying IKIGAI (happiness, self-efficacy, and sense of contribution) in volunteer staff of a civic health promotion activity. Both datasets consist of multiple sub-datasets measured using different modalities, such as facial expressions, sound, activity, and heart rates. By defining feature extraction methods for each subdataset, we compare and integrate the overlapping data. The results demonstrated that our method could effectively preserve common characteristics across different data types, offering a more interpretable solution than traditional dimensionality reduction methods based on linear and nonlinear transformation. This approach has significant implications for data integration in multidisciplinary fields and opens the door for future applications to a wide range of datasets.},

However, existing privacy-preserving techniques for vertical federated feature selection are limited to selecting task-related features and cannot reduce redundant features among clients, resulting in performance loss. This article introduces a mutual information-based federated feature selection (MUSE) framework to address these issues. In the MUSE framework, the correlation of cross-device feature–feature and feature–class is estimated by our defined privacy-preserving mutual information, called federated mutual information (FMI). To compute FMI, we propose the anonymous bin matching (ABM) algorithm, which only uses the intersection size of bins rather than bin elements to avoid sample-IDs leakage. With FMI, MUSE can support the minimized dependency feature selection criteria for removing redundant features. Additionally, we propose the local feature preselection to reduce the computation cost of FMI. It is theoretically and experimentally proved as a close approximation of the global optimum under certain constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MUSE framework on various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the state-of-the-art federated feature selection methods across most datasets. Moreover, our method shows potential in multimodal data as well.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) aims to identify emotions in target utterances from multimodal records, drawing significant attention for its value in conversational artificial intelligence. While early research focuses on exploring conversational context, recent efforts emphasize integrating multimodal cues. Existing methods focus on modeling the impact of conversational context on emotion recognition while neglecting the role of the speaker’s personality factors. Furthermore, these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in information transfer due to full-utterance connectivity and fail to leverage multiple fusion modes for complementary benefits. To address these issues, we propose a personality-guided iterative feedback graph network (PGIF) for MERC. PGIF incorporates personality information as a specialized modality to enhance the feature space for emotional inference. We utilize a graph network to model information flow, integrating interlocutor-aware contextual information by considering interlocutor dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we employ a dialogue discourse parser to directly model semantic relationships between utterances. Our iterative feedback fusion mechanism explicitly simulates emotional interactions between feature-level and decision-level modalities, improving inference without ground truth labels through iterative refinement. PGIF demonstrates improvements of 1.94% and 1.42% over state-of-the-art methods on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of PGIF’s mechanisms, while its manipulation of input features and global fusion strategies ensures compatibility with existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has recently gained much attention since it can leverage information over multiple modalities. However, in real life, we often encounter the problem of missing modalities, as well as modeling the heterogeneity and correlation among multimodal data are challenges. To this end, we propose a unified model called cross-modal adaptive masked autoencoder (CMA-MAE) for incomplete multimodal learning. Our CMA-MAE model comprises a cross-modal adaptive fusion encoder (CMAFE) and a multiview adaptive encoder (MVAE) to capture and fuse the heterogeneity and correlation among multimodal features. Additionally, we design a convolutional decoder that progressive upsampling and fusion with the modality-invariant features to generate robust emotional features from partially observable data. To effectively utilize both data with complete and incomplete modalities for feature learning, we adopt an end-to-end approach that simultaneously optimizes classification and reconstruction tasks. Extensive testing on the DEAP and SEED-IV datasets is conducted to assess our model, with the findings demonstrating that our CMA-MAE model outperforms current leading approaches in both incomplete and complete multimodal learning scenarios.},

Consequently, many studies have begun using audio-visual data for automatic depression detection (ADD). Despite significant progress, numerous challenges remain. During feature extraction, many studies fail to capture crucial spatiotemporal information for depression diagnosis, leading to decreased feature quality. In the modality fusion stage, many methods assume that the semantic information of different modalities is temporally aligned, which is not the case. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a linear spatiotemporal detector (LSTD) to model spatiotemporal information through detection and ensemble, enhancing feature quality. To tackle the second challenge, a cross-modal temporal aligner (CMTA) is proposed, using cross-modal attention for alignment before modality fusion to promote thorough fusion. LSTD and CMTA form the proposed spatiotemporal information modeling and modal alignment (SIMMA) framework. Extensive experiments on five depression datasets (AVEC2013, AVEC2014, AVEC2017, AVEC2019, and CMDep) demonstrate that our method outperforms previous studies in effectiveness.},

To address the problem of optimizing 3-D missile interception guidance laws, this article introduces the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm on the foundation of proportional navigation guidance (PNG) and proposes an adaptive proportional guidance algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed algorithm uses air combat situational information as the state space and incorporates parameters such as the missile-target relative distance and line-of-sight (LOS) angle into the reward function design. The optimal proportional navigation coefficient $K^{*}$ for low-overload maneuvering targets is determined through network search, and the longitudinal and lateral control commands of the missile are decoupled by designing the proportional coefficient increment $\Delta K$, constructing a discretized action space. Simulation results show that, compared to the PNG with a constant $K^{*}$, the proposed method significantly improves the hit probability of high-overload maneuvering targets while maintaining the hit rate for low-overload maneuvering targets. As an exploration of future intelligent combat scenarios, this guidance law design method holds both theoretical significance and practical application value.},

In this article, we propose phishing detection on Ethereum via graph neural architecture search of transaction subgraph (PETS-GNAS). The phishing detection problem on Ethereum is transformed into a graph classification task, where accounts and transactions are represented as nodes and edges, respectively. Specifically, we acquire account labels and their corresponding transaction information from credible sources and then extract transaction subgraphs centered on labeled accounts as datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a mapping mechanism to extend these transaction subgraphs into corresponding temporal transaction subgraph (TTSG), encoding transaction attributes during the TTSG construction process. Then, graph neural architecture search (GNAS) strategy that incorporates early stopping and L2 regularization is proposed to enhance the feasibility and accuracy of Ethereum phishing detection by avoiding redundant parameters and complex architectures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PETS-GNAS achieves strong performance in phishing detection tasks, enabling early and accurate identification of phishing accounts.},

  abstract     = {Information diffusion prediction plays a pivotal role in the analysis of information propagation across social networks. Many existing methods rely on learning social homophily solely from users’ social connections as a single diffusion dependency to drive information diffusion. Moreover, these approaches often capture temporal influence from cascades within discrete time intervals, which might be inadequate in describing complex diffusion processes and can limit prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach with augmented diffusion dependency and multigranularity temporal influence (ADDMT) for information diffusion prediction. Our method strategically leverages the interactive regularity implicit in historical diffusion cascades. This information is integrated with social homophily through a cross-graph convolution network (GCN) to augment the diffusion dependency among users. Furthermore, we introduce multiple overlapping sliding windows to partition diffusion cascades. Adjacent cascade slices exhibit 50% overlap, enhancing semantic and structural coherence. In addition, we employ the combination of hypergraph convolution networks (HGCNs) and temporal convolution networks (TCNs) to capture multigranularity temporal influence within cascades. This design enables our model to further discern evolutionary trends and ephemeral fluctuations in users’ preferences across time intervals. The experimental results, obtained from comprehensive evaluations on four realistic datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model. In particular, our model surpasses previous state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models, as evidenced by improved metrics such as Hits@K and MAP@K. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of ADDMT in predicting information diffusion in social networks.},

Such conventional methods struggle with the advanced features associated with LLM-driven bots, which possess contextual understanding and mimic human interaction patterns. The significance of detecting LLM-driven bots lies in their increased difficulty of detection and their potential to inflict more covert harm compared with traditional bots. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-BotGuard, a novel detection model that is capable of capturing the unique features of LLM-driven bots alongside other bot characteristics through three key modules, i.e., pattern-informed feature extraction module, mixture of experts module, and graph module with graph sample and aggregation networks.

The results demonstrate that LLM-BotGuard significantly outperforms baseline methods in detecting LLM-driven bots.

  abstract     = {Multimodal recommendation has become a key technology for social media platforms. It is widely used in content recommendation, user preference analysis, advertisement placement, etc. Existing recommendation methods mainly focus on learning multimodal embeddings from direct interactions between users and items, ignoring indirect interactions among users-to-users and items-to-items. This limits the further exploration of potential interests between users and items. Moreover, during the model training, classical recommendation methods usually randomly select uninteracted items of a user as their negative samples. This may introduce significant learning bias, as uninteracted items could be false negatives and still potentially interest the user. To this end, we propose a novel indirect interactions discovery and true negative sampling multimodal recommendation (ITMRec) method to further explore potential user interests and mitigate the issue of false negative samples during learning. Specifically, we propose an indirect interactions discovering (IID) model to explore the latent interests among users-to-users and items-to-items. Then, we propose a true negative sampling (TNS) model to refine negative sampling that can alleviate the false negative sample problem. Finally, we enhance existing collaborative filtering methods by integrating representations derived from multimodal content, indirect interactions discovery, and refined negative sampling strategies, allowing for more precise alignment with users’ latent interests. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our ITMRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines, achieving a 3.64% improvement over peer methods.

  abstract     = {Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has received widespread attention. As a typical multimodal task, MFND is troubled by modality imbalance, where the dominant modality suppresses other modalities during the optimization process. Meanwhile, the social credibility maintains the amount of fake news less than that of real news, which causes class imbalance. We call MFND with intertwined influence of modality imbalance and class imbalance as dual imbalanced MFND, i.e., DI-MFND, which has not been well studied. In this article, we propose an approach called prototype-based fully balanced learning (PFBL) for DI-MFND. Specifically, our model contains three main parts. 1) The prototype-based modality-balanced learning (PMB) part, which constructs modality prototypes for each modality. It designs the prototype-based unimodal loss to enhance the intraclass compactness of the poorly performing modality and a constrained gradient optimization strategy to suppress the dominant modality for optimization. 2) The prototype-based class-balanced learning (PCB) part constructs class prototypes. A prototype-oriented discriminative enhancement loss is designed to effectively align samples with corresponding prototypes and increase the inter-class distance, thus enhancing the separability of different categories. 3) The multimodal fusion and classification (MFC) part employs a cross-transformer block to perform interaction between modalities and further integrates features of different modalities by attention mechanism. We propose a joint updating strategy for modality prototypes and class prototypes. Extensive experiments on three widely-used news datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract     = {Activity recognition (AR) using surveillance cameras remains challenging because of the variation between the data required for deep learning and the capabilities of CCTV-based frameworks for data recording. Most research on skeleton-based activity focuses on improving recognition using complete data, often overlooking performance on incomplete skeleton data due to occlusion or noise. However, in practical situations, it is inevitable to obtain a noisy or occluded human skeleton. When some informative keyjoints are unavailable or disturbed, it can compromise the efficiency and effectiveness of existing methods. This article proposes a skeleton-based model for activity recognition to deal with the occlusion problem. The main approach of the proposed model is to address occlusion by treating it as a missing value imputation problem within the feature matrix. First, it extracts features such as normalized joints, relative joint coordinates, angles, and velocity using a CNN-based technique and encodes the skeleton data into a feature matrix. The innovative use of generative adversarial imputation networks (GAIN) with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), enhanced by spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, effectively handled missing data due to occlusions, ensuring a complete feature matrix for subsequent classification. Additionally, this article introduces autoencoder-based Bi-LSTM with attention modules that improve activity classification by capturing and leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies. A comprehensive experiment was conducted on both occluded and unoccluded datasets to validate the effectiveness and improvements of the proposed model. Comparative results show that the proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior recognition accuracy in an occluded environment.},

Existing methods often overlook the high-order interactions and heterogeneous relationships among users and tweets, limiting their effectiveness in addressing sophisticated bot behaviors. This article introduces HHG-Bot, a novel hyper-heterogeneous graph-based framework for Twitter bot detection. The proposed approach integrates heterogeneous graph convolutional networks with a trainable hypergraph aggregation model to capture complex, high-order interactions. To overcome the challenge of labeled data scarcity, HHG-Bot employs a meta-learning paradigm that enhances the model’s generalization capability across different bot types. Experiments conducted on the Twibot-20 benchmark dataset demonstrate that HHG-Bot achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in terms of accuracy (86.17%), F1-score (87.51%), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) (71.75%).

  abstract     = {Although social media generally provides a safe and enjoyable experience, it can also serve as a quick and easy means for spreading false news, misinformation, and other harmful content. These contents have been proven effective in influencing people’s beliefs and behaviors, spanning from influencing political opinions to directly impacting public health, particularly during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, it becomes crucial to take proactive measures to identify the misinformation spreaders to mitigate their impact and influence over society. Existing approaches primarily focus on identifying spreaders by analyzing features such as writing style, content, user profiles, and engagement statistics. However, since fake or deceiving content is frequently crafted to closely resemble authentic information, traditional techniques alone prove insufficient to effectively identify either fake content or its spreaders. In this context, this work introduces a deep-learning model tailored for detecting misinformation spreaders in social media. Our model not only incorporates content-based features but also integrates patterns of social interactions and information propagation structures. By considering the multifaceted nature of misinformation spread, our approach provides a more holistic and accurate means of identifying its spreaders. An experimental evaluation focusing on COVID-related data yielded promising results, demonstrating a significant performance improvement compared to other techniques in the literature. Thus, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to develop robust tools for reducing the adverse effects of misinformation in social media.},

Traditional spreading models often assume individuals play the same role in the spreading process. In reality, however, individuals’ diverse characteristics contribute differently to the spreading performance, leading to a heterogeneous infection rate across the system. To investigate network spreading dynamics under heterogeneous infection rates, we integrate two individual-level features—influence (i.e., the ability to influence neighbors) and susceptibility (i.e., the extent to be influenced by neighbors)—into the independent cascade model. Our findings reveal significant differences in spreading performance under heterogeneous and constant infection rates, with traditional structural centrality metrics proving more effective in the latter scenario. Additionally, we take the constant and heterogeneous infection rates into a state-of-the-art maximization algorithm, the well-known TIM algorithm, and find the seeds selected by heterogeneous infection rates are more dispersed compared to those under constant rates. Lastly, we find that both individuals’ influence and susceptibility are vital to the spreading performance. Strikingly, susceptible individuals are particularly important to spreading when information is disseminated by social celebrities. By integrating influence and susceptibility into the spreading model, we gain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving information spreading.},

However, it remains a critical challenge to robustly acquire cardiac pulse information in scenarios with head motion (e.g., rotation and swing), as it inevitably introduces interfering noise, such as facial geometric deformation and displacement. Most existing methods primarily focus on how to extract subtle pulse signals while neglecting the detrimental effects of noise, especially out-of-distribution motion patterns. In response to this, we propose a temporal gated face alignment network (TGFAN) to adaptively counteract motion noise in long-term video sequences. Specifically, the bidirectional temporal face alignment (BFA) block first captures interframe motion discrepancies to align the displaced face feature and then extracts motion-robust pulse features. Furthermore, we propose a learnable temporal gating mechanism that disentangles the features and dynamically guides motion-disturbed segments for feature alignment, thereby alleviating local head motion interference. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our superior performance on both intradataset and cross-dataset tests.},

However, most existing graph neural network models do not alleviate the problem of incomplete raw graph data and the need for extensive labels. This leads to increased labor costs and produces suboptimal or even incorrect results. In this article, we propose an end-to-end method for fusing learnable node-level and edge-level augmentation in automatic graph-level contrastive learning (NEAGCL), consisting of a graph preprocessing module and tailored graph-level contrastive learning. In the graph preprocessing module, we propose a parallel view generator method, which solves the problem of data incompleteness by simultaneously performing adaptive structure enhancement and learnable node information optimization. In tailored graph-level contrastive learning, we employ contrast learning in self-supervised learning and classification loss to jointly train graph classifiers, thus solving the problem of relying on the original labels. Besides, our model employs differentiable contrastive learning and is an end-to-end self-supervised model. Comparative tests of semisupervised learning and unsupervised learning on seven benchmark datasets for graph-level tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. We demonstrate that effective graph contrastive learning requires learning better joint representations of graph structures and node attributes to improve the performance of graph-level tasks.},

  abstract     = {In autonomous driving, motion prediction is vital for anticipating the behaviors of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users, enabling the system to make accurate decisions and plan driving paths effectively. Current motion prediction models typically utilize an encoder–decoder architecture, and many methods focus on the decoder’s design because the decoder is directly responsible for generating future trajectories. However, this often leads to neglecting the encoder’s capability to represent input information, resulting in a failure to provide the decoder with accurate and semantic prior features, which impacts the overall prediction accuracy. Contrastive learning, as an effective approach for enhancing feature representation through cross-modal alignment, demonstrates strong generalization and reduced reliance on labeled data. Therefore, we propose a motion prediction network named DMotion that leverages contrastive learning to align trajectory features with numeric signals and textual descriptions, improving the model’s representational capacity and enriching contextual priors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to use textual descriptions as a modality to enhance motion prediction accuracy. We sparsify dense agent attribute labels, such as historical distance and angular variation, to enable these prior features learned by the model through contrastive learning. By investigating the impact of numeric and textual supervision signals on contrastive learning effectiveness, textual supervision achieves superior results compared with numeric signals, benefiting from richer input information and more robust extraction capabilities of the text model. We further apply the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method to fine-tune the text encoder, improving model performance and preventing catastrophic forgetting with only 0.1M additional trainable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that DMotion shows competitive performance on the Waymo motion prediction and interaction prediction challenges. Additionally, the contrast learning module of DMotion does not introduce additional parameters or computational overhead during inference, maintaining the efficiency of the original encoder-decoder model.},

The system is built upon a model grounded solely in basic individual behavioral dynamics and free from reliance on specific technical assumptions, ensuring broad generality.

Key findings include the identification of dynamic patterns such as stationarity, inertia, and polarization tendencies in journal performance over time. The experiments further demonstrate the robustness of journal dynamics against moderate external disturbances, such as self-citation behavior, and highlight a gradual weakening of volatility in journal citation indices. These findings are further explained through a semianalytical approach.

  abstract     = {Hybrid bike-sharing systems (operating both bikes and ebikes) are emerging worldwide for flexibility and sustainability. Excessive rebalancing, while addressing supply-demand imbalances, causes financial burdens and resource waste. Hence, long-term daily operations (e.g., rebalancing at midnights for upcoming days) have practical economic significance, but they remain underexplored due to difficulties in tracking high within-day and between-day demand variability and the interplay between demand and daily inventory management strategies. Besides, cooperative operation of bikes and ebikes expands solution space, given their inherent demand coupling. This study is the first to explore long-term daily inventory strategies for the hybrid system (ebikes get charged at stations), determining spatial-heterogeneous inventory at midnight to maximize profits. To address the demand variability perception issue, we develop a recurrent-attentive neural process (RANP) model to predict hour-to-hour demand of the upcoming day. The RANP is integrated into a long-term optimization model, referred to as the generative-models-informed Markov decision process (GMI-MDP), where two cooperative intelligent agents determine the bike–ebike allocation based on demand perception and system rewards. A suite of numerical experiments utilizing a real-world dataset from New York is carried out, and various strategies are compared. The proposed method, through online and offline tests, demonstrates superiority over other MDP-based and rule-based methods, achieving a faster solution-seeking process and more stable rewards than MDP with exact upcoming demand.

This mechanism consists of three modules: 1) EEG-based emotional state computation; 2) process-based relaxation assessment; and 3) adaptive positive decision feedback. Collectively, these components form a computation-assessment-feedback closed-loop system that objectively quantifies emotions while enabling real-time decision adjustments based on emotional trends, thereby enhancing user engagement and emotion regulation efficacy through personalized feedback. The contribution of the proposed feedback mechanism was evaluated through a randomized controlled trial (N = 36). The results indicated that both physiological measures and self-reported relaxation significantly increased when compared to interventions without feedback. These findings validate that the EEG-based positive feedback mechanism effectively enhances emotion regulation while providing additional insights into improving both the engagement and effectiveness within digital mental health interventions.},

However, on one hand, within this process, the varying contributions of different modalities can cause imbalance in multimodal training. On the other hand, in unimodal representation, the inclusion of pretrained models presents challenges of slow training and difficult optimization. Based on the aforementioned findings, we have redefined the workflow for current multimodal emotion recognition. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called reward-based gradient modulation for regulating the convergence speed of individual modalities within the fusion network with LoRA (RGM-LoRA), aimed at achieving a balanced integration process. Additionally, text modality encoders commonly employ large-scale language pretraining models such as BERT. We introduce LoRA to alleviate the problem of text modality optimization being suppressed by the other two modalities. To our knowledge, we are the pioneering researchers who have provided evidence showcasing the efficacy of LoRA in the context of optimization. Finally, to further ensure the effect of textual modality, we add intermodal contrast learning.

Our approach computes the weight of the edges and their change over time, similar to memory traces in the human brain, by simulating the process of forgetting and strengthening connections depending on the intensity of interactions. We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links. We found: 1) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9% compared to baselines with competitive area under curve (AUC); 2) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets; and 3) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.},

  abstract     = {As a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems (ITS), accurate traffic flow prediction has attracted considerable attention. Numerous popular models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) and graph convolution networks (GCN), have been extensively applied to this task. However, due to the constraints of the topology of urban road network and the law of dynamic change with time, the single-layer network model cannot capture the dynamic correlation between the spatial–temporal and the traditional road network characteristics for traffic flow. In this article, we propose a spatial–temporal two-layer synchronous network (ST2SNet) for traffic flow prediction. First, we introduce a novel network structure comprising a spatial–temporal fusion layer and a situation awareness layer, where temporal and spatial correlations are fused synchronously using a transformer architecture. Next, we incorporate the residual gated GCN structure and a 2-D convolution network to effectively integrate road network information and temporal trends for spatial–temporal traffic flow prediction. Finally, we evaluate ST2SNet on two benchmark datasets, PeMSD4, and PeMSD8. Compared to baseline methods, our model achieves MAE improvements ranging from 4.00% to 48.30% on PeMSD4 and from 4.88% to 54.13% on PeMSD8. These outstanding experimental results demonstrate that ST2SNet significantly enhances prediction performance.},

  abstract     = {Social networks are now the primary channels for sharing information about events, especially during emergencies. Identifying crucial information in these situations is intricate due to the absence of specific event labels and the prevalent label imbalance in social network data. Prior efforts in disaster event management have applied unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these efforts encounter difficulties when focusing on specific events and dealing with class-imbalance domain adaptation (CDA), often leading to modifications in data distribution. This article introduces a solution named class-imbalanced adversarial neural network (CADNN) to address UDA challenges in emergency events across diverse domains. First, an adversarial domain adaptation model is developed to achieve cross-domain feature representation. Second, unlike existing methods that rely on data augmentation, a cross-domain interpolation model is designed to generate aligned pairwise samples. This ensures that the generated samples preserve the original data distribution by preserving the sample centroid. Third, the sample interpolation is integrated with the adversarial domain adaptation model, optimizing the overall loss function to enhance generalization performance. Experimental results on four open-source datasets demonstrate that CADNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in recognizing emergency event information.},

  abstract     = {Malware poses a great threat to information security such as user data, privacy, and assets. Early detection before it has a real impact is the main countermeasure. However, the diversity of carriers and technologies has led to a huge gap between the training scenarios and actual scenarios of detection methods. This makes it difficult for supervision-based detection frameworks to identify new malware variants and complicates threat response. We propose a novel method that integrates frequency domain techniques with feature alignment to enhance variant malware detection, reducing distribution differences between labeled (source) and new (target) samples. By converting malware into grayscale images and applying discrete cosine transform (DCT) for improved feature extraction, followed by feature extraction via a deep residual network from both domains, our model systematically aligns features. This alignment is achieved through a tailored domain adaptation technique involving the minimization of classification and domain alignment losses, which ensures the consistent learning of features across varied domains. Such rigorous alignment not only enhances detection accuracy for both known and variant malware but also supports simultaneous detection across significant distribution differences. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of various deep learning models under consistent and inconsistent domain distributions. Compared to existing methods, our approach improves accuracy by an average of 1.4% on the BIG2015 dataset, 3.2% on the MDA dataset, 2.75% on the Malimg dataset, and also achieves the best performance on the MaleVis dataset, with similar gains in precision, recall, and F1-score across all datasets.},

Knowledge graphs have been leveraged as auxiliary information to mitigate these issues. However, current knowledge graph-based recommendation systems still struggle to accurately capture the latent features of users and items in the embedding space. In this article, we introduce a heterogeneous propagation-based recommendation framework that effectively integrates collaborative patterns derived from user–item interactions with knowledge graph data. Specifically, we first design hierarchical layerwise attention mechanisms (LAMs) tailored to the different layers of the knowledge graph propagation process. These mechanisms assign appropriate attention scores to feature representations at various levels of complexity, thereby enhancing the integration. Additionally, the feature learning is further improved by adding Gaussian noise to the initial latent features of users and items, which are then refined using a denoising autoencoder. This method helps learn more robust and discriminative representations for users and items, enhancing recommendation performance. Extensive experiments were conducted on the MovieLens-1M, Book-Crossing, and Last.FM datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms eighteen state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each module, emphasizing their individual contributions to the overall performance improvement.},

First, a new fuzzy control model of the bullwhip effect is proposed.

Then, the studied system can be deemed as a closed-loop control system. Furthermore, a series of criteria are provided for the existence of fuzzy control strategies to stabilize the closed-loop system with the bullwhip effect reduction.

  abstract     = {Personalized decentralized federated learning (PDFL) has emerged recently to address the problem of single point of failure and data heterogeneity in traditional centralized federated learning. However, existing works on PDFL still have two challenges that urgently need to be solved. First, model updates exposed by point-to-point communication during collaborative training in PDFL may disclose sensitive information about clients. Second, the distributed structure makes PDFL vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can disrupt the network by introducing poisoned data or faulty behaviors. In this article, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Byzantine-resilient approach to effectively address the dual challenges of privacy and security in PDFL. In particular, each client is required to build a unique critical parameter index set by evaluating the importance of its model parameters and broadcasting it to neighbors. To improve Byzantine resilience, we propose a novel weight allocation scheme based on the critical parameter index set for clients to alleviate the negative impact of Byzantine neighbors in the model aggregation. To enhance privacy protection while boosting personalization, we combine with model decoupling and execute a clipping-robust personalized local training for each client to achieve user-level differential privacy. We finally conduct exhaustive experiments on FEMNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR10 datasets and various settings. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to five state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed method achieves excellent performance with user-level differential privacy guarantee in PDFL and implements additionally superior Byzantine robustness in adversarial settings.},

In this computational social systems context, we address the challenge of accurately segmenting CRC lesions from colonoscopy images, which is pivotal for early cancer detection and treatment. The complexity of intestinal environments and variations in medical expertise contribute to the high rate of undetected or misdiagnosed lesions, underscoring the need for advanced computational models. This study presents ColoSegNet, a novel self-supervised deep learning framework designed to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of CRC diagnosis. By leveraging a comprehensive and annotated colorectal lesion segmentation dataset (CLSD), ColoSegNet incorporates a temporal correlation module to extract critical features from colonoscopy video frames, significantly improving the segmentation of colorectal lesions. Furthermore, ColoSegNet employs a masked autoencoder (MAE) module for self-supervised image reconstruction, preserving the original image integrity and facilitating precise segmentation. Comparative assessments against established models such as UNet, PraNet, and Deeplab V3 demonstrate ColoSegNet’s superior performance in detailed feature representation and overall segmentation accuracy. This research not only contributes to the field of medical imaging but also to computational social systems, by capturing inherent data patterns and integrating specialized modules for feature representation in a healthcare context. Our findings provide valuable insights into the early and accurate detection of CRC, a critical issue given the disease’s high incidence and mortality rates, and its impact on social systems.},

In contrast, deep multiview clustering overcomes this limitation by utilizing learning-based nonlinear transformations for clustering, but it may be restricted by model interpretability caused by black-box networks. Besides, previous multiview clustering methods only consider homogeneous or heterogeneous situations, resulting in restricted scalability and generalizability. To address the aforementioned issues, we design a universal interpretable clustering framework that accommodates both homogeneous and heterogeneous multiview scenarios. To realize this purpose: 1) we revisit the interpretable knowledge-driven design architecture of traditional multiview methods and formulate clustering optimization problems on multiview data attributes in homogeneous scenarios; 2) the optimization problem is leveraged to derive network modules that learn shared and self-expressive representations for clustering, with the practical meaning of each network component providing model design-level interpretability; 3) the proposed method is extended from homogeneous to heterogeneous scenarios, enhancing its universality for a broader spectrum of multiview clustering tasks; and 4) tailored training loss for the clustering task is employed to inversely enhance the affinity between objects with similar attributes.

Therefore, these methods inadequately consider the impact of trends on the overall graph. Moreover, there are a large number of nodes in temporal graphs, which make it difficult to generate effective graph embeddings directly by aggregating dynamic node embeddings. In this study, we propose a novel temporal attention network for learning graph-level embedding learning called GraphTAN. Specifically, the proposed model employs pooling attention to select crucial nodes and filter out noisy ones for each snapshot, thereby enhancing the quality of aggregated graph embeddings. Furthermore, we design a graph-level temporal attention mechanism to effectively extract temporal graph embeddings, capturing trends and patterns across snapshots. The proposed model is evaluated on three downstream tasks.

Advances in generative models have introduced image outpainting techniques that expand the size of acquired social scene images, thereby enhancing the value of social image data. Stable diffusion (SD), which benefits from the guidance of caption prompts, shows excellent performance in image outpainting. However, its heavy reliance on manual prompts leads to a significant drawback: a decrease in the quality of generated images without prompts. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel self-prompt diffusion model for image outpainting that extrapolates images based on the semantics of the source image, thereby removing the dependence on manual prompts. Specifically, we design a prompt autoencoder that uses an autoregressive transformer to map prompt embeddings into their semantic space, facilitating the construction of a semantic decoder. The semantic decoder and prompt embeddings are then cooptimized within the proposed prompt embedding network, allowing the mapping of image features to the stable diffusion prompt embeddings. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent generative capabilities of diffusion models, we introduce a seam line regeneration mechanism to address the common problem of seam lines when splicing input and generated images. Comparative experiments on the Places2 and COCO datasets show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on visual quality metrics and is adaptable to the stable diffusion model without additional fine-tuning.},

However, GAN struggle with minority data that have few instances and lack accurate statistical characteristics. To mitigate this problem, a hierarchical oversampling based on Cohen’s criterion (HiOC) is proposed for extremely imbalanced data with missing information. The main idea of HiOC is to use Cohen’s criterion to design a primary rebalancing rate by considering data size, distribution, and feature information comprehensively. Then, HiOC including two stages to achieve the data balance. In the first stage, to enhance the data variety, especially for instances on the borderline as well as make a delicate imputation for missing information, a progressive oversampling method in the framework of fuzzy information decomposition (FID) is proposed. The progressive FID (PFID) introduces a small bias to expand the prediction region’s bounds and fulfills imputation step by step using newly sampled data. In the second stage, to greatly keep the original data distribution, an information granularity (IG) incorporated fuzzy c-means clustering strategy is developed. Afterward, a GAN based on Mahalanobis distance performs oversampling in each cluster to achieve ultimate data balance with unbiased evaluation. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to several real datasets, demonstrating higher classification accuracy compared with existing algorithms, thus proving the applicability of the research results in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) serves as a distributed framework facilitating privacy-preserving machine learning on vast data generated by mobile and IoT devices. Hierarchical federated averaging (H-FedAvg) has emerged as a solution to the communication bottleneck, enabling large-scale implementation. It leverages the client-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, capitalizing on the accessibility of the cloud server and the communication efficiency of edge servers (ESs). However, the full potential of H-FedAvg in real-world scenarios, particularly in the presence of imbalanced ES communication latency, remains largely unexplored. This article delves into the issue of imbalanced communication latency and introduces the edge-level imbalanced H-FedAvg (IH-FedAvg) algorithm, accompanied by convergence analysis. Theoretical and empirical results underscore the degradation of IH-FedAvg, which is influenced by the number of edge aggregation rounds and the divergence between the slowest and fastest ESs. To tackle this challenge, we propose an error-feedback compression method, leading to the edge-level compressed H-FedAvg (ECH-FedAvg) algorithm. Theoretical analysis indicates that the convergence performance depends on the compressor ratio. Going beyond compression, we present a joint optimization approach that considers both compressor ratio selection and bandwidth allocation, dynamically guiding ECH-FedAvg. Extensive experiments show that ECH-FedAvg achieves competitive performance compared to H-FedAvg, significantly enhancing communication efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of ECH-FedAvg in addressing challenges related to imbalanced communication in real-world networks.},

  abstract     = {Multibehavioral recommender systems improve the prediction accuracy of target behaviors (e.g., purchase) by integrating auxiliary user behaviors (e.g., page view), but often face the challenge of sparse data on target behaviors. Although contrastive learning can effectively alleviate this problem, existing models still have limitations: they reduce behavioral relationships to linear combinations, ignoring users’ unique behavioral combination modes for different items; meanwhile, when constructing contrastive views, they fail to adequately consider the data imbalance between auxiliary and target behaviors, resulting in learned features biased toward auxiliary behaviors. Consequently, we introduced a multibehavioral recommendation model founded on dual mode contrast learning (DMCL). DMCL innovatively defines behavior combination modes and generates interaction graphs from two perspectives: behavior combination and cascading, and designs a specialized graph encoder for each graph to learn node embedding. By introducing adversarial constraints and contrastive learning, DMCL enhances the complementary nature of node embeddings, and at the same time utilizes interaction graphs in different modes to construct a contrast view, which makes full use of the limited interaction information of the target behavior, and effectively mitigates the feature bias problem. Finally, DMCL combines multilayer perceptron to predict recommendation scores. Our comprehensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate significant improvements in Recall and NDCG metrics, achieving increases of 2.4–10.1% and 2.6–10.3%, respectively, over current state-of-the-art methods.},

A key innovation of this work is the proposed Muls-IRWR algorithm, which improves traditional random walk with restart (RWR) by integrating various similarity measures.

  abstract     = {The prisoner’s dilemma highlights the conflict between individual gains and collective well-being, emphasizing the need for superior strategies. This article explores strategy learning through reinforcement learning, avoiding the time-intensive offline methods like genetic algorithms. Given the significance of both player behaviors and states in creating a lifelike gaming environment, two primary strategies are introduced: Q-learning (QLPlayer), focusing on game behaviors, and reinforcement learning with a finite state machine (RLFSM), integrating behaviors and states. Furthermore, two greedy strategies are developed: payoff-greedy (PG) based on historical payoffs and epsilon-greedy (EG) based on fixed probability. Following that, QLPlayer_PG, QLPlayer_EG, RLFSM_PG, and RLFSM_EG strategies are designed to choose the action with the highest expected payoffs based on different greedy strategies, and continuously update the expected payoffs in different states through online learning. Our experiments demonstrate that QLPlayer_PG and RLFSM_PG significantly outperform classical strategies in achieving higher payoffs and cooperation, especially in noisy environments, by dynamically adapting to learned opponent behaviors. Notably, QLPlayer_PG and RLFSM_PG exhibit superior performance compared to QLPlayer_EG and RLFSM_EG, indicating that the reinforcement learning strategy combining payoff-greedy can adjust its behavior over time according to the payoff information of both sides of the game, ensuring adaptability in the game. The results emphasize the importance of incorporating behaviors, states, and payoffs into strategy learning. This helps reduce exploitation, promote cooperation, and improve understanding of chosen actions.},

Most research emphasizes establishing information dissemination models and designing information processing methods within a single network platform, which is insufficient to address the accelerated information spread resulting from users’ cross-platform dissemination behavior. This article presents a multiplatform information fusion processing method based on the susceptible infected recovered disregarded (SIR-D) model, which reduces the impact of negative information dissemination. First, we introduce an enhanced comprehensive propagation model, termed the SIR-D model, which incorporates a “Disregarded” state to represent users who have received but chose to disregard the recommended content. Additionally, the user state fusion process in the coupled network structure, consisting of ER random network, BA scale-free network and small world network, is described. Moreover, an information processing method is proposed that implements three different measures based on the level of information harm: taking no measures, weakening the effectiveness and blocking the source. Finally, the effectiveness of the information processing method, which incorporates the user state fusion process, is demonstrated through a simulation within complex social networks. The results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves processing efficiency and effectively reduces dangerous information dissemination compared to the nonfusion method.},

  abstract     = {Outliers are intrinsic to recommender systems (RSs) due to user uncertainty and bring large deviations to the total loss. Classical loss functions such as $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ do not consider this issue, thus biasing the model toward abnormal ratings. Advanced ones such as Logcosh, Huber, and Wing losses try to control model biasing; however, they do not consider the rating ranges of recommender systems. In this article, we propose a Seagull loss combining quadratic and softsign functions to handle this issue. The quadratic function aims to preserve or appropriately increase losses caused by small deviations, while softsign function aims to suppress losses caused by large deviations. It is distinguished from three types of popular losses. Compared with $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, it controls the upper bound, therefore suppressing the influence of outliers. Compared with Logcosh and Huber, it not only adjusts the loss of small deviations but also suppresses the loss of large deviations. Compared with Wing loss, it considers the characteristics of data in RSs and therefore is more suitable to the matrix factorization model. Experiments are undertaken on six real-world recommendation datasets in comparison with six popular loss functions. Results show that Seagull loss function has superiority to all losses above on mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) and slight inferiority to $L_{2}$ and Wing on hit ratio (HR), mean average precision (MAP), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).},

Addressing the issues of data scarcity and the influence of leaders on users, this article proposes a guided derived topic propagation model based on topic identity and transfer learning. To tackle the sparsity of early data on derived topics, we introduce generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enhance data integrity and continuity, given their efficacy in compensating for missing data. Additionally, recognizing the potential for domain shifts during topic evolution, we incorporate transfer learning to facilitate domain adaptation and improve the accuracy of the derived topic propagation model. To address the significant impact of leader authority on user perspectives, we incorporate the social psychological concept of “identity theory” and design a metric for topic identity based on this theory to quantify the leader’s influence on user viewpoints. Concurrently, considering user identification with topics, we propose a metric for topic domain co-presence, incorporating interest preferences to more accurately represent user engagement with the topic. Finally, to account for the dynamic nature of user viewpoints, we employ graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model user perspectives over time. The use of GCNs, based on temporal slices, effectively handles the interconnections between user nodes and explores the influence of interuser interactions on viewpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model not only enhances data integrity and continuity but also improves the prediction of the propagation dynamics of guided derived topics.},

This article investigates the minimum cost consensus modeling (MCCM) considering opinion-based variable cost and trust-based tolerance constraints. Given that the existing models ignore the preference strategy manipulation of DMs, a dynamic opinion-based variable unit cost allocation mechanism is presented to prevent the preference manipulation behavior of DMs to a certain extent. To effectively reveal the adjust willingness of DMs in the consensus reaching process, an improved tolerance level measurement which incorporates the tolerance threshold, opinion deviation, and individual return satisfaction is developed to evaluate the compromise willingness of DMs. On this basis, a trust relationship-based tolerance threshold adjustment mechanism for the consensus feedback of MCCM is proposed. Meanwhile, a relative opinion similarity-based trust relationship updating approach is presented to promote the consensus efficiency. A case of regional air pollution collaborative governance is given to verify the practicability of the proposed model. Comparative studies show that the proposed model has stable consensus performance and lower consensus cost compared with existing models.},

Discussions on consistency and consensus are crucial in group decision-making with IFPRs. Consistency prevents self-contradictory judgments, while consensus restricts the disparities among DM assessments within a predetermined threshold. Both have a significant impact on decision quality. Hence, the Shapley consistency and consensus mechanism (SHAP-CCM), which endows the adjustment to DMs by considering their marginal contributions to the minimum total adjustments of all corresponding coalitions, is introduced. Under each DM’s Shapley consensus adjustment, personalized judgment adjustment strategies are considered due to DMs’ intrinsic characteristic differences. In rare scenarios where the Shapley value may fall below zero, this could result in other DMs bearing a greater adjustment. Thus, we propose the Nash-bargaining consensus adjustment based on max–min marginal contribution. This method effectively addresses the issue associated with SHAP-CCM, enhancing the reliability of the analysis. With these mechanisms, the corresponding group decision methods are given.

We then propose a mathematical model called habit formation and behavioral inertia (HFBI), and through experiments, we demonstrate that the data generated by the model shows a robust fit to the distribution of empirical data. We also analyze the effects of different types of activities, and find that periods of high activity participation often begin with rewarded activities, suggesting the importance of incentives to sustain long-term participation. Our study provides a scientific foundation for developing optimized strategies to enhance community sports participation.

In recent years, federated learning has been successfully introduced into a recommendation, while these algorithms still encounter several challenges. First, real-world recommendation scenarios often suffer from sparse data, making it difficult for models to learn reliable representations. Second, data heterogeneity necessitates the design of personalized models to enhance recommendation performance. To address these challenges, we propose a federated recommendation approach based on graph neural networks, named federated personalized contrastive learning for recommendation. On the client side, we propose a contrastive learning approach to enhance the embedding quality of nodes (users or items) by maximizing positive similarities. Specifically, we formulate the concept of structural neighbors based on the graph structure and devise a contrastive learning objective. We treat nodes and their structural neighbors as positive pairs to better learn node representations. On the server side, we group users based on the learned representations and compute cluster-level federated models and a global model. Each user learns a personalized model by combining these two models. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of performance.},

In this article, we address a specific and important scenario of monitoring suicidal ideation (SI), where time-series data, such as galvanic skin response (GSR) and photoplethysmography (PPG), are susceptible to such noise. Current methods predominantly focus on image and text data or address artificially introduced noise, neglecting the complexities of natural noise in time-series analysis. To tackle this, we introduce a novel neural network model tailored for analyzing noisy physiological time-series data, named DBN_ConvNet, which integrates advanced encoding techniques with confidence learning training to enhance prediction performance. Another main contribution of our work is the collection of a specialized dataset of GSR and PPG signals derived from real-world environments for SI prediction. By employing this dataset, our DBN_ConvNet achieves a prediction accuracy of 76.67% and an F1 score of 0.74 in a binary classification task, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive evaluations have been conducted on three other well-known public datasets with artificially introduced noise to test the DBN_ConvNet’s capabilities rigorously.

The occurrence of Turing instability and the resultant patterns are of paramount importance to the system; hence, we delve into the conditions of Turing instability. Subsequently, we analyze the patterns under diverse scenarios to elucidate the impact of various contributing factors. Concurrently, the endeavor to optimize the control of pattern formations is addressed by delineating the first-order necessary optimality conditions pertinent to the optimal control problem. Consequently, the target patterns are achieved under the influence of optimal control. Furthermore, in conjunction with the aforementioned efforts, the gradient descent approach is utilized to ascertain the unknown parameters, specifically the cross-diffusion coefficients $d_{12}$ and $d_{21}$. The outcomes derived from this method are deemed to be satisfactory. Moreover, two distinct algorithms have been deployed for the purpose of parameter identification, with their efficacy compared through a meticulous analysis of error discrepancies. Finally, an illustrative demonstration is provided, showcasing the application of parameter identification techniques in the biological surface pattern conformation.},

  abstract     = {Happiness prediction based on large-scale online data and machine learning models is an emerging research topic that underpins a range of issues, from personal growth to social stability. Many advanced machine learning (ML) models with explanations are used for happiness online assessment while maintaining high accuracy of results. However, expert feedback and sociological theory may be absent from these models, which limits the association between prediction results and the right reasons for why they occurred. Sociological studies have shown that primary and secondary relations are inherent in happiness factors, which can be used as domain knowledge to guide model training. Inspired by such insights, this article attempts to provide new insights into the explanation consistency from an empirical study perspective. Then this article studies how to represent and introduce domain knowledge constraints to make ML models more trustworthy. We achieve this by 1) proving that multiple prediction models with additive factor attributions will have the desirable property of primary and secondary relations consistency; and 2) showing that factor relations with quantity can be represented as an importance distribution for encoding domain knowledge. Factor explanation difference is penalized by the Wasserstein distance among prediction models. Experimental results using two online datasets show that domain knowledge of stable factor relations exists. Using this knowledge not only improves happiness prediction accuracy but also reveals more significant happiness factors for assisting decisions.},

To address the issue, we introduce a space–frequency and global–local attentive network (SFGLA-Net) for sequential deepfake detection. This method is designed to identify and analyze the sophisticated manipulated attributes of deepfake images. Specifically, we introduce a space–frequency fusion module to leverage the deep feature extracted in spatial and frequency domains, so as to exploit subtle inconsistencies and artifacts that are not perceptible in the spatial domain alone. Additionally, we design a global–local attention module to pinpoint the manipulated areas more accurately.

We assess five novel SoP hypotheses about successful behavior. We propose two algorithms to automatically compute an agent’s SoP vector and describe the important factors in this computation. As an agent’s SoP depends on the game state and its perception of threat, we develop a novel “means, motive, and opportunity” (MMO) model of threat and show that we can predict threats effectively using this model.

  abstract     = {The multimodal fake news detection is challenging due to the wide scope of news topics and the frequent speed of emerging event updates on social media, which leads to the difficulty of discernible feature extraction of real and fake news. Furthermore, existing studies failed to consider the reliability of modalities and their fluctuation across different news. This poses an enormous challenge in attaining trusted multimodal fusion for fake news detection. The lack of uncertainty estimation, which shows the extent such decisions can be trusted, further compounds this issue. Thus, a novel method named trusted multimodal evidential fusion considering behavior information (TMEF-BI) was proposed, including the multimodal data evidence acquisition module, uncertainty estimation module, and trusted multimodal fusion module. It aims to: 1) acquire sufficient discernible features of real and fake news via speaker behavior information, which can provide domain invariant information beyond news content through their underlying state of mind and intentions; and 2) provide reliable decisions via uncertainty estimation. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.95%. Further experiments suggest that evidential fusion encompassed a deeper consideration of the uncertainty associated with each modality, leading to more reliable decision-making. This method sheds light on a fresh perspective on detecting multimodal fake news through reliability analysis.},

  abstract     = {The demand, technologies, and market all put forward the request for platformization of the vehicle logistics industry. In China, a few logistics companies have plans but only one has initially built a platform for vehicle logistics. This platform has also attracted a considerable number of service providers to join, which has led to competition between service providers and the platform. To promote the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry and attract more customers to use platform-based services, how to leverage the incentive effect of subsidies is a topic of concern for the government. Motivated by the above, this article discusses whether the exogenous subsidies (provided to customers for platform service or providers service) can accelerate the process of the vehicle logistics industry. We explore the role of subsidies by developing a model (a hotelling line) that describes the differentiated competition between the platform and service providers. Our study found that subsidies do not always work as expected. The effectiveness of the subsidy depends on service advantages and customer preferences. Subsidies may even be counterproductive if customers prefer service providers or if platform services lack advantages. This is a reminder for both the government and industry that to accelerate the platformization of the vehicle logistics industry, it is necessary to combine reality and not blindly subsidize.},

While these systems have demonstrated significant potential in addressing customer needs, they typically assume that users will interact with the dialogue agent in a polite manner. This assumption, however, is often unrealistic, as users may express impatience or frustration through impolite behavior. Addressing this gap, this article investigates the impact of impolite user behavior on the performance of TOD systems. To this end, we developed a novel corpus of impolite dialogues and conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art TOD systems on this dataset. Our results reveal a notable limitation: existing TOD systems struggle to handle impolite user utterances effectively, leading to degraded performance. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a data augmentation approach designed to improve the systems’ ability to manage impolite dialogues. Although this method achieves measurable improvements, managing impolite user interactions remains a challenging research problem. By making our impolite dialogue corpus publicly accessible, we aim to encourage further research in this underexplored area. This study underscores the need for more robust TOD systems capable of handling diverse user behaviors, ultimately enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.},

Previous studies utilize human–robot collaboration and parallel workstations to enhance disassembly efficiency.

As the number of disassembly lines in a plant increases, labor resources such as workers and robots become redundant, leading to low resource utilization and decreased disassembly revenue. This study proposes a novel disassembly scheme aimed at achieving high efficiency by leveraging parallelization and human–robot collaboration to share labor resources on a hybrid disassembly line. Specifically, this work develops a mixed-integer programming model to maximize disassembly profit. A discrete aquila optimizer algorithm, incorporating uniform variation and two-point crossover methods, provides the solution for the problem. Furthermore, the correctness of the proposed model and algorithm is verified within the solvable range of the commercial solver CPLEX.

To fill the gap, we start from the ground truth by empirically studying the breadth and depth of the DAO markets in mainstream public chain ecosystems in this article. We dive into the most widely adoptable DAO launchpad, Snapshot, which covers 95% of the wild DAO projects for data collection and analysis. By integrating extensively enrolled DAOs and corresponding data measurements, we explore statistical resources from Snapshot and analyze data from 581 DAO projects, encompassing 16 246 proposals over the course of 3+ years. Our empirical research has uncovered a multitude of previously unknown facts about DAOs, spanning topics such as their status, features, performance, threats, and ways of improvement. We have distilled these findings into a series of key insights and takeaway messages, emphasizing their significance.

This article proposes a novel approach $M^{2}RM^{2}UL$, which stands for multimodal movie recommendation with multitasking and movie–user learning. The initial phase involves preprocessing multimodal movie data to extract features encompassing visual and textual information. Subsequently, a multitasking architecture is employed, simultaneously undertaking classification and regression tasks to acquire user and movie representations. The learned representations are used to make personalized and accurate movie recommendations. Additionally, the Netflix Prize dataset has been augmented to include textual and visual features, rendering it multimodal. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world multimodal movie datasets (Movielens-100K, MMTF-14K, and Netflix Prize) and compared our approach with several state-of-the-art movie recommendation algorithms. The experimental results illustrate that our approach outperforms the baseline methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in different scenarios, such as cold-start and sparse data. Our empirical study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multimodal movie recommendation.},

  abstract     = {Recommender Systems in real scenarios suffer from poor representation ability of user–item interaction graph caused by data sparsity and data noise. Most of the existing models have problems of instability and limited generation ability. This article proposes a novel recommendation method called graph generative diffusion with hard negative sampling contrastive learning recommendation method (GGDHSCL) to overcome the limitations above. First, the latent diffusion model (L-diffusion) and parametric topological noise reduction network (PTDNet) were introduced as view generators to improve the limited representation ability and mitigate noise. Second, dual-view contrastive learning was constructed to alleviate the limitations of high-quality data in the recommendation system and the problem of model collapse in the training process. Third, a hard negative sampling strategy was proposed to improve the self-supervised signal. We extensively compared our method with 14 popular baselines on four public datasets (Yelp, BeerAdvocate, Gowalla, and LastFM). Experiments show an improvement of recommendation quality (e.g., that on the BeerAdocate dataset, NDCG@40 is improved by 3.6% and Recall@40 is improved by 3.3% on BeerAdvocate dataset).},

  abstract     = {The stock market is a profit-oriented, chaotic, and nonlinear market game platform. Because price changes are directly related to investors’ returns, the accurate prediction of the short-term trend of stock prices has garnered significant attention. Recently, the application of a graph neural network (GNN) has become a research hotspot because of its ability to mine the momentum spillover effect between asset prices to achieve more effective forecasting. However, the graph data used in previous studies are difficult to obtain and process, and there is much room for improvement at the feature processing level. In this study, we construct a dynamic inductive predictive graph neural network (DIP-GNN) model, which introduces a sequence decomposition algorithm to separate the wave modes of the data, which can considerably simplify the learning difficulty of the model, thereby improving the overall performance. In addition, on the basis of the information captured by a recurrent neural network in the time dimension, the model uses Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Manhattan distance, and dynamic time warping to dynamically evaluate the short-term correlation between daily stock prices, and then the identified dynamic relation network to extract valuable cross-sectional information. By combining the cross-sectional information with the temporal information and applying it to the graph representation learning task, stock dynamics can be revealed more effectively. Multiple comparative experiments show that DIP-GNN exhibits better predictive performance than the benchmark models and has robust and much superior profitability over traditional strategies in several markets.},

Existing methods focus on majority voting or integrating opinions from a few assigned annotators, leading to biased decisions and limited performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a cascade perspective network (CPNet) to uncover reliable disagreement for subjective tasks. Specifically, CPNet learns each annotator’s personalized knowledge from annotation disagreement and stores them in an annotator bank through the personal perspective module for abundant disagreement information. Then, CPNet obtains consistent opinions by referring to all annotators’ opinions from the annotator bank through the comprehensive perspective module to reduce bias caused by noise. CPNet improves decision-making by considering the diversity and comprehensiveness of all annotators’ opinions. Moreover, it performs well in subjective tasks with limited or numerous annotators. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on subjective datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of CPNet.},

  abstract     = {Social recommendation leverages social network to complement user–item interaction data for recommendation task, aiming to mitigate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems. The information propagation mechanism of graph neural networks (GNNs) aligns well with the process of social influence diffusion in social network, thereby can theoretically boost the performance of recommendation. However, existing social recommendation methods encounter the following challenge: both social network and interaction data contain substantial noise, and the propagation of such noise through GNNs not only fails to enhance recommendation performance but may also interfere with the model’s normal training. However, despite the importance of denoising for social network and interaction data, only a limited number of studies have considered the denoising for social network and all of them overlook that for interaction data, hindering the denoising effect and recommendation performance. Based on this, we propose a novel model called dual-domain collaborative denoising for social recommendation (DCDSR). DCDSR comprises two primary modules: the structure-level collaborative denoising module and the embedding-space collaborative denoising module. In the structure-level collaborative denoising module, information from the interaction domain is first employed to guide social network denoising. Subsequently, the denoised social network is used to supervise the denoising of interaction data. The embedding-space collaborative denoising module devotes to resisting the noise cross-domain diffusion problem through contrastive learning with dual-domain embedding collaborative perturbation. Additionally, a novel contrastive learning strategy, named Anchor-InfoNCE, is introduced to better harness the denoising capability of contrastive learning. The model is jointly trained under a recommendation task and a contrastive learning task. Evaluating our model on three real-world datasets verifies that DCDSR has a considerable denoising effect, thus outperforms the state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.},

Furthermore, the randomness involved in the selection of negative samples may lead to blurred distinctions between positive and negative samples. Therefore, we introduce a graph attention-based dual enhancement multiview clustering (GA-DE-MVC). The GA-DE-MVC first encodes structure and attributes through attention mechanisms and fully connected layers to achieve dual enhancement of structure and attributes. Then, it selects the farthest sample as the negative sample based on the Euclidean distance between cluster centers, to alleviate the randomness in negative sample selection, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness between positive and negative samples.The experimental results on six datasets surpass existing algorithms, verifying the effectiveness of the GA-DE-MVC algorithm.},

This study integrated time-varying flight schedules, connecting airports, and epidemic situations in airport catchment areas for estimating a traveler's exposure risk during the user-defined flight journey and applying to the timely exposure risk during air travel (TERAT) for a spatial decision support system (SDSS). We leveraged epidemic information and dynamic flight schedules to estimate personalized and timely exposure risk. Flight frequency and arrival time of all inbound flights within 6 h before and after the current time were encompassed to determine the potentially infected passenger sources. We estimated the timely airport exposure risk for the user's destination airport and its top 10 importation risk origin airports and demonstrated the top 10 risk final destination airports from the user's destination airport. Two real-world scenarios showed that direct flight and transfer air passengers were exposed to time-varying risks at different travel stages; additionally, all high-risk exposure routes were highlighted. To our knowledge, TERAT is the first attempt to leverage real-world dynamic epidemiological data and flight schedules to estimate time-varying exposure risk for user-defined routes. We further converted airport exposure risk into four levels for determining the personal protection measures to facilitate the usage of exposure risk applications. Therefore, air passengers can protect themselves when facing passengers from high-risk areas in advance.},

  abstract     = {Individual next location prediction plays a crucial role in location-based applications, such as route navigation and service recommendation. Although the existing research based on deep learning effectively captures users' spatiotemporal travel preferences, there are challenges in the interpretability of location prediction, heavily relying on large-scale historical travel data for model training. Drawing inspiration from the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), this study proposes a novel multiround continuous dialogue mechanism and candidate set enhancement method, leveraging LLMs for next location prediction through step-by-step reasoning. In the first round of dialogue, we introduce activity prediction as an auxiliary task to narrow down the candidate locations. Subsequently, we establish an activity-aware prompt to enable LLM to achieve accurate location prediction and provide corresponding reasoning. Finally, we incorporate a third round of dialogue to prompt LLM to make necessary corrections by integrating the prediction results of deep learning models. To address the issues of LLMs being affected by element ranking within the candidate set, we propose a new candidate set enhancement method based on the entropy-weighted Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Our model can understand user travel preferences by fusing location, activity, and time information through natural language. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets of user check-ins, and the results show that our model achieves prediction performance comparable to deep learning models in full-sample prediction and outperforms them in the few-shot settings. Our model provides logical and explainable reasoning, offering insightful guidance for downstream application tasks.},

  abstract     = {Cyber propaganda has become an increasingly sophisticated tool for manipulating public perception and discourse within online social networks (OSNs). The effectiveness of cyber propaganda is strongly influenced by the interplay between individual awareness and the underlying topology of OSNs that facilitates the spread of propaganda. However, existing interventions primarily focus on continuous control strategies, which may not be feasible in certain real-world scenarios. Therefore, effectively suppressing the spread of cyber propaganda while taking into account the above impact factors remains a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a methodology that combines the optimal impulse control (OIC) theory with a novel propagation model to address this problem. Our propagation model is the first to take into account the effects of the cognitive differences and interconnectivity of OSNs on the dynamics of cyber propaganda. By employing the OIC framework and our newly developed propagation model, we formulate an OIC problem. The goal is to find impulse strategies that optimally balance the cost of intervention against its effectiveness. Using the impulse maximum principle, we establish the necessary conditions for optimal impulse strategies and construct an algorithm to solve the OIC problem. Our numerical experiments, conducted on three distinct social networks, demonstrated that: 1) awareness levels play a crucial role in effectively suppressing the spread of cyber propaganda on OSNs; and 2) our impulse strategies are significantly superior to random strategies in terms of suppression effect, thereby evidencing their cost-effectiveness.},

Given that duplicate comments are generated from templates or predrafted texts, they can easily overwhelm the commenting process, and massive opinion spam campaigns have made manually flagging duplicate comments a costly and time-consuming task for rulemaking agencies. To help agencies in their deduplication efforts, we developed and tested a highly accurate and cost-effective technique based on unsupervised deep machine learning. Our method used the graph augmented deep learning model to embed the comment texts into vectors, and then we applied the clustering method to the embedded vectors to identify similar comments. To test the efficacy of the proposed approach, we applied our technique to the raw data from the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) proposed rule change on Net Neutrality in 2017.

However, most existing methods predominantly focus on the user’s psychological state and the causes of user’s emotional problem, neglecting key cues, e.g., topics of conversation and listener’s psychological state. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the user’s situation and ineffective emotional support. This article presents a novel method that utilizes prompt learning with multiperspective cues (PMPC) to generate emotional support responses. Specifically, we extract multiperspective cues from the dialogue history and the causes of user’s emotional problem. To fully utilize the different cues within the ESC system, we categorize them into two groups: semantic enhancement cues and semantic constraint cues. Subsequently, we construct two prompts based on different categories of cues, which are designed to thoroughly understand user’s emotional predicament and generate an engaging support response, respectively. Experimental results on the ESConv dataset demonstrate that our proposed PMPC can surpass other approaches in both automatic and human evaluation metrics, providing compelling evidence of its efficacy and potential impact in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {Community detection in signed networks reveals mesoscale structures and sign characteristics, facilitating accurate and realistic understanding of real-life signed networks. Given the complexity of signed community structures and the NP-hard challenge of achieving optimal partitions, modularity optimization using memetic algorithms has emerged as a promising approach. However, the identified signed partitions still face challenges in modularity quality and precision, with many misassigned nodes or being stuck at local optima, particularly in ambiguous and complex structures. To address this issue, this article introduces a new concept: central-node signed motif, a higher order local topological feature that effectively identifies signed communities, providing richer and more efficient topological information. Furthermore, we utilize these central-node signed motifs to improve community detection through a framework named higher order local search assisted memetic modularity (HLSMM). In HLSMM, we design a central-node signed motif-based local search strategy to optimize node assignments and improve modularity quality and structural balance of optimized signed communities. Experimental results from synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the local search strategy in enhancing accuracy and modularity quality. HLSMM exhibits a general advantage in modularity quality over currently representative methods on real-world datasets, particularly in ambiguous and complex community structures.},

A reversed process of Role-Based Collaboration (RBC) is proposed for emergence studies. The Environments–Classes, Agents, Roles, Groups, and Objects (E-CARGO) model is the fundamental model of RBC. A well extended E-CARGO (EE-CARGO) model is proposed to modeling a social system with emergent properties. The system is abstracted into agent-role level, roles are modeled as a tree structure and role emergence is identified and analyzed at multiple scales. Then we derive that the masses are primary, and the individual agent is secondary to understanding the emergence forming. A case study is accomplished to verify the effectiveness of proposed approach (i.e., the reversed RBC process and EE-CARGO model). The results are revealed that the role emergence fits a cubic curve estimation by time and at a moderate scale, the role emergence happens easily. Role performances at a small scale affect super-role emergence at a large scale statistically, and vice versa. The proposed approach can be applied to investigate emergence in a variety of areas, such as social evolution.},

  abstract     = {Bound by social bonds, people often travel in groups, exhibiting mutual correlations in their mobility behaviors, known as mobility correlations. However, conventional graphs, which describe pairwise connections between vertices, fail to adequately capture the complex many-to-many connection characteristics of multiple individuals. To address this limitation, we propose a novel semisupervised hypergraph clustering (SSHC) model aimed at unraveling the intricate correlations among individuals before discerning their latent clusters. Each individual is characterized by features that encompass spatial, temporal, and attributive diversity. The high-order correlations concealed among multiple individuals are captured using a hypergraph framework featuring hyperedges. Building upon this foundation, we fuse individuals’ latent feature representations, extracted via an auto-encoder, with their structural representations derived from a hypergraph convolutional network. Through this fusion, we identify clusters of similar individuals exhibiting mobility correlations. Notably, our model incorporates a semisupervised learning scheme, leveraging priori patterns gleaned from a small pool of ground-truth data to better express latent patterns within unlabeled datasets. Experimental validations conducted in five public datasets corroborate the superiority of our proposed model over baseline methods in elucidating complex correlations within vast datasets. In addition, experiments conducted on Beijing Transit Smart Card Data showcase promising results in identifying correlated individuals with similar mobility patterns. The delineation of groups of individuals exhibiting mobility correlations is of paramount importance, particularly in accurately detecting their connection networks during public emergencies, such as the transmission of dangerous pathogens.},

Considering the interactions among multiple online social platforms, the multilayer IM problem poses further challenges ($\rm i.e.,$ high-simulation burden and low-optimization quality). To solve these problems, this article proposes a susceptible-exposed-infected1-infected2-infected12-vigilant (SE3IV) model to simulate the information spreading process in multilayer networks. The spreading dynamic is modeled by mean-field equations considering the effect of cross-layer propagation. To optimize the multilayer information maximization modeled by SE3IV, an asynchronous distributed cooperative coevolutionary algorithm (ADCA) is proposed. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm in multilayer networks, the multilayer community detection first decompresses the network into a single layer by dimension-based method. Then, the Louvain method is adopted to decompose the problems into subcomponents with lower dimensionality. The populations with the same size evolve corresponding subcomponents in an asynchronous and distributed way based on the pool model. Besides, an asynchronous communication mechanism is devised to manage the communication among the shared pool. An adaptive seeds regulation strategy is designed to adjust the number of seeds of subcomponents. Numerous experiments on different networks show that ADCA possesses good scalability and efficiency, especially in large-scale networks.},

In Opportunistic MCS, the real-time mobility of participants and requesters is a crucial feature, as it significantly impacts the quality of MCS services. However, most existing task allocation approaches focus on optimizing the overall system performance while disregarding the mobile attribute of participants and requesters. To remedy this issue, this article proposes a real-time route prediction-based multiobjective task allocation for Opportunistic MCS, called RRP-MOTA, which presents the participants’ route-considered task allocation scheme to maximize social welfare comprehensively. Specifically, instead of merely optimizing system performance, a two-stage mechanism is designed to comprehensively enhance task allocation efficiency by estimating and leveraging participants’ routes. Moreover, by utilizing participants’ spatio–temporal location information, an improved graph convolutional network-based participant route prediction method is developed to provide more accurate participant location information for task allocation. Furthermore, a reference vector-based multiobjective task allocation method is suggested to cater to diverse usage preferences by balancing quality of service and task cost. To validate the performance of our proposed method, extensive simulations are performed on synthetic and real datasets in two scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RRP-MOTA significantly outperforms the chosen existing designs.},

First, a gas text joint extraction method (GTJM) for gas accident cases is proposed at the first stage. The multigranularity training tasks in the enhanced representation through knowledge integration (ERNIE) pretrained model are used to address the issue of insufficient context understanding when processing long texts in gas cases while combining multihead attention mechanism to obtain richer semantic information. The cascade binary tagging framework (CasRel) is then utilized to extract entities and relationships contained in the background and disposal information of accident cases, to tackle the problem of overlapping entity extraction in gas accident case texts. Second, in the second stage, the bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) is used to capture the contextual features of compressed events, while a novel Incept-text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) focuses on the global semantic information within compressed events. The combination of both models could resolve the problem of sequential relationship identification between long events much better. Finally, a clear event logic knowledge graph is formed for gas accident disposal in emergencies. The experimental results indicate that in the first phase, the GTJM model has an average improvement of 7% in F1 value compared to other baseline models. In the second phase, the accuracy of the sequential relationship identification reaches 92%. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through real cases. The study could provide auxiliary decision support for emergency disposal in gas accidents.},

  abstract     = {3-D action recognition become a fast-pacing field in recent years. However, traditional approaches have limitations. They either focus on modeling overly detailed yet redundant information by reconstructing the coordinates of each body joint. Alternatively, they treat actions as a whole, overlooking the spatial and temporal variations in the semantic locality of actions. To address these limitations, we propose representing long-term actions as contexts of short-term actions organized by locality-aware graphs. In our framework, we take the inspiration that the continuity of motion and pose variations generate higher correlations. These correlations occur among spatio-temporally adjacent joints. Built upon this, we craft short-term actions as embeddings using spatio-temporal graph convolutions. This graph-based encoding not only captures richer high-level semantics but also maintains an awareness of the topology. To capture long-term action dynamics effectively, we integrate a graph convolutional gated recurrent unit (GraphGRU) for the fusion of action embeddings. Additionally, we introduce the context-aware topological attention (CTA) mechanism. Positioned between embedding encoding and context aggregation phases, CTA amplifies the features of context-relevant nodes. Lastly, we create self-supervision by contrasting predicted embeddings with actual encoded embeddings. This approach explicitly learns changes in dynamics to obtain distinct embeddings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms mainstream unsupervised 3-D action recognition methods.},

  abstract     = {The rapid spread of online rumors has significant negative impacts on the online ecosystem and social order, which is closely tied to users’ cognitive traits. To explore the mechanisms of rumor propagation driven by cognition and mitigate its harm, we propose an information diffusion model based on the rumor, antirumor, and cognitive game. First, to address the uncertainty and difficulty in quantifying cognitive biases, and considering the advantages of fuzzy logic theory in handling uncertainty, a fuzzy logic-based algorithm for measuring user cognitive biases is proposed. Moreover, recognizing the nonlinear relationships among various factors, polynomial functions are introduced as the output of fuzzy rules to more accurately describe these complex relationships. Second, regarding the symbiotic and antagonistic relationships among multiple types of rumor information under the influence of cognitive biases, and leveraging the strengths of game theory in analyzing complex systems characterized by coexistence of symbiosis and antagonism, an evolutionary game-based rumor-antirumor user behavior mechanism is developed. This provides a robust theoretical foundation for understanding user state transitions and their evolutionary patterns. Finally, integrating the aforementioned research, and considering that the dynamic evolution of user cognition leads to variations in trust responses and attitudes toward rumor and antirumor information, the concepts of trust states—trust in rumor (TR) and trust in antirumor (TA)—are introduced into the classical susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. On this basis, a rumor propagation susceptible-trused-infectious-recovered (STIR) model incorporating user cognitive biases and evolutionary game theory is further constructed. Experimental results demonstrate that this model effectively reveals the game dynamics of multiple types of rumor information, providing a more efficient framework for studying rumor propagation in social networks.},

  abstract     = {Detecting rumors on social networks is increasingly important due to their rapid dissemination and negative societal impact. The structural characteristics of propagation play a crucial role in rumor detection. However, most current graph neural network-based methods focus on spatial structural features, overlooking the temporal structural features or exploring spatio-temporal features from a single perspective, failing to comprehensively and finely learn representations of dynamic events. Therefore, this article proposes a multiview spatio-temporal feature learning method based on dual dynamic graph convolutional networks. First, dynamic graphs of information propagation and user interactions are constructed based on retweet and reply relationships. Second, BERT is utilized to extract semantic features of content, serving as initial node representations for the information propagation graph, while social features of users serve as initial node representations for the user interaction graph.

Finally, a time fusion unit based on cross-attention is devised to facilitate the learning and fusion of the spatio-temporal features from the two dynamic graphs.

  abstract     = {Current projections indicate that many countries worldwide are experiencing an increase in the older adult population. Thus, it is important to develop methodologies and tools to improve the quality of life of aging people in terms of their cognitive, social, and physical well-being. An area that is currently showing considerable potential in coping with cognitive decline associated with the aging process is digital serious games. Recent years have witnessed a significant attention increase toward this topic with contributions from several research communities. Although some previous work aimed to synthesize the main findings in related areas, a focused and systematic review categorizing and discussing the literature on cognitive training for older adults is still lacking. To this aim, we selected 113 relevant articles from four international databases. We analyzed them on different relevant dimensions, such as the interactive technologies employed in the games, the activities supported, the user profiles participating in the studies, the factors influencing user engagement and motivation, and the effects of training on the addressed cognitive functions. The analysis of the above dimensions is useful to uncover the factors that distinguish successful cognitive interventions from less effective ones and to facilitate the creation of engaging training programs tailored to the needs of older adults. At the same time, by highlighting promising avenues for further research, the review provides useful indications to researchers and practitioners interested in this field.},

Despite the lack of appropriate benchmark video datasets for forgery detection at night time using infrared (IR) video modality, we designed a novel ground truth annotated forged video dataset named as “NV2CIR (Night Vision Video Forensic Challenges based IR Forged Dataset)” in real-world night time situations. The dataset contains various 310 infrared imaging based forged videos (i.e., object based forgery, interframe forgery, and intraframe forgery) and their corresponding 310 authentic videos. The article also proposed a novel framework named as “AFOD-Net (attention guided fake object detection network)” for localization of spliced objects in night vision outdoor scenarios. The proposed network employs a long short term memory (LSTM) module and our proposed spliced object attention module (SOA) so as to precisely localize the spatio-temporal spliced regions.

  abstract     = {Minimum-cost consensus (MCC) is an effective technique for reducing differences of opinion in group decision-making that is sensitive to adjustment costs. Classical MCC aims to obtain an optimal solution regarding the consensus reaching process (CRP) with the objective function of minimizing the group adjustment cost. However, the following limitations exist: 1) the absolute adjustment cost is usually employed as the sole criterion, which is susceptible to the uneven distribution of individual opinions; and 2) while some MCC models account for over-adjustment, how to prevent over-adjustment in the CRP with relative adjustment costs remains almost unexplored. To this end, this study proposes minimum-relative-cost consensus (MRCC) models based on personalized feedback constraints. First, the concept of relative adjustment cost is defined. The notion of personalized feedback constraint is introduced to take full account for individual willingness to adjust their respective opinions. According to different types of consensus constraints, three personalized feedback constraint-driven MRCC models are constructed. We then perform the cost analysis, which shows that MRCC changes the acting mechanism of classical MCC on CRP. In addition, we explore the integration of MCC and MRCC to fully utilize the advantages of both. Finally, a case study of online healthcare community knowledge services and the comparative analysis reveals the feasibility and advantages of the models.},

  abstract     = {Short videos have surged in popularity on social media. The emotions expressed by short videos can trigger or even magnify the public sentiment. Hence, accurate computation of these emotions is vital for social affective computing. However, the multimodal emotion analysis of short videos on social platforms faces some challenges: the accuracy of the model is tested by the disunity of video resolution; the collection of large-scale social media data, the manual transcription and segmentation of audio content, and the precise labeling process require a lot of manpower. In this article, we have proposed an affective computing system MEAS for social short videos, which combines multiscale resolution adaptability and advanced RoBERTa model to optimize the preprocessing of high definition large size short videos and improve the contribution of text modality in emotion analysis. In addition, the system also adopts automatic audio segmentation and transcription technology to realize the efficient capture of speech forms in social short videos. Experimental results show that compared with the leading open source algorithm V2EM on the IEMOCAP dataset, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in weighted accuracy and F1 score of 4.17% and 7.29%, respectively. We constructed a novel dataset named “Bili-news” based on social platform news short videos, validating the effectiveness of the MEAS system. Through experimental verification, we also find a significant positive correlation between the emotions expressed in short videos and the social sentiments of the audience.},

  abstract     = {The enigmatic link between inflation and remittances in Pakistan has puzzled economists. We argue hidden time scales, beyond short-run and long-run, hold the key. Using wavelet decomposition and employing Granger causality on 1991(07)-2022(06) data, we find a nuanced picture. Remittances from Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries engage in a “bidirectional tango” with inflation in the medium-long run, impacting each other. Intriguingly, remittances from other regions (USA, U.K., and EU) follow similar steps, except in the USA where inflation leads remittances in the medium-long term. This partially supports our hypothesis that inflation can drive remittances, particularly during the year’s first months. While in short run, a counterintuitive dynamic emerges where inflation exerts a transitory influence on remittances, the relationship undergoes a reversal across the year, with remittances becoming a catalyst for inflation, potentially mediated by an upsurge in construction activity. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that remittances are predominantly utilized for essential necessities or investments, rather than nonfood purchases. Overall, in the short and medium term, inflation acts as a driver of remittances, with cyclical fluctuations in inflation mirroring those in remittances, particularly during the first half of the year. This dynamic weakens or disappears in the long run, suggesting other factors dominate. The complex relationship between inflation and remittances unfolds across timeframes and depends on remittance source country and inflation indicator. This study paves the way for research informing policy decisions that promote economic growth, maintain stability, and harness the full potential of remittances for Pakistan.},

This model directly analyzes and synthesizes customer feedback from online reviews to generate dynamic and precise hotel ratings.

The proposed hotel rating model outperformed baseline models across experiments, demonstrating superior adaptability, scalability, and robustness. Notably, it achieved an accuracy of 0.9123 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9536 on diverse datasets, and its performance consistently improved with increased data volumes, reaching 0.9376 accuracy and 0.9612 AUC at 75% data volume.

Graphs with weak information lack adequate training data to guide the graph learning process, resulting in performance loss. This article presents a novel automated data augmentation for graphs with weak information, namely AutoDAW, which aims to derive more informative node representations from incomplete input graphs in an adaptive way. To learn local features at the subgraph level, we adopt a reinforcement learning method to optimize the aggregation range for each node. To capture global semantic information, we present a graph diffusion-based long-range propagation method to facilitate more effective node feature propagation and aggregation. The dual-stage information aggregation promotes synergistic interactions between the two node representations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of AutoDAW.},

  abstract     = {In multimedia social networks, the user's geo-location can be inferred by matching his shared images with the referenced satellite images, viz. cross-view image geo-localization. Although the existing most cross-view image geo-localization methods perform well in the center-misaligned scenario, in practical application, the shooting location of the query ground image is most likely not aligned with the center point of satellite images. Then, their geo-localization accuracy would drastically decrease. Therefore, we propose a novel cross-view image geo-localization model based on ground-to-satellite (G2S) transform, named CIG2S. First, the queried ground image is transformed into the aerial-view by spherical transform, generating G2S images, which could improve the similarity between ground and satellite images. Second, multiscale features are extracted from the original ground image, G2S images, and satellite images by twins-PCPVT. Furthermore, a dynamic similarity weighted loss function is designed to measure the distance between the query ground image and the referenced satellite image. Experimental results on three center-misaligned datasets, including VIGOR and the center-misaligned versions of CVUSA and CVACT, demonstrate that the proposed CIG2S model can significantly improve the geo-localization accuracy. For example, when compared with another vision-transformer-based model L2LTR-polar, CIG2S can outperform about 6.6% and 15.8% in the center-misaligned datasets CVUSA_CM and CVACT_CM.},

Existing methods improve ASC performance by incorporating syntactic dependencies through a graph convolution layer on top of BERT. However, these approaches often assign a fixed weight to edges with the same dependency type, overlooking the contextual nuances these dependencies can convey. To address this, we propose syntax-enhanced BERT (SE-BERT), which integrates syntactic distance embeddings, a syntax-enhanced transformer, aspect-specific masking, and a sentiment classification layer. SE-BERT advances previous methods in two main ways. First, SE-BERT enables dynamic weighting for edges with the same dependency type based on the source node's part-of-speech (POS) tags, which enhances graph propagation accuracy and enables more precise edge associations. Second, rather than adding additional graph convolutional layers on top of BERT, SE-BERT replaces BERT's final Transformer layers with the proposed SE-Transformer. This approach directly encodes syntactic information into the attention distribution and word representation within scaled dot-product attention. The model can be initialized from a pretrained checkpoint and fine-tuned for downstream tasks without requiring additional training parameters. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SE-BERT outperforms existing ASC methods.},

The sustainability and success of open source projects rely heavily on the active community of contributors, who have the freedom to join or depart voluntarily. The churn of core developers can have detrimental effects on the continuous development and progress of these communities. Therefore, previous studies have aimed to identify the factors that influence developer churn and reveal its impact on open source communities. However, there is currently a lack of research on predicting whether a developer will leave or retain within a given timeframe. This article aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel model called context-aware dynamic graph neural network (ConDyGNN), which is designed specifically for predicting developer churn in open source communities. By leveraging historical data, this model takes into consideration various factors such as developers’ activities, collaborative networks, and community context information. To capture both temporal dependencies and spatial correlations among different developers, temporal convolutional network (TCN) and graph convolutional network (GCN) modules are employed in ConDyGNN. Furthermore, a context-aware module based on a multihead attention mechanism is proposed to effectively integrate macrolevel community information and enhance the predictive performance. The superiority of the proposed model is empirically demonstrated through extensive comparative experiments and an ablation study.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of the health insurance system, the problem of health insurance fraud is becoming more and more prominent. Health insurance fraud not only harms health insurance organizations financially but also causes serious disruptions to the normal provision of healthcare services. Current fraud detection methods usually rely on a single data source or specific features, making it difficult to comprehensively capture the complex patterns and intrinsic associations of fraudulent behavior. Therefore, the aim of this study is to efficiently integrate feature information from different perspectives of health insurance data using multiperspective representation learning. Health insurance fraud detection via multiview heterogeneous information networks with augmented graph structure learning (MHINAGSL) is proposed. Initially, multiple heterogeneous graphs are constructed based on health insurance datasets, encompassing diffusion, topology, feature, and semantic graphs. To enhance these foundational perspectives, a confidence fusion optimizer is employed. Additionally, a multichannel semantic graph convolution with shared parameters is introduced to effectively integrate diverse meta-path semantic graphs. Subsequently, an adaptive attention mechanism assigns weights to different views, facilitating the comprehensive fusion of information from multiple perspectives and enabling a more accurate characterization of the richness of health insurance data. Ultimately, the combination of multiple loss functions is employed for end-to-end model training, aiming to fully leverage the complementary advantages of multiview data, thereby enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of fraud detection models. We fully apply the proposed method to real health insurance datasets and provide in-depth validation of its comprehensive utility in real-world scenarios. Extensive experimental results fully confirm that our approach achieves significant results in improving accuracy and recall. Particularly noteworthy is that in the anomaly detection experiments, our method achieved an F1 score as high as 0.92, further proving its excellent performance. This also demonstrates the practical application and research value of the approach based on multiview heterogeneous information network structure learning in the field of health insurance fraud detection.},

To address this issue, this article proposes a two-stage MADM consensus method for large-scale participatory budget project selection problems. In the first stage, the ISODATA algorithm segments large participatory districts into subclusters, followed by an iterative algorithm based on group contribution theory to generate subcluster decision matrices. In the second stage, each subcluster is treated as a new participant, with district fairness considered to refine decision-making power through iterative adjustments, resulting in more manageable decisions. Finally, the iterative consensus-reaching algorithm is applied again to get the final group decision result. The applicability of the proposed methodology is verified through a case study in the Poland participant city project selection budget and comparative analysis. The result demonstrates that the methodology can integrate the preferences of different districts, facilitate budget consensus reaching, and improve the misrepresentations and fairness of decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Empowered by blockchain technology, smart contracts have attracted considerable interest from Web3 users due to their distinct advantages. Nevertheless, it is challenging to address problems caused by the dramatic expansion of the Web3 ecosystem. This article introduces the smart contract-as-a-service (SCaaS) paradigm to mitigate smart contracts’ redundant deployment via their composability and reusability. Moreover, we design trust and incentive schemes to ensure project security and developer engagement in SCaaS. Specifically, we first introduce a reputation filter by leveraging the authentic on-chain data, aiming to eliminate high-risk contracts. We then design a contract-based incentive mechanism to help the foundation attract heterogeneous developers with multidimensional private information, and maximize the foundation’s utility by inducing developers to undertake projects of differing complexities based on their ability. We further differentiate between veteran and newcome developers and examine their influences on foundational strategies. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed contracts can efficiently remove high-risk smart contracts, maximize the foundation’s utility, and ensure that developers select contracts honestly and participate in the SCaaS ecosystem actively.},

  abstract     = {Fake news detection on social media is crucial to purifying the online environment and protecting public safety. Many existing methods explore the news propagation structures through graph neural networks (GNNs) to determine the truthfulness of news. End-to-end supervised GNNs notoriously depend on large amounts of labels. Recently, self-supervised graph pretraining has been a promising solution to alleviate the dependence on labels. However, the application of graph pretraining in fake news detection still suffers from two challenges: 1) the missing and unreliable interactions intrinsic in the news propagation structures seriously damage the pretraining performance. 2) There is an inherent gap between pretraining and downstream fake news detection tasks due to inconsistency in optimization objectives, which hinders the efficient transfer of pretrained prior knowledge and causes suboptimal detection results. To address the above two challenges, we propose RGCP, a structure redefined graph pretraining with contrastive prompting for fake news detection. Specifically, we design a propagation structure refinement module that adds potential implicit interactions and removes noisy interactions according to the connection probabilities between posts estimated under the guidance of self-supervised contrastive learning. Thereby, the redefined structures provide reliable news propagation patterns to generate robust pretrained news representations. Moreover, we propose a novel prompt tuning based on the contrastive learning module that reformulates the downstream fake news detection task in a similar form as the graph contrastive pretraining, bridging the optimization objective gap. The extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of RGCP, achieving an average improvement of 10.15% in few-shot classification.},

  abstract     = {In real-world networks, such as social networks, the occurrence of random failures or external attacks on network components can lead to the discontinuation of information flow in the network. Hence, ensuring the existence and robustness of these networks is a crucial concern these days. To address this problem, one possible solution is to redesign the connection between individual nodes in the network using some budget-constrained rewiring operations. Multiple rewiring operations help in building trust between individuals and strengthening their connections, further enhancing overall connectivity and information flow in the network. The effectiveness of rewiring approaches is determined by analyzing some important facts, such as the rewiring cost, adherence to budget constraints, and enhancement in network connectivity. To assess the efficacy of rewiring approaches, the rewiring cost has been regularly updated after each rewiring operation by measuring the evolution of the size of the giant component in the social network. The performance of the proposed budget-constrained rewiring approaches is evaluated against the random rewiring approach. The results show the superiority of the proposed approaches on the benchmark real-world dataset. By leveraging these budget-constrained rewiring approaches, it becomes possible to design social systems that exhibit enhanced stability and reliability of social networks in the face of various disruptions.},

With increased economic activity, various interrelations between listed companies have become important for accurate predictions. These relations can be represented as complex financial networks, aiding the development of effective graph neural network (GNN) prediction methods. However, current GNN-based methods for stock prediction typically rely on a single static network representation, which fails to capture the dynamic and multifaceted relationships inherent in financial markets. In this article, we propose the multilayer spatial–temporal graph neural network (MST-GNN) to model the complex and evolving interactions between stocks. The MST-GNN framework incorporates a novel spatial–temporal cross-layer high-order fusion mechanism, which includes two key components: spatial–temporal neighborhood aggregation and cross-layer high-order feature fusion. These components enable the model to effectively capture both the temporal evolution and cross-network feature interactions of stocks. Our extensive experiments on four stock networks from the China A-share market demonstrate that MST-GNN significantly outperforms existing GNN-based methods on stock price trend classification and return ranking tasks.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal emotion recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movement signals has shown to be a promising approach to provide more discriminative information about human emotional states. However, most current works rely on a subject-dependent approach, limiting their applicability to new users. Recently, some studies have explored multimodal domain adaptation to address the mentioned issue by transferring information from known subjects to new ones. Unfortunately, existing methods are still exposed to negative transfer as a suboptimal distribution alignment is performed between subjects, while irrelevant information is not discarded. In this article, we present a multimodal and multisource domain adaptation (MMDA) method, which adopts the following three strategies: 1) marginal and conditional distribution alignments must be performed between each known subject and a new one; 2) relevant distribution alignments must be prioritized to avoid a negative transfer; and 3) modality fusion results should be improved by extracting more discriminative features from EEG signals and selecting relevant features across modalities. Our proposed method was evaluated with leave-one-subject-out cross validation on four public datasets: SEED, SEED-GER, SEED-IV, and SEED-V. Experimental results show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art results for each dataset when subject data from different sessions are combined into a single dataset. Moreover, MMDA exceeds the state of the art in 8 out of 11 different sessions when each session is evaluated.},

  abstract     = {The two most common families of electoral systems (ESs), defining the rules used to elect assemblies and legislative institutions, are proportional representation (PR) and plurality (Bormann and Golder, 2013; Farrell, 2011). When they are evaluated, most often the arguments come from social choice theory and political science. The former overall uses an axiomatic approach that includes a list of mathematical criteria a system should fulfill (Urken et al., 1995; Sen, 1995). The latter predominantly focuses on the tradeoff between proportionality of apportionment and governability (Monroe, 1994; Carey and Hix, 2011). However, there is an ongoing discussion about which ES is the best (Bowler et al., 2005; Farrell and Gallagher, 1999) and which set of indexes and measures would be the most important in such assessment (Pennisi, 1998). Although previous research addressed various perceptions of fairness related to the proportionality of different ESs (Blau, 2004; Plescia et al., 2020), the sensitivity of ES to efforts that influence opinions has been neglected. Here, we address this research gap with a framework that can measure ESs’ susceptibility to different means of influence. Using a simulation study, we show that plurality ESs are less stable than PR. They are more susceptible to coordinated efforts to influence opinions, for example, by political agitators and media propaganda. A review of real-world ES reveals possible improvements in their design, leading to lower susceptibility. Additionally, our simulation framework allows the computation of popular indexes, such as the Gallagher index and the effective number of parties, in different scenarios. Our work provides a new tool for dealing with modern threats to democracy that could destabilize voting processes (Hyde, 2020). Furthermore, our results add an important argument to a long-standing discussion on the evaluation of ES.},

However, factors such as hidden social relationships between users, various social contents, and diverse application scenarios in the vast social network bring severe challenges to the timely and accurate detection of rumors. Therefore, for the sake of exploring the infulence of the above factors, we propose an adaptive rumor detection model combining propagation link prediction (PLP) and semantic-structure adaptive fusion, PLP and semantic-structure adaptive fusion (PLP-SSAF). First, we investigate in depth the impact of hidden social relationships on the propagation structure of posts. We leverage the hidden social relationships between users, and utilize the graph attention neural network to extract propagation structure features that simultaneously include both current and future propagation structure. Second, in order to overcome regional and cultural differences among users in multidialect environment, we enhance the text in the original dataset and merge it with the source text. We use a language representation model to extract semantic features from the joint text, getting joint semantic features that can more comprehensively represent the text. Finally, we propose a parallel features adaptive fusion mechanism that can dynamically update the weights between propagating structure features and semantic features. This enables the obtained post features to better adapt to rumor detection scenarios in social networks under massive data environments. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our PLP-SSAF significantly improving rumor detection performance in accuracy and generalization over existing methods, and demonstrates superior rumor detection capabilities at early stages.},

However, existing techniques face two challenges: 1) the inherent sparse supervision signals and noise issues in real-world social networks; 2) current social recommendation methods suffer from the neglect of user preference and social attribute heterogeneity, which hinders the extraction of preference-related information from social networks. Taking inspiration from social enhancement and contrastive learning methods, we propose a social recommendation model DSVC based on dual social view contrastive learning. Specifically, in response to the first challenge, our model derives the consistency factors of users in different augmented social views, which are used to highlight noise-resistant users and jettison preference-independent social relationships in social views. To address the second challenge, we adopt probability vectors generated from consistency factors. These vectors guide the cross-view augmentation process of the interaction graph, which helps supplement social self-supervised signals and effectively avoid noise retained due to indiscriminate augmentation. The baseline model comparison experiment, ablation experiment, parameter adjustment experiment and robustness experiment conducted on three different real-world datasets consistently validated the effectiveness of our model in improving recommendation performance.},

  abstract     = {Cross-corpus speech emotion recognition (SER) poses a challenge due to feature distribution mismatch between the training and testing speech samples, potentially degrading the performance of established SER methods. In this article, we tackle this challenge by proposing a novel transfer subspace learning method called acoustic knowledge-guided transfer linear regression (AKTLR). Unlike existing approaches, which often overlook domain-specific knowledge related to SER and simply treat cross-corpus SER as a generic transfer learning task, our AKTLR method is built upon a well-designed acoustic knowledge-guided dual sparsity constraint mechanism. This mechanism emphasizes the potential of minimalistic acoustic parameter feature sets to alleviate classifier over-adaptation, which is empirically validated acoustic knowledge in SER, enabling superior generalization in cross-corpus SER tasks compared to using large feature sets. Through this mechanism, we extend a simple transfer linear regression model to AKTLR. This extension harnesses its full capability to seek emotion-discriminative and corpus-invariant features from established acoustic parameter feature sets used for describing speech signals across two scales: contributive acoustic parameter groups and constituent elements within each contributive group. We evaluate our method through extensive cross-corpus SER experiments on three widely used speech emotion corpora: EmoDB, eNTERFACE, and CASIA. The proposed AKTLR achieves an average UAR of 42.12% across six tasks using the eGeMAPS feature set, outperforming many recent state-of-the-art transfer subspace learning and deep transfer learning methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of our approach. Furthermore, our work provides experimental evidence supporting the feasibility and superiority of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the transfer learning model to address cross-corpus SER tasks.},

  abstract     = {In the film industry, movie posters have been an essential part of advertising and marketing for many decades and continue to play a vital role even today in the form of digital posters through online, social media, and over-the-top (OTT) platforms. Typically, movie posters can effectively promote and communicate the essence of a film, such as its genre, visual style/tone, vibe, and storyline cue/theme, which are essential to attract potential viewers. Identifying the genres of a movie often has significant practical applications in recommending the film to target audiences. Previous studies on genre identification have primarily focused on sources such as plot synopses, subtitles, metadata, movie scenes, and trailer videos; however, posters precede the availability of these sources and provide prerelease implicit information to generate mass interest. In this article, we work for automated multilabel movie genre identification only from poster images, without any aid of additional textual/metadata/video information about movies, which is one of the earliest attempts of its kind. Here, we present a deep transformer network with a probabilistic module to identify the movie genres exclusively from the poster. For experiments, we procured 13882 number of posters of 13 genres from the Internet movie database (IMDb), where our model performances were encouraging and even outperformed some major contemporary architectures.},

  abstract     = {Information leakage easily occurs in large-scale information interactions and brings harm to individuals, enterprises, and society. As a well-known security policy, Chinese Wall (CW) provides a security guideline, which combines mandatory and discretionary access control to avoid information leakage. Colored Petri nets (CPNs) are a widely used formal method, well suited for verification of CW policy due to the capability of characterizing the concurrency. However, CPN easily suffers from the problem of state space explosion due to the interleaving semantics. The unfolding techniques can effectively alleviate this problem. In this article, we apply simplified CPN and their unfolding techniques to detect information leakage against CW policy. Specifically, we define a CPN-based CW model, propose an algorithm to generate the merged process of CPN, and detect the potential information leakage by analyzing the structural behaviors of its unfoldings. Furthermore, we conduct a case study and several experiments to show the advantages of our method. The results exhibit that our method can effectively detect information leakage against CW policy and alleviate the state space explosion.},

  abstract     = {Density-based techniques are gaining popularity due to their inherent capability to detect nonconvex shaped clusters in the presence of noises and outliers. However, existing approaches suffer from higher computational costs and require optimization of global parameter values to determine similar density regions present within the data. The sparse similarity graphs can aid in detecting the neighborhood information which is essential to calculate the density distribution. We propose a technique, “graphical and gravitational force-based density clustering (GGDC)” by combining the concepts of graph neighborhood, density distribution, and gravitational force of attraction to obtain satisfying results with higher efficacy. First, the neighbors are identified using the similarity graph, and then a new density computation technique is proposed which considers the number of neighbors as well as their proximity information. Next, the density values are utilized to identify the similar density distributed regions using the force of gravity between the data points and their neighbors. Lastly, the neighboring denser regions are merged together to form the actual clusters using the gravitational force of attraction based on their density distribution and proximity. A thorough experimental study is performed to evaluate the performance of GGDC by comparing it to nine other well-known clustering algorithms on 26 diversified synthetic, gene expression, and real datasets including three application areas from computational social systems. The results show that GGDC is effective in identifying complex clusters and is also superior in terms of time complexity, and robustness against noise.},

However, traditional studies ignore DMs’ loss aversion behavior under uncertain environments. To address this gap, this article develops a two-stage distributionally robust minimum cost consensus model under uncertainty with loss aversion (TSDR-MCCM-LA). In the first stage, group opinion is obtained based on a predefined consensus level function. The second stage considers loss aversion under uncertainty. Further, considering DMs’ acceptance degrees of recommendations, we develop $\varepsilon$-TSDR-MCCM-LA and RB-TSDR-MCCM-LA to address DMs’ compromise limit and rejection behaviors, respectively. The proposed models are equivalently transformed into tractable mixed-integer programming models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed models is proved by the case of urban demolition compensation negotiation. Sensitivity and comparison analysis further demonstrate the validity of the proposed model in coping with uncertainty and improving consensus outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Equipment manufacturing industry plays a pivotal role in a nation's economy, national development, and technological innovation. Traditional equipment manufacturing enterprises often face the problem of untimely information sharing and inconsistent focus of various departments in the process of operation, which causes difficulties in analysis and conflict in decision-making. Considering the subjectivity of interdepartmental decisions, reinforcement learning is introduced to analyze the decisions of various departments and get the decisions that best meet the needs of the enterprise. In addition, due to the instability of the internal and external environment of the enterprise, the decision obtained only by the machine usually cannot meet the development requirements of the enterprise, so human–machine coordination is used to adapt to the environmental changes. Therefore, a decision conflict resolution for equipment manufacturing enterprises based on human–machine coordination is proposed in this article. The resolution of conflicts in the context of deep human–computer collaborative decision-making is achieved through the incorporation of expert knowledge twice within the framework of reinforcement learning, thereby expressing preferences for both production factors and decision model structures. The experiments indicate that our model achieves superior performance in resolving decision conflicts.},

However, few existing researches fully consider the inherent characteristics of misinformation (e.g. evoking repulsive effects), as well as the adaptive nature of social relationship or come to see the impacts of algorithmic interventions on online misinformation and the formation process of social groups. To comprehensively investigate the coevolution process of user misinformation beliefs and social relationships under algorithmic interventions, we proposed a novel model with configurations as follows: 1) a nonlinear social influence function constructed to reflect the process of reinforcing misinformation beliefs; 2) probabilities for the rewiring of links among individuals determined by their opinion distance and social distance; and 3) multiple algorithmic mechanisms reformulated, regarding five recommendation processes and the information distribution rules integrating three information sources. Such extensive numerical simulation experiments have revealed diversification, radicalization, and polarization of misinformation. We observe that the introduction of moderate repulsive interactions fosters the emergence of diverse opinions. In absence of algorithmic interventions, misinformation naturally evolves into radicalization, while the introduction of algorithmic interventions exacerbates polarization, particularly with extensive reliance on content-based recommendations and excessive allowance of distributed opinions from recommendations. It is noteworthy that we discover that encouraging recommendation based on predetermined information effectively reverses the trend of misinformation evolution. Our research contributes to clarifying the interaction between human behavior and artificial intelligence, as well as providing insights for misinformation supervision and governance.},

This study proposes an innovative emergency evacuation framework that optimizes the crowd evacuation by integrating multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with adversarial reinforcement learning (ARL). The developed simulation environment models realistic human behavior in complex buildings and incorporates robotic navigation and intelligent path planning. A novel simulated human behavior model was integrated, capable of complex human–robot interaction, independent escape route searching, and exhibiting herd mentality and memory mechanisms. We also proposed a multiagent framework that combines MARL and ARL to enhance overall evacuation efficiency and robustness. Additionally, we developed a new ARL evaluation framework that provides a novel method for quantifying agents’ performance. Various experiments of differing difficulty levels were conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits advantages in emergency evacuation scenarios. Specifically, our ARLR approach increased survival rates by 1.8% points in low-difficulty evacuation tasks compared to the RLR approach using only MARL algorithms. In high-difficulty evacuation tasks, the ARLR approach raised survival rates from 46.7% without robots to 64.4%, exceeding the RLR approach by 1.7% points. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and safety of human–robot collaborative fire evacuations and provides theoretical support for evaluating and improving the performance and robustness of ARL agents.},

However, despite their advanced capabilities, these methods often struggle with significant computational complexity and limited ability to capture temporal dynamic contextual relationships. Recently, a new model architecture called mamba has emerged, noted for its capability to capture complex dependencies in sequences while significantly reducing computational complexity. Building on this, we propose a novel method, TDG-mamba, which integrates mamba for TDG learning. TDG-mamba introduces deep semantic spatiotemporal embeddings into the mamba architecture through a specially designed spatiotemporal prior tokenization module (SPTM). Furthermore, to better leverage temporal information differences and enhance the modeling of dynamic changes in graph structures, we separately design a bidirectional mamba and a directed GNN for improved spatiotemporal embedding learning. Link prediction experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method delivers superior performance, with an average improvement of 5.11% over baseline methods across various settings.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of mashup development composed of various Web APIs in the realm of Web services, API recommendation research has gained significant attention. However, it faces challenges, particularly in dealing with nonpopular APIs. Studies suggest that focusing on nonpopular APIs may better align with developer needs, necessitating a deeper exploration of effective depopular API recommendation methods. Much of the existing research on nonpopular APIs recommendation employs deep learning methods, which focus on studying recommendation strategies to improve accuracy rather than composition recommendation strategies. Currently, there are two main challenges regarding depopular API composition recommendation methods, including compatibility concerns and the impact of popularity bias. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel approach called the depopularity web API compatible compositions recommendation approach (DPAR), which is a recommendation method designed for the compatible composition of Web APIs with long-tail mining capabilities that can mitigate the effects of popularity bias. DPAR builds a depopularity web API correlation graph (DP-ACG) and proposes a minimum weighted subgraph algorithm to select candidate Web API compositions that meet development requirements based on DP-ACG. The design of DP-ACG assures that candidate compositions generated by this method are depopularized and compatible. Subsequently, utilize the DPP algorithm to rerank the candidate Web API compositions, enhancing the diversity of the results. To evaluate DPARs performance, we conducted extensive experiments on real datasets to verify the efficacy of each module in DPAR and illustrate the impact of parameter settings. The experimental results demonstrate that DPAR consistently outperforms comparative methods, yielding significantly superior performance.},

The research incorporates bibliometric analyses along with small business innovation research (SBIR) data to yield a holistic view of the science-industry interface. We quantify the temporal effects and impact latency of scientific advancements on industrial activity across 10873 topics and take into account their taxonomic relationships, spanning from 2010 to 2021. We find that the impact of scientific advances on industrial projects across different thematic depths consistently exhibited p-values less than 0.05, underscoring the significant predictive power of contemporary scientific activities on future industrial projects. Further, we demonstrate that the semantic contents of scientific paper abstracts within a topic are associated with future industrial project description text embeddings. The frequency analysis reveals that various scientific activities significantly inform future industrial project funding across varying depths of MeSH topic categorization, highlighting the significant role of science in steering industrial innovation.

During the early phase of infection, asymptomatic carriers exhibit the same activity level as susceptible individuals, which presents challenges for incorporating control measures in epidemic projection models. This article focuses on modeling and cost-efficient activity control of susceptible and carrier individuals in the context of the susceptible-carrier-infected-removed (SCIR) epidemic model over a two-layer contact network. In this model, individuals switch from a static contact layer to create new links in a temporal layer based on state-dependent activation rates. We derive conditions for the infection to die out or persist in a homogeneous network. Considering the significant costs associated with reducing the activity of susceptible and carrier individuals, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the disease decay rate while constrained by a limited budget. We propose the use of successive geometric programming (SGP) approximation for this optimization task. Through simulation experiments on Poisson random graphs, we assess the impact of different parameters on disease prevalence. The results demonstrate that our SGP framework achieves a cost reduction of nearly $33$% compared to conventional methods based on degree and closeness centrality.},
