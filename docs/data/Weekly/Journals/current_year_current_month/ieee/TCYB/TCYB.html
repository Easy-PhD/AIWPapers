  abstract     = {This brief proposes an optimized time-synchronized control method based on reinforcement learning for the bipartite consensus tracking problem. The study considers multiagent system comprising leaders and followers, where followers interact through signed directed graphs. Some agents track the leader’s state, while others converge to its opposite value. The proposed method employs a time-synchronized sliding mode control framework to ensure fixed-time bipartite consensus among agents with signed interaction topology. Reinforcement learning is integrated to optimize the control process, wherein an actor–critic architecture is utilized to minimize the Bellman residual, enabling optimal control performance. Theoretical analysis proves the fixed-time convergence and Bellman optimality of the system, with the upper bound of convergence time explicitly determined by controller parameters. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method: all followers simultaneously achieve bipartite consensus within a fixed time, while reinforcement learning significantly and adaptively optimizes the control process.},

First, to avoid collisions with obstacles, a safe reference trajectory planning method is proposed, which dynamically projects unsafe segments of a reference trajectory onto the outer boundary of obstacle regions, enabling the agent to bypass the obstacle. Second, by using only input-output information, a distributed tracking controller incorporating two dynamical barrier functions is designed, which allows the agent to adaptively decelerate within the coverage range of the barrier function to avoid collisions. Finally, sufficient conditions are provided to ensure that the agent can successfully bypass obstacles using the proposed control strategy.

This article introduces an efficient encryption mechanism configured for securing the physical layer communication in these systems while transmitting data over optical fiber networks using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing active optical networks. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the hypersensitive chaotic properties of the Lorenz map to provide robust multidimensional encryption and confidentiality. The encryption process involves arranging bulk encoded codewords in a table structure shape, with each column representing individual codewords encoded by pipelined successive cancellation polar encoding. A Lorenz map is then utilized to generate three distinct chaotic keys, which are employed to reindex the rows and columns of the table structured codeword along with the subcarrier remapping in the constellation map. This reindexing operation provides an additional layer of security against potential brute-force attacks. Performance metrics such as computational efficiency, security robustness, and resistance to various noise and distortion sources are being evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate promising levels of security and resilience against potential threats on the physical layer of communications. The scheme’s compatibility with the technical environment ensures seamless integration into existing CCSs infrastructure, making it a resilient solution for securing critical physical layer transmissions.},

To tackle the dynamic uncertainty while maintaining safety constraints on system state, a novel hierarchical formation control framework is presented. First, a nonlinear mapping function (NMF) is introduced, which, by integrating HOFA theory, effectively transforms the original constrained system into an unconstrained HOFA tracking error model, thus removing the feasibility conditions typically required in traditional barrier Lyapunov function methods. Subsequently, distributed observers are designed in the upper layer for followers to estimate the leader’s information, while an adaptive formation controller is directly constructed for each follower in the lower layer using the fully actuated theory. Particularly, the neural network approximators are used to learn unknown nonlinear dynamics. By employing Lyapunov stability theory, the designed formation controller guarantees that the entire state stays within the specified constraint set while also ensuring the desired formation performance. Finally, the developed formation control algorithm is proven effective by applying it to a network of multiple robotic arm systems.},

This control method eliminates the model dependence and simplifies the control strategy synthesis by employing a compact form dynamic linearization data model, which is constructed from real-time output torque and input current measurements of the MRFDC. Furthermore, based on the proposed data model, the DSMC is employed based on a minimum operator sliding mode reaching law to deal with the rate-dependent hysteresis and nonlinearity of the MRFDC. Experimental studies validate that the presented control method provides satisfactory torque tracking performance in both transient and steady states.},

The negative deviation effects between the event-triggered controller and the continuous controller are eliminated by introducing two intermediate sampling deviation terms. Moreover, a performance function is introduced to achieve more flexible tracking performance. This function represents different performance behaviors and addresses the issue of redesigning controllers.

To solve this problem, the multiplicative noise Gaussian perturbation strategy and the additive noise linear fusion strategy are proposed to capture fault information beyond source domain distributions. The former is used to randomly perturb feature statistics of multisource domains to simulate the uncertainty of domain shift, while the latter is used to perform the additive noise linear operation on feature statistics of multiple source domains to ensure the authenticity of the generated feature styles. Further, the feature statistics generated by both strategies are mixed with random convex weights to obtain new feature styles, achieving the best compromise between reliability and diversity. The network can learn more fault information from features with diversified styles. Extensive experimental results on both public and real datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the adaptive resilient flexible output containment (FOC) control problem for semi-Markov jump fully heterogeneous multiagent systems (FHMASs) under random switching topologies and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In contrast to most existing containment control results, the proposed control strategy can address the challenges posed by the full heterogeneity of multiagent systems (MASs), particularly when multiple leaders exhibit different system dynamics. To better reflect real-world MASs and communication networks, multiple asynchronous semi-Markov chains are employed for the first time to capture system parameter variations and communication topology switching, incorporating generally uncertain transition rates (TRs). In order to deal with this problem, a novel adaptive observer-based FOC control framework is developed. First, by introducing an adaptive gain, the adaptive resilient observers can observe leaders’ states without prior knowledge of global topology information and TRs, while resisting the impacts of random switching topologies and DoS attacks. Then, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to ensure the achievement of FOC. Notably, the containment coefficients in the controller design are no longer tied to the Laplacian matrix and can be flexibly predefined to align with specific task requirements. Furthermore, the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to obtain estimator gain matrices and controller gain matrices are derived for the case of generally uncertain TRs, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical method is demonstrated through the simulation.},

This article investigates a collaborative scheduling problem in a cascaded dual-shop production setting.

In addition, real-world production often involves a mode where main and suborders must be integrated through mating operations. This study formulates an energy-efficient cascaded dual-shop collaborative scheduling problem with the mating operation (ECDCSP-M). The focus is on developing a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for the ECDCSP-M and designing an end-to-end graph-based deep reinforcement learning (GDRL) approach. A dual-shop heterogeneous graph is constructed to capture the real-time state of the entire system, in which “job-factory” and “operation-machine” pairs are defined as agent actions. A heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) is then proposed, employing a three-stage embedding mechanism to model complex relationships, including mating operations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves strong generalization across varying problem complexities and provides robust solutions to challenging scheduling scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In wastewater treatment process (WWTP), the dissolved oxygen concentration (DOC) sensor fault provides incorrect data to the control system, affecting the blower operation. This leads to insufficient aeration and increases the risk of membrane fouling. To solve this problem, a robust model-free fault-tolerant controller (RMFFTC) is designed. First, the pseudo partial derivative (PPD) approach is utilized to transform nonlinear WWTP into a compact form dynamic linearization (CFDL) data model with residual disturbances. Then, according to the CFDL model, a robust fault detection threshold is designed by the extended state observer (ESO) to timely detect the occurrence of faults. Second, after detecting the DOC sensor fault, the fault is estimated using the fuzzy neural network (FNN) considering that the fault is unknown. Third, an improved RMFFTC is designed based on the fault estimation information. In particular, to ensure stable DOC tracking under sensor faults, the controller design considers the output tracking error variation. In addition, the bounded-input–bounded-output (BIBO) stability result is provided to theoretically guarantee the usefulness of the proposed RMFFTC for DOC control affected by the sensor fault. Finally, the effectiveness of the RMFFTC are verified through extensive simulations in the membrane bioreactor (MBR) model.},

Initially, the silicon single crystal growth systems are modeled by using the geometrical models of meniscus section, hydrodynamic and heat transfer process of silicon single crystal growth. Since numerous unmeasurable state variables exist in systems and the growth equipments are affected by external and internal disturbances, consideration is given to employing the output feedback control scheme and disturbance observer method in the construction of the anti-disturbance switching controller. Meanwhile, considering the high accuracy of linear systems at equilibrium points, the silicon single crystal growth systems are divided into multiple subsystems using switching control method, that is, multiple equilibrium points are set to enable the systems to switch between different subsystem models, thereby the precision of silicon single crystal growth systems has been improved. Then, using the multiple Lyapunov function method and linear matrix inequality technique, the exponential stability of silicon single crystal growth systems is ensured with the $\boldsymbol {H_{\infty }}$ performance. Finally, the feasibility of designed switching anti-disturbance output feedback control method is verified through actual parameters of silicon single crystal growth systems.},

Furthermore, a generalized Halanay-like inequality (GHLI) is proposed to address the effects of time scale discontinuities and DoS attacks on sampling intervals. Compared with the common Halanay inequality (CHI) used in continuous-time sampled-data systems, the GHLI accommodates TSTSs and permits some sampling intervals that exceed the constraints of the CHI.

The false injection information of the attack is generated by a stochastic inverse dynamics system satisfying the stochastic input-to-state stable condition, and the input of the system depends on the relevant output information of neighboring agents, rather than all state information. In this case, we develop a novel distributed output feedback consensus control algorithm to overcome the impact of attacks and stochastic disturbances. First, we design the distributed linear controller with a compensator for each follower based on the relevant outputs, and provide sufficient conditions for ensuring its effectiveness. Then, we construct a new candidate Lyapunov function with a power constant that is used to relax the constraints of the attack model. Subsequently, by means of the exchanging supply function approach, we strictly prove that all agents can achieve leader-following full-state bounded consensus in probability.

To address this problem, a dual event-triggered spatial model predictive control (DET-SMPC) under a data-driven framework is investigated for distributed thermal processes to achieve good global performance. The spatiotemporal model is built utilizing the time/space theorem and updated to accommodate the time-varying system dynamics. Since the controller effect will be affected when the model is switched, it is necessary to identify the preferable switching mode. Therefore, an adaptive MU approach based on an error-triggered generator is proposed. Subsequently, ET-model predictive control (MPC), the controller activation threshold derived from the Lyapunov function, is introduced. The controller will only be activated when the threshold is triggered, resulting in better performance. The availability of the dual event-triggered spatial MPC (DET-SMPC) is confirmed through both simulation studies and oven experiments.},

This assumption ensures that the subsequence of solutions sampled at impulsive moments is a Markov chain. Based on this assumption and the semi-tensor product (STP), random impulsive BCNs (RI-BCNs) can be converted into impulsive-interval driven probabilistic BCNs (ID-PBCNs), and the input-state transition probability matrix (IS-TPM) is constructed, the calculations of convergent target set in the hybrid domain and the time domain are discussed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic feedback set stabilizability are obtained.

  abstract     = {Communication imperfections, such as variable sampling periods and packet dropouts induced by insufficient network bandwidth, can degrade the control performance and even jeopardize the stability of networked control systems (NCSs). A stochastic communication protocol (SCP) is usually adopted to ensure that only one sensor node can transmit the output signal to the controller at each sampling instant, thus conserving network bandwidth resources. This article focuses on the output feedback synthesis problem for NCSs in the presence of the SCP, considering two-channel successive packet dropouts (SPDs) and multiple probability sampling periods (MPSPs). Among these, MPSPs mean that there are three or more different sampling rates in system. To address the output feedback synthesis problem, we first obtain the discrete-time augmented model of the closed-loop NCS with a dynamic output feedback controller. This model incorporates an equivalent sampling period representation between adjacent nonpacket-dropout instants, which plays a pivotal role in our analysis. Furthermore, a general analysis model is established by considering the effects of the SCP. Based on this model, conditions for designing the dynamic output feedback controller, represented by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), are established using a two-step synthesis approach. In particular, the dimension of the obtained controller design conditions remains unchanged with respect to the upper bound of SPDs and the number of possible sampling periods, especially through the introduction of a matrix decomposition method, which is more general than existing results. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated through an illustrated example.},

By adjusting the desired entanglement level, the proposed method can generate a wide range of states, including both bipartite and multipartite configurations, as well as pure and mixed states. Since the entanglement measure is scalar-valued, the resulting control law is inherently independent of the number of subsystems—an important advantage of the proposed approach. Among various entangled states, maximally entangled states (MESs) are of particular interest. Lyapunov stability of the control scheme is established, and numerical simulations confirm its effectiveness in robustly generating MESs in both bipartite and multipartite systems.},

  abstract     = {In complex and variable terrains, affine formation control, with its flexible formation adjustment ability, can achieve various formation shapes to adapt well to the environment. Notably, the existing affine formation research based on stress matrices require the variation parameters for translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing of formations to be predesigned offline. To address this, we propose a novel method for online affine parameter adjustment that enables self-reconfiguration of formations in multiobstacle environments. By adopting artificial potential field environment excitation, the proposed motion planning algorithm can dynamically adjust the affine transformation parameters online, and realize the self-reconfiguration of formation shape to avoid collision. Then, a distributed model predictive controller is proposed for multiagent systems, which actively utilizes historical control input information to flexibly adjust controller performance while avoiding algebraic loops between neighboring agent controllers. The algorithm separates stability and performance optimization within the nonlinear model predictive control framework, ensuring both the feasibility and stability of the underlying optimization. Finally, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller.},

Starting with the quadratic Lyapunov function of isolated node, we construct a quadratic Lyapunov function of complex network for estimating the DOA of network. In this way, if the largest spherical estimate of the DOA for isolated node can be obtained, we can directly obtain the largest spherical estimate of the DOA for network. Then, for improving the existing estimate, we directly utilize the Laplacian matrix to ingeniously construct a new Lyapunov-like function, relaxing the constraint that the derivative of the Lyapunov function is negative definite in a neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, we iteratively compute Lyapunov-like functions to maximize the obtained estimate as far as possible. Afterward, for polynomial networks, the estimate problem of the DOA is transformed into a classical sum of squares (SOS) programming problem. Particularly, we use the properties of isolated node and network topology to significantly reduce the computational complexity of the above SOS programming problem, such that our estimate can be effectively obtained even for large-scale networks.

  abstract     = {This article investigates the sliding mode fault-tolerant secure control for cyber–physical system facing jamming attacks and multiple physical faults. An intelligent attacker is capable of emitting interference power and adjusting its strategy by observing the transmitter’s sending power, leading to packet dropouts in the controller-to-actuator channel. A Bayesian Stackelberg game is exploited to capture these competitive interactions between the two players, in which the transmitter and the intelligent attacker can only probabilistically obtain information about each other’s channel state and transmission cost. Meanwhile, the transmitter has only statistical knowledge about either the presence or absence of the attacker in the practical environment. First, optimal transmission power strategies for both sides are studied using the backward induction method and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker condition. Second, an integrated observer is designed to simultaneously estimate the system state, actuator fault, and sensor fault. Furthermore, the reaching law is proposed so that the state trajectories can reach the preselect sliding surface during the assigned finite time interval from any initial state. Sufficient criteria are derived to guarantee stochastic finite-time boundedness during reaching and sliding motion phases of closed-loop systems using a sliding-mode fault-tolerant secure controller. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Metric learning aims to learn a discriminative metric space, where samples of the same class stay close, and those of different classes far apart. Existing classical metric learning methods based on linear transformation have limited learning performance due to the low representation capability. Although deep metric learning learns nonlinear mappings, the training may come across convergence issues and be unstable. Additionally, many classical metric learning algorithms suffer from long computational time for iterative optimization especially when data dimension is high. Deep metric learning also requires high training cost. To learn a metric space more efficiently and effectively, this article proposes a novel broad metric learning (BML) model, which learns the data transformation by training a broad network. BML maps input data to a broad feature space by fast and convenient nonlinear feature mapping based on random weights, and learns a linear transformation to a discriminative output space. Intraclass distance is reduced by minimizing the distance between data and their class-specific reference points in the target space. The hard-triplet distance learning (HDL) is proposed to learn the distance of hard positive and negative sample pairs, which enhances the intraclass compactness and interclass separation. Closed-form solutions are adopted to solve the optimization problems efficiently when learning the linear transformation. Experiments are conducted on nine datasets to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of BML. BML learns fast and achieves high classification and clustering accuracies in the learned data space.},

  abstract     = {The modeling problem of converter-based multibus direct current (DC) microgrids (MGs) and the conflict between voltage regulation and current balancing in such MGs have been a hot topic of interest. Voltage regulation is essential for ensuring the stability and power quality of MGs, while current sharing is a reflection of the MGs’ ability to coordinate power and is critical to extend the lifespan of the generation units. However, due to the presence of line impedance, currents no longer have the freedom of regulation under consistent voltages across the buses. Additionally, existing models have failed to strike a good balance between accuracy and simplicity in describing DC MGs, resulting in rare research on model-based secondary control. With this in mind, this article develops a DC MG error model containing the dynamics of both the circuit and inner control loops via the fully actuated system theory. Further, a distributed optimal control is proposed based on this model. Compared to existing studies, the suggested error model captures the power characteristics of MGs while possesses a simple structure. For regulation tasks of voltage recovery and precise current allocation, this article unifies these two into a single integrated regulation error, offering a novel approach to address their conflict. Subsequently, the stability of the closed-loop MG system is given. Furthermore, this article includes a consensus analysis of current sharing and a tracking analysis of the average voltages. Finally, a laboratory-scale MG prototype equipped with photovoltaics and batteries is developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Sensor data becomes vulnerable to malicious tampering when operating in a low-energy level, whereas the high-energy transmission level enables accurate data transmission. By introducing a set of Bernoulli random variables and ternary random variables, a novel measurement model is proposed to characterize scenarios involving both dual-energy transmission modes and hybrid attacks, including three statuses: safe, deception attacks, and Denial-of-Service attacks. Based on the innovation analysis approach, local secure estimators are designed to ensure that the estimation errors are minimized locally. Then, an optimal secure fusion algorithm is provided to generate the final estimated value by fusing all the local estimates.

  abstract     = {Different sampling rates are common for different variables in industrial processes because of the different electrical properties and requirements of sensors. Especially the sampling rate of quality variables is significantly lower than that of process variables. However, most soft sensors assume that industrial data is uniformly sampled, which differs significantly from actual industrial systems and may affect decision-making in the production process. An interpretable disentangled transfer learning (IDTL) quality prediction is proposed suitable for multirate industrial processes. First, a setness constructor is designed to diversify the original multirate data into multiple multirate sets to preserve information without data loss. Then, a disentangled transfer learning (TL) approach is proposed to infer domain-invariant and domain-specific representations from multiple multirate sets, thereby revealing the intrinsic properties of multirate industrial processes and improving the soft sensor performance. From the perspective of information theory, the theoretical representations for disentanglement and their connection to TL are established, laying a solid theoretical foundation for subsequent TL under complex working conditions. Our theoretical analysis shows that interpretable disentangled TL (IDTL) achieves optimal disentangled representations in equilibrium. Case studies of the debutanizer column dataset and the actual polyester esterification dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed IDTL.

Specifically, we consider the setting where the initial position and velocity of each legitimate agent are both private, an internal or external adversary wants to identify them based on the information it obtains. To deal with this scenario, we propose a privacy preservation algorithm based on a position and velocity simultaneous perturbation technique. To be specific, our algorithm consists of a collaborative scrambling phase and a convergence phase. In the scrambling phase, each agent is required to produce two sets of edge-based perturbation signals that are, respectively, imposed on the local position and velocity signals before transmission, with the purpose of preserving privacy; in the convergence phase, each agent updates its state per a normal rule, aiming to achieving accurate consensus. Also, we establish a system-theoretic framework to analyze privacy performance by examining the indistinguishability of private values’ arbitrary variations to adversaries, and further show that, an internal adversary cannot infer the privacy of a legitimate agent provided it has at least one legitimate in-neighbor or out-neighbor, and the privacy is leaked out once that agent exclusively connects to the internal adversary in bidirectional way. As for external eavesdroppers, they can never infer any agent’s privacy if the gain parameters in the scrambling phase are not accessible to them.

Using the lemma proposed in the study (Lemma 3) and the normalized function, it is shown that under the performance constraint approach, the selection of the performance function is consistent with the control protocols. By adopting the modified admissible edge-dependent average dwell time method and the optimal controller, the boundedness of closed-loop system signals is proved, and the Zeno phenomenon does not occur.

  abstract     = {The present research addresses the issue of fixed-time (FxT) command filtered adaptive tracking control for a class of nonlinear system subject to time-varying input delay and error/state constraints. First, based on the existing FxT control theory, we present two new FxT stability lemmas, affording less conservative and more exact upper-bound estimates (UBEs) for the settling time. Second, the asymmetric constrained systems are reconstructed into novel systems devoid of constraints by introducing nonlinear transformation functions (NTFs), which remove the feasibility conditions related to the virtual controllers while satisfying the error and state constraints. Then, a novel FxT auxiliary system is established to effectively handle the input delay that is allowed to be unknown. By employing the FxT stability criterion and Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional approach, it is proved that the controlled systems are practically fixed-time stable (PFxTS) and do not violate their error/state constraints. Additionally, without the need for modifying the control framework, the control algorithm capably addresses the control issue uniformly for both constrained and unconstrained systems. In the end, a simulation example is given to check the validity of the main results.},

  abstract     = {HCMOP are widespread in practical engineering such as vehicle routing problem and shop scheduling problem etc. The problems introduced above refer to optimization problems with complex constraints which lead to small and disconnected feasible regions. The optimization performance of general evolutionary algorithms decreases due to the small and dispersed feasible regions in highly constrained optimization problems. To address this problem, a multiobjective ant colony optimization algorithm based on dynamic constraint evaluation strategy (MOACO-DCE) is proposed in this article. First, a dynamic constraint violation metric is proposed to evaluate the constraint violation degree of solutions. The population is classified into the subpopulation with evolutionary advantages and the subpopulation with high constraint violation degree by this metric. Second, an evolutionary strategy based on dynamic transfer probabilities is proposed for the subpopulation with evolutionary advantages in order to improve the evolutionary efficiency. A Gaussian variation evolutionary strategy is proposed for the subpopulation with high constraint violation degree in order to improve the population diversity. Third, a pheromone collaborative updating strategy is proposed to achieve the synergistic pheromone updating between two subpopulations. A pheromone updating strategy considering the constraint violation metric is designed to improve the utilization of constraint violation information in the whole population. In addition, compared with other constrained multiobjective optimization algorithms, MOACO-DCE can obtain more satisfactory performance for the highly constrained optimization.},
