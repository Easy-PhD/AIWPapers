  abstract     = {This article presents a novel design of a distributed adaptive observer for distributed state estimation of continuous-time uncertain linear time-invariant systems over directed networks. In contrast to existing works, the observed system is subject to uncertainties and possibly jointly observable. The distributed estimation of such systems allows practical applications in challenging problems subject to sparse arrangement of sensors and model uncertainties. A class of fully distributed nonlinear adaptive observers is proposed to address these challenges. In particular, we introduce an observability decomposition method to decompose both the state and the unknown parameters of the observed system into an observable and an unobservable component. This decomposition circumvents the impact of the unknown parameters on existing observability decomposition methods. Two nonlinear mappings are designed to achieve the reconstruction of the system state and the unknown system parameters. A parametric representation of the output estimation error is established to convert the unknown parameter estimation problem of the observable subsystem into an unknown parameter identification problem using a linear regression equation. Using a Lyapunov stability analysis, it is shown that the system parameter can be recovered by the nonlinear mappings, while the distributed state estimation problem is solved.},

This method employs the recent adaptive control approach with batch least-squares identification (BaLSI, pronounced “ballsy”) that completes perfect parameter identification in finite time and offers a previously unforeseen advantage in safe control design with aCBF, which we elucidate in this article. Since the true challenge is exhibited for CBF of a high relative degree, we undertake a control design in this article for a class of systems that possess a particularly extreme relative degree: $2\times 2$ hyperbolic PDEs sandwiched by a strict-feedback nonlinear ODE and a linear ODE, where the unknown coefficients are associated with the PDE in-domain coupling terms and with the input signal of the distal ODE. The designed output-positive adaptive controller guarantees the positivity of the output signal that is the furthermost state from the control input as well as the exponential regulation of the overall plant state to zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulation.},

This note investigates online trajectory generation and control for this system, focusing on the asymptotic stabilization of both the actuated UAV's positions and the unactuated payload's swings. First, we introduce a virtual nonholonomic constraint (VNHC)-based approach to generate smooth UAV trajectories. This approach simplifies the design by operating on a lower dimensional system, thereby bypassing the complexities of the original high-dimensional underactuated system. Second, a continuous fixed-time tracking controller is designed to drive the system dynamics onto the VNHC and to ensure its invariance. The rigorous asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using Lyapunov techniques and Barbalat's lemma. Numerical and experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.},

This significantly weakens the classic assumptions used in the literature. To design an optimal adaptive control, a weighted least squares algorithm is modified by using random regularization method, which can ensure uniform stabilizability and uniform detectability of the family of estimated models. At the same time, a diminishing excitation is incorporated into the design of the proposed adaptive control to guarantee strong consistency of the desired components of the estimates. Finally, although some components of the estimates may not converge to the true values, it is still demonstrated that a certainty equivalence control with diminishing excitation remains optimal for an ergodic quadratic cost function.},

This article investigates the delayed pinning control scheme for lag synchronization and lag quasi-synchronization of dynamical networks. Two pinning control schemes with uniform delay and nonuniform delays are proposed, which are more practical than the widely used delay-free pinning control scheme. For the two pinning control schemes, criteria for lag synchronization and lag quasi-synchronization of dynamical networks are derived by proposing a system of functional differential inequalities, and in the meantime, an upper bound of tolerable delays that allows synchronization is given. In particular, the ultimate bound of the synchronization error is estimated for lag quasi-synchronization. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated by two numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a nonlinear adaptive proportional-integral-derivative (PID) tracking control methodology suitable for a class of multi-in-multi-out nonlinear systems. By incorporating three nonlinear modulating (trimming) functions to “recalibrate” the generalized tracking error, a nonlinear PID control framework is constructed that possesses several notable features. First, the user-assignable parameters in the modulating functions allow the resultant control strategy to analytically bridge fixed gain linear PID control with nonlinear PID control, covering both traditional fixed-gain and time-varying gain PID control as special cases. Second, the inherently nonlinear nature of the proposed control methodology effectively counteracts system nonlinearities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the control scheme. Third, unlike conventional PID control that often involves integration saturation, the proposed control method obliterates such “windup” phenomenon by utilizing the integral trimming function that remains bounded or self-vanishes. Fourth, eliminating the necessity for a “trial-and-error” process for PID gain determination, the proposed control not only ensures asymptotic tracking but also guarantees a bounded comprehensive performance index in the presence of modeling uncertainties and external disturbances. The effectiveness and benefits of the proposed method are also confirmed by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {Passivity-based approaches have been suggested as a solution to the problem of decentralized control design in many multiagent network control problems as stability can often be determined independently of the network topology. However, it is not clear if these controllers are optimal at a network level due to their inherently local formulation, with designers often relying on heuristics to achieve desired global performance. On the other hand, solving for an optimal controller is not guaranteed to produce a decentralized optimal policy that leads to a passive network with a plug-and-play operation. In this article, we address these dual problems by showing that when appropriate decentralized conditions are satisfied, passive network systems have an inverse optimal control interpretation, i.e., the corresponding decentralized controllers are solutions to a network-wide optimal control problem. These conditions are then formulated into a set of linear matrix inequalities for the case of linear systems, which can be used for control synthesis for such systems. The proposed approach is demonstrated through case studies from distributed optimization and the control of dc microgrids.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes an online cross-layered defense strategy for multichannel systems with switched dynamics under DoS attacks. The enabling condition of a channel under attacks is formulated with respect to attack flow and channel bandwidth, then a new networked control system model bridging the gap between system dynamics and network deployment is built. Based on this, the cross-layered defense strategy is proposed. It jointly optimizes the controller gain and bandwidth allocation of channels according to the real-time attack flow and system dynamics, by solving a mixed-integer semidefinite programming online. A smart enumeration algorithm for nonconvex bilevel optimization is proposed to analyze the stability under the strategy. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the high resilience from the cross-layered feature.},

In particular, we assume that the controlled plant admits a global asymptotic stable equilibrium corresponding to each fixed reference input and consider a modified gradient-flow optimizer augmented with a nonlinear perturbation function. With the output map of the controlled plant satisfying a linear growth condition, this article proves the existence of a perturbation function such that the resulting feedback optimization system is globally asymptotically stable at the desired equilibrium. The proof is based on the seamless integration of tools from the singular perturbation theory, input-to-state stability, and the nonlinear small-gain theorem. The possibility of extending the proposed approach to other optimizers is also discussed. Three numerical examples are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

A new representation of saturation map is presented by equality with bounded uncertain diagonal matrix and reduces conservatism. Further, based on spherical polar coordinate quantizer, the quantization error is converted to sector-bound uncertainty. Thus, the considered system is modeled as uncertain system and the considered problems are converted into the equivalent solvable problems for uncertain system and the larger stability region is obtained. We first propose the quantization methods with finite data rate for asymptotic stability under the system input saturation for two cases: first state quantization case and second input quantization case. In input quantization case, an augmented vector is constructed and quantized to obtain the estimate of the system input. We further propose the quantization method for the case of quantizations and saturations of the system input and state, which results in nested saturation and nested quantization. In this case, although the quantizer for the sensor output and the quantizer for the controller output can not communicate with each other, by the proposed quantization method, they coordinate with each other to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the systems.},

  abstract     = {Social pressure is a key factor affecting the evolution of opinions on networks in many types of settings, pushing people to conform to their neighbors’ opinions. To study this, the interacting Pólya urn model was introduced by Jadbabaie et al., 2023, in which each agent has two kinds of opinion: inherent beliefs, which are hidden from the other agents and fixed; and declared opinions, which are randomly sampled at each step from a distribution which depends on the agent’s inherent belief and her neighbors’ past declared opinions (the social pressure component), and which is then communicated to her neighbors. Each agent also has a bias parameter denoting her level of resistance to social pressure. At every step, each agent updates her declared opinion (simultaneously with all other agents) according to her neighbors’ aggregate past declared opinions, her inherent belief, and her bias parameter. We study the asymptotic behavior of this opinion dynamics model and show that the agents’ declaration probabilities approach a set of equilibrium points of the expected dynamics using Lyapunov theory and stochastic approximation techniques. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the agents to approach consensus on their declared opinions. Our work provides further insight into the difficulty of inferring the inherent beliefs of agents when they are under social pressure.},

We develop a general framework for reconstructing errors by processing nonlinear measurements obtained across the sensor network, based on the assumptions that the errors are sparse (i.e., only a fraction of the agents have errors) and that the sensor network is sparsely connected. It is shown that this twofold sparsity of the EIC problem can be leveraged using a combination of block-sparse optimization and the alternating direction method of multipliers, yielding a novel distributed EIC algorithm which can be interpreted as a multiagent residual testing mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed distributed EIC approach is demonstrated by considering a numerical example of sensor network localization, in which the distances between connected agents are used to uniquely identify and correct the agents with erroneous position estimates without relying on anchors (i.e., agents that are assumed to be error-free).},

The technique consists of using data sampled from the concrete system to find a lower dimensional subspace of its state space (which we call the active subspace), and constructing an abstraction candidate using Gaussian process (GP) regression. We derive sufficient conditions under which the GP candidate is shown to be the abstraction of the original system while quantifying the error bound between the output of the abstraction and that of the concrete system.

The time series generated by a subset of the nodes in this new larger network are equivalent to the time series generated by the original network. In this new larger network, based on the notion of $d$-separation, we formulate sufficient graphical conditions to select a set of predictor inputs.

However, such leader-following behavior would be impossible with existing adaptive consensus methods, e.g., based on model reference adaptive control, since the stability of the reference dynamics is required. To fill this gap, we propose a novel model reference adaptive stabilizing control framework for leader-following consensus of multiagent systems with unknown and heterogeneous dynamics. Differently from several approaches in the leader-following consensus literature, the proposed framework is free of any extra distributed observer layer for the leader's signal, as the reconstruction of such signals is intrinsic in the adaptive laws. Besides, the framework does not require Hurwitz or neutral stability of the leader and generalizes existing acyclic requirements on the communication graph among the follower. Starting from any weakly connected communication digraph, the proposed method allows us to derive a lower bound, useful from the network design point of view, for the minimum number of followers that should be pinned by the leader.},

Assuming the global cost function satisfies the Polyak–Łojasiewicz condition, which does not require the global cost function to be convex and the global minimizer is not necessarily unique, we show that our proposed algorithms linearly converge to a global optimal point. Moreover, we show that a low data rate is sufficient to guarantee linear convergence when the algorithm parameters are properly chosen. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {In its standard formulation, the control barrier function (CBF) method scales poorly as the order of the system dynamics increases. On the one hand, the need of recursively extending the control with higher-order terms along the backstepping procedure inevitably results in dynamically increasing complexity. On the other hand, the lack of an explicit form of the CBF leads to implicit formulations of the safety conditions, to be solved numerically via quadratic programming. These high complexity and poor scalability issues further amplify in multiagent systems. This work proposes a low-complexity framework for safe control of higher order multiagent systems within the philosophy of funnel control. Different from the state-of-the-art, safety is expressed in terms of a CBF that is explicitly constructed from funnel functions, thus providing a solution to the well-known problem of lack of systematic methods for constructing a CBF. Low complexity comes from the fact that the control does not involve complex dynamical extensions during the backstepping procedure. Notably, the proposed CBF is shown to automatically satisfy by design the safety conditions, without resorting to any quadratic programming. Lyapunov analysis shows that the design allows to consider individual terms for stability and safety, so as to accomplish these tasks in a seamless integrated fashion. Simulation studies and comparisons with the state-of-the-art further demonstrate the method.},

To that end, we model the market clearing process as a dynamical system, called market dynamics, which is temporally coupled with the grid frequency dynamics and is thus required to guarantee system-wide stability while meeting operational constraints. We characterize participants as price-takers who rationally update their bids to maximize their utility in response to real-time schedules of prices and dispatch. For two common bidding mechanisms, based on quantity and price, we identify a notion of alignment between participants’ behavior and a grid planner’s goals, leading to a saddle-based design of market dynamics that guarantees convergence to an operating point achieving economic efficiency and incentive compatibility subject to all operational constraints. We further explore cases where this alignment property does not hold and observe that misaligned participants’ bidding can destabilize the closed-loop system. We thus design a regularized version of market dynamics that recovers all the desirable stability and steady-state performance guarantees. Numerical tests validate our results on the IEEE 39-bus system.},

In the literature, this problem has been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose applicability is limited by the need of accurate a priori information on the game and a lack of robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome these limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain control scheme within a replicator equation—a nonlinear ordinary differential equation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the population. For most classes of 2-action matrix games, we establish sufficient conditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator equation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a priori information on the game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical findings.},

This relationship, however, remains underinvestigated in the existing studies. To address this gap, the formation control problem of classical second-order multiagent systems with bounded process noises was considered taking into account the channel capacity. More specifically, the model of communication links between agents is first established, based on a new concept—guaranteed communication region, which characterizes all possible locations for successful message decoding in the presence of control-system uncertainty. Furthermore, we rigorously prove that the guaranteed communication region does not unboundedly increase with the transmission time, which indicates an important tradeoff between the guaranteed communication region and the data rate. The fundamental limits of data rate for any desired accuracy are also obtained. Finally, an integrated design to achieve the desired formation accuracy is proposed, where an estimation-based controller and transmit power control strategy are developed.},

The proposed algorithms are based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). ADMM is a powerful tool for solving a wide class of constrained optimization problems. There are two main challenges when applying ADMM: Its performance depends greatly on the efficiency of solving the suboptimization problems associated with the ADMM at each iteration; it is not trivial to find the correct penalty parameters. For the first challenge, we provide a way to reformulate the original QCQP problem into a form such that there exist analytical solutions for the suboptimization problems. Hence, the computational cost per iteration is low. For the second challenge, we provide two procedures to compute systematically the penalty parameters. In the first procedure, a closed-form expression for the optimal constant scalar parameter is derived in terms of the matrix condition number. In the second one, the penalty parameters are adaptively tuned to achieve fast convergence. The results are validated via numerical simulations.},

We derive the difference expressions among these quantities and establish the corresponding one-step relations. These relations reveal how performance deteriorates when noise covariances are misspecified, and demonstrate how to evaluate the estimation error covariance using the available nominal filter parameter. We particularly highlight the effect of the information fusion step number on these relations. Furthermore, recursive relations are introduced by extending the results of the one-step relations. Subsequently, we demonstrate the convergence of these quantities under the collective observability condition and show that the convergence condition of the nominal filter parameter can guarantee the convergence of the estimation error covariance. In addition, we provide bounds on the estimation error covariance under misspecified noise covariances by utilizing the Frobenius norms of the noise covariance deviations and the trace of the nominal filter parameter. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified through numerical simulations.},

Specifically, a system is observed by a set of (local) observation sites (OSs) which occasionally send their recorded sequences of observations to the coordinator that is in charge of estimating the system state. The malfunctions and attacks, referred to as errors in this article, include symbol deletions, insertions and replacements, each of which bears a positive cost. Two types of errors, global errors and local errors, are proposed to describe the impact of errors on decentralized information processing. Global errors occur when all OSs record the same error, while local errors occur when different OSs record different errors. Distinguishing these types of errors is important for a proper design of decentralized information processing (so as to be more resilient and better equipped to handle attacks and failures). For each type of error, we propose two methods to efficiently perform state estimation: one based on appropriately modifying the original system and the other based on inferring the matching behavior of the original system. For each method, we adopt an estimation-by-release methodology to design an algorithm for constructing a corresponding synchronizer for state estimation.},

If all of the parameters of a model can be recovered from data, then the model is said to be identifiable. However, in many models, there are parameters that can take on an infinite number of values but yield the same input–output data. In this case, those parameters and the model are called unidentifiable. The question is then what to do with an unidentifiable model. One can try to add more input–output data or decrease the number of unknown parameters, if experimentally feasible, or try to find a reparameterization to make the model identifiable. In this article, we take the latter approach. While existing approaches to find identifiable reparameterizations were limited to scaling reparameterizations or were not guaranteed to find a globally identifiable reparameterization even if it exists, we significantly broaden the class of models for which we can find a globally identifiable model with the same input–output behavior as the original one. We also prove that, for linear models, a globally identifiable reparameterization always exists and shows that, for a certain class of linear compartmental models, with and without inputs, an explicit reparameterization formula exists. We illustrate our method on several examples and provide detailed analysis in the Supplementary Material on github.},

In this article, we propose a lifting approach to map observable data into an infinite-dimensional function space, which generates a flow governed by the proposed Zubov–Koopman operators. By learning a Zubov–Koopman operator over a fixed time interval, we can indirectly approximate the solution to Zubov's equation by iteratively applying the learned operator on certain functions. We also demonstrate that a transformation of such an approximator can be readily utilized as a near-maximal Lyapunov function. We approach our goal through a comprehensive investigation of the regularities of Zubov–Koopman operators and their associated quantities. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for learning Zubov–Koopman operators that exhibit strong convergence to the true operator. We show that this approach reduces the amount of required data and can yield desirable estimation results, as demonstrated through numerical examples.},

The considered systems have sensors and actuators that are susceptible to unknown or adversarial inputs. To solve this problem, we first identify conditions that allow agents to obtain nonlinear bounded-error equations characterizing the input. Then, we propose a distributed interval-valued observer that is guaranteed to contain the disturbance and system states. To do this, we first detail a gain design procedure that uses global problem data to minimize an upper bound on the signal norm of the observer error. We then propose a gain design approach that does not require global information, using only values that are local to each agent. The second method improves on the computational tractability of the first, at the expense of some added conservatism. Further, we discuss some possible ways of extending the results to a broader class of systems. We conclude by demonstrating our observer on two examples. The first is a unicycle system, for which we apply the first gain design method. The second is a 145-bus power system, which showcases the benefits of the second method, due to the first approach being intractable for systems with high dimensional state spaces.},

  abstract     = {This article is devoted to classification of stochastic systems given by stochastic differential equations in continuous time. We develop two novel approaches. The first one is based on the use of a deep neural network (NN), whereas the second one uses hypothesis test-based methods. The idea of deep learning method focuses on treating the given stochastic system models by generating Monte Carlo sample paths. These samples are used to train a deep neutral network. A least square error is used as the loss function for network training. Then, the resulting weights are applied to out of sample Monte Carlo paths for testing. The underlying problem is then converted to a stochastic optimization task. Recursive stochastic algorithms are developed; convergence of the algorithm and rate of convergence are fully analyzed. Such deep NN approach compares favorably to the hypothesis test approaches. Then mean reversion models are studied to show the adaptiveness and power of our deep NN method. An advantage of the deep NN approach is real data can be used directly to train the deep NN. Therefore, model calibration can be bypassed all together.},

We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely.

At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays, conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the Kullback–Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.},

The objective is to develop distributed optimization algorithms for a set of heterogeneous linear agents over a directed communication network, which will drive the decision variables of the agents to the optimal state with optimal system performance. First, a new distributed optimal coordination algorithm is developed, comprising an output regulation tracking controller and a surplus-based optimal policy generator. This is achieved by utilizing the output regulation technique and surplus-based consensus method. Second, a projected distributed optimal coordination algorithm is designed to address the distributed constrained optimal coordination problem, where the decision variables of the agents are constrained by local feasible set constraints and network resource constraints. In comparison to previous distributed optimal coordination studies, the agent dynamics and communication framework have been significantly expanded, and this represents the first investigation of the distributed constrained optimal coordination problem for heterogeneous linear systems over weight-unbalanced directed communication networks. Finally, the practical applications of multiple rotary-wing air vehicle systems and battery energy storage systems are presented, thereby demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed distributed optimal coordination and distributed constrained optimal coordination algorithms in a real-world context.},

The proposed method aims to enhance a given suboptimal controller, leveraging data to achieve a nearly optimal solution for the infinite horizon problem. The method is built on two techniques. First, we estimate the expected values of the convex costs using a computationally tractable approximation, achieved by sampling across the space of disturbances. Second, we implement a data-driven approach to approximate the optimal value function and its corresponding domain through systematic exploration of the system's state space. These estimates are subsequently used to calculate the terminal cost and terminal set within the proposed MPC. We prove recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence in probability to the target set. Furthermore, we prove that the estimated value function converges to the optimal value function in a local region. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is illustrated with detailed numerical simulations and comparisons with a value iteration method and a learning MPC that minimizes a certainty equivalent cost.},

We consider the problem of enforcing privacy and utility with both obfuscation (altering communications to mislead eavesdroppers) and control (restricting system behavior to avoid information leakage). We present a formulation of this problem that models components of the networked system as interconnected reactive processes. Tools from distributed reactive synthesis are then used to automatically design obfuscators and controllers, which coordinate to enforce requirements. In particular, we develop formal specifications capturing privacy using the information flow property of opacity and utility ensuring availability of information or imposing constraints on the closed-loop system. This synthesis approach is applicable to a large class of network architectures, which we demonstrate on three representative problems over a building access control system.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a robust data-driven predictive control (RDPC) framework for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems affected by bounded disturbances and measurement noise. Unlike traditional model-based approaches, the proposed method relies solely on input-state-output (ISO) data without requiring prior system identification. Given that multiple systems can be consistent with the collected data due to disturbances and noise, a set of all possible systems using quadratic matrix inequalities is constructed. The RDPC scheme is then formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes an upper bound on the control objective while ensuring robust constraint satisfaction for all systems in the set. Unlike the existing robust data-driven model predictive control methods based on behavioral system theory, the proposed method does not require the precollected data to satisfy the persistently exciting condition of a sufficiently high order. It only needs the stabilizability of the LTI system to be controlled. The proposed approach is further extended for systems where the state is unmeasurable. By reformulating the problem using an autoregressive exogenous model, a dynamic output feedback controller that leverages input–output data directly is designed. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through a case study on an unstable batch reactor, demonstrating comparable performance to model-based robust MPC and data-driven MPC approaches while reducing conservatism and computational complexity.},

Taking advantage of the symmetry in the game structure, the identifiability of the underlying game model is established and the well-posedness of the inverse game problem is guaranteed. The identification problem is solved by a least squares program that admits a unique global minimum at the true value of the unknown parameter. To address the mixed-integer constraints, an efficient subdifferential algorithm is designed by incorporating the linear sum assignment substructures. In addition, robust estimators are further designed in the stochastic setup, whose statistical consistency can be guaranteed in the presence of noisy observations.

We conclude with a simulation study on representative real-world networks and present insights. When all the nodes' opinions are observable, we show that our learning algorithm deduces the exact optimal strategy in very few intervals.

Moreover, the performance analysis of the modified algorithms is also provided under rather mild conditions, including the steady-state value of the estimation error covariance.

  abstract     = {A novel robust nonlinear model predictive control strategy is proposed for systems with nonlinear dynamics and convex state and control constraints. Using a sequential convex approximation approach and a difference of convex functions representation, the scheme constructs tubes that contain predicted model trajectories, accounting for approximation errors and disturbances, and guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. An optimal control problem is solved as a sequence of convex programs. We develop the scheme initially in the absence of external disturbances and show that the proposed nominal approach is nonconservative, with the solutions of successive convex programs converging to a locally optimal solution for the original optimal control problem. We extend the approach to the case of additive disturbances using a novel strategy for selecting linearization points. As a result, we formulate a robust receding horizon strategy with guarantees of recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the design of distributed observers for a class of nonlinear systems. The designed distributed observers reside in a network of sensor nodes. The communication links in the network enable each sensor node to estimate all states of the nonlinear system, even though each one can only collect a small portion of the system's outputs. However, all inputs of the system are still needed at each node to carry out a correct state estimation. For this problem, the article further proposes a distributed nonlinear observer without using global inputs, in which each sensor node only needs partial input information of the nonlinear system.},

  abstract     = {This article is concerned with game-based distributed least-distance formation tracking with a moving target. More specifically, the agents aim to form a desired shape while enclosing a moving target with a least overall distance. Different from most of the existing results on formation tracking, the key challenge for least-distance formation tracking under consideration is that the distances between the agents and the target are not required to be predefined but are autonomously adjusted by solving a distance optimization problem. In particular, with the target being moving, the distance optimization problem is time-varying. To address this issue, a game-based formulation of distributed least-distance formation tracking is first presented, where first- and second-order integrator-type agents are taken into account, respectively. Then, under the scenario in which all the agents know the position of the moving target, a new distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy that can be utilized to achieve distributed least-distance formation is constructed based on gradient search algorithms, regularization techniques and consensus protocols. Moreover, when it is further considered that only a subset of the agents can access the information of the moving target, a leader-following tracking protocol is introduced to estimate unknown information distributively. It is theoretically shown that the proposed strategies can globally steer the agents to form a desired shape while minimizing the overall distance to the moving target. Finally, the effectiveness of the established strategies is verified by, respectively, conducting simulation studies for a network of vehicles and quadrotors.},

  abstract     = {Safety guarantees are vital in many control applications, such as robotics. Model predictive control (MPC) provides a constructive framework for controlling safety-critical systems but is limited by its computational complexity. We address this problem by presenting a novel algorithm that automatically computes an explicit approximation to nonlinear MPC schemes while retaining closed-loop guarantees. Specifically, the problem can be reduced to a function approximation problem, which we tackle by proposing the Adaptive and Localized Kernel Interpolation Algorithm with eXtrapolated reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm, which we refer to as Alkia-x. Alkia-x is a noniterative algorithm that ensures well-conditioned computations, a fast-to-evaluate approximating function, and the guaranteed satisfaction of any desired bound on the approximation error. Hence, Alkia-x automatically computes an explicit function that approximates the MPC, yielding a controller suitable for safety-critical systems and high sampling rates. We apply Alkia-x to approximate two nonlinear MPC schemes, demonstrating reduced computational demand and applicability to realistic problems.},

  abstract     = {Neural network related machine learning algorithms, inspired by biological neuron interaction mechanisms, are advancing rapidly in the field of computing. This development may be leveraged in reverse to advance synthetic biology progress. A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties specifically in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. By addressing these difficulties, this paired article manages to develop a biochemical fully connected neural network (BFCNN) that has the potential to behave like a neural network independently in vivo. In Part I, BFCNN is designed according to five different modules with concrete theoretical support on the stability of every module. In this article, we establish a systematic framework for error analysis of the designed BFCNN. We introduce current error evaluating error generation within an individual computational module by measuring the deviation between finite-time concentration and steady-state concentration, and the accumulative error characterizing error propagation across different modules connected via oscillatory signals and within the repeated modules due to multiple iterations. We further derive the formula for the total error upper bound about the iteration number and illustrate its exponential convergence order about nonzero duration time of an oscillatory signal concentration. Ultimately, the numerical experiments on two classification examples are made to exhibit the change tendency of total error bounds about the nonzero duration time and iteration number.},

A challenging exploration is to implement neural network functionalities through biochemical reaction networks (BCRNs), a language that is inherently compatible with in vivo, with difficulties especially in constructing an appropriate BCRN that respects computation and information processing steps involved in neural networks. These two-part articles finish programming a nonlinear fully connected neural network (FCNN) with a three-layer structure using BCRNs endowed with mass action kinetics. In part I, we divide the FCNN into assignment, feedforward propagation, judgment, learning, and clear-out modules. Each module is programmed using BCRNs by setting species concentrations to carry information related to all kinds of computations and operations, with the equilibria of some species to represent the computation results and information processing results. The newly formed biochemical neural network exhibits the potential to work independently in vivo. In addition, our construction addresses a critical design gap by integrating two essential modules: the biochemical assignment module that enables iterative input of training samples, and the biochemical judgment module responsible for determining the termination of the training process. We further confirm theoretically that the BCRN system achieves FCNN functionality with exponential convergence to all target computational results. Finally, the performance of this construction is evaluated numerically on binary classification problems.},
