The main goal is on overloading multiple transmission lines while maintaining a high level of stealth. The proposed model employs cluster-based approach to form distinct clusters, each representing different load patterns within the power system. This enables the design of attack vectors that seamlessly blend with these load patterns, thereby challenging advanced anomaly detection systems. The stealth of the attack is quantified by the Stealth Distance Index (SDI), ensuring that injected false data remain within the maximum permissible distance from the centroid of its corresponding cluster. The proposed model is validated on the modified IEEE 14-bus and 30-bus systems, demonstrating enhanced stealth capabilities in LR attacks.},

  abstract     = {The multirobot coverage search problem in unknown environments has attracted significant attention. However, the existing methods are inefficient in the search process. The aim of the present study is to improve the search efficiency through an enhanced bioinspired neural network method. In this work, a connected Glasius bioinspired neural network (CGBNN) model is introduced to address the lack of consideration for neuronal connectivity and transmission properties in existing studies. The dynamic search environment is represented by the changes in neurons' activity values, which guide the robots in performing the search task. Each robot automatically plans its search path according to the principle of the decreasing gradient of CGBNN activity values until the task is completed. Experimental results demonstrate that the robots can avoid different types of obstacles to complete the coverage search, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, it indicates that the proposed method outperforms others, the coverage rate is improved by 6.90%, 6.22%, and 4.02% compared to the GBNN, A-RPSO, and DMPC algorithms, respectively. In adition, the decision time is less affected by the complexity of the environment, which fulfills the practical demands of real-time decision-making in a large-scale complex environment.},

  abstract     = {The current Internet struggles to meet the deterministic transmission requirements in terms of end-to-end delay. Time-sensitive networking (TSN) provides a solution by offering deterministic forwarding services for critical flows, ensuring strict latency requirements. However, the costs and complexity of hardware associated with TSN increases the barriers for researchers to build prototype for validating newly proposed queue scheduling algorithms. To address this dilemma, software-based simulation platforms are widely used for reduction of simulation expenses. However, these platforms cannot flexibly simulate various queue scheduling algorithms. Although existing programmable packet scheduling methods can adapt to TSN queue scheduling algorithms for common hardware base, they cannot be directly applied to software-based TSN simulation platforms. In response, we propose a novel lightweight software-defined packet scheduling primitive—first-in-pick-out (FIPO), based on the programmable switch behavior-model-version-2 (BMV2). FIPO is capable of expressing customized queue scheduling algorithms to support current TSN algorithms and can be flexibly extended to future algorithms. Particularly, FIPO consists only of multipriority queues and eligible time comparator to implement TSN queue scheduling with minimal computational and management overhead. We also propose a fine-grained logical queue-based flow queue mechanism to enhance FIPO. Finally, a lightweight prototype system for the FIPO is established, incorporating four customized deterministic scheduling algorithms. Extensive experimental results show that FIPO can quickly implement customized queue scheduling algorithms and simulate network conditions that closely resemble real environments. It also demonstrates increased implementation flexibility, achieving millisecond-level configuration times with only a moderate increase in CPU utilization (less than 10%).},

An active disturbance rejection control is utilized to design a disturbance observer for estimating the disturbances in the input channel. To enhance communication efficiency and reduce energy consumption during information interaction between agents, the disturbances estimator is integrated into the consensus controller to suppress these disturbances. The convergence condition and lower bound of DTSs are derived. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Note to Practitioners— The complete system composed of multiple controlled objects in industrial production, transportation, aerospace, and other fields is inevitably influenced by external uncertain signals to varying degrees. The disturbance observer-based control technique effectively addresses the robust consensus problem of MASs. This significantly enhances the stability of most controlled systems operating in complex environments. Simultaneously, the distributed DTSs efficiently reduce communication burden between devices, minimize microprocessor computing power requirements, and save substantial economic costs. Undoubtedly, this offers a novel approach for the development of MASs.},

The proposed novel protocol has the characteristics of traditional FRP time-triggered and event-triggered mechanisms. In addition, such protocol is able to avoid selecting sensors affected by DoS attacks. Subsequently, a set of dynamic output feedback controllers related to the selection of sensor nodes is designed to guarantee the finite-time boundedness of the closed-loop system with the prescribed $H_\infty$ performance. However, the co-design problem of protocol and dynamic control includes more nonlinear terms, making the problem more challenging to be solved. In order to address the co-design problem and enhance system performance, a genetic-algorithm-based controller design approach has been proposed.

When transmitting the local measurement output to the local controller and neighboring agents, a multiple description coding (MDC) scheme is introduced to reduce the communication burden and enhance data transmission reliability in a resource-constrained environment. The MDC scheme encodes each signal into two descriptions, which are then transmitted through separate channels, and decoding schemes are employed to address the different characteristics of the arrival of the two descriptions, ensuring the boundedness of the decoding error. The proposed consensus control scheme uses the relative decoded measurement errors between local agents and their neighbors. The aim is to design an output-feedback control scheme that ensures the error dynamics of the controlled MAS reach exponentially mean-square boundedness. Sufficient conditions are established for the existence of the controllers through stochastic analysis techniques, and the desired controller gains are parameterized using the feasibility of certain matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the proposed coding-decoding-based consensus control scheme is verified through a numerical simulation.},

This article, thus, proposes a deep reinforcement learning based evolutionary architecture path selection method that considers uncertainties and interdependency. The approach employs an architecture framework to guide the design and defines SoS architecture decisions as the addition of systems and the allocation of operational architecture to physical architecture across sequential stages. Capability evaluation leverages a capability-activity-system structure, supported by a functional dependency network analysis method. Utilizing a deep neural network as a functional approximator to predict future SoS capability, the article develops a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that balances immediate and future needs. Applied to a mosaic warfare-oriented naval antisubmarine SoS, the proposed method outperforms heuristic optimization techniques by achieving higher SoS capability, reduced instability, and fewer violations of budget and intermediate requirements constraints in both deterministic and stochastic scenarios. These results highlight the PPO method's effectiveness in addressing SoS architecting path selection challenges under uncertainty.},

This article focuses on the distributed optimization of the WVCP$_{k}$ problem, where individual vertices, acting as rational agents, make decisions independently based on incomplete information. We formulate a Bayesian game model to capture the interactions among agents, who face the uncertainty to the statuses of their $k$-path neighbors and rely on communications to enhance their individual beliefs on the actual cover state. Our analysis delves into the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the ex-post Pareto optimal cover state (POCS) within this framework. In addition, a Bayesian game-based perturbation parallel algorithm (BGPPA) is developed and shown to converge to the ex-post POCS set, even when agents are restricted to using only estimated expected utility. A series of numerical simulations indicate that the BGPPA delivers superior performance with rapid convergence across various networks.},

To characterize the system performance, first, we derive the statistical distribution of cascaded Nakagami-$m$ channels using the Laguerre polynomial series approximation. Second, the approximate closed-form expressions in terms of average block error rate (ABLER), system throughput, goodput, latency, and reliability are derived. Third, the asymptotic analysis is also done at a high signal-to-noise ratio to gain further insights. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify the correctness of the theoretical results. Numerical results validate the superiority of STAR-RIS-SP-NOMA over STAR-RIS-SP-orthogonal multiple access (OMA) (STAR-RIS-SP-OMA) and the conventional cooperative communication scenarios, such as decode and forward relay-assisted half-duplex-SP-OMA and fixed-gain amplify and forward relay-assisted half-duplex-SP-OMA.

In addition, three essential features are investigated to enhance coverage, support massive connections, and ensure low power consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that the cumulative distribution function curves of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio fully comply with industrial standards. Furthermore, the throughput performance explains how NB-IoT networks realize massive connections at the cost of data rate. This work highlights its practical utility and paves the way for developing NB-IoT networks.},

  abstract     = {In this article, a planning algorithm is presented, which is capable to design an overall path in the first stage and determine the formation shape of a cooperative load transportation system forced to move in a spatial hypothetical tunnel (an authorized tunnel), in the second stage. The planning algorithm works in multipassages environment containing obstacles with different shapes and dimensions. The shape of the formation is determined optimally to handle nonconvex constraints like obstacle avoidance, intercollision avoidance between agents and allowable range of cable forces for minimal swing motion. The optimization algorithm also considers the response of the system dynamics and ability of controllers in tracking the optimal path and formation shape. Three types of optimization-based path planning methods are presented called simultaneously all waypoints, waypoint by waypoint (WBW), and waypoints in risk. It is shown that the WBW method presents the best performance in terms of adjustment of the formation shape for passing through narrow passages in complex environment without external or internal collision.},

  abstract     = {Effective boundary scenario generation methods are critical for dynamic target tracking when evaluating the performance of unmanned aerial vehicles. However, traditional methods primarily rely on exhaustive testing or random sampling and often assume that different contributing factors are independent. This results in the ineffective generation of boundary scenarios and a lack of realism. In this study, a novel high-dimensional dynamic characteristics-based boundary test scenario generation method is proposed using reinforcement learning (RL). Boundary test scenarios can be explored more purposive, by designing an appropriate reward function. First, an innovative scenario modeling method is developed to model the influence of environment, occlusion, and other interference. A joint distribution model of the key correlation factors, such as light intensity and clouds, is also established. This ensures scenario authenticity and test accuracy. Subsequently, a high-dimensional dynamic spatial Markov decision process (HDDS-MDP) model is constructed to facilitate the generation of boundary scenarios based on the scenario modeling. Ultimately, RL is employed to solve the HDDS-MDP model and generate boundary test scenario, thereby substantially improves the effectiveness of boundary test scenario generation. The simulation results indicate that the boundary test scenario generation effectiveness is improved by 91% over random sampling methods.},

IT2FC sets are considered for a multiarea interconnected power network, followed by the implementation of a supervisory predictive control method for the entire system. It is demonstrated that the SIT2FPC method effectively addresses the challenges within the overall system. By incorporating a predictive controller as a robust supervisory control technique, the proposed method can effectively handle unexpected problems that may arise within the IT2FC units.

First, a comprehensive simulation platform for the entire AAR docking system is established to generate reliable data. Then, to address the complex nature of AAR docking signals, VMD decomposes the data into modes with distinct natural frequencies, enhancing input accuracy. SSA optimizes the LSTM parameters, improving prediction accuracy and avoiding local minima. Based on these predictions, a docking safety evaluation network is developed to assess docking safety and prevent failures or collisions.

This article introduces a novel profit-oriented attack by some greedy VPP (G-VPP) for the first time, which aims to transfer its risk of economic losses to other normal VPPs (N-VPPs) and obtain a risk-free profit. Particularly, the G-VPP launches the load-altering attack (LAA) on N-VPPs to fail their real-time (RT) generation schedule via modifying the generation instructions of the managed resources. The optimal LAA strategy considering stealthiness is proposed to avoid priori detection and the optimal bidding strategy using CVaR is proposed to quantify bidding risk and maximize profit. To defend against such profit-oriented attacks, this article constitutes the first attack traceability research. A defense scheme with attack detection and attacker identification is proposed, which is executed by VPPs and the independent system operator (ISO). VPPs employ an attack detection algorithm based on complex features, and if any, report it to the ISO. The ISO constructs a knowledge graph of electricity market transactions and embeds a rules-based identification algorithm to identify suspected attackers. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the defense scheme and Neo4j is used to visualize.},

  abstract     = {Radar and communication coexistence (RCC) aims at improving the spectral efficiency of next generation wireless systems. One of the challenges facing RCC, however, is the mutual interference between the two coexisting subsystems. A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can thus be used to address such a challenge by optimizing its phase shifts along with the beamforming weights at the base station (BS). In this article, we aim to maximize the communication sum rate (SR), while limiting the interference toward the radar to a certain limit. Motivated by the unexplored fact that covariance matrices of RCC signals are Hermitian positive definite (HPD) and hence, can be represented over Riemannian manifolds (i.e., curved surfaces), the RCC SR maximization problem is reformulated as minimization of a Riemannian metric, which is the geodesic distance between the covariance matrices of the radar and the RIS-relayed signals. Such geometric reformulation paves the road for a low-complexity optimization approach over Riemannian manifolds, which simultaneously optimizes the beamforming weights and phase shifts at the BS and RIS, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly increases the communication SR, while meeting the constraint on the interference toward radar. Equally important, the proposed optimization approach over Riemannian manifolds exhibits a reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms over Euclidean spaces.},

To tackle the challenges caused by the dynamic topology, the evolution of the dynamic topology of MASs is transformed into time-varying Markov chains. By analyzing the characteristics of time-varying Markov chains, the properties of some key matrices related to the dynamic topology are derived, which benefits the convergence analysis of containment control. By applying the proposed control protocol, the reference signals can be tracked by the leaders, while the followers' states are driven into the convex hull formed by leaders.

With advancements in quantum computing, quantum neural networks (QNNs) are showing unique advantages in information representation and processing. This study is the first to explore quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) for real-time job scheduling in cloud systems. Specifically, we propose a QRL framework that utilizes variational and encoding layers to convert state information into quantum data, repeatedly embedded into a QNN to compute optimal value returns. This approach aims to enhance QoS by improving job execution success rates and reducing average response times with unpredictable job arrivals. We present the detailed design of our approach, and our simulation results demonstrate that the QRL method significantly exceeds established baselines, including those based on DRL, across a range of workload intensities and computational resource configurations. This is particularly evident under high-load conditions, where our approach can achieve 55.2% higher success rates, underscoring its significant potential in cloud job scheduling optimization.},

The basis of this scheme is to minimize the maximum transmit power of antennas for each radar while adhering to the constraint of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for the targets. By transforming the formulated optimization problem into a convex problem, the Lagrangian duality theory is utilized to decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. Then, a subgradient projection method and an equivalent receive beamforming optimization method are developed to tackle the two sub-problems, yielding the optimal transmit beamformers for the radars. After obtaining the transmit and receive beamformers iteratively, the game relationship among radars is then formulated as a power control game, and the paper proves the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium. Furthermore, a centralized beamforming design problem is explored for comparative analysis, where the beamformers of all radars are jointly optimized to suppress power fluctuations among transmit antennas.

Subsequently, we have developed adaptive fuzzy distributed control protocols for each follower agent. The proposed consensus protocols have been demonstrated to ensure semiglobally uniformly ultimate boundedness for all system signals. Furthermore, we extend the control gain from constant to a state-dependent gain, delving into the globally uniformly ultimate boundedness of multiagent systems. To mitigate the intricacies arising from virtual control differentiation, command filtering is integrated with backstepping techniques, thereby streamlining the control process and enhancing overall system performance.

In reality, due to the poor infrastructure conditions on the battlefield, the communication services of the combat units are usually provided by the communication units with limited communication resources. Thus, figuring out an efficient method to share the scarce communication resources among massive combat units becomes crucial. However, it is challenging to efficiently construct the connection relationship and allocate communication resources to the operational units because of the differences in communication requirements and the randomness of location movement of combat units, i.e., unable to obtain battlefield environmental information in advance. In this article, we propose an online learning (OL)-based combat communication architecture construction method, which can estimate the current state of the battlefield environment by interacting with it and dynamically construct connection relationships and allocating communication resources according to the needs and locations of operational units, so as to maximize the QoE. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed OL-based approach is capable of constructing the combat communication architecture in a flexible and efficient manner, surpassing existing methods in terms of efficiency and fairness by significantly enhancing the total QoE up to twice as much compared to baseline methods.},

Compared with the existing method, updating weights using RBFNN estimation is avoided. By utilizing the obtained fault estimation, a distributed model-free adaptive fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy is developed to achieve bipartite consensus. Unlike other bipartite consensus control techniques, the constructed FTC mechanism does not require accurate system model and structure information, and uses solely the agents' input/output data. Finally, a simulation is performed to verify the proposed mechanism's efficacy.},

  abstract     = {Developing and fielding complex systems requires proof that they are reliably correct with respect to their design and operating requirements. Especially for autonomous systems, which exhibit unanticipated emergent behavior, fully enumerating the range of possible correct and incorrect behaviors is intractable. Therefore, we propose an optimization-based search technique for generating high-quality, high-variance, and nontrivial data, which captures the range of correct and incorrect responses a system could exhibit. This manifold between desired and undesired behavior provides a more detailed understanding of system reliability than traditional testing or Monte Carlo simulations. After discovering data points along the manifold, we apply machine learning techniques to quantify the decision manifold's underlying mathematical function. Such models serve as correctness properties, which can be utilized to enable both verification during development and testing, as well as continuous assurance during operation, even amidst system adaptations and dynamic operating environments. This method can be applied in combination with a simulator in order to provide evidence of dependability to system designers and users, with the ultimate aim of establishing trust in the deployment of complex systems. In this proof-of-concept, we apply our method to a software-in-the-loop evaluation of an autonomous vehicle.},

  abstract     = {The distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems facilitate real-time services through the composition of loosely coupled microservices. The composed IoT service is the output of multiple microservices, executed at computationally capable edge or fog nodes, which we consider as the facility nodes (FNs). However, the service composition process in IoT microservice architectures is abstracted from the users that gives freedom to the FNs to act maliciously and provide low-quality IoT services. Further, the service composition needs to be transparent so that the FNs involved in a service cannot repudiate their involvement at a later time. In this article, we propose a novel, lightweight, trustworthy, and verifiable service composition framework for IoT-based systems that adopt microservice architecture. First, we propose a dynamic programming approach to select trustworthy FNs for each user request, while considering the trust scores of the FNs and the delay requirements of the users. Next, we propose a transparent service composition framework that uses lightweight cryptography functions to generate the proof-of-involvement for the FNs in each service. With the help of a trust controller, we verify the proofs generated by the FNs and update the trust scores of the FNs. Considering the user traces from Berlin city in the simulation of urban mobility tool, we show the efficacy of the proposed framework in maximizing user trust and detecting malicious FNs involved in user services. Further, we show that the delay and communication overhead of the proposed framework are very low compared to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract     = {Distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems (DHMASs) link geographically dispersed agents through networks, harnessing information technology to foster collaboration. Considering the mainstream status of wireless communication in modern multiagent systems and the differences in the performance of interagent communication devices, we believe that it is appropriate to use directed heterogeneous networks (DHNs) to model distributed heterogeneous multiagent systems. This model not only reflects the directionality of interagent communication but also reflects the complexity of communication due to performance differences, thus providing a more accurate framework for understanding and optimizing system behavior. The study of disintegration in DHNs is vital for enhancing the decision-making agility of DHMAS. We introduce Directed heterogeneous network Attack sequence inference through graph attention MAtrix Generation Embedding and reinforcement learning (DAMAGE), an algorithm that integrates graph neural networks and reinforcement learning within an inductive reasoning framework. DAMAGE is designed to optimize the generation of disintegration strategies, improving the efficiency of network breakdown processes. Our approach includes a directed network embedding technique with a graph attention matrix generation module, which enhances the utilization of imperfect network structure information. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that DAMAGE not only increases the effectiveness of network disintegration under perfect topological conditions but also maintains robustness in scenario with imperfect topological information.},

In particular, the physical-layer security of an ARIS-NOMA system is investigated when the system is subject to eavesdropping by a malicious user in a user pair group. To provide real-world impact, we examine the main system performance metrics, including the connection outage probability, the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the strictly positive secrecy capacity, which are important guidelines in evaluating the system's reliability, security, and achievable secrecy rates. We evaluate the impact of distances between the ARIS, the eavesdropper, and the base station on the SOP. We derive the optimal power allocation factors in the NOMA scheme, which provides insights into the system design and parameter adjustment to achieve robust and secure operation. In comparison to a benchmark model using the orthogonal multiple access, we show ARIS-NOMA is a promising solution to further enhance security and secrecy in IoT networks.},

  abstract     = {Forecasting and categorizing cellular traffic flows and their types are essential functions in intelligent network systems to ensure efficient network optimization. The ever-evolving nature of 5G networks results in fluctuations in traffic patterns over time, leading to a phenomenon known as model drift. Consequently, accurately predicting and identifying cellular traffic patterns becomes a complex task. To tackle this challenge, this article introduces an innovative approach called TL-ConvLSTM, which combines transfer learning with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) to effectively combat model drift and provide precise forecasting and recognition of cellular traffic within the network. To accomplish this, we initiate the training of TL-ConvLSTM by estimating its parameters from the source domain. We then employ the Kolmogorov–Smirnov method to adapt the model within the target domain, fine tuning its weights. To improve the precision of this model adaptation, we systematically explore optimal learning windows. This exploration includes adjusting window size for time-series data and feature dimensions to capture dynamic traffic patterns in a 5G environment. Furthermore, we make use of the Amarisoft 5G testbed in our lab to create a 12-day time-series dataset. This dataset includes various features related to traffic flows and their patterns. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach through a set of experiments.},
