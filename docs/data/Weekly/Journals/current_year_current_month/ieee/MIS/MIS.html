  abstract     = {Foundation models (FMs), trained on diverse web-scale datasets, have demonstrated remarkable performance on a broad range of tasks. Despite their strong capabilities, the rapid expansion in scale and complexity of FMs introduces significant challenges that could compromise their reliability upon deployment. Key concerns can include the potential leakage of private data, exacerbation of existing bias, generation of incorrect or even harmful responses, and the risk of malicious use, among other emerging issues. This article discusses the public perception of critical ethical issues surrounding the privacy, safety, and security of FMs and their major challenges and opportunities.},

  abstract     = {Modern learning models, while powerful, often exhibit a complexity level that renders them opaque black boxes, lacking transparency and hindering our understanding of their decision-making processes. Opacity challenges the practical application of machine learning, especially in critical domains requiring informed decisions. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses that challenge, unraveling the complexity of black boxes by providing explanations. Feature attribution/importance XAI stands out for its ability to delineate the significance of input features in predictions. However, most attribution methods have limitations, such as instability, when divergent explanations result from similar or the same instance. This work introduces T-Explainer, a novel additive attribution explainer based on the Taylor expansion that offers desirable properties, such as local accuracy and consistency. We demonstrate T-Explainer’s effectiveness and stability over multiple runs in quantitative benchmark experiments against well-known attribution methods. Additionally, we provide several tools to evaluate and visualize explanations, turning T-Explainer into a comprehensive XAI framework.},

  abstract     = {Semantic maps provide information on road elements, which is crucial for ensuring driving safety. However, previous methods mostly focus on normal weather conditions, neglecting the challenges of scene feature extraction caused by image degradation in complex weather scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a normal weather scene-guided complex weather scene map construction network (NCMC-Net). First, we propose a scene feature sharing module based on the complement learning mechanism. This module alternately updates the shared feature pool with features from normal and complex weather scenes during two training stages. Second, we design a feature refinement module based on the channel attention mechanism to adjust the intensity of multichannel features selectively. The two modules facilitate the extraction of optimal complex weather scene features guided by features from normal weather scenes. Experimental results on the complex weather scene dataset nuScenes-W validate our model’s performance.},

Ensuring secure communication channels for UASs is crucial to protecting sensitive information and maintaining operational integrity. Eavesdropping attacks pose a significant threat to data confidentiality and system security in these applications. To address these challenges, we propose an environment in Python that emulates eavesdropping attacks on UASs. Subsequently, we introduce UASDefMeta, a meta-learning-based approach that combines model-agnostic meta-learning and proximal policy optimization for detecting these attacks. Experiments validate UASDefMeta’s effectiveness, demonstrating its adaptability and improved performance over other selected models.},

  abstract     = {Despite substantial progress in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a systematic characterization of DRL agents’ robustness to unexpected events in the environment is relatively understudied. Such unexpected events (“novelties”), especially those that are more structural than parametric, may significantly deteriorate the performance of DRL agents, leading them to be unfit for open-world environments and applications. However, not all novelties affect an agent’s performance equally. Unfortunately, even with reasonable and constrained definitions of the problem, the space of all novelties can be (at least) exponential. Hence, an effective search strategy is required to find novelties that can adversely affect the agent. This article presents a formalism for this problem and proposes a deep Q-learning-based novelty search strategy that efficiently and systematically finds candidate (potentially complex) novelties with significant negative impact on a DRL agent. We conduct a detailed set of experiments in a stochastic multiagent game environment (Monopoly) with complex decision-making properties.},
