  abstract     = {This article proposes a novel framework for ethical human–artificial intelligence (AI) partnerships in education by integrating Eastern ethics (with Chinese ethics as an example), intelligence augmentation, and agentic AI design. Moving beyond the dominant Western paradigm, the study draws from Confucian and Daoist principles—such as relational trust, coagency, and moral cultivation—to envision AI as an ethical partner, not just a tool. It addresses two key questions: How can trust in AI be cultivated in education? and when can AI be ethically considered a collaborator? The authors introduce a triadic model combining normative grounding, cognitive scaffolding, and system-level design, operationalized through culturally sensitive platforms, pedagogy, and ethical interaction. They also propose a three-tiered evaluation system: learner trust metrics, educator audits, and AI reflexivity protocols. This interdisciplinary synthesis provides a scalable culturally rooted pathway for designing AI systems that are pedagogically meaningful, ethically adaptive, and co-constructive—contributing to more equitable and morally resonant educational futures.},

A sample of 26 preservice teachers (divided into 13 teams) was included in this two-phrase study. Results showed that textbook design activities with the chatbot effectively promoted participants’ acquisition of content knowledge and improved self-efficacy, although it did not reduce teaching anxiety. Evidence was also extracted from participants’ open-ended responses with an extended COSTEM (i.e., content, others, self, tasks, ethics, and model) framework. Meanwhile, preservice teachers perceived both advantages and disadvantages regarding the utility of the GAI-based chatbot in learning. Implications of this study were also discussed.},

Utilizing data from 1522 kindergarten teachers, we developed and validated a culturally adapted AI literacy scale through factor analyses, confirming a three-construct structure: Safety, Attitude, and Capability. Latent profile analysis identified three distinct teacher profiles: “Hesitant Beginners” (9.6%), “Enthusiastic Practitioners” (64.2%), and “Confident Experts” (26.2%), revealing significant heterogeneity. Teachers generally exhibited positive attitudes toward AI but lower safety awareness and capability levels. Regression analyses indicated that education level, working experience (negatively associated), kindergarten type, and geographic location (urban/rural) significantly influence AI literacy levels and profile membership. These findings underscore the need for context-specific assessment tools and tailored teacher education programs to enhance their digital literacy and promote equitable AI integration in Chinese early childhood education.},

  abstract     = {Aesthetic perception, as a core competence in art education, fosters students’ cultural sensibility, emotional expression, and critical thinking. However, existing approaches to cultivating aesthetic perception often lack systematic guidance and personalized developmental pathways, limiting their capacity to support sustained and individualized growth. Two central challenges remain unresolved: first, how to effectively model the dynamic, multidimensional progression of students’ aesthetic understanding, and second, how to construct coherent learning paths that guide students from basic perceptual awareness to more abstract artistic engagement. To address these issues, we propose AesthPath a reinforcement learning-based recommendation model that constructs personalized picture book learning paths to enhance aesthetic perception. Specifically, the model introduces a Markov decision process formulation that captures the evolving states of learners’ aesthetic competence across multiple dimensions. An actor–critic algorithm is then employed to generate adaptive learning trajectories by balancing exploration of new content with the reinforcement of effective materials, based on ongoing learner feedback. Unlike traditional static or rule-based recommendation methods, AesthPath supports fine-grained, feedback-driven optimization of learning trajectories, facilitating goal-oriented and personalized development of aesthetic perception. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AesthPath in enhancing students’ aesthetic understanding. This study offers new theoretical and methodological insights for intelligent learning path design and educational recommendations, highlighting the potential of reinforcement learning in adaptive learning scenarios.},

The main contribution of this tool is the integration of an adaptive learning system with a 3-D robotic simulator, used to face realistic challenges in a user-friendly fashion. ProgTutor provides automated evaluations and feedback on coding errors, ensuring that learners receive the support they need to progress effectively. In addition, it features dynamic learning paths tailored to each student’s pace, offloading tasks such as automated evaluation and adaptive sequencing to the tool so that students and teachers can concentrate on judgment. ProgTutor also enhances the teachers’ capacities as educators, as they can focus their attention on those students with more learning difficulties. Therefore, it functions as intelligence augmentation rather than automation, with teachers remaining in the decision loop. This article introduces the conceptual and functional design of ProgTutor, and it includes piloting results with high school students during the academic course 2023–2024, focused on their acceptability of the tool and on the analysis of the real impact that this type of system could have over the formal educational landscape in the future.},

However, the advent of haptic virtual reality (HVR) technologies offers a transformative approach to this training, enhancing safety and potential efficiency. This study explores the development of an IV needle insertion simulator using two different haptic devices integrated into a VR system on the Unity platform and assesses its impact on learning through a three-week experiment. The simulator is designed to create a realistic and immersive training environment by incorporating detailed anatomical models, physics-based hand interactions, and real-time haptic feedback. The virtual environment replicates a clinical setting, featuring a patient arm model and an IV needle. The haptic feedback is programmed to offer realistic feelings of needle insertion and hand grasping, improving the user’s accuracy. Learning impact and usability testing with 41 students indicate a promising improvement in skill acquisition and confidence. Specifically, participants showed a 55% increase in success rates and a significant boost in confidence. This high-fidelity HVR simulator represents a significant step forward in medical training technologies, offering a scalable and repeatable training tool adaptable to various educational needs and skill levels.},

We chose five Polish public economics universities offering those degree programs for comparison. Four LLMs were used in this experiment: ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Google Bard, and Gemini. Two of them are multimodal models. The study used an iterative approach, increasing the detail of the prompt in each iteration. The results show that the more specific prompt is given to the LLM, the less accurate the results are. Moreover, the experiment shows that none of the LLMs developed a complete curriculum at a level comparable to that generated by humans. However, LLMs can significantly help create a curriculum and develop syllabi by humans, provided that there is close human–artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration. The results obtained from the AI-assisted curriculum design differ depending on the model.

However, existing learning path generation schemes still have challenges, such as focusing solely on one aspect of the learner’s characteristics or the structure of learning content, difficulty in describing the variation in a learner’s knowledge level, and a lack of interpretability. To address these issues, in this article, we propose an educational psychology-empowered personalized learning path generation strategy. First, inspired by Brown’s decay theory of immediate memory, we design the decay attentive knowledge tracing approach for assessing a learner’s knowledge level. Then, motivated by Bruner’s cognitive structure learning theory, we present search space optimization for selecting the learning content candidate set. Finally, enlightened by Posner’s conceptual change model, we impose multiple rule constraints on the matching process of the learner’s knowledge level and the learning content in the candidate set, gradually forming the personalized learning path. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed strategy for guaranteeing the reasonableness of learning content organization and enhancing the learner’s knowledge level. Moreover, the actual utilization of the proposed strategy in higher education course instruction shows its effectiveness in improving learning outcomes, motivation, and engagement.},

Against this background, the demand for automatic labeling of unit information to learning contents is increasing. In previous research, classification using n-gram and random forest yielded high performance for automatic unit labeling. These findings were only found for homogeneous learning contents because the method analyzed common words in the content text. In this study, we conducted an experiment to find the best-performing methods that can be used to label unit information in various forms of textual math learning contents. The experimental results showed that a perceptron method using bigram as a vectorization method performed well for all combinations of prediction datasets. Our proposed method outperforms others when labeling contents even in situations where only a small number of different types of learning contents are available. Implementation of this system will enable the analysis of student behaviors from a content-based perspective, assist teachers in efficiently organizing uploaded materials by unit, and help students identify relevant content for targeted review.},

Compliance, the System Usability Scale, and custom satisfaction questionnaires were used to evaluate the system. Compliance was high, with at least five sessions conducted in 80% of the weeks. 82% of children reported good usability, and 92% were satisfied with the experience.

  abstract     = {This article addresses the growing importance of understanding how multimodal artificial general intelligence (AGI) can be integrated into educational practices. We first reviewed the theoretical foundations of multimodality in human learning, encompassing its concept and history, dual coding theory and multimedia theory, VARK multimodality, and multimodal assessment (see Section II-A). After that, we revisited the essential components of AGI, particularly focusing on the multimodal nature of AGI that distinguished it from artificial narrow intelligence. Based on its conversational functionality, multimodal AGI is considered an educational agent already tested in various educational situations (see Section II-B). How significant text, image, audio, and video modalities are for education, the technological backgrounds of AGI for analyzing and generating them, and educational applications of artificial intelligence (AI) for each modality were thoroughly reviewed (Sections III–VI). Finally, we comprehensively investigated the ethics of AGI in education, originating from the ethics of AI and specified in three strands: first, data privacy and ethical integrity, second, explainability, transparency, and fairness, and third, responsibility and decision-making. Practical implementation of ethical AGI frameworks in education was reviewed (see Section VII). This article also discusses the implications for learning theories, derived operational design principles, current research gaps, practical constraints and institutional readiness, and future directions (see Section VIII). This exploration aims to provide an advanced understanding of the intersection between AI, multimodality, and education, setting a foundation for future research and development.},

  abstract     = {According to the interactive–constructive–active–passive (ICAP) framework, engaging in constructive cognitive modes yields better learning outcomes than active modes. Also, prior studies on educational chatbots suggest that enhancing chatbot humanness can improve learning. However, these two ideas have not been fully explored together, especially within the context of text-based, disembodied chatbots. This study investigates the impact of the cognitive engagement modes (constructive versus active) and chatbot humanness (humanized versus nonhumanized) on learning outcomes and five dimensions of learning motivation. We conducted a two-by-two factorial user experiment with 55 chatbot users. Data were analyzed through a mixed-method approach to examine the main and interaction effects of the two independent variables. Regarding learning outcomes, our data showed that learners who interacted with constructive chatbots showed higher learning outcomes than those who interacted with active chatbots. In addition, learners who interacted with nonhumanized chatbots reported higher learning outcomes than those who interacted with humanized chatbots. Lastly, we observed a significant interaction effect between the two independent variables on tension-pressure and perceived competence, which are two dimensions of learning motivation. Our study extended the applicability of the ICAP framework to the domain of chatbot-based learning, challenged the assumption that the humanness of chatbots can lead to improved learning outcomes, and underscored the importance of exploring both the cognitive engagement modes and the humanness of chatbots when designing chatbots to enhance users’ learning motivation.},

  abstract     = {Automated classification of learner-generated text to identify behavior, emotion, and cognition indicators, collectively known as learning engagement classification (LEC), has received considerable attention in fields such as natural language processing(NLP), learning analytics, and educational data mining. Recently, large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, which are considered promising technologies for artificial general intelligence, have demonstrated remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. However, their capabilities in LEC tasks still lack comprehensive evaluation and improvement approaches. This study introduces a novel benchmark for LEC, encompassing six datasets that cover behavior classification (question and urgency level), emotion classification (binary and epistemic emotion), and cognition classification (opinion and cognitive presence). In addition, we propose the annotation guideline-based knowledge augmentation (AGKA) approach, which leverages GPT-4.0 to recognize and extract label definitions from annotation guidelines and applies random undersampling to select a representative set of examples. Experimental results demonstrate the following: AGKA enhances LLM performance compared to vanilla prompts, particularly for GPT-4.0 and Llama-3 70B; GPT-4.0 and Llama-3 70B with AGKA are comparable to fully fine-tuned models such as BERT and RoBERTa on simple binary classification tasks; for multiclass tasks requiring complex semantic understanding, GPT-4.0 and Llama-3 70B outperform the fine-tuned models in the few-shot setting but fall short of the fully fine-tuned models; Llama-3 70B with AGKA shows comparable performance to GPT-4.0, demonstrating the viability of these open-source alternatives; and the ablation study highlights the importance of customizing and evaluating knowledge augmentation strategies for each specific LLM architecture and task.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we preliminarily discuss the limitations of current video conferencing platforms in online synchronous learning. Research has shown that while the involved technologies are appropriate for collaborative video calls, they often fail to replicate the rich nature of face-to-face interactions among students and between students and professors, by constraining them to a grid of faces on screens and limiting the natural flows of conversation and nonverbal communication. We believe that a potential solution to this issue could be adopting virtual reality (VR) technologies in online synchronous teaching. To test our assumption, we developed a novel subjective assessment involving 44 electronics engineering students who attended real lessons on Internet protocols. The taught content was included in the course program and the final exam; the professor made use of slides for teaching and a blackboard to explain some exercises. Two different learning approaches were used: VR-based online synchronous learning and video-based online synchronous learning. While the former consisted in wearing a headset and participating in a virtual classroom in front of the teacher’s avatar, the latter involved watching a 2-D video of the streamed lesson through a laptop and communicating through the microphone. The opinions collected from the students included several aspects, namely, overall quality of experience, immersion, interactivity, naturalness, usability, entertainment, comfort, side effects, interaction with the teacher and students, and ease of taking notes. Key findings from Welch’s $t$-test indicate the higher interactivity ($p&lt; 0.05$), naturalness ($p&lt; 0.01$), entertainment ($p&lt; 0.01$), and immersion ($p&lt; 0.001$) perceived by students for the VR-based learning experience than the video-based one. Increased immersion was the most significant aspect, as highlighted by the lowest $p$-value. On the other hand, the level of comfort was heavily penalized ($p&lt; 0.001$), and students were unable to take notes in the VR classroom environment easily. No significant difference ($p&gt;0.05$) was achieved for the other considered metrics.},

  abstract     = {Decimal misconceptions are a persistent challenge in mathematics education, often hindering students’ long-term understanding. This study examines how learning analytics (LA) can be effectively integrated into instructional sequences to address these misconceptions, providing teachers with real-time insights for formative assessment. Despite the growing presence of technology in education, LA remains underutilized at the primary level. The study involved 235 fifth- and sixth-grade students completing decimal number tasks through a Moodle-based platform. Students were assigned to one of three conditions: tasks based on correct examples (CE tasks, n = 79), erroneous examples (n = 80), or no tasks (control group, n = 76). Results indicate that example-based tasks significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly for students with lower prior knowledge, who benefited more from CE tasks. LA data effectively predicted student performance, demonstrating its potential as a formative assessment tool. Importantly, results suggest that the observed effects were consistent across male and female students. These findings highlight the need to integrate LA into daily teaching practice, enabling educators to identify misconceptions and tailor instruction accordingly. Given the positive student reception and the efficiency of LA-driven interventions, this study underscores its relevance for policy decisions aimed at enhancing mathematics education in primary schools.},

  abstract     = {Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts, there is no evidence on how these can be operationalized by students to generate custom datasets suitable for teaching and learning. Moreover, in the context of network science, little is known about whether LLMs can replicate real-life network properties. This study addresses these gaps by evaluating the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), specifically LLMs, to create synthetic network datasets for educational use. The analyzed data include students’ AI-generated network datasets, their interactions with the LLMs, and their perceptions and evaluations of the task's value. The results indicate that the LLM-generated networks had properties closer to real-life networks, such as higher transitivity, network density, and smaller mean distances compared to randomly generated networks. Thus, our findings show that students can use LLMs to produce synthetic networks with realistic structures while tailoring to the individual preferences of each student. The analysis of students’ interactions (prompts) with the LLMs revealed a predominant use of direct instructions and output specifications, with less emphasis on providing contextual details or iterative refinement of the LLM's responses, which highlights the need for AI literacy training to optimize students’ use of generative AI. Students’ perceptions of the use of AI were overall positive; they found using LLMs time saving and beneficial, although opinions on output relevance and quality varied, especially for assignments requiring replication of specific networks.},

  abstract     = {Researchers have increasingly utilized artificial intelligence to automatically analyze classroom dialogue, aiming to provide timely feedback to teachers due to its educational significance. However, traditional machine learning and deep learning models face challenges, such as limited performance and lack of generalizability, across various dimensions of classroom dialogue and educational contexts. Recent efforts to utilize large language models (LLMs) for classroom dialogue analysis have predominantly relied on prompt engineering techniques, primarily due to the high costs associated with full fine-tuning, which has resulted in suboptimal performance and areas needing improvement. We, therefore, propose the application of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to enhance the performance of LLMs in classroom dialogue analysis. Specifically, we utilized low-rank adaptation, a prominent PEFT technique, to fine-tune three state-of-the-art LLMs—Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-2-9B, and Mistral-7B-v0.3—targeting the analysis of both teachers' and students' dialogic moves within K-12 mathematics lessons. The experimental results indicate that, in comparison to fully fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa models and prompting LLMs, LLMs fine-tuned using the PEFT technique achieve superior performance. Moreover, the PEFT approach significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters within the LLMs by over 300 times and decreased their training duration. Although the training time for PEFT-tuned LLMs was still longer than that required for fully fine-tuning BERT and RoBERTa, these LLMs demonstrated specialization in this specific dimension and generalizability to other tasks and contexts. We believe that the use of PEFT techniques presents a promising direction for future research in classroom dialogue analysis.},

Given the fundamental role of education, concerns are rising about whether LLMs can serve as competent teachers. To address the challenge of comprehensively evaluating the competencies of LLMs as teachers, a systematic quantitative evaluation based on the competency model has emerged as a valuable approach. Our study, grounded in the teacher competency model and drawing from 14 existing scales, constructed an evaluation framework called TeacherComp. Based on TeacherComp, we evaluated six LLMs from OpenAI across four dimensions: knowledge, skills, values, and traits. Through comparisons between LLMs’ responses and human norms, we found that: 1) with each successive update, LLMs have shown overall improvements in knowledge, while their skills dimension scores have increasingly aligned with human norms; 2) there are both commonalities and differences in the performance of various LLMs regarding values and traits. For instance, while they all tend to exhibit more negative traits than humans, their morals can vary; and 3) LLMs with reduced security, constructed using jailbreak techniques, exhibit values and traits more closely aligned with human norms. Building on these findings, we provided interpretations and suggestions for the application of LLMs in various educational contexts. Overall, this study helps teachers and students use LLMs in appropriate contexts and provides developers with guidance for future iterations, thereby advancing the role of LLMs in empowering education.},

Leveraging large language models and learning analytics, the platform supports educators by offering tag-based recommendations and AI-generated feedback to enhance the quality and efficiency of open-response evaluations. A controlled experiment involving 65 higher education instructors assessed the platform's effectiveness in real-world environments. Using the technology acceptance model, this study investigated the platform's usefulness and relevance from the instructors' perspectives. Moreover, we collected data from the platform's usage to identify partners in instructors' behavior for different scenarios. Results indicate that AI-driven feedback significantly improved instructors' ability to provide detailed personalized feedback in less time. This study contributes to the growing research on AI applications in educational assessment and highlights key considerations for adopting AI-driven tools in instructional settings.},

  abstract     = {Orienteering has long been used in physical education due to its recognized benefits for perceptual-motor capacity, as a tool for safe and efficient movement and as a recreational activity. It also helps in the acquisition of skills in multiple domains besides physical education, such as geography, mathematics, or biology. Many teachers use this interdisciplinary nature of orienteering, complementing it with educational tasks at each control point, and using geolocation and mobile devices to avoid the cumbersome tasks related to the setting up and dismantling of physical circuits. However, the systems that allow this kind of geolocated educational orienteering activities have some limitations in their implementation of the elements of orienteering or in the educational possibilities for teachers to configure and monitor learning situations that can adapt to their learning goals. To address these challenges, this article proposes a set of design requirements to create geolocated educational orienteering systems and a mobile tool, OrientaTree, created following the said requirements. A prototype of OrientaTree has been evaluated by means of a feature analysis and a pilot study involving five teachers and 115 students. The results of the evaluation provide evidence that OrientaTree overcomes the limitations of alternative reviewed approaches to conduct geolocated educational orienteering activities. However, it could be improved to allow more configuration capabilities to permit teachers to better adapt activities to their learning goals.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a monocular approach for capturing students' prototyping activities and interactions in digital-fabrication-based makerspaces. The proposed method uses images from a single camera and applies object reidentification, tracking, and depth estimation algorithms to track and uniquely label participants in the space, extracting both spatial and temporal information. A case study was conducted by recording a lab session in a digital-fabrication-based makerspace where students from a university undergraduate program turned their product ideas into tangible prototypes using digital fabrication. Moreover, a creativity test was conducted to assess individual creative competence. The findings reveal that the monocular approach effectively captures interactions among team members and instructors. It also identifies prototyping activities at individual and team levels. Furthermore, results demonstrate that the students with high and low creativity scores exhibit distinct patterns of interaction with instructors and teammates. Those with high creativity scores worked more independently and less collaboratively. Students with low creativity scores worked more collaboratively and less independently. The proposed monocular approach can be used in formal educational settings for student evaluation and prototyping activities. In addition, instructors can use this approach to assess and tailor teaching methods by promptly intervening and providing structures and scaffolding support to assist struggling students.},

  abstract     = {Digital teachers represent an innovative fusion of media and artificial intelligence (AI) within online educational environments. However, the specific ways in which the appearance anthropomorphism of digital teachers influences the delivery of different knowledge types remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on Embodied Learning Theory and Parasocial Interaction Theory, this study investigates how digital teachers' appearance (cartoonish versus realistic) interacts with knowledge types (explicit versus tacit) to affect digital learning satisfaction and usage intention, exploring the mediating roles of physical and social presence. Initially, we implemented a 2 × 2 experimental design using a large language model application, collecting data from 475 participants to empirically test our hypotheses. Subsequently, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 Chinese university students to further validate and clarify the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions. The results indicate that digital teachers with a cartoonish appearance are more effective for delivering explicit knowledge, whereas digital teachers with a realistic appearance excel in conveying tacit knowledge. Both physical presence and social presence were found to significantly mediate these effects. This research enriches our understanding of AI-enhanced online education by highlighting the alignment effect between digital teacher appearance and the type of knowledge delivered and by uncovering the underlying psychological mechanisms. In addition, it offers practical insights for the design of digital human appearances in educational interfaces and broader AI–human interaction scenarios.},

Despite its potential, previous studies have primarily highlighted the benefits of lightboard videos by evaluating learners' subjective experiences, with limited empirical research examining their impact on learning outcomes. Moreover, the psychological factors underlying the potential advantages of lightboard videos have remained largely unexplored. To address these gaps, the present study conducted an online learning task in a mathematical optimization course, randomly assigning 78 college students to three groups: lightboard, whiteboard, and no-instructor. Learning outcomes and experiences during the learning process were measured and analyzed. The results showed that the lightboard group experienced significantly lower cognitive load while achieving learning outcomes comparable to the other two groups, suggesting that lightboard videos can reduce students' cognitive load without compromising learning outcomes. Further analysis of the psychological factors revealed that cognitive load played a more critical role than perceived social presence or learning motivation in explaining learning outcomes. These findings underscore the positive impact of lightboard videos on online learning, provide insights into the underlying psychological mechanisms, and offer implications for their integration into educational practices.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced smart education in the artificial general intelligence era. A promising application lies in the automatic generalization of instructional design for curriculum and learning activities, focusing on two key aspects: 1) customized generation: generating niche-targeted teaching content based on students' varying learning abilities and states and 2) intelligent optimization: iteratively optimizing content based on feedback from learning effectiveness or test scores. Currently, a single large LLM cannot effectively manage the entire process, posing a challenge for designing intelligent teaching plans. To address these issues, we developed EduPlanner, an LLM-based multiagent system comprising an evaluator agent, an optimizer agent, and a question analyst, working in adversarial collaboration to generate customized and intelligent instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Taking mathematics lessons as our example, EduPlanner employs a novel Skill-Tree structure to accurately model the background mathematics knowledge of student groups, personalizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities according to students' knowledge levels and learning abilities. In addition, we introduce the CIDDP, an LLM-based 5-D evaluation module encompassing Clarity, Integrity, Depth, Practicality, and Pertinence, to comprehensively assess mathematics lesson plan quality and bootstrap intelligent optimization. Experiments conducted on the GSM8K and Algebra datasets demonstrate that EduPlanner excels in evaluating and optimizing instructional design for curriculum and learning activities. Ablation studies further validate the significance and effectiveness of each component within the framework.},

This exploratory quasi-experimental study examined the effects of ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (CCL) on students’ learning performance, artificial intelligence (AI) awareness, critical thinking, and cognitive load. A total of 36 sophomore undergraduates participated in an eight-week instructional experiment, dedicating 3 h per week to applying STEM and entrepreneurship knowledge in the creation of cultural products. The experimental group (N = 21) participated in CCL, while the control group (N = 15) engaged in non-ChatGPT-assisted collaborative learning (NCCL). The results indicated that the CCL group outperformed the NCCL group in terms of learning performance, AI awareness, and cognitive load, while the NCCL group excelled in critical thinking. The findings confirm that ChatGPT offers significant potential and advantages in addressing complex problems within group collaboration and stimulating group creativity, providing new insights into fostering students’ entrepreneurial spirit and skills. However, overreliance on and misuse of ChatGPT may hinder student learning outcomes. Future research should focus on the cocreative problem-solving mechanisms between humans and machines in entrepreneurial education, particularly the interplay of knowledge, thinking, emotions, and actions in collaborative processes involving GAI.},

This hesitancy can be partially attributed to a lack of guidance for integrating these novel technologies into existing curricula. This work aims to guide instructional designers, curriculum developers, and technologists in seamlessly integrating immersive technologies into public safety training curricula. This work provides a comprehensive account of our collaboration with instructional designers, public safety personnel, and subject matter experts in developing an AR-based training curriculum for the Sort, Assess, Life-saving Interventions, Treatment/Transport triage technique used in mass casualty incidents (MCIs). In addition, we introduce a systematic framework for public safety curriculum development based on the Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate instructional design model. Leveraging a human-centered design approach, we first analyze the necessity for immersive learning in public safety. Next, we identify the obstacles in developing XR training experiences and outline our construct of a training prototype through iterative evaluations based on stakeholder feedback. Finally, we share qualitative insights through iterative evaluations with firefighters and emergency medical technicians performing MCI triage tasks in AR, supplemented by survey questionnaires and semistructured interviews.

Through precise performance prediction, schools can quickly pinpoint students facing challenges and provide customized educational materials suited to their specific learning needs. The reliance on teachers' experience to predict students' academic performance has proven to be less accurate and efficient than desired. Consequently, the past decade has witnessed a marked surge in employing machine learning and data mining techniques to forecast students' performance. However, the academic community has yet to agree on the most effective algorithm for predicting academic outcomes. Nonetheless, conducting an analysis and comparison of the existing algorithms in this field remains meaningful.

This article reviews the state-of-the-art literature on academic performance predictions using machine learning approaches in recent years. It details the variables analyzed, the algorithms implemented, the datasets utilized, and the evaluation metrics applied to assess model efficacy. What makes this work different is that relevant surveys in the past 10 years are also analyzed and compared, highlighting their contributions and review methods. In addition, we compared the accuracy of various machine learning models using popular open-access datasets and determined the best-performing algorithms among them.
