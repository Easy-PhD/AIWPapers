  abstract     = {We investigate the phase retrieval problem perturbed by dense bounded noise and sparse outliers that can change an adversarially chosen s-fraction of the measurement vector. The adversarial sparse outliers may depend on both the observation and measurements. We demonstrate that the nonlinear least absolute deviation based on amplitude measurements can tolerate adversarial outliers up to a fraction of $s^{*,1}\approx 0.2043$ , while the intensity-based model can tolerate a fraction of $s^{*,2}\approx 0.1185$ . Furthermore, we construct adaptive counterexamples to show that these thresholds are theoretically sharp, thereby showing the presentation of phase transition in the adversarial phase retrieval problem when the corruption fraction exceeds the sharp thresholds. This implies that the amplitude-based model exhibits superior adversarial robustness in comparison with the intensity-based model. Corresponding experimental results are presented to further illustrate our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first theoretical examination of the differences in robustness performance between amplitude and intensity measurement. A crucial aspect of our analysis is the exploration of the exact distribution of a combination of two non-independent Gaussian random variables, leading to the presentation of novel probability density functions to derive the sharp thresholds.},

  abstract     = {Automated cryptanalysis has taken center stage in the arena of cryptanalysis since the pioneering work by Mouha et al. which showcased the power of Mixed Integer Linear Programming ( $\textsf {MILP}$ ) in solving cryptanalysis problems that otherwise, required significant effort. Since the inception, research in this area has moved in primarily two directions. One is to model more and more classical cryptanalysis tools as optimization problems to leverage the ease provided by state-of-the-art solvers. The other direction is to improve existing models to make them more efficient and/or accurate. The current work is an attempt to contribute to the latter. In this work, a general model referred to as $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ has been devised to capture the correlation between $\textsf {AND}$ gates in $\textsf {NLFSR}$ -based lightweight block ciphers. $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ builds upon and generalizes the idea of joint propagation of differences through $\textsf {AND}$ gates captured using refined $\textsf {MILP}$ modeling of $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ by Saha et al. in FSE 2020. The proposed model has been applied to $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ , $\textsf {KATAN}$ , $\textsf {KTANTAN}$ and can detect correlations that were missed by earlier models. This leads to more accurate differential bounds for both the ciphers. In particular, a 384-round (full-round as per earlier specification) $\textsf {Type-IV}$ trail is found for $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ with 14-active $\textsf {AND}$ gates using the new model, while the refined model reported this figure to be 19. This also reaffirms the decision of the designers to increase the number of rounds from 384 to 640. Moreover, the model succeeds in searching a full round $\textsf {Type-IV}$ trail of $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ keyed permutation ${\mathcal {P}}_{1024}$ with probability $2^{-105} (\gg 2^{-128})$ . This reveals the non-random properties of ${\mathcal {P}}_{1024}$ thereby showing it to be non-ideal. Hence it cannot be expected to provide the same security levels as robust block ciphers. Further, the provable security of $\textsf {TinyJAMBU}$ $\textsf {AEAD}$ scheme should be carefully revisited. Similarly, for the variants of $\textsf {KATAN}$ , several previously reported trails are improved upon by employing the $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ model. Moreover, in the related-key setting, the $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ model is able to make a better 140-round boomerang distinguisher (for both the data and time complexity) in comparison to the previous boomerang attack by Isobe et al. in ACISP 2013. Furthermore, for enhanced applicability, we employ the $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ model on another multiple $\textsf {AND}$ -based cipher, $\textsf {KTANTAN}$ , in the related-key setting. Our analysis reveals practical differential distinguishers with low data and time complexities for all full-round $\textsf {KTANTAN}$ variants. In summary, $\textsf {DEEPAND}$ seems to capture the underlying correlation better when multiple $\textsf {AND}$ gates are at play and can be adapted to other classes of ciphers as well.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study a multiclass spatial birth-and-death (SBD) processes on a compact region of the Euclidean plane modeling wireless interactions. In such a setup, users arrive at a constant rate and leave at a rate inversely proportional to a shot noise created by interfering users in the network. The novelty of this work lies in the addition of service differentiation, inspired by bandwidth partitioning present in 5G networks: users are allocated a fixed number of frequency bands and only interfere with transmissions on these bands. The first result of our work lies in the determination of the critical user arrival rate below which the system is always stochastically stable, and above which it is unstable. The analysis requires symmetry assumptions which are defined in the paper. The proof for this result uses stochastic monotonicity and fluid limit models to bound the dynamics from above and below by two adequate discrete-state Markov jump processes, for which we obtain stability and instability results. This leads to a closed form formula for the critical arrival rate. In a second part, we propose two heuristics to estimate the steady-state densities of users in the network: the first one relies on a Poisson approximation of the steady-state processes. The second one uses a cavity approximation leveraging second-order moment measures, which leads to more accurate estimates of the steady-state user densities of all classes of users. The Poisson heuristic also gives a good estimate for the critical arrival rate.},

  abstract     = {The problem of T-colluding private information retrieval (PIR) enables the user to retrieve one out of M files from a distributed storage system with N servers without revealing anything about the index of the desired file to any group of up to T colluding servers. In the considered storage system, the M files are stored across the N distributed servers in an X-secure K-coded manner such that any group of up to X colluding servers learns nothing about the files; the storage overhead at each server is reduced by a factor of $\frac {1}{K}$ compared to the total size of the files; and the files can be reconstructed from any $K+X$ servers. However, in practical scenarios, when the user retrieves the desired file from the distributed system, some servers may respond to the user very slowly or not respond at all. These servers are referred to as stragglers, and particularly their identities and numbers are unknown in advance and may change over time. This paper considers the adaptive PIR problem that can be capable of tolerating the presence of a varying number of stragglers. We propose a general coding method for designing adaptive PIR schemes by introducing the concept of a feasible PIR coding framework. We demonstrate that any feasible PIR coding framework over a finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ with size q can be used to construct an adaptive PIR scheme that achieves a retrieval rate of $1-\frac {K+X+T-1}{N-S}$ simultaneously for all numbers of stragglers $0\leq S\leq N-(K+X+T)$ over the same finite field. Additionally, we provide an implementation of the feasible PIR coding framework, ensuring that the adaptive PIR scheme operates over any finite field $\mathbb {F}_{q}$ with size $q\geq N+\max \{K, N-(K+X+T-1)\}$ .},

A user wishes to retrieve a desired message from N non-colluding servers efficiently, such that the identity of the desired message is not leaked in a significant manner; however, some servers can be more trustworthy than others. We propose a code construction for this setting and optimize the probability distribution for this construction. For the Max-L metric, it is shown that the optimal probability allocation for the proposed scheme essentially separates the delivery patterns into two parts: a completely private part that has the same download overhead as the capacity-achieving PIR code, and a non-private part that allows complete privacy leakage but has no download overhead by downloading only from the most trustful server. The optimal solution is established through a sophisticated analysis of the underlying convex optimization problem and a reduction between the homogeneous setting and the heterogeneous setting. For the MI metric, the homogeneous case is studied first for which the code can be optimized with an explicit probability assignment, while a closed-form solution becomes intractable for the heterogeneous case. Numerical results are provided for both cases to corroborate the theoretical analysis.},

Empirical investigations demonstrate that KANs optimized via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are capable of achieving near-zero training loss in various machine learning (e.g., regression, classification, and time series forecasting, etc.) and scientific tasks (e.g., solving partial differential equations). In this paper, we provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical success by conducting a rigorous convergence analysis of gradient descent (GD) and SGD for two-layer KANs in solving both regression and physics-informed tasks. For regression problems, we establish using the neural tangent kernel perspective that GD achieves global linear convergence of the objective function when the hidden dimension of KANs is sufficiently large. We further extend these results to SGD, demonstrating a similar global convergence in expectation. Additionally, we analyze the global convergence of GD and SGD for physics-informed KANs, which unveils additional challenges due to the more complex loss structure. This is the first work establishing the global convergence guarantees for GD and SGD applied to optimize KANs and physics-informed KANs.},

  abstract     = {Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) has shown great promise in many real-world applications. Existing MORL algorithms often aim to learn a policy that optimizes individual objective functions simultaneously with a given prior preference (or weights) on different objectives. However, these methods often suffer from the issue of gradient conflict such that the objectives with larger gradients dominate the update direction, resulting in a performance degeneration on other objectives. In this paper, we develop a novel dynamic weighting multi-objective actor-critic algorithm (MOAC) under two options of sub-procedures named as conflict-avoidant (CA) and faster convergence (FC) in objective weight updates. MOAC-CA aims to find a CA update direction that maximizes the minimum value improvement among objectives, and MOAC-FC targets at a much faster convergence rate. We provide a comprehensive finite-time convergence analysis for both algorithms. We show that MOAC-CA can find a $\epsilon +\epsilon _{\text {app}}$ -accurate Pareto stationary policy using $\mathcal {O}({\epsilon ^{-5}})$ samples, while ensuring a small $\epsilon +\sqrt {\epsilon _{\text {app}}}$ -level CA distance (defined as the distance to the CA direction), where $\epsilon _{\text {app}}$ is the function approximation error. The analysis also shows that MOAC-FC improves the sample complexity to $\mathcal {O}(\epsilon ^{-3})$ , but with a constant-level CA distance. Our experiments on MT10 demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithms over existing MORL methods with fixed preference.},

While recent advances in robust RL focus on Markov decision processes (MDPs), robust non-Markovian RL is limited to planning problem where the transitions in the uncertainty set are known. In this paper, we study the learning problem of robust offline non-Markovian RL. Specifically, when the nominal model admits a low-rank structure, we propose a new algorithm, featuring a novel dataset distillation and a lower confidence bound (LCB) design for robust values under different types of the uncertainty set. We also derive new dual forms for these robust values in non-Markovian RL, making our algorithm more amenable to practical implementation. By further introducing a novel type-I concentrability coefficient tailored for offline low-rank non-Markovian decision processes, we prove that our algorithm can find an $\epsilon $ -optimal robust policy using $O(1/\epsilon ^{2})$ offline samples. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to the case when the nominal model does not have specific structure. With a new type-II concentrability coefficient, the extended algorithm also enjoys polynomial sample efficiency under all different types of the uncertainty set.},

  abstract     = {Clustering is a fundamental tool in statistical machine learning in the presence of heterogeneous data. Most recent results focus primarily on optimal mislabeling guarantees when data are distributed around centroids with sub-Gaussian errors. Yet, the restrictive sub-Gaussian model is often invalid in practice, since various real-world applications exhibit heavy-tail distributions around the centroids or suffer from possible adversarial attacks that call for robust clustering with a robust data-driven initialization. In this paper, we present initialization and subsequent clustering methods that provably guarantee near-optimal mislabeling for general mixture models when the number of clusters and data dimensions are finite. We first introduce a hybrid clustering technique with a novel multivariate trimmed mean type centroid estimate to produce mislabeling guarantees under a weak initialization condition for general error distributions around the centroids. A matching lower bound is derived, up to factors depending on the number of clusters. In addition, our approach also produces similar mislabeling guarantees even in the presence of adversarial outliers. Our results reduce to the sub-Gaussian case in finite dimensions when errors follow sub-Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem thoroughly, we also present novel data-driven robust initialization techniques and show that, with probabilities approaching one, these initial centroid estimates are sufficiently good for the subsequent clustering algorithm to achieve the optimal mislabeling rates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Lloyd‚Äôs algorithm is suboptimal for more than two clusters even when errors are Gaussian and for two clusters when error distributions have heavy tails. Both simulated data and real data examples further support our robust initialization procedure and clustering algorithm.},

Despite many methodological and theoretical developments in the past two decades, the theoretical guarantees of the popular SPCA algorithm proposed by Zou et al. (2006) based on the elastic net are still unknown. This paper aims to address this critical theoretical gap. We first revisit the SPCA algorithm of Zou et al. (2006) and present our implementation. We also study a computationally more efficient variant of the SPCA algorithm in Zou et al. (2006) that can be considered as the limiting case of SPCA. We provide the guarantees of convergence to a stationary point for both algorithms and prove that, under a sparse spiked covariance model, both algorithms can recover the principal subspace consistently under mild regularity conditions. We show that their estimation error bounds match the best available bounds of existing works or the minimax rates up to some logarithmic factors. Moreover, we demonstrate the competitive numerical performance of both algorithms in numerical experiments.},

  abstract     = {Given a sequence of tokens, such as words, the task of next-token prediction is to predict the next-token conditional probability distribution. Decoder-only transformers have become effective models for this task, but their properties are still not fully understood. In particular, the largest number of distinct context sequences that a decoder-only transformer can interpolate next-token distributions for has not been established. To fill this gap, we prove upper and lower bounds on this number, which are equal up to a multiplicative constant. We prove these bounds in the general setting where next-token distributions can be arbitrary as well as the empirical setting where they are calculated from a finite number of document sequences. Our lower bounds are for one-layer multi-head decoder-only transformers and our proofs highlight an important injectivity property satisfied by self-attention. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence that the minimal number of parameters for memorization is sufficient for being able to train the model to the entropy lower bound.},

The setting is extended to a multiplex version, where all layers have the same collection of nodes and follow the SGRDPG. The only common feature of the layers of the network is that they can be partitioned into groups with common subspace structures, while otherwise matrices of connection probabilities can be all different. The setting above is extremely flexible and includes a variety of existing multiplex network models, including GRDPG, as its particular cases. By employing novel methodologies, our paper ensures strongly consistent clustering of layers and highly accurate subspace estimation, which are significant improvements over the results of Pensky and Wang (2024). All algorithms and theoretical results in the paper remain true for both signed and binary networks. In addition, the paper shows that keeping signs of the edges in the process of network construction leads to a better precision of estimation and clustering and, hence, is beneficial for tackling real world problems such as, for example, analysis of brain networks.},

When instantiated in appropriate Markov categories, these algorithms specialize to existing ones such as the Kalman filter, forward-backward algorithm, and the Rauch-Tung‚ÄìStriebel smoother. We also prove that the sequence of outputs of our abstract Bayes filter is itself a Markov chain with a concrete formula for its transition maps. There are two main features of this categorical framework. The first is its abstract generality, as manifested in our unified account of hidden Markov models and algorithms for filtering and smoothing in discrete probability, Gaussian probability, measure-theoretic probability, possibilistic nondeterminism and others at the same time.

We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide.

  abstract     = {Determining the optimal fidelity for the transmission of quantum information over noisy quantum channels is one of the central problems in quantum information theory. Recently, [Berta-Borderi-Fawzi-Scholz, Mathematical Programming, 2021] introduced an asymptotically converging semidefinite programming hierarchy of outer bounds for this quantity. However, the size of the semidefinite programs (SDPs) grows exponentially with respect to the level of the hierarchy, thus making their computation unscalable. In this work, by exploiting the symmetries in the SDP, we show that, for a fixed output dimension of the quantum channel, we can compute the SDP in time polynomial with respect to the level of the hierarchy and input dimension. As a direct consequence of our result, the optimal fidelity can be approximated with an accuracy of $\epsilon $ in $\mathrm {poly}(1/\epsilon, \text {input dimension})$ time, compared to the $\exp (1/\epsilon, \text {input dimension})$ running time required for direct computation.},

The problem setting we investigate involves an exponentially distributed delay channel for transmissions and a constraint on the average sampling rate. We first show that the optimum sampling and transmission policy is a multi-threshold policy, where the thresholds depend on both the estimation value and the state of the original process, and sampling and transmission need to be initiated when the instantaneous AoII exceeds the corresponding threshold, called the estimation- and state-aware transmission (ESAT) policy. Subsequently, we formulate the problem of finding the thresholds as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) and the Lagrangian approach. Additionally, we propose two lower complexity sub-optimum policies, namely the estimation-aware transmission (EAT) policy, and the single-threshold (ST) policy, for which it is possible to obtain these thresholds for CTMCs with relatively larger number of states. The underlying CSMDP formulation relies on the multi-regime phase-type (MR-PH) distribution which is a generalization of the well-known phase-type distribution, which allows us to obtain the first two moments of time until absorption in a CTMC whose transition rates change with respect to time, in a piece-wise manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ESAT, EAT, and ST sampling and transmission policies are shown through numerical examples, along with comparisons with a baseline scheme that transmits packets according to a Poisson process in out-of-sync periods.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers a massive connectivity setting in which a base-station (BS) aims to communicate sources $(X_{1},\cdots ,X_{k})$ to a randomly activated subset of k users, among a large pool of n users, via a common message in the downlink. Although the identities of the k active users are assumed to be known at the BS, each active user only knows whether itself is active and does not know the identities of the other active users. A naive coding strategy is to transmit the sources alongside the identities of the users for which the source information is intended. This requires $H(X_{1},\cdots ,X_{k}) + k\log (n)$ bits, because the cost of specifying the identity of one out of n users is $\log (n)$ bits. For large n, this overhead can be significant. This paper shows that it is possible to develop coding techniques that eliminate the dependency of the overhead on n, if the source distribution follows certain symmetry. Specifically, if the source distribution is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) then the overhead can be reduced to at most $O(\log (k))$ bits, and in case of uniform i.i.d. sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(1)$ bits. For sources that follow a more general exchangeable distribution, the overhead is at most $O(k)$ bits, and in case of finite-alphabet exchangeable sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(\log (k))$ bits. The downlink massive random access problem is closely connected to the study of finite exchangeable sequences. The proposed coding strategy allows bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between finite exchangeable distributions and i.i.d. mixture distributions to be developed and gives a new KL divergence version of the finite de Finetti theorem, which is scaling optimal.},

  abstract     = {The capacity of a discrete-time channel with correlated phase noises is investigated. In particular, the electro-optic frequency comb system is considered, where the phase noise of each subchannel is a combination of two independent Wiener phase-noise sources. Capacity upper and lower bounds are derived for this channel and are compared with lower bounds obtained by numerically evaluating the achievable information rates using quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. Capacity upper and lower bounds are provided for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The multiplexing gain (pre-log) is shown to be $M-1$ , where M represents the number of subchannels. A constant gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds is observed, which depends on the number of subchannels M. For the specific case of $M=2$ , capacity is characterized up to a term that vanishes as the SNR grows large.},

  abstract     = {The classical Rician Weichselberger channel and the emerging holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel share a common characteristic of non-separable correlation, which captures the interdependence between transmit and receive antennas. However, this correlation structure makes it very challenging to characterize the fundamental limits of non-centered (Rician), non-separable MIMO channels. In fact, there is a dearth of existing literature that addresses this specific aspect, underscoring the need for further research in this area. In this paper, we investigate the mutual information (MI) of non-centered non-separable MIMO channels, where both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components are considered. By utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we set up a central limit theorem for the MI and give the closed-form expressions for its mean and variance. The derived results are then utilized to determine the ergodic MI and outage probability of holographic MIMO channels. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.},

It should be emphasized that the upper bounds build a connection between the RT-metric and the Hamming metric. Constructions of linear matrix codes are presented and their parameters for the RT-metric are investigated. It is shown that every linear matrix code can be expressed by using the trace function, which is a generalization of the well-known defining-set construction of linear codes.

  abstract     = {In their fundamental paper published in 1965, G. Solomon and J. J. Stiffler invented infinite families of codes meeting the Griesmer bound. These codes are then called Solomon-Stiffler codes and have motivated various constructions of codes meeting or close the Griesmer bound. However weight distributions of Solomon-Stiffler codes have been only determined for very special cases. In this paper, we give a geometric construction of affine and modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Projective Solomon-Stiffler codes are special cases of our modified affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Several infinite families of q-ary Griesmer, optimal, almost optimal, two-weight, three-weight, four-weight and five-weight linear codes are constructed as special cases of our construction. Weight distributions of these Griesmer, optimal or almost optimal codes are determined explicitly. Many optimal linear codes documented in Grassl‚Äôs list are re-constructed as (modified) affine Solomon-Stiffler codes. Several infinite families of optimal or Griesmer codes were constructed in Shi et, al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 63, no. 10, 2017, and in Liu et, al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 65, no. 5, 2019, via Gray images of codes over finite rings. Parameters and weight distributions of these Griesmer or optimal codes can be realized as very special cases in our construction. We also indicate that more general optimal binary linear codes than that constructed in Mondal, IEEE Trans. Inf.

In an additive white Gaussian noise channel, optimal linear codes with the smallest error coefficients achieve the best possible asymptotic frame error rate (AFER) among all optimal linear codes under maximum likelihood decoding. Such codes are referred to as AFER-optimal linear codes. The Griesmer bound is essential for determining the optimality of linear codes. However, establishing tight lower bounds on the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes is challenging, and the linear programming bound often performs inadequately. In this paper, we propose several iterative lower bounds for the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes. Specifically, for binary linear codes, our bounds are tight in most cases when the dimension does not exceed 5. To evaluate the performance of our bounds when they are not tight, we also determine the parameters of the remaining 5-dimensional AFER-optimal linear codes. Our final comparison demonstrates that even when our bounds are not tight, they remain very close to the actual values, with a gap of less than or equal to 2.},

In this work, we are interested in the maximum size of permutation codes in the Ulam metric and aim to design permutation codes that can correct multiple deletions with efficient decoding algorithms. We first present an improvement on the Gilbert-Varshamov bound of the maximum size of these permutation codes by analyzing the independence number of the auxiliary graph. The idea is widely used in various cases and our contribution in this section is to enumerate the number of triangles in the auxiliary graph and show that it is small enough. Next, we design permutation codes correcting multiple deletions with a decoding algorithm. In particular, the constructed permutation codes can correct t deletions with at most $(3t-1) \log (n+1)+o(\log n)$ bits of redundancy where n is the length of the code. Our construction is based on a new mapping that yields a new connection between permutation codes in the Hamming metric and permutation codes in various metrics. Furthermore, we construct permutation codes that correct multiple bursts of deletions using this new mapping. Finally, we extend the new mapping for multi-permutations and construct the best-known multi-permutation codes in the Ulam metric.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose and study r-minimal codes, a natural extension of minimal codes which have been extensively studied with respect to Hamming metric, rank metric and sum-rank metric. We first propose r-minimal codes in a general setting where the ambient space is a finite dimensional left module over a division ring and is supported on a lattice. We characterize minimal subcodes and r-minimal codes, derive a general singleton bound, and give existence results for r-minimal codes by using combinatorial arguments. We then consider r-minimal rank metric codes over a field extension $\mathbb {E}/\mathbb {F}$ of degree m, where $\mathbb {E}$ can be infinite unless otherwise specified. We characterize these codes in terms of cutting r-blocking sets, generalized rank weights of the codes and those of the dual codes, and classify codes whose r-dimensional subcodes have constant rank support weight. Next, with the help of the evasiveness property of cutting r-blocking sets and some upper bounds for the dimensions of evasive subspaces, we derive several lower and upper bounds for the minimal length of r-minimal codes. Furthermore, when $\mathbb {E}$ is finite, we establish a general upper bound which generalizes and improves the counterpart for minimal codes in the literature. As a corollary, we show that if $m=3$ , then for any $k\geqslant 2$ , the minimal length of k-dimensional minimal codes is equal to $2k$ . To the best of our knowledge, when $m\geqslant 3$ , there is no known explicit formula for the minimal length of k-dimensional minimal codes for arbitrary k in the literature.},

  abstract     = {We study message identification over a noiseless q-ary uniform permutation channel, where the transmitted vector is permuted by a permutation chosen uniformly at random. The channel is noiseless in the sense that the channel only rearranges the symbols in a different order, without changing the symbol values. For discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), the number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially. Identification capacity, the maximum second-order exponent, is known to be the same as the Shannon capacity of the DMC. Permutation channels support reliable communication of only polynomially many messages. A simple achievability result shows that message sizes growing as $2^{\epsilon _{n}n^{q-1}}$ are identifiable for any $\epsilon _{n}\rightarrow 0$ . We prove two converse results. A ‚Äúsoft‚Äù converse shows that for any $R\gt 0$ , there is no sequence of identification codes with message size growing as $2^{Rn^{q-1}}$ with a power-law decay ( $n^{-\mu }$ ) of the error probability. We also prove a ‚Äústrong‚Äù converse showing that for any sequence of identification codes with message size $2^{R_{n} n^{q-1}}$ , where $R_{n} \rightarrow \infty $ , the sum of Type I and Type II error probabilities approaches at least 1 as $n\rightarrow \infty $ . To prove the soft converse, we use a sequence of steps to construct a new identification code with a simpler structure which relates to a set system, and then use a lower bound on the normalized maximum pairwise intersection of a set system. To prove the strong converse, we use results on approximation of distributions. The achievability and converse results are generalized to the case of coding over multiple blocks. We also show that under deterministic encoding, the number of messages that can be identified per block is the number of types, i.e., $\binom {n+q-1}{q-1}$ , and this is same as the message size for reliable communication. We finally study message identification over a q-ary uniform permutation channel in the presence of causal block-wise feedback from the receiver, where the encoder receives an entire n-length received block after the transmission of the block is complete. We show that in the presence of feedback, the maximum number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially even under deterministic encoding, and we present a two-phase achievability scheme.},

  abstract     = {Minimum storage regenerating (MSR) codes are a class of maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes capable of repairing any single failed node by downloading the minimum amount of information from each of the helper nodes. However, MSR codes require large sub-packetization levels, which hinders their usefulness in practical settings. This led to the development of another class of MDS array codes called $\varepsilon $ -MSR codes, for which the repair information downloaded from each helper node is at most a factor of $(1+\varepsilon)$ from the minimum amount for some $\varepsilon \gt 0$ . The advantage of $\varepsilon $ -MSR codes over MSR codes is their small sub-packetization levels. In previous constructions of epsilon-MSR codes, however, several specific nodes are required to participate in the repair of a failed node, which limits the performance of the code in cases where these nodes are not available. In this work, we present a construction of $\varepsilon $ -MSR codes without this restriction. For a code with n nodes, out of which k store uncoded information, and for any number d of helper nodes ( $k\le d\lt n$ ), the repair of a failed node can be done by contacting any set of d surviving nodes. Our construction utilizes group algebra techniques, and requires linear field size. We also generalize the construction to MDS array codes capable of repairing h failed nodes using d helper nodes with a slightly sub-optimal download from each helper node, for all $h \le n-k$ and $k \le d \le n-h$ simultaneously.},

The rate was derived under the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input. In this work, focusing on the ReRAM channel with a single selector failure in the memory array, we derive an upper bound on achievable rate under arbitrary input distribution. This upper bound is within 0.02 bits from the achievable rate of i.i.d. input, indicating that i.i.d. is very close to optimal for large memory arrays. Moreover, we analyze the achievable rate of random code over ReRAM channel with suboptimal decodings where the decoder ignores the channel correlation. Our result indicates that in this case the achievable rate is limited by the capacity of a memoryless channel. We reveal both weak and strong asymptotic properties of ReRAM channel to prove this. The proof can be directly extended to the case of ReRAM with an arbitrary number of selector failures in the memory array.},

By employing analytical techniques rooted in cyclotomic numbers and Gaussian period theory over finite fields, we characterize the admissible symbol-pair weights of these codes. Significantly, we demonstrate that their minimum symbol-pair distances attain twice the minimum Hamming distances under specific algebraic constraints. Furthermore, we identify and rigorously determine the symbol-pair weight distributions for several three-weight code families. Notably, we construct a class of MDS symbol-pair codes that achieve optimal distance parameters by the puncturing technique.

The task of outlier hypothesis testing is to identify the set of outliers that are generated from an anomalous distribution among all observed sequences where the rest majority are generated from a nominal distribution. In the sequential setting, one obtains a symbol from each sequence per unit time until a reliable decision could be made. For the case with exactly one outlier, our exponent bounds are tight, providing exact large deviations characterization of sequential tests and strengthening a previous result of Li et al. (2017). In particular, the average sample size of our sequential test is bounded universally under any pair of nominal and anomalous distributions and our sequential test achieves larger Bayesian exponent than the fixed-length test, which could not be guaranteed by the sequential test of Li et al. (2017). For the case with at most one outlier, we propose a threshold-based test that has bounded expected stopping time under mild conditions and we bound the exponential decay rate of error probabilities, a.k.a., error exponents, under each non-null hypothesis and the null hypothesis. Our sequential test resolves the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of misclassification, false reject and false alarm probabilities for the fixed-length test of Zhou et al. (2022). Finally, with a further step towards practical applications, we generalize our results to the cases of multiple outliers and show that there is a penalty in the error exponents when the number of outliers is unknown.},

  abstract     = {We consider the problem of covert communication with random slot selection over binary-input Discrete Memoryless Channels (DMCs) and Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels, in which a transmitter attempts to reliably communicate with a legitimate receiver while simultaneously maintaining covertness with respect to (w.r.t.) an eavesdropper. Covertness refers to the inability of the eavesdropper to distinguish the transmission of a message from the absence of communication, modeled by the transmission of a fixed channel input. Random slot selection refers to the transmitter‚Äôs ability to send a codeword in a time slot with known boundaries selected uniformly at random among a predetermined number of slots. Our main contribution is to develop bounds for the information-theoretic limit of communication in this model, called the covert capacity, when the number of time slots scales sub-exponentially with the codeword length. Our upper and lower bounds for the covert capacity are within a multiplicative factor of $\sqrt {2}$ independent of the channel. This result partially fills a characterization gap between the covert capacity without random slot selection and the covert capacity with random selection among an exponential number of slots in the codeword length. Our key technical contributions consist of 1) a tight upper bound for the relative entropy characterizing the effect of random slot selection on the covertness constraint in our achievability proof; 2) a careful converse analysis to characterize the maximum allowable weight or power of codewords to meet the covertness constraint. Our results suggest that, unlike the case without random slot selection, the choice of covertness metric does not change the covert capacity in the presence of random slot selection.},

Moreover, our achievability analysis is based on a coded-index strategy, implying that such strategies attain the highest error exponents within the broader class of codes that we consider. We then extend our results to other scaling regimes, including a super-linear number of reads, as well as several low-rate regimes.

  abstract     = {Reliability of sequential hypothesis testing can be greatly improved when the decision maker is given the freedom to adaptively take an action that determines the distribution of the current collected sample. Such advantage of sampling adaptivity has been realized since Chernoff‚Äôs seminal paper in 1959. While a large body of works have explored and investigated the gain of adaptivity, in the general multiple-hypothesis setting, the fundamental limits of individual error probabilities have not been fully understood. In particular, in the asymptotic regime as the expected stopping time tends to infinity, the error exponents are only characterized in specific cases, such as that of the total error probability. In this paper, we consider a general setup of active sequential multiple-hypothesis testing where at each time slot, a temporally varying subset of data sources (out of a known set) emerges from which the decision maker can select to collect samples, subject to a family of expected selection budget constraints. The selection of sources, understood as the ‚Äúaction‚Äù at each time slot, is constrained in a predefined action space. At the end of each time slot, the decision maker either decides to make the inference on the M hypotheses, or continues to observe the data sources for the next time slot. The optimal tradeoffs among $M(M-1)$ types of error exponents are characterized. A companion asymptotically optimal test that strikes the balance between exploration and exploitation is proposed to achieve any target error exponents within the region. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the literature to identify such tradeoffs among error exponents in active sequential hypothesis testing, and it uncovers the tension among different action taking policies even in the basic setting of Chernoff (1959).},

Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multivariate divergences that generalize the R√©nyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences.

If all possible sequences are transmitted with the same probability, then studying the input and output entropies becomes equivalent. For both the 1-deletion and 1-insertion channels, it is shown that among all sequences with a fixed number of runs, the input entropy is minimized for sequences with a skewed distribution of run lengths, and it is maximized for sequences with a balanced distribution of run lengths. Among our results, we establish a conjecture by Atashpendar et al., which claims that for the 1-deletion channel, the input entropy is maximized by the alternating sequences among all binary sequences. This conjecture is also verified for the 2-deletion channel, where it is proved that sequences with a single run minimize the input entropy.},
