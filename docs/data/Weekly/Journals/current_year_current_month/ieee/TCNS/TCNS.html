  abstract     = {This article concerns the distributed observer for the descriptor linear system. Unlike centralized descriptor system observers, in the case of distributed observers, each agent either finds it difficult to independently eliminate impulses, or the observer dynamics after eliminating pulses cannot be implemented. To overcome this issue, this article develops the structure of the distributed observer in two different scenarios, and the observer parameters are presented through a novel design. Moreover, we provide two implementation methods for distributed observer in different scenarios. As a result, each local observer has the ability to reconstruct the states of the underlying system, including its impulse phenomenon. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of our results.},

To achieve Nash equilibrium (NE) in a user-defined prescribed time, a time-varying high-gain function is incorporated into the design. The core challenge lies in applying IC to NE seeking, which complicates the convergence analysis and control design. To address this sticking point, we construct an auxiliary function and propose a Lyapunov function considering second-order dynamics to solve the PTNE seeking problem of PEG. Building upon the results for undirected graphs, we further extend our findings to directed graphs, demonstrating that the proposed method can reach the NE of PEG under IC in the prescribed time. Moreover, we generalize the approach to noncooperative games, indicating that the prescribed-time IC framework can effectively solve the PTNE seeking problem in such competitive scenarios. The numerical simulations validate the practicality of the proposed method.},

A distributed position controller is first developed for each follower quadrotor to ensure the formation tracking to the leader, where cascade estimators consisting of a filter-based dynamics estimator and a fixed-time estimator are exploited to completely counteract the actuator fault and external disturbance. Then, based on the cascade estimators development, by introducing a nonlinear transformation, a robust attitude constrained controller is proposed to guarantee the command attitude tracking singularity free. Stability analysis demonstrates that the closed-loop systems are asymptotically stable. Experiment results further verify and assess the proposed control strategy.},

Traditional approaches involve developing detectors to identify cyber-attacks or implementing passive defense strategies, such as encrypting communication channels and using firewalls. Differently, in this article, we address the challenge of securing CPS against unauthorized observers, which aims to estimate the system states by eavesdropping on system input and output. An active defense strategy, called misleading unauthorized observer, that modifies input–output signals in order to mislead the unauthorized observer, is introduced. These modifications are additional signals undetectable by innovation-based or residual-based detectors and designed with the aim of arbitrarily increasing the estimation error at the unauthorized observer side. For this purpose, system properties required for guaranteeing the existence of such a defense strategy are stated. Then, the design of these additional signals is formulated as an optimization problem with undetectability constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations of a moving body in the XY plane, demonstrating how the active defending system successfully misleads the unauthorized observer.},

The error in attitude estimation converges asymptotically to a common orientation among multiple rigid body systems, based on relative attitude measurements under undirected graphs. To eliminate the reliance on direct angular velocity measurements, a cascaded estimation scheme is proposed, employing indirect angular velocity estimation through a single vector measurement that is readily accessible using accelerometers or magnetometers. An event-triggered condition, grounded in clock variables, is proposed to reduce the communication and computation requirements associated with the attitude estimation. Subsequently, a rigorous convergence analysis of the attitude estimation errors is conducted, relying upon a stability criterion of invariant sets for cascade-connected systems. Furthermore, a self-triggered condition is developed to overcome the challenge of continuous monitoring throughout the event detection process. Ultimately, the efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through a numerical simulation encompassing multiple small satellites.},

Our approach leverages the notion of privacy to add noise to the agents' states, ensuring that individual contributions are masked while still enabling the detection of malicious behavior. We present a detailed analysis of the privacy–accuracy tradeoff and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations. The results show that our reputation-based consensus method with privacy guarantees offers robustness against attacks while preserving the privacy of participants, making it a promising solution for privacy-conscious resilient distributed systems.},

That is, a channel for which its use is switched between the multiple output feedback control loops. We then extend the study to the case of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constrained transmission of the actuation signal through an AWN multiple access channel (MAC). For both channel approaches, we consider first the regulation problem (with setpoint set to zero) and then include in the analysis the potential effect of a nonzero setpoint signal on the resulting SNR constraints. We conclude that, in terms of the minimal required SNR, the AWN MAC channel option is, in general, preferable over the switched AWN channel option if linear co-design of the encoder and decoder is available.},

We consider that the communications are affected by time-varying delays and the vehicles lack velocity measurements. The desired control objective is that all the vehicles converge to a given desired formation and that they reach a consensus on the localization of the center of such formation and on their orientations. The control architecture exploits several features. From a control viewpoint, the systems’ dynamics are split into their angular-motion and linear-motion parts, so each of these is driven by a separate distributed dynamic output-feedback controller, passively interconnected to the plant via a virtual spring. From a network-topology viewpoint, the overall networked system contains two layers of interconnections with undirected graphs. Finally, from an analytical viewpoint, each vehicle-controller closed-loop system may be regarded as a cascade with a $\boldsymbol{\delta }$-persistently exciting interconnection, which ensures the achievement of the control goal, in spite of the nonholonomic constraints.},

  abstract     = {Statistical diversity is a property of data distribution and can hinder the optimization of a decentralized network. However, the theoretical limitations of the Push-SUM protocol reduce the performance in handling the statistical diversity of optimization algorithms based on it. In this article, we theoretically and empirically reduce the negative impact of statistical diversity on decentralized optimization using the Push-SUM protocol. Specifically, we propose the adaptive weighting Push-SUM protocol, a theoretical generalization of the original Push-SUM protocol, where the latter is a special case of the former. Our theoretical analysis shows that, with sufficient communication, the upper bound on the consensus distance for the new protocol reduces to $O(1/N)$, whereas it remains at $O(1)$ for the Push-SUM protocol. We adopt stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum SGD on the new protocol and prove that the convergence rate of these two algorithms to statistical diversity is $O(N/T)$ on the new protocol, while it is $O(Nd/T)$ on the Push-SUM protocol, where $d$ is the parameter size of the training model. To address statistical diversity in practical applications of the new protocol, we develop the Moreau weighting method for its generalized weight matrix definition. This method, derived from the Moreau envelope, is an approximate optimization of the distance penalty of the Moreau envelope. We verify that the adaptive weighting Push-SUM protocol is practically more efficient than the Push-SUM protocol via deep learning experiments.},

The proposed algorithm includes three crucial points, i.e., proximal-point regularizer, primal-dual method, and inertial update rule. For the first point, we use a proximal quadratic-form term to regularize the Lagrangian function to maintain the strong-convex property for the primal and dual subproblems. Then, a primal-dual method is adopted to update the predicted solutions of primal and dual subproblems, which are subsequently corrected by an inertial update rule. An alternating iterative procedure is carried out between the primal-dual method and the inertial update rule to find the optimal solution. We present the convergence analysis based on the strongly convex characteristic of the proximal operator and the saddle-point theorem and prove that our algorithm has the worst case $\mathcal {O}({1}/{k})$ convergence rate for the general nonsmooth convex optimization problems. Furthermore, we present an algorithmic extension of PCPM to solve the separable convex optimization problems.

  abstract     = {In this article, to effectively implement the environmental monitoring mission around the perimeter of a rocky area, a prescribed performance control (PPC) scheme is proposed for an underactuted surface vehicle–underactuted aerial vehicle system using the robust bounded compensating technique (RBCT). First, a grid cell guidance law is introduced for rocky area scanning, considering the heterogeneous system's differing maneuverability. The grid cell undergoes a comprehensive calculation process to ensure that it meets operational requirements. Subsequently, a prescribed performance control scheme based on the RBCT is proposed to reduce design and computational complexity. A novel prescribed performance function is developed to regulate transient performance and initial errors. The RBCT is employed not only to eliminate system uncertainties but also to resolve the “calculation explosion” problem, thereby simplifying the control design. The system's global stability is proved via Lyapunov theory. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the PPC-RBCT scheme.},

In such scenarios, asymptotic leader-following requires employing discontinuous robust mechanisms to cope with unknown parts of the neighbors' trajectories, leading to chattering in the followers' inputs. Few studies have already addressed asymptotic leader-following with continuous control inputs; however, they require the communication topology to be undirected, which is a restrictive assumption in leader-following. In this article, asymptotic dynamic leader-following in Euler–Lagrangian multiagent systems is addressed. We assume that the leader's control input is determined by the leader locally and is unknown to the followers. The contribution of this article is that whereas the unknown input and model of the neighboring agents are compensated by a robust mechanism in the followers' control strategy, the continuity in the followers' control inputs is guaranteed, and the interaction in the network is under directed topologies. Simulation results for a network of manipulator robots illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.},

First, because of the nonlinearity and uncertainty of multimicrogrid interconnected systems, the relevant model information cannot be fully obtained. To realize the design of the algorithm under the assumption that the model information is unknown, the equivalent functional relationship between the control signal and the area-control-error signal is established by using a dynamic linearization technique. Then, a data-driven control algorithm with time delays is developed, in which a tracking differentiator is designed to obtain the derivative value of the system output signal for the improved model free adaptive structure. On this basis, to reduce the computation and communication burden of the multimicrogrid system, an event-triggered mechanism is proposed. The stability of the system is analyzed by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, simulation results in a three-area multimicrogrid interconnected system verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Existing distributed online algorithms solving this problem require that each agent broadcasts its decision to its neighbors at each iteration. However, communication resources are often limited. To better utilize communication resources, we propose a distributed event-triggered online primal–dual algorithm with two-point bandit feedback. Under several classes of appropriately chosen decreasing parameter sequences and nonincreasing event-triggered threshold sequences, we establish dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation bounds. These bounds are comparable to the results achieved by distributed event-triggered online algorithms with full-information feedback.

In networked control systems, the controller generates control inputs based on sampled data to ensure the safety and stability of the plant. However, the combined effects of quantization and time-varying delay introduced by digital communication networks have rarely been considered in safety-critical control. This article develops sufficient conditions for the design of safety and stabilizing control laws and provides explicit safety and input-to-state stability thresholds for networked control systems. In addition, we present provable extensions that can cope with the network-induced challenges mentioned above. In the context of periodic event-triggered mechanism, we formulate optimal control problems with constraints in the form of high-order control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions. Finally, we apply the proposed strategy to adaptive cruise control, and illustrate that the event-based control approach effectively reduces communication traffic while achieving the control objectives.},

  abstract     = {To estimate accurate voltage phasors from inaccurate voltage magnitude and complex power measurements, the standard approach is to iteratively refine a good initial guess using the Gauss–Newton method. However, the nonconvexity of the estimation makes the Gauss–Newton method sensitive to its initial guess, so human intervention is needed to detect convergence to plausible but ultimately spurious estimates. This article makes a novel connection between the angle estimation subproblem and phase synchronization to yield two key benefits: first, an exceptionally high-quality initial guess over the angles, known as a spectral initialization, and second, a correctness guarantee for the estimated angles, known as a global optimality certificate. These are formulated as sparse eigenvalue–eigenvector problems, which we efficiently compute in time comparable to a few Gauss–Newton iterations. Our experiments on the complete set of Polish, PEGASE, and RTE models show, where voltage magnitudes are already reasonably accurate, that spectral initialization provides an almost-perfect single-shot estimation of $n$ angles from $2n$ moderately noisy bus power measurements (i.e., $n$ pairs of PQ measurements), whose correctness becomes guaranteed after a single Gauss–Newton iteration. For less-accurate voltage magnitudes, the performance of the method degrades gracefully; even with moderate voltage magnitude errors, the estimated voltage angles remain surprisingly accurate.},

In addition, this study considers the energy consumption of an HVAC system that is governed by the regulated indoor temperatures within its zones and addresses the dynamics of the temperatures, presenting a noncooperative Nash game involving players with dynamic models in the context of a multizone HVAC systems connected by a strongly connected communication network. The dynamics of the indoor temperature in each zone is affected by the outside environment, the external thermal disturbance, and the temperatures in its neighboring zones. The disturbances we consider are general bounded disturbances with unknown bounds. Furthermore, we also consider temperature constraints in individual zones to accommodate the requirements of the HVAC users. Consequently, the distributed estimator approach, the adaptive control method, and the projected gradient-based technique are integrated to address all these considerations.

Thus, based on the susceptible–infected–susceptible compartmental model, this study proposes a susceptible–infected–exhausted–susceptible model that includes an enhanced transition pathway of the malware state. Subsequently, considering the potential heterogeneity of network topology and pulse wave attacks (PA), three additional models are expanded upon. Concurrently, the dynamic stability analyses of these four models have been conducted to verify the practicality of effective control by malicious attackers (MA) and network defenders (ND) within these frameworks to achieve their respective benefits. Finally, based on the framework of optimal control and game theory, we discuss and simulate attack–defense confrontation under various scenarios, including different objective functions, network topologies, control forms, and parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that in most cases, MA refrained from launching malicious attacks but continued malware propagation. Under certain conditions, malware may remain in a dormant state indefinitely. Meanwhile, ND consistently engages in network repair regardless of MA's actions. MA's revenue peaks when launching continuous-time attacks in the financial network, while ND's revenue is at its lowest. In the majority of instances, under PA and higher operation costs, MA's efficacy is lower, while ND performs better.},

It has been exploited for adaptive output feedback control of uncertain nonlinear systems in the literature; however, the controller must partially reside at the plant side where computation capacity is required. In this article, all controller components are moved to the controller side, and their dynamics use sampled states rather than continuous ones with the benefit of directly estimating the next triggering instance of some conditions and avoiding constantly checking the event condition at the controller side. However, these bring two major challenges. First, the virtual input designed in the dynamic filtering technique for stabilization is no longer differentiable. Second, the plant output is sampled to transmit at the plant side and sampled again at the controller side to construct the controller, and the two asynchronous samplings make the analysis more involved. This article solves these two issues by introducing a new state observer to simplify the adaptive law, a set of continuous companion variables for stability analysis, and a new lemma quantifying the error bound between the actual output signal and the sampled transmitted output. It is theoretically guaranteed that all internal signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally bounded and the output is practically stabilized to the origin.

The challenge is to address secure formation tracking and communication bandwidth-saving issues simultaneously. To tackle this, we propose a switching-like event-triggered mechanism that reduces excessive bandwidth consumption during interactions among multiple followers under DoS attacks. The triggering condition is allowed to be switched during the intervals when attacks are activated, ensuring that triggering can normally occur throughout the overall time interval by introducing an auxiliary variable depending on the success of the latest trigger moment. Based on this approach, we construct an event-based time-varying formation control scheme. In addition, we establish sufficient conditions that reveal the relationship between exponential stability and the frequency/duration of the DoS attacks. Unlike other single-leader methods, a significant feature of the formation control scheme is its ability to achieve the desired formation tracking for multiagent systems with multiple leaders. Finally, the validity of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation and experimental results.},

To address this, we explore two spatial out-of-order scenarios, focusing on enhancing state estimation precision. For the random out-of-order scenario, characterized by unpredictable sensor data sequences, we propose an accumulative measurement approach and introduce two algorithms to restore data order, thereby improving state estimation accuracy. In the fixed out-of-order scenario, where a consistent but unknown pattern exists, our two algorithms efficiently restore measurement order within a limited time frame.

  abstract     = {This article formulates a predefined-time multiagent approach to distributed nonconvex constrained optimization and tackles the challenges caused by the nonconvexity and nonlinearly coupled information. The divergence caused by nonconvexity is handled by utilizing a momentum-based system, and the distributed computation of nonlinearly coupled optimization information, as well as the distributed comparison of global function values, is dealt with by introducing estimation state variables. Then, combined with time-base generators, the proposed multiagent system is proven to be stable at a local optimal solution within a predefined time. The simulations of a chiller system and a numerical example are elaborated to verify and demonstrate the enhanced stability, predefined-time convergence, and distributed computation capability of the proposed multiagent approach.},

Drawing on gradient tracking technique and projection method, a fixed-step distributed optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the multirobot formation problem.

We first formulate the scheduling problem as a mixed-integer convex program (MICP), then propose an efficient polynomial time relaxation–adjustment–rounding algorithm for solving the problem. The key novelty of the proposed method lies in its adjustment step, which uses a graph-based algorithm to navigate within the set of optimal points of the convex relaxation while reducing the number of fractional entries in the solution. We establish mathematically that our algorithm yields solutions that are near optimal for a finite number of loads and with its suboptimality independent of the number of loads. Consequently, the proposed method is asymptotically optimal in a per-load cost sense when the number of loads increases. Despite the gap between the MICP and its convex relaxation, we establish that the solution of the proposed algorithm can be decentralized by marginal prices of the convex relaxation. We also develop and analyze variants of the proposed algorithm for settings with uncertainty and with time-varying realistic load shapes. Finally, we numerically evaluate the proposed algorithm in a case study for the nonpreemptive scheduling of electric vehicles charging loads.},

  abstract     = {This article proposes a distributed safety-critical optimal flocking control algorithm for the multiagent system. In general, safety (i.e., collision avoidance) could be guaranteed by the use of a control barrier function (CBF) as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, the existence of conflicting safety constraints from multiple agents could lead to a feasibility problem (i.e., the absence of a feasible control command) in distributed optimal flocking control algorithms. To deal with this issue, we propose two effective feasibility enhancement approaches. First, we develop a high-order CBF associated with the collision risk to alleviate the burden of distributed safety constraints on agents with a high risk of collision. Second, to enhance feasibility, a relaxation method is used to enlarge the allowable control space of agents. In particular, to decrease the number of optimization variables in the relaxation method, a selective strategy is adopted. This involves applying the relaxation method only to specific CBF based on the decision variable related to the overlap of admissible control spaces among agents. Numerical simulations demonstrate the superiority and validity of the proposed optimal flocking algorithm compared with existing approaches.},

The leaders perform trajectory scaling in order to cope with the velocity limits of the single robots. Once the trajectories for the centroid and the formation are estimated, each agent can compute its own reference trajectory and a local control loop is designed to track it. An approach to mapping the velocity constraints of each agent to the velocity limits at the task level is developed. Then, a trajectory-scaling algorithm is adopted to ensure velocity constraint fulfillment. The stability and performance properties are rigorously analyzed under two different assumptions about the planned trajectories. Finally, both simulation and experiments are run on the Robotarium platform to show the effectiveness of the approach and the effect of parameter tuning on the achieved performance.},

To tackle such a problem, the model-based distributed control scheme is developed via distributed continuous observer design. Subsequently, the data-driven distributed control scheme is proposed, which comprises a compensation term, an optimal feedback term, and a feedforward term. Specifically, a new kind of distributed adaptive continuous observers is first constructed based on the adaptive control theory to estimate the leader's state, output, and plant matrices, the off-policy learning method is then employed to seek the optimal control gain and identify the unknown system dynamics, thereby facilitating the construction of the control protocols.

First, in communication-based networks, AUVs are allowed to transmit information via communication devices. A dynamic control law consisting of a distributed estimator is proposed.

Second, in communication-denied networks, AUVs depend only on the relative measurements from the onboard sensors. A dynamic control law consisting of a decentralized estimator is proposed.

In the proposed network model, node dynamics are nonlinear and defined by a tractable realization of the mixed-feedback structure. Coupling between nodes is also nonlinear and defined by a tractable abstraction of synaptic coupling between neurons. We derive constructive conditions under which the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix fully and explicitly determine both the emergence of a stable network rhythm and its detailed rhythmic profile, i.e., the pattern of relative oscillation amplitudes and phase differences. Our theoretical developments are grounded on ideas from dominant systems and bifurcation theory. They provide a new framework for the analysis and design of nonlinear network rhythms.},

If the hypergraph's hyperedges further connect the same number of vertices, it is said to be uniform. In algebraic graph theory, a graph can be characterized by an adjacency matrix, and similarly, a uniform hypergraph can be characterized by an adjacency tensor. This similarity enables us to extend existing tools of matrix analysis for studying dynamical systems evolving on graphs to the study of a class of polynomial dynamical systems evolving on hypergraphs utilizing the properties of tensors. To be more precise, in this article, we first extend the concept of a Metzler matrix to a Metzler tensor and then describe some useful properties of such tensors. Next, we focus on positive systems on hypergraphs associated with Metzler tensors. More importantly, we design control laws to stabilize the origin of this class of Metzler positive systems on hypergraphs. In the end, we apply our findings to two classic dynamical systems: a higher order Lotka–Volterra population dynamics system and a higher order SIS epidemic dynamic process. The corresponding novel stability results are accompanied by ample numerical examples.},

For the heterogeneous agents involving nonlinear underactuated coupled dynamics and limited communication capabilities, a unified event-triggered data-driven control method is proposed, including a distributed event-triggered observer for interaction data recovery under DoS attacks and robust controllers to achieve distributed formation. The control policies and disturbances, including couplings and external disturbances, are modeled as performance optimizers and adversarial players in the zero-sum game. Robust optimal policies are obtained by developing off-policy reinforcement learning without information on system dynamical parameters. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system under DoS attacks, and Zeno behavior for all agents can be excluded. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is validated by presenting two simulation examples of a distributed heterogeneous formation.},

  abstract     = {Exploiting the underlying structure of optimization programs has unlocked computational gains and, in some cases, enabled distributed solution methods. One should expect that this structure can be similarly exploited for other important tasks, such as differentiation. Differentiating through optimization programs has in fact attracted much interest and led to numerous applications, from optimization-based layers in machine learning models to complex design problems formulated as bilevel programs. However, existing differentiation methodologies rarely leverage problem structure. In this work, we propose an efficient framework for computing gradients of constraint-coupled optimization problems. Gradients are decomposed into local components—computed in a distributed manner—and a coupling term—handled by a central coordinator. This centralized framework achieves significant computational gains, especially for large systems, and we provide sufficient conditions to ensure its validity. Building on this, we develop a decentralized algorithm—eliminating the need for a central coordinator—by leveraging the exponential decay of sensitivities in graph-structured problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the decentralized scheme allows for accurate and efficient estimation of important emissions metrics on large dynamic power system models.},

An event-triggered distributed two-stage fusion estimation method is proposed for the clustered sensor network. Specifically, a local fusion estimator is first constructed to fuse multirate measurements transmitted through small-scale fading channels. The parameters of the estimator are computed by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, the event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is utilized to adjust the transmission frequency of local estimates, aiming to conserve the energy of cluster heads. Furthermore, by solving a min–max optimization problem, a global fusion estimator is designed to fuse the local estimates in the presence of the ETM and large-scale fading channels. Sufficient conditions for the stochastic ultimate boundedness of both local and global estimation errors are derived by leveraging differential game theory and LMIs. The comparison simulation results on a dc-power network show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

Due to the unobservable influence of other subsystems and the noise, it is difficult for local subsystems to achieve convergent identification under local observations. This article proposes a distributed identification algorithm for local subsystems to identify their parameter matrices under local observation with a guarantee of convergence. We obtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of local identification. We prove that by injecting an independent random signal to the local subsystem, which is easy to implement, using a simple least-squares method to identify local systems can achieve convergent identification for a certain probability. Meanwhile, we give the minimal level of variance of the injected signal that can still guarantee the convergence of the identification. Next, we add the designed input as a vector of Gaussian noises with decreasing variance to a known controller, proving that it can converge to the original controller. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

Our method employs a distributed projected gradient play approach alongside consensus dynamics, with individual agents minimizing their local costs through gradient steps and local information exchange with neighbors via a time-varying directed communication network. Addressing time-varying directed graphs presents significant challenges. Existing methods often circumvent this by focusing on static graphs or specific types of directed graphs or by requiring the stepsizes to scale with the Perron–Frobenius eigenvectors. In contrast, we establish novel results that provide a contraction property for the mixing terms associated with time-varying row-stochastic weight matrices. Our approach explicitly expresses the contraction coefficient based on the characteristics of the weight matrices and graph connectivity structures, rather than implicitly through the second-largest singular value of the weight matrix as in prior studies. The established results facilitate proving geometric convergence of the proposed algorithm and advance convergence analysis for distributed algorithms in time-varying directed communication networks. Numerical results on a Nash–Cournot game demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

For a NET-SCS, the propagation of nonlinear statistics of the network communication status brought up by deterministic thresholds makes the precise computation of ACR difficult. Previous work used to oversimplify the computation using a Gaussian distribution without incorporating this nonlinearity, leading to sacrificed precision. This article proposes a novel approach to calculate the exact ACR for a NET-SCS using a recursive model. We use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information. The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental studies. Our work is promising to benefit the efficient resource planning of networked control systems with limited communication resources by providing accurate ACR computation.},

  abstract     = {This work studies efficient centralized solution methods for cluster-based control policies of transition-independent Markov decision processes (TI-MDPs). We focus on control of multiagent systems, whereby a central planner influences agents to select desirable group behavior. The agents are partitioned into disjoint clusters whereby agents in the same cluster receive the same controls but agents in different clusters may receive different controls. Under mild assumptions, this process can be modeled as a TI-Markov decision process (MDP) where each factor describes the behavior of one cluster. The action space of the TI-MDP becomes exponential with respect to the number of clusters. To efficiently find a policy in this rapidly scaling space, we propose a clustered Bellman operator that optimizes over the action space for one cluster at any evaluation. We present clustered value iteration (CVI), which uses this operator to iteratively perform “round robin” optimization across the clusters. CVI converges exponentially faster than standard value iteration (VI), and can find policies that closely approximate the MDP’s true optimal value. A special class of TI-MDPs with separable reward functions is investigated, and it is shown that CVI will find optimal policies for this class of problems. Finally, the optimal clustering assignment problem is explored. The value functions TI-MDPs with submodular reward functions are shown to be submodular functions, so submodular set optimization may be used to find a near-optimal clustering assignment. We propose an iterative greedy cluster splitting algorithm, which yields monotonic submodular improvement in value at each iteration. Finally, simulations offer an empirical assessment of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates impulsive security protocols with the goal of achieving consensus of fractional-order fuzzy multiagent systems (FOFMASs). In contrast to multiagent systems characterized by ordinary differential equations, FOFMASs are created using Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy rules and fractional-order differential equations, which allow for nonlinearities with parameter uncertainties and also manage memory effects. Due to the potential of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the topology among nodes may change, and it is necessary to gain insight into the security consensus under topology switching. This article tackles the security protocol problem by designing a distributed impulsive control for each agent, relying on global delayed communications and topology switching resulting from DoS attacks. Analyzing the stability of impulse-free error systems is a salient problem. Supported by the Lyapunov method and average impulsive interval method, for two cases of self-stabilization or instability of the error system in the absence of impulse, some sufficient conditions are presented to ensure the exponential consensus of FOFMASs under distributed impulsive control with communication delays. Besides, several corollaries are provided to guarantee the consensus under distributed impulsive control without communication delays. Finally, two numerical examples are provided, and some numerical simulations are given to confirm the efficacy of the theoretical findings.},

We propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions, and hence, distributed NE seeking is impossible.},

Our key contribution is deriving the distributed evidence lower bound (DELBO) from the centralized estimation objective, whose separable structure enables distributed inference with one-hop sensor communication. The DELBO consists of observation likelihood and divergences to prior estimates, and the gap in the measurement evidence is ascribed to consensus and modeling errors. For supervised learning, we design a DELBO-maximizing online distributed algorithm and specialize it to Gaussian variational densities with nonlinear likelihoods. We extend the resulting distributed Gaussian variational inference updates via diagonalized and 1-rank covariance inversions for high-dimensional estimates and apply it to multirobot probabilistic mapping using indoor LiDAR data.},
