  abstract     = {With the rapid evolution of wireless technologies, the deep integration of sensing, communication and computation has heralded a novel and promising paradigm. In this paper, we propose a secure beamforming design framework for integrated sensing, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication and over-the-air computation (AirComp) networks, which can provide multi-functional intelligent services for communication-intensive, computation-intensive, delay-sensitive and security-sensitive applications. In the considered network, each dual-functional intelligent device engages in NOMA information transmission and AirComp. Meanwhile, the triple-functional base station conducts target sensing, NOMA signal decoding and data aggregation simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of NOAM devices while ensuring that the quality of service requirements for both sensing and AirComp are met within the transmit power constraints imposed on all nodes. The formulated optimization problem involves coupled variables and logarithmic determinant, thus it is highly non-convex. To solve it, we propose an efficient matrix-extended generalized Lagrangian dual transformation based algorithm with penalty method, which can obtain the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution to the original problem with low-complexity and convergence guarantee. Additionally, the well-known successive convex approximation based algorithm is also employed to address the formulated SSR maximization problem. However, its computational complexity significantly exceeds that of our proposed algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the performance improvement of our proposal compared with the benchmark approaches.},

  abstract     = {Finger vein recognition offers significant advantages in biometric authentication, while federated learning addresses data silo challenges in distributed environments. However, label noise issues severely impact recognition performance due to variations in data acquisition environments, fluctuations in user registration quality, and privacy constraints preventing centralized annotation review. Existing label noise research typically focuses on sample-level processing, overlooking quality variations between authentication systems and noise distribution characteristics across multiple source devices. This paper proposes FedRDA, a federated optimization framework that achieves precise identification and adaptive correction of noisy samples through a three-tier progressive mechanism. We first construct a hierarchical noise detection system that identifies label noise from both noisy client and noisy sample perspectives. Then, we design a dynamic pseudo-label learning module with an improved adaptive label ambiguation loss function that dynamically adjusts sample learning difficulty parameters and incorporates momentum update mechanisms, significantly enhancing model adaptability to label noise of varying difficulty, while integrating predictive uncertainty entropy with unsupervised consistency constraints for more accurate label correction. Finally, we propose an adaptive aggregation strategy based on distance awareness and gradient consistency metrics to address data isolation and label noise issues in distributed environments. Experiments on SDUMLA, MMCBNU_6000, FV-USM, and combined datasets demonstrate that FedRDA maintains high model accuracy even under high noise rate conditions, with approximately 14% accuracy improvement over existing methods. The proposed framework effectively mitigates the negative impact of label noise on model training, ensuring robust operation of finger vein recognition systems in practical distributed environments while protecting user privacy.},

  abstract     = {Person Re-identification (ReID) primarily involves the extraction of discriminative representations derived from morphological characteristics, gait patterns, and related attributes. While camera-based Person ReID methods yield notable results, their reliability diminishes in scenarios involving long distances and limited illumination. LiDAR enables the precise acquisition of human point cloud sequences across extended distances, unaffected by variations in lighting or similar factors. Nevertheless, current LiDAR-based Person ReID techniques are limited to static measurements, rendering them susceptible to perturbations from attire variations, occlusions, and similar confounding factors. To address these issues, this manuscript introduces MOJO, which is applied to 4D LiDAR point clouds to extract unique motion patterns specific to individuals. To characterize the motion patterns across two consecutive point cloud frames, MOJO employs optimal transport to compute point-wise motion vectors, thereby enabling the identification of discriminative implicit motion information. To mitigate the attenuation of point cloud density induced by self-occlusion during dynamic motion, MOJO leverages inverse point-wise flow information to integrate forward frames, thereby yielding a comprehensive representation, whilst concurrently ameliorating the effects of heterogeneous density distribution within localized regions of the 4D point cloud data. Additionally, the inherent unordered nature and sparsity of 4D point clouds present significant obstacles to capturing discriminative features. We develop the 3D joint graph to extract scalable fine-grained traits and employ the joint pyramid pooling module to conduct hierarchical spatiotemporal aggregation across the 4D point clouds. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that MOJO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on the LReID dataset (for LiDAR-based Person Re-identification) and SUSTech1k dataset (for LiDAR-based Gait Recognition) without any pre-training while exhibiting robust performance across various point cloud densities.

  abstract     = {Transfer-based adversarial attacks pose a severe threat to real-world deep learning systems since they do not require access to target models. Adversarial training (AT), which is recognized as the most effective defense against white-box attacks, also ensures high robustness against (black-box) transfer-based attacks. However, AT suffers from significant computational overhead because it repeatedly generates adversarial examples (AEs) throughout the entire training process. In this paper, we demonstrate that such repeated generation is unnecessary to achieve robustness against transfer-based attacks. Instead, pre-generating AEs all at once before training is sufficient, as proposed in our new defense paradigm called Data-Centric Robust Training (DCRT). DCRT employs clean data augmentation and adversarial data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset before training. Our experimental results show that DCRT outperforms widely-used AT techniques (e.g., PGD-AT, TRADES, EAT, and FAT) in terms of transfer-based black-box robustness and even surpasses the top-1 defense on RobustBench when combined with common model-centric techniques. We also highlight additional benefits of DCRT, such as improved training efficiency and class-wise fairness. Our code will be available on GitHub.},

  abstract     = {As Ethereum confronts increasingly sophisticated fraud threats, recent research seeks to improve fraud account detection by leveraging advanced pre-trained Transformer or self-supervised graph neural network. However, current Transformer-based methods rely on context-independent, numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings. Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive linguistic representations, and leverages language modeling to learn transaction semantics. To clearly characterize the semantic differences between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training objective, which, together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective, learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning, which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on reconstructing account node features rather than graph structure. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising training quality. Additionally, we initialize the account nodes in the graph with expert-engineered features to inject empirical and statistical knowledge into the model. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results show that our method improves the F1-score by over 10% at most compared with the best baseline. Furthermore, we observe from three datasets that the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization ability compared to previous work.

However, protecting users’ privacy while handling diverse sparse patterns in contexts with a large dimension size $d$ poses significant challenges for efficient and privacy-preserving data aggregation. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an optimized $k$ -sparse vector mean estimation scheme under Local Differential Privacy (LDP), ensuring that each user’s entire set of up to $k$ private values from $\{-1, 1\}$ satisfies $\varepsilon $ -LDP. Specifically, our proposed scheme employs a seed mining technique in conjunction with PRNG Randomizer, which allows users to send their data only once while enabling the server to accurately estimate any value’s mean in the domain. Our scheme achieves an asymptotically optimal per-coordinate error of $O\left ({{\frac {1}{\varepsilon \sqrt {n}} }}\right)$ , equivalent to that of a 1-sparse case, while also ensuring efficient communication costs. The communication cost remains at a minimal level of $O(1)$ (only 2 bytes per user’s report) for smaller $k$ values and scales to $O(k)$ for larger $k$ , due to efficient binning strategies. Extensive experimental results confirm that our results align with theoretical expectations, demonstrating that our scheme not only preserves user privacy but also ensures higher accuracy compared to other schemes.},

OTAuth provides a more secure and convenient alternative to password-based and Short Message Service (SMS)-based authentication schemes. Consequently, the OTAuth service has been adopted by numerous Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) worldwide. However, a high severity vulnerability remains unaddressed in the OTAuth service, which allows an attacker to access a victim’s various app accounts, posing a significant risk to user privacy and data security. In this paper, we present LoadShow, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first security-enhanced OTAuth scheme to address this vulnerability. We propose a novel dynamic application identification technique that aims to address the root cause of this vulnerability, i.e., the inability of MNOs to distinguish between different applications on the same device. Specifically, application identification is based on the hardware load side-channel and captures the unique CPU and GPU load characteristics of applications through the sequence of timing values of fingerprinting functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of LoadShow by accuracy, False Positive Rate (FPR), and True Positive Rate (TPR). We also evaluate its multi-platform compatibility on devices with different architectures and models. LoadShow achieves over 90% accuracy, with a TPR exceeding 90% and an FPR below 1%. The evaluation results demonstrate LoadShow’s capability to effectively differentiate between applications on a device, defend against app impersonation attacks, and reliably identify legitimate applications.},

  abstract     = {Cloud computing has become the predominant platform for data sharing due to its adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and ability to scale resources according to user demand. Ensuring secure and efficient data sharing has long been a central research focus, with attribute-based encryption (ABE) serving as a key cryptographic primitive. In real-world scenarios, user attributes often change, necessitating timely revocation of access rights. Common user revocation methods include direct and indirect revocation. Direct revocation is controlled by the data owner, who adds revocation information to a list and embeds it into ciphertext to revoke permissions. Indirect revocation is managed by an authorized authority or delegated third party, dynamically publishing revocation information and generating new keys and ciphertexts. Conventional direct and indirect revocation methods incur substantial communication and computation overheads, limiting their practical effectiveness, particularly in environments with frequent user access terminations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel puncturable ciphertext-policy ABE scheme based on lattice cryptography for user revocation, eliminating the need for key regeneration and revocation-list maintenance. The proposed approach effectively resists collusion, quantum, and chosen-plaintext attacks, and experimental evaluations demonstrate its advantages in storage consumption, communication cost, and computational overhead.},

  abstract     = {With the popularity of cross-chain transactions in heterogeneous blockchain systems, scalability has become a critical challenge. To overcome this, researchers propose to establish virtual channels, which move cross-chain transactions off the blockchain, enabling instant transaction confirmation between users and improving the system throughput. However, existing off-chain cross-chain transaction schemes encounter the following issues: (i) they are incompatible with non-Turing complete blockchain systems; (ii) they are incapable of accessing authentic information from blockchain systems. These issues have a dual impact on the cross-chain transaction, affecting its compatibility and dispute resolutions among mutually distrustful users. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces SightCVC, a novel cross-chain payment protocol. The core of SightCVC is a new smart contract, which facilitates unrestricted off-chain transactions among mutually distrustful users in heterogeneous blockchain systems. It only requires off-chain protocol of the blockchain system involved in the transactions to support a Turing complete scripting language, which resolves the compatibility issue. Meanwhile, it can securely retrieve the real information from the blockchain systems, significantly improving the effectiveness of dispute resolution and enforcing the privacy of cross-chain transactions. We conduct a thorough security analysis within the Universal Composability framework to validate that SightCVC can achieve consensus at each stage. We implement and deploy SightCVC on the experimental networks of Ripple and Ethereum. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SightCVC is able to effectively handle the disputes and reduce the system costs by approximately 64% compared to existing solutions. Its superiority becomes more evidence when the number of transactions increases.},

Next, integrated distributed hybrid controller with time-varying noise injection is designed, enabling agents to interact with sensitive information only at sampling instants, thereby preserving privacy while maintaining trajectory availability. Then, the time-varying step-size and noise parameters, which are tunable parameters of the dual control mechanism corresponding to the desired $\varepsilon $ -differential privacy budget and system convergence accuracy are proposed, and the trade-off between control performance and privacy preservation is thoroughly analyzed. It is shown that the proposed protocol achieves asymptotically unbiased mean-square output consensus with predefined accuracy and privacy budget.

  abstract     = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices generates substantial data that supports deep learning, significantly advancing intelligent specific emitter identification (SEI) technology. However, challenges such as labeling costs and privacy concerns limit the availability of labeled samples, thereby constraining the training of deep models. To address this problem, this paper focuses on enhancing the data manifold structure through deep feature information, proposing a semi-supervised SEI method named SSME. A well-structured manifold enables the model to capture underlying patterns and relationships within the data more effectively, leading to more accurate and generalizable classification boundaries. First, to maximize the use of supervision information from limited labeled samples, we design a supervised cross-class contrastive (SCCC) loss, which increases the feature distance between anchor samples and cross-class samples based on their labels, achieving better manifold separation of different categories. Second, we propose an instance neighborhood matching regularization (INMR) loss that captures the neighborhood of weakly and strongly augmented samples of unlabeled instances within the feature space. By aligning these neighborhood representations, neighborhood-to-neighborhood consistency learning is achieved, enhancing the structural consistency and smoothness of local manifolds. Evaluated on ADS-B and XSRP datasets across diverse settings, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches. Notably, even with only five labeled samples per class, it surpasses supervised baselines by 24.82% and 12.55% on the respective datasets.},

While existing research has advanced SSOs identification and classification, there remains a significant gap in systematically understanding how these objects can be effectively exploited in real-world security analysis. To address this challenge, we present PREXP, a novel approach to analyzing SSOs exploitability and automating the transformation of Proof-of-Concept (PoC) into exploitable states. Our approach encompasses three key techniques: (1) capability analysis and attribute modeling of vulnerable object (2) extraction and filtering of target SSOs and (3) automatically augmenting PoCs with SSO-specific code to create exploitation capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we tested our prototype on 30 public CVEs, successfully parsing vulnerable object in 22 cases (73.3%) and achieving accurate SSO matches in 18 (60.0%). PREXP outperformed state-of-the-art tools such as SCAVY and AlphaEXP in structure-matching, and enabled the generation of new Control Flow Hijacking Primitives (CFHPs) for 3 previously unexploited vulnerabilities, demonstrating its practical value in real-world exploit development.},

  abstract     = {Ethereum serves as the cornerstone for value transfer in Web 3.0, providing a decentralized and efficient trust mechanism for global connectivity. However, the anonymity of Ethereum undermines market regulatory capabilities, leading to frequent malicious behaviors such as Ponzi Scheme, Money Laundering, and Phishing. Therefore, in the face of the diverse and continuously emerging malicious behaviors, implementing fine-grained detection is crucial for maintaining the prosperous development of the blockchain ecosystem. In this paper, we propose FiMAD, a fine-grained and class-incremental malicious account detection framework based on dynamic graph learning. Specifically, we first propose a general graph structure called Dynamic Account Relation Graph (DARG), which dynamically models Ethereum accounts from a continuous-time perspective. Then, we design a cascade graph feature extraction method to capture deep temporal evolution patterns and neighbor interaction features in DARG. Next, we construct a pre-training universal encoder to transform account features into high-dimensional embeddings, followed by fine-tuning the model classifier with a few labeled samples, enabling accurate fine-grained detection and rapid updates for incremental classes. We conduct extensive experiments using real Ethereum data. The results demonstrate that FiMAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in fine-grained detection across five typical scenarios: class-incremental, full data, new malicious accounts, imbalanced data, and binary classification. In the class-incremental scenario, FiMAD improves the Macro-F1 by up to 26.4% compared to SOTA methods.},

Despite their proven effectiveness, recent studies have highlighted challenges faced by DL-based profiled attacks in a more realistic portability threat model, where two devices are used respectively for profiling and the attack. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cross-device attack by incorporating the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to develop a generalized model. Additionally, an adaptive multi-task loss is employed to balance multiple training objectives that respectively focus on model generalization and precision. We evaluate our strategy on five cross-device SCA datasets. The experimental results show that, compared to baseline methods, our approach achieves significantly enhanced performance, as measured by the number of traces required to recover the secret key. Specifically, on a more challenging dataset obtained from three SAKURA-G evaluation boards, our method successfully recovers the secret key using approximately 300 traces, whereas baseline methods fail to guarantee a successful cross-device attack even with 5,000 traces. Furthermore, our method demonstrates remarkably enhanced attack efficiency, reducing attack time by over an hour compared to the baselines.},

The classification of tactics and techniques descriptions in CTI has been extensively studied to assist security experts in interpreting attack patterns. Although many recent studies have applied various deep learning methods to enhance classification performance, they mainly focus on improving performance from an average or top perspective. However, the imbalance between tactical and technical tag samples, as well as text sparsity, may lead to poor model performance, which has been under-explored. To address these issues, we propose a new tactics and techniques classification model based on adversarial contrastive learning and meta-path (TTC-ACLM). In TTC-ACLM, a novel text representation learning module is first designed. It includes pre-trained language model (PLM) and contrastive adversarial methods, which can better adapt to categories with smaller sample sizes while obtaining better text representations. Then, heterogeneous information networks are used to model the rich relationships between texts and labels (tactics and techniques), which can merge additional information, e.g., processes and tools, to address text sparsity. Next, we defined a meta-path based classifier learning module that maps text, tactics, and meta-path based context to a set of classifiers, which are applied to the text representation generated by the text representation module for better classification. Finally, the classification performance is further improved through the tactics and techniques correlation enhancement matrix. Through in-depth research, we demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively address the impact of sample imbalance and text sparsity. Extensive experimental results indicate that TTC-ACLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

  abstract     = {Far Field EM Side-Channel Attacks (FEM-SCAs) have emerged as a realistic security threat to widely deployed RF-integrated IoT edge devices. In mixed-signal chips, side-channel leakage may unintentionally couple with transmission signals and be emitted via the on-chip antenna, potentially allowing adversaries to extract sensitive information from the victim at long distances. However, in practical scenarios, far field EM traces captured at long distances usually suffer from noise and interference, which makes the attack less efficient or sometimes even unfeasible. In this paper, we propose a Domain-Adversarial ReFeature Nueral Network (DAR-NN) to facilitate “noisy-clean” adaptation for far field EM traces captured at long distances. By integrating a DAE model with two deep-learning classifiers as regularization terms, the proposed DAR-NN model can reconstruct features of traces obtained remotely in complex environments, thereby achieving a more efficient FEM-SCA. We first test our model by using a publicly available dataset and show that it is feasible to extract the AES key from 141 traces captured at 15 m distance to the victim, which is 58.7% more efficient than existing methods with 80% less profiling data. Afterwards, we set up a more complex experimental environment with a HackRF radio serving as an interference source. We show that the proposed model can still extract the key by using around 2K traces at 15 m even in the presence of 25% active interference, while the state-of-the-art model fails under same conditions.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of blockchain technology, the widespread adoption of smart contracts—particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications—has introduced significant security challenges, such as reentrancy attacks, phishing, and Sybil attacks. To address these issues, we propose a novel model called TrxGNNBERT, which combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) and the Transformer architecture to effectively handle both graph-structured and textual data. This combination enhances the detection of suspicious transactions and accounts on blockchain platforms like Ethereum. TrxGNNBERT was pre-trained using a masked language model (MLM) on a dataset of 60,000 Ethereum transactions by randomly masking the attributes of nodes and edges, thereby capturing deep semantic relationships and structural information. In this work, we constructed transaction subgraphs, using a GNN module to enrich the embedding representations, which were then fed into a Transformer encoder. The experimental results demonstrate that TrxGNNBERT outperforms various baseline models—including DeepWalk, Trans2Vec, Role2Vec, GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, Zipzap and BERT4ETH—in detecting suspicious transactions and accounts. Specifically, TrxGNNBERT achieved an accuracy of 0.755 and an F1 score of 0.756 on the TrxLarge dataset; an accuracy of 0.903 and an F1 score of 0.894 on the TrxSmall dataset; and an accuracy of 0.790 and an F1 score of 0.781 on the AddrDec dataset. We also explored different pre-training configurations and strategies, comparing the performance of encoder-based versus decoder-based Transformer structures. The results indicate that pre-training improves downstream task performance, with encoder-based structures outperforming decoder-based ones. Through ablation studies, we found that node-level information and subgraph structures are critical for achieving optimal performance in transaction classification tasks. When key features were removed, the model performance declined considerably, demonstrating the importance of each component of our method. These findings offer valuable insights for future research, suggesting further improvements in node attribute representation and subgraph extraction.},

In both algorithms, Keccak is the designated hash algorithm extensively used for deriving sensitive information, making it a valuable target for attackers. In the field of fault injection attacks, few works targeted Keccak, and they have not fully explored its impact on the security of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. Consequently, many attacks remain undiscovered. In this article, we first identify various fault vulnerabilities of Keccak that determine the (partial) output by manipulating the control flow under a practical loop-abort model. Then, we systematically analyze the impact of a faulty Keccak output and propose six attacks against ML-KEM and five attacks against ML-DSA, including key recovery, signature forgery, and verification bypass. These attacks cover the key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification phases, making our scheme the first to apply to all phases of ML-KEM and ML-DSA. The proposed attacks are validated on the C implementations of the PQClean library’s ML-KEM and ML-DSA running on embedded devices. Experiments show that the required loop-abort faults can be realized on ARM Cortex-M0+, M3, M4, and M33 microprocessors with low-cost electromagnetic fault injection settings, achieving a success rate of 89.5%. Once the fault injection is successful, all proposed attacks can succeed with a probability of 100%.},

An optimal control strategy, taking into account the system gain, is then implemented. The existence and stability of equilibria, and bi-stability between invasion threshold and persistence threshold are derived. Experiments on synthetic and empirical simplicial complexes reveal the dynamic behavior of the system with discontinuous phase transitions, backward bifurcation and periodic oscillations. An increase in the birth rate makes the system more susceptible to outbreaks of negative information, while the opposite is true for the death rate. Reporting mechanism suppresses discontinuous phase transition. And the synergistic application of preventive and corrective strategies demonstrates superior cost-effectiveness in system control compared to their isolated implementation. Additionally, an identifiability analysis of the model is conducted. Finally, the model parameters are inversely estimated and the diffusion dynamics are predicted using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) across three instances, and the optimal control is subsequently performed, validating the effectiveness of both the proposed model and the control strategy.},

To solve these problems, this paper proposes the notion of traceable access control encryption with parallel multiple sanitizers for the first time and designs a specific structure of traceable parallel ACE to prevent the single point of failure, effectively deter abnormal sanitizer behaviors, and optimize system performance. Additionally, computationally intensive operations in the encryption and decryption processes are outsourced to third-party servers, resulting in a significant reduction of computational overhead. Furthermore, theoretical analysis and experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

  abstract     = {Information bottleneck (IB) is a promising defense solution against adversarial attacks on deep neural networks. However, these methods often suffer from spurious correlations. A correlation exists between the prediction and the non-robust features, yet it does not reflect the causal relationship well. Such spurious correlations induce the neural networks to learn fragile and incomprehensible (non-robust) features. This issue limits its potential for further improving adversarial robustness. This paper addresses this issue by incorporating causal inference into the IB-based defense framework. Specifically, we propose a novel defense method that use the instrumental variables to enhance the adversarial robustness. Our proposed method divides the features into two parts for causal effect estimation: robust and non-robust features. The robust features relate to understanding semantic information, and the non-robust features link to the vulnerable style information. By employing this framework, the IB method can mitigate the influence of non-robust features and extract the robust features linking to the semantic information of objects. We conduct a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, the experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the adversarial robustness against multiple adversarial attacks compared to previous methods. Our regularization method can improve adversarial robustness in both natural and adversarial training frameworks. Besides, CausalIB can be applied to both Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers as a plug-and-play module. Our code is available at https://github.com/HydrogenWasser/CausalIB},

The primary goal of these techniques is to detect malicious software early, preventing attacks before any damage occurs. However, many of these methods either claim that packing has minimal impact on malware detection or fail to address the reliability of their approaches when applied to packed samples. Consequently, they are not capable of assisting victims in handling packed programs or recovering from the damages caused by untimely malware detection. To address these challenges, we propose VisUnpac, a static analysis-based data visualization framework for bolstering attack prevention while aiding recovery post-attack by unveiling malware patterns and offering more detailed information including both malware class and family. Our method includes unpacking packed malware programs, calculating local similarity descriptors based on basic blocks, enhancing correlations between descriptors, and refining them by minimizing noises to obtain self-analysis descriptors. Moreover, we employ machine learning to learn the correlations of self-analysis descriptors through architectural learning for final classification. Our comprehensive evaluation of VisUnpac based on a freshly gathered dataset with over 27,106 samples confirms its capability in accurately classifying malware programs with a precision of 99.7%. Additionally, VisUnpac reveals that most antivirus products in VirusTotal can not handle packed samples properly or provide precise malware classification information. We also achieve over 97% space savings compared to existing data visualization based methods.},

  abstract     = {As a collaborative framework designed to safeguard privacy, Federated Learning (FL) seeks to protect participants’ data throughout the training process. However, the framework still faces security risks from poisoning attacks, arising from the unmonitored process of client-side model updates. Most existing solutions address scenarios where less than half of clients are malicious, i.e., which leaves a significant challenge to defend against attacks when more than half of partici pants are malicious. In this paper, we propose a FL scheme, named FedAMM, that resists backdoor attacks across various data distributions and malicious client ratios. We develop a novel backdoor defense mechanism to filter out malicious models, aiming to reduce the performance degradation of the model. The proposed scheme addresses the challenge of distance measurement in high-dimensional spaces by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve clustering effectiveness. We borrow the idea of critical parameter analysis to enhance discriminative ability in non-iid data scenarios, via assessing the benign or malicious nature of models by comparing the similarity of critical parameters across different models. Finally, our scheme employs a hierarchical noise perturbation to improve the backdoor mitigation rate, effectively eliminating the backdoor and reducing the adverse effects of noise on task accuracy. Through evaluations conducted on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior backdoor defense across diverse client data distributions and different ratios of malicious participants. With 80% malicious clients, FedAMM achieves low backdoor attack success rates of 1.14%, 0.28%, and 5.53% on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively, demonstrating enhanced robustness of FL against backdoor attacks.},

  abstract     = {Currently global features are usually extracted directly from local patterns in palmprint verification. Furthermore, sequence features for palmprint verification are only used as local features, but the properties of sequence features are not fully utilized. To solve this issue, this paper introduces Sequence Feature Fusion Network (SF2Net) for palmprint verification. SF2Net proposes a new paradigm: using stable and spatially correlated sequence features as an intermediate bridge to generate robust global representations. SF2Net’s core mechanism is to first extract fine-grained local features that are then converted into sequence features by a Sequence Feature Extractor (SFE). Finally, the sequence features are used as a superior input to capture high-quality global features. By fusing multi-order texture-based local features with globally extracted sequence features, SF2Net achieves superior discrimination. To ensure high accuracy even with limited training data, a hybrid loss function is proposed, which integrate a cross-entropy loss and a triplet loss. Triplet loss effectively optimizes feature separation by explicitly considering negative samples. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available palmprint datasets demonstrate that SF2Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Remarkably, even with a small training-to-testing ratio (1:9), SF2Net achieves 100% accuracy, surpassing SOTA methods under several benchmark datasets.

This paper addresses the design of an $H_{\infty } $ consensus fuzzy filter over a finite-time horizon, that is subject to selective network attacks and stochastic incomplete measurements. First, a novel selective-data-based (SDB) network attack model is proposed. Unlike conventional models, this model is constructed from the attacker’s perspective to mimic attacks that target high-value data, thereby maximizing its destructive potential. Second, incomplete measurements, arising from factors such as limited AAV sensing ranges and target motion, are modeled by using a set of random variables to characterize the stochastic nature of data loss. Furthermore, an $H_{\infty } $ consensus fuzzy filter is developed to achieve precise consensus estimation of the target with finite-time performance, thereby forming a unified attack-defense architecture. Sufficient conditions for the existence of such a filter are established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), from which the filter gains can be derived. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed design are validated through both numerical simulations and physical experiments.},

The framework tackles unique challenges like the black-box nature of the victim model, limiting access to its parameters, gradients, and outputs, and the difficulty of acquiring data that matches the original noise distribution while having adequate diversity. Our solution involves simulating the victim’s noise conditions to transform clean images into noisy ones and introducing loss functions to optimize the generator and substitute model. Experiments show that our method closely approximates the victim model’s performance and improves generalization in some scenarios.

  abstract     = {Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) is a classic cryptographic protocol for anonymous transactions on blockchains, currently used in the popular anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. The proof size of RingCT transactions is linearly related to the ring size, which limits the use of larger ring sizes due to the significant communication overhead it incurs. However, reducing the ring size also leads to decreased anonymity. Therefore, in recent years, many studies have focused on optimizing the proof sizes for RingCT, with the latest known solutions reducing the proof size to be logarithmic with the ring size. In this paper, we propose a new compact RingCT protocol (CRCT) for smaller proof sizes. To this end, we first design three extended schemes of the Sum Argument (CRYPTO’21), which are used to generate logarithmic-sized proofs for three distinct zero-knowledge arguments, respectively. We then introduce a new zero-knowledge proof scheme called the Difference Argument. It is used to prove that one has the knowledge of two secret values, with their difference being public. Based on these schemes, we construct our CRCT protocol, whose proof size is independent of the ring size and logarithmic with the number of source accounts. We provide concrete constructions and security proofs for the proposed cryptographic schemes. The experimental results demonstrate that CRCT exhibits significant advantages in computational efficiency and proof size over existing solutions when dealing with large ring sizes and moderate numbers of source accounts.},

The dynamic nature of routing policies, massive scale of global routes, and incomplete global topology visibility make BGP anomalies exceptionally challenging to identify—let alone trace back to malicious or misconfigured ASes. To effectively overcome these barriers, this paper proposes GraphBGP, a novel BGP anomaly detection method that dynamically constructs real-time AS-level topologies, achieves precise anomaly detection and classification, and accurately traces malicious or misconfigured ASes. Specifically, to address the evolving nature of BGP routing status, GraphBGP constructs an attributed AS-level graph that dynamically integrates node and edge attributes. It intelligently tracks BGP updates to refresh this graph efficiently. Leveraging this enriched, up-to-date representation, GraphBGP employs tailored detection and tracing models grounded in graph convolutional networks (GCNs), enabling precise anomaly identification and source tracing. Comprehensive experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that GraphBGP achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection accuracy while significantly reducing inference time, even under partial BGP network visibility. Furthermore, GraphBGP precisely traces malicious or misconfigured ASes within a short time period of 7 milliseconds after anomaly detection, enabling rapid mitigation.},

Existing methods often assume noise-free graph structures and primarily focus on monitoring structural changes to discover anomalies. Regrettably, practical applications often involve inaccurate information, individual non-response and dropout, and sampling biases. These factors contribute to the pervasiveness of dynamic noisy graphs that encompass structural noises, making anomaly detection more challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hypergraph-driven Anomaly Detection Framework (HADF), which resists the interference of structural noises and adapts to dynamic noisy graphs. HADF consists of a hyper encoder and an embedding enhancer. The hyper encoder leverages inter-edge correlations to generate hyperedges and design their resistant weights, further employing hypergraph convolutional layers to extract the basic hyper-embeddings of edges. The embedding enhancer exploits temporal structural correlation and reconstructs multi-head attention to achieve noise-resistant enhancement of basic hyper-embeddings. Extensive experiments show that our proposed HADF can realize resistance to structural noises and outperform state-of-the-art methods in identifying anomalous edges in dynamic noisy graphs.},

To address these challenges in real-world environments, we propose a novel system, ORI, designed to tackle two critical tasks: 1) open recognition, including classifying known class samples while recognizing unknown ones, and 2) inspection, involving further inspecting samples recognized as unknown. Specifically, we reformulate open recognition as a binary classification task and propose a density-based method to recognize low-density samples as unknown while classifying known class samples with a closed-world classifier, thereby minimizing the risk associated with open spaces. To reduce the inspection overhead of samples recognized as unknown, we treat unknown sample inspection as a constrained clustering task, using a few manually inspected samples as constraints, and then assign labels to the remaining unknown samples via clustering. We evaluate our system against established open recognition and unknown sample inspection baselines through extensive experiments on three public datasets. Additionally, we simulated a security analyst inspecting unknown samples labeled by ORI. The experimental results demonstrate that ORI accurately classifies known class samples, recognizes unknown samples, and effectively labels samples recognized as unknown, enhancing both open recognition and inspection capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) mitigates data leakage by sharing only local machine learning models instead of raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to differential attacks. Differential Privacy (DP) addresses this concern by introducing noise to make it challenging for adversaries to reconstruct training samples. Nonetheless, clients often have varying attitudes toward data privacy, quantified by their privacy budgets. Low privacy budgets indicate the stringent privacy requirements of clients, requiring high compensations to incentivize their participation. Focusing solely on privacy budgets, however, can introduce selection bias, potentially compromising model generalization. Therefore, it is essential to emphasizes the fairness of client participation, ensuring that clients with lower privacy budgets also have opportunities to contribute to the training process. To tackle the above challenges, this paper formulates a novel DP-based incentive problem in FL, aiming to optimize the utilities of both the server and the clients. Specifically, we propose an auction mechanism that jointly selects participants based on their heterogeneous privacy budgets and determines appropriate payments. The proposed auction mechanism is proven to achieve several desirable properties, including computational efficiency, individual rationality, budget balance, truthfulness, and guaranteed optimization performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Broadcast primitives like Reliable Broadcast (RBC) are integral to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols. Despite recent advancements, these protocols often suffer from high latency due to the inherent three communication rounds in RBC. To mitigate this latency, we propose employing Best-Effort Broadcast (BBC) for message dissemination, which requires only one communication round. However, leveraging BBC poses challenges in constructing a DAG-based ledger and ensuring consistent commitment in the face of contradictory blocks. In this paper, we introduce PlainDAG, a low-latency and secure asynchronous DAG-based BFT protocol that eschews complex broadcast primitives. Instead, it achieves lower latency by simplifying broadcast and committing with a larger quorum of votes. Our approach addresses the integrity, agreement, and totality properties lacking in BBC compared to RBC, thus ensuring correctness. Key to the design of PlainDAG is the introduction of an Integral Reference field in blocks, which References previously committed blocks and facilitates voting among contradictory blocks. Additionally, we devise a block query scheme to retrieve missing blocks. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalized design applicability of PlainDAG for asynchronous DAG-based BFT, with the best-case latency of 2 communication rounds and practical resilience. Experimental results underscore the superiority of PlainDAG over state-of-the-art asynchronous DAG-based protocols in latency, while achieving comparable throughput performance.},

  abstract     = {The growing adoption of 3D point cloud in applications like autonomous driving has heightened concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Existing defense methods face two fundamental challenges: ineffective detection of imperceptible adversarial examples and poor restoration of severely distorted point cloud. In this paper, we present ADDR, an end-to-end defense framework that integrates Binary Geometric Feature Anomaly Detection (BGFAD) and Distorted point cloud Restoration (DPCR). BGFAD employs a dual threshold mechanism combining global distance statistics and local curvature analysis to detect both substantial and imperceptible adversarial perturbations. DPCR leverages attention enhanced feature encoding to reconstruct missing geometric structures while preserving semantic integrity through bidirectional Chamfer loss optimization. Our framework uniquely bridges traditional geometric priors with deep learning mechanisms, achieving attack-agnostic defense without classifier retraining. Extensive experiments on ModelNet40, ShapeNet and ScanObjectNN datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with about 12% higher robustness against structural attacks and $6\times $ better restoration fidelity than existing methods. ADDR maintains real-time processing capabilities while reducing adversarial success rates to <5% across diverse attacks. The code is available at https://github.com/whwh456/ADDR},

  abstract     = {A compiler converts smart contract source code into bytecode, ensuring behavior consistency between them. However, as compiler is also a program, it may contain bugs that disrupt this consistency, known as Compiler-Introduced Bugs (CIBs). Of the latest 4,857 verified smart contracts coded in Solidity, approximately 58% still use compilers that contain at least one CIB. These CIBs can be exploited by attackers to bypass security checks or inject malicious data, leading to significant security issues, which becomes even more serious for smart contracts in blockchain as they cannot be modified after being deployed. To this end, this paper proposes sBugChecker, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic framework designed to automatically and effectively detect CIBs for smart contracts coded in Solidity. sBugChecker can be readily extended with the rule customization suite we propose based on domain specific language. Additionally, it employs two static analytical methods, i.e., pattern matching, and symbolic execution, to identify CIBs’ triggering conditions and confirm their impacts, broadening its detection scope and improving its detection efficiency. To evaluate sBugChecker’s performance, we construct a CIB mutated smart contract dataset, which is the first publicly-available one for this study. According to the evaluation based on this dataset, sBugChecker performs exceptionally well, with detection precision, recall, and F-measure on average achieving 96.6%, 95.5% and 96.0%, respectively. Moreover, sBugChecker has been applied to successfully discover real-world deployed smart contracts capable of triggering CIBs.},

Surveillance cameras are often installed around buildings to detect falling objects, but such detection remains challenging due to the small size and fast motion of the objects. Moreover, the field of falling object detection around buildings (FODB) lacks a large-scale dataset for training learning-based detection methods and for standardized evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a large and diverse video benchmark dataset named FADE. Specifically, FADE contains 2,611 videos from 25 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather conditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a novel detection method for FODB that effectively leverages motion information and generates small-sized yet high-quality detection proposals. The efficacy of our method is evaluated on the proposed FADE dataset by comparing it with state-of-the-art approaches in generic object detection, video object detection, and moving object detection.

However, many existing methods struggle with overfitting to the training data, which limits their generalization performance and real-world applicability. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel forensic framework that incorporates an advanced data augmentation technique. The framework consists of two key components: a generator and a detector. The generator challenges the detector’s learned distribution under constraints of diversity and consistency, ensuring that the generated data diverges from the source domain while maintaining statistical differences related to tampering. The detector, in turn, captures tampering traces from three critical aspects of the tampered image: long-range dependency information, RGB-noise fusion information, and boundary artifacts, resulting in a more comprehensive detection process. By alternating the optimization of the generator and detector, the framework fosters mutual reinforcement, promoting diverse data generation and expanding the distributional coverage, ultimately improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both generalization and robustness, with numerous ablation studies further validating the soundness of the model design.},

  abstract     = {Person re-identification (ReID) is vital for surveillance, tracking, and criminal investigations, yet occlusions often lead to partial information loss and noisy features that significantly degrade ReID performance. Recent CLIP-based occluded person ReID methods have demonstrated promising performance by leveraging cross-modal alignment, but still face two limitations: first, generic text prompts fail to capture the fine-grained semantics of specific samples; second, there is a lack of effective enhancement mechanisms for hard local features in occlusion scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Semantically Guided and Focused Network (SGFNet), which comprises three synergistic modules. First, to tackle the absence of fine-grained textual descriptions, we design a Segmentation and Text Generation (STG) module that segments pedestrian regions and generates sample-specific text features, providing detailed text descriptions and spatial information for local pedestrian regions. In addition, in order to accurately extract fine-grained features, we propose a Dual-guided Feature Refinement (DGFR) module. This module leverages a spatial attention mechanism guided by dual-semantic information to enhance discriminative fine-grained features while effectively suppressing interference from irrelevant regions. Finally, building upon the DGFR module, we further propose a Hardness-aware Semantic Focus (HASF) module. This module leverages segmentation cues to assess the difficulty of distinguishing local regions and employs a carefully designed Semantic-driven Focal Triplet loss to specifically enhance hard local feature learning, thereby improving the model’s robustness in feature extraction under occlusion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SGFNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three occluded person ReID datasets while maintaining competitive results on three holistic person ReID datasets.},

  abstract     = {Passwordless user authentication schemes with FIDO as the standard have been widely deployed in web applications. Users use hardware tokens to store their identity credentials (i.e., signing keys) and implement strong authentication through a challenge-response mechanism, avoiding the security risks associated with traditional password-based authentication. Distributed Web services can greatly alleviate the system reliability problem caused by single points of failure, and thus have received increasing attention and research. In distributed systems, resources are distributed across multiple servers, and users must interact with them (or a subset of them in thresholding) to obtain network services. User authentication among the distributed (threshold) systems also poses a challenge: how to ensure security and ease of use at the same time? In particular, users need to authenticate to multiple servers when accessing distributed services, and in the case of using FIDO authentication, users need to authenticate to each server using challenge-response authentication, which will greatly reduce the user experience. In this work, we propose the concept named Threshold Passwordless Authentication (ThPlA) to address this issue. ThPlA allows users to authenticate to a t-of-n thresholding system. ThPlA is designed to be compatible with existing FIDO tokens and requires no extra hardware modifications; the user only needs to interact with the hardware token once during an authentication session; and on the service side, the servers do not need to communicate with each other. ThPlA is based on the component named Non-interactive Threshold Nonce Generation (NI-ThNG), which extends the two-party challenge-response mechanism to t-of-n settings. We provide a formal definition of ThPlA and NI-ThNG and give practical constructions. We also provide a performance evaluation of ThPlA and NI-ThNG, respectively. Our experimental results show that the schemes are efficient and practical for real-world applications, even in large-scale distributed systems.},

  abstract     = {Remote Attestation (RA) is an effective security service that allows a trusted party (verifier) to initiate the attestation routine on a potentially untrusted remote device (prover) to verify its correct state. Despite their usefulness, traditional challenge-response remote attestation protocols suffer from certain limitations, such as challenges in scaling attestation collection and the forced suspension of normal operation during attestation. Self-attestation tackles these issues by enabling the prover to measure its own state asynchronously with the verifier’s attestation request. Existing self-attestation methods rely on hybrid architectures to provide the required security properties, which may not be compatible with low-end Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to hardware limitations. In addition, these protocols currently lack formal verification of design correctness. In this paper, we present FlashAttest, a formally verified self-attestation protocol for low-end IoT devices. FlashAttest leverages the flash device to fulfill the security properties required by self-attestation, eliminating the requirement for hardware modifications. In particular, FlashAttest allows the prover to initiate the attestation routine and guarantee the trustworthiness of the results based on the verified software-based security architecture. By collaborating with the flash device during attestation to generate timestamped reports, FlashAttest enables the verifier to collect and verify the legitimacy of the attestation results. More importantly, FlashAttest achieves strong security guarantees supported by a formally verified design using the Tamarin prover. We implement and evaluate FlashAttest on MSP430 architecture, showing a reasonable overhead in terms of memory footprint, communication overhead, runtime and power consumption. Compared with state-of-the-art self-attestation schemes, our approach achieves similar runtime overhead, low energy consumption, and reasonable memory overhead while eliminating the need for hardware modifications. The results confirm the suitability of FlashAttest for low-end devices.},

Autonomous vehicles rely on both vision and LiDAR sensors to provide accurate 3D visual perception of their surroundings. However, adversarial vulnerabilities in these models pose several risks, as they can lead to misinterpretation of sensor data, ultimately endangering safety. While substantial research has been devoted to image-level adversarial attacks, these efforts are predominantly confined to 2D-pixel spaces, lacking physical realism and applicability in the 3D world. To address these limitations, we introduce AdvNeRF, a groundbreaking approach for generating 3D adversarial meshes that effectively target both vision and LiDAR models simultaneously. AdvNeRF is a Transferable Target Adversarial Attack that leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to achieve its objectives. NeRF ensures the creation of high-quality adversarial objects and enhances attack performance by maintaining consistency across unseen viewpoints, making the adversarial examples robust from multiple angles. By integrating NeRF, our method represents a leap forward in improving the robustness and effectiveness of 3D adversarial attacks. Experimental results validate the superior performance of AdvNeRF, demonstrating its ability to degrade the accuracy of 3D object detectors under various conditions. These findings highlight the critical implications of AdvNeRF, emphasizing its potential to consistently undermine the perception systems of autonomous vehicles across different perspectives, thus marking an advancement in the field of adversarial attacks and 3D perception security.},

Our results reveal that the agents are familiar to procedures of penetration testing tasks, but they still face limitations in generating accurate commands and executing complete processes. Accordingly, we summarize the current challenges, including the difficulty of maintaining the entire message history and the tendency for the agent to become stuck. Based on the above insights, we propose a Penetration testing State Machine (PSM) that utilizes the Finite State Machine (FSM) methodology to address these limitations. Then, we introduce AutoPT, an automated penetration testing agent based on the principle of PSM driven by LLMs, which utilizes the inherent inference ability of LLM and the constraint framework of state machines. Our evaluation results show that AutoPT outperforms the ReAct-based baseline and improves the task completion rate from 22% to 41% on the benchmark target.

As recommended in NIST SP 800-90B (90B), these methods estimate min-entropy by forecasting the outputs of entropy sources. Owing to their computational efficiency, considerable research has focused on enhancing the accuracy of predictors, including approaches based on deep neural networks (DNNs). However, concerns remain about their interpretability, reliability, and applicability, particularly for DNN-based predictors. In this paper, we first identify key deficiencies in existing prediction-based methods, including those in 90B and DNN-based predictors, which lead to unreliable estimates and poor adaptability across diverse entropy sources. To improve reliability, we model the predictor output distribution and revise the local predictability metric to produce more stable estimates with associated confidence levels. To enhance the interpretability of DNN-based predictors in entropy estimation, we provide the first theoretical analysis linking neural network optimization objectives to min-entropy, clarifying the suitability and learnability of different architectures. We further reveal the inapplicability of existing methods under time-varying sources and propose a new estimation framework that combines online learning, change detection, and Bayesian optimization for dynamic model updates.

Tons of applications additionally need confidentiality with flexible access control such that data providers can decide how their data are shared through blockchains. This paper aims at enhancing Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based permissioned blockchains with controllable access control. To this goal, we extend the concept of Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) to a new variant called Controllable Threshold PRE (CT-PRE). The traditional PRE enables a proxy, using a re-encryption key, to convert a ciphertext meant for delegator A into another ciphertext meant for delegatee B, all without exposing the original message. CT-PRE extends PRE into the setting with multiple proxies (corresponding to blockchain servers and avoiding a single point of failure) and enables the delegator to fully take control of its ciphertext. We formally define CT-PRE and construct a provably secure $\textsf {CTPRE}$ scheme. We further extend the $\textsf {CTPRE}$ scheme to a verifiable one $\textsf {VCTPRE}$ . We implement the Verifiable CT-PRE scheme with stronger security, integrate it in our BFT-based blockchain system, and deploy our system in a WAN on Amazon EC2 with 22 nodes across four continents. We show that our system is highly efficient, achieving a throughput of 5.15 ktx/sec (for access control operations) and 10.83 ktx/sec (for write operations, only slightly slower than our BFT write operations), respectively.},

  abstract     = {Machine Learning (ML) has proven effective in Integrated Circuits (IC) security, particularly in Hardware Trojan (HT) detection. However, a model’s generalization potential depends on its ability to address distribution shifts (DS) in unseen data. Mitigating DS enhances a model’s adaptability to novel variations and threats within the dynamic realm of IC designs and HTs. We formulate HT detection as a DS problem, introducing DART, a novel Distribution-Aware HT detection framework, to enhance model generalization. Applying DART on state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network architecture yields up to 22.96% and 17.37% F1-score improvements for unseen IC designs diverging significantly from the training data.},

  abstract     = {Fuzzing is a prevalent technology for identifying software vulnerabilities. Existing fuzzing techniques predominantly focus on maximizing code coverage to unearth potential security issues. However, the mere expansion of explored code does not necessarily correlate with an increased discovery of vulnerabilities. Additionally, existing fuzzers often neglect comprehensive execution path information in code exploration. Consequently, potential vulnerabilities may be delayed or overlooked in the fuzzing process. To address this, we propose VPGFuzz, a vulnerable path-guided fuzzer that can not only explore new code but also exploit known vulnerability path knowledge for vulnerability discovery. It employs a vulnerable path recognition model to identify test cases with potentially vulnerable paths. This model is trained with various execution paths derived from real-world vulnerability PoCs (Proof of Concepts). Based on this model, VPGFuzz applies an explore-exploit seed selection strategy to effectively choose test cases for testing. Unlike traditional seed selection methods that maintain a single queue for exploring new code, this strategy includes a separate queue for retaining test cases identified as potentially vulnerable, allowing for more thorough testing. Experimental results demonstrate that VPGFuzz discovers 24 previously unknown vulnerabilities, with 18 receiving vulnerability identifiers from third-party organizations such as CVE. Our evaluation also shows VPGFuzz’s superior efficiency by uncovering the first vulnerability approximately 1.2 to 70 times faster than popular fuzzers in most programs.},

  abstract     = {The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol is emerging as one of the most promising blockchain consensus mechanisms, and Ethereum is also undergoing a significant transition to PoS, specifically by adopting Gasper. However, a particularly critical threat faced by existing view-dependent PoS, such as Gasper, lies in view-interference attacks, exemplified by balance attack and reorg attack. These attacks enable adversaries to prevent honest proposals from being committed, thereby directly compromising the fundamental liveness property of blockchain. Currently, there is no effective solution to mitigate such view-interference attacks. In this paper, we present Chitin, a novel view-dependent PoS protocol that is designed to enhance security and effectively mitigate all varieties of view-interference attacks. The core design of Chitin comprises a common set protocol that leverages an innovative deletion mechanism to achieve both a consistent message set and strong termination, while requiring only minimal support from Trusted Execution Environment through its basic validation module. Furthermore, we prove that Chitin not only satisfies safety and liveness, but also possesses resilience against view-interference attacks. Finally, we implement Chitin and conduct comparisons with existing works. The experimental results show that our protocol exhibits superior efficiency, resulting in significant improvements in throughput ranging from 33%-50%, along with reduced communication costs.},

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of cyber-attack technologies, attackers increasingly exploit zero-day vulnerabilities or leverage emerging techniques to launch sophisticated attacks, resulting in the persistent emergence of unknown cyber-attacks. However, traditional DL-based cyber-attack detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled training data. In practice, obtaining sufficient samples of unknown attacks is challenging, which makes it difficult for these methods to effectively defend against unknown cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering unknown cyber threats empowered by genetic evolution without prior knowledge. Specifically, We, first mapped the network feature space into a gene framework, and divided the attack genes into a static gene region (SGZ) and a dynamic gene region (DGZ) according to the importance of the cyber-attack genes. Subsequently, leveraging the known attack genes, we utilized different gene evolution strategies and a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) to generate attack variants and potential unknown attack genes. Finally, we constructed a cyber-attack detection model incorporating both the global attention mechanism (GAM) and the local attention mechanism (LAM). The generated attack variants and unknown attack genes are the used to enhance the detection ability of the detection model for variants and unknown cyber-attacks. We conducted a large number of experiments on six real and authoritative network datasets. The experimental results show that in different scenario settings, the F1 scores of our proposed method for detecting unknown attacks are 84.64% and 95.77% respectively. The F1 score for detecting unknown attacks on the UNSW-NB15 dataset exceeds that of the baseline classifier. The F1 score for detecting unknown attacks on the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset is 98.85%. In comparison with SOTA methods, the average F1 score is improved by 3.14%. In the evaluation of variant detection performance, the generation method we proposed improves the detection of variants by approximately 11.2%, surpassing generation methods such as the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Meanwhile, we also comprehensively evaluated the generalization ability of our proposed method and the evolution ability of different evolution strategies on different datasets and through ablation experiments.},

We designed a threshold signature scheme that relies only on zero-knowledge proofs and pseudo-random functions, and extended the identifiable abort mechanism to hold the corrupted party accountable afterwards.

  abstract     = {Model watermarking is a widely adopted mechanism for protecting deep learning (DL) model intellectual property (IP). Black-box verifiable watermarking typically involves injecting backdoors that cause the model to produce predetermined outputs for specific inputs. In contrast, white-box verifiable watermarking uses steganographic techniques to embed watermarks into weight parameters or activation values. However, the former poses new security risks, while the latter often lacks robustness against removal techniques. In this paper, we propose a latent model watermarking, constructing upon the model Division and Union operating concept, dubbed as DUO, leveraging the strengths of two watermarking methods above while eliminating each shortcoming. Once the model owner or provider embeds a watermark into the model using watermark data, the watermarked model is divided into two parts: the main model, which corresponds to the primary task and is made publicly available, and a small sub-network privately reserved by the owner. The watermark resides latently within the main model and can only be activated through the private sub-network (the reserved parameters) when they are united. Consequently, DUO does not adversely affect the performance of the main model on its primary task and does not induce any security risks, even in the presence of watermark data. We extensively validate DUO on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, ImageNette, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) using various model architectures, including standardized ResNet and VGG. The results affirm its capability to accurately verify model ownership without compromising model accuracy. It exhibits a 100% detection accuracy on pirated/positive testing models (96 models are tested) with a 0% false positive rate on normal/negative testing models (64 models are tested). Due to its latent nature, DUO is both effective and robust, capable of withstanding a wide range of state-of-the-art watermark laundering including severe model fine-tuning and pruning. We further evaluate and demonstrate that DUO remains robust against adaptive attacks, even when both the watermark data and the reserved parameters are known to the adversary.},

We begin by examining standard ML models trained on long-tailed datasets and identify three key privacy risk effects: amplification, convergence, and polarization. Building on these insights, we extend our analysis to state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methods, such as foundation model-based approaches, offering new perspectives on how these models respond to membership inference attacks across head to tail classes. Finally, we investigate the privacy risks of ML models trained with differential privacy in long-tailed scenarios. Our findings corroborate that, even when ML models are designed to improve tail class performance to match head classes and are protected by differential privacy, tail class data remain particularly vulnerable to membership inference attacks.},

However, existing conjunctive keyword dynamic searchable encryption schemes often expose the Keyword Pair Result Pattern (KPRP) during index matching, compromising privacy. Additionally, frequent index updates require expensive group exponentiations, leading to high client-side overhead. To tackle these challenges, we propose LRP-HDSE, a lightweight dynamic conjunctive keyword searchable encryption scheme that hides KPRP while minimizing client computation costs. To enhance privacy, we introduce the Vector Hidden Subset Predicate Encryption (VH-SPE) mechanism, which enables the server to implicitly detect cross-tag in the membership matching index, effectively mitigating KPRP leakage. For improved efficiency, the scheme designs a lightweight membership matching index structure, LSet, based on low-cost multiset hash operations, reducing reliance on costly exponentiations and lowering client overhead. Our security analysis confirms that LRP-HDSE provides robust KPRP hiding along with forward and backward security in dynamic environments. Asymptotic analysis, along with experiment evaluations on two real-world datasets, show that our scheme offers superior client-side computational efficiency compared to existing approaches, making it both practical and effective.},

More precisely, a malicious combiner may delay the combination of signature shares and replace some signature shares from honest signers with ones from colluding signers, and an unrestricted tracer can reveal signers’ identities arbitrarily. In this work, we introduce a new scheme called TiMTAPS under a stronger security model. First, we sew homomorphic time-lock puzzles into the Schnorr signature, allowing puzzles to be combined and opened as needed. Second, we knit the Schnorr signature with homomorphic commitment for verifiable combining. Third, we infuse the combining phase with an identity-based key encapsulation mechanism for message-dependent tracing. Next, formalize the definitions and requirements for TiMTAPS. Then, we present a concrete construction and formally prove its privacy and security. We build a prototype of TiMTAPS based on Ethereum. Results from extensive experiments exhibit its practicability and efficiency, e.g., combining (tracking) 10 signature sets with a threshold value of 5 requires only 3.72 s (12.44 s) for the threshold signature.},

Efficiently optimizing these provenance graphs has thus become a core issue. However, existing data reduction methods often mistakenly delete critical security information, significantly impacting attack detection and investigation. This paper introduces TeRed, a novel method for reducing provenance graphs based on normal behavior patterns. Our approach employs unit tests to learn the system’s normal behavior patterns, which are then used to streamline the provenance graph. Experiments on five datasets show that our method reduces the provenance graph while preserving all attack-related information.

  abstract     = {Quantum computers leverage qubits to solve certain computational problems significantly faster than classical computers. This capability poses a severe threat to traditional cryptographic algorithms, leading to the rise of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) designed to withstand quantum attacks. FALCON, a lattice-based signature algorithm, has been selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as part of its post-quantum cryptography standardization process. However, due to the computational complexity of PQC, especially in cloud-based environments, throughput limitations during peak demand periods have become a bottleneck, particularly for FALCON. In this paper, we introduce GOLF (GPU-accelerated Optimization for Lattice-based FALCON), a novel GPU-based parallel acceleration framework for FALCON. GOLF includes algorithm porting to the GPU, compatibility modifications, multi-threaded parallelism with distinct data, single-thread optimization for single tasks, and specific enhancements to the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module within FALCON. Our approach achieves unprecedented performance in FALCON acceleration on GPUs, setting the highest throughput record in the history of FALCON digital signature generation and verification. On the NVIDIA RTX 4090, GOLF reaches a signature generation throughput of 420.25 kops/s and a signature verification throughput of 10,311.04 kops/s. These results represent a $58.05\times $ / $73.14\times $ improvement over the reference FALCON implementation and a $7.17\times $ / $3.79\times $ improvement compared to the fastest known GPU implementation to date. Additionally, since we have not modified the content of the algorithm, but only optimized its engineering implementation, the security of the algorithm has not changed, and the security of the original algorithm has been maintained. GOLF demonstrates that GPU acceleration is not only feasible for post-quantum cryptography but also crucial for addressing throughput bottlenecks in real-world applications.},

In this paper, we propose a novel stealthy-based approach, named Dual-latent Adaptive Diffusion Protection (DADP), which generates transferable stealthy adversarial examples consistent with the source images by the diffusion model to protect facial privacy. DADP effectively harnesses adversarial information within both the semantic and diffusion latent spaces to explore adversarial latent representations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on bounded constraints and sign gradient optimization, DADP employs adaptive optimization to maximize the utilization of adversarial gradient information and introduces latent regularization to constrain the adaptive optimization process, ensuring that the protected faces maintain high privacy and natural appearance. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on the public CelebA-HQ and LADN datasets demonstrate the proposed method crafts more natural-looking stealthy adversarial examples with superior black-box transferability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Existing adversarial attacks generate AEs separately and specifically for different APKs (termed as APK-specific attacks), resulting in significant computational overhead and limited attack efficiency. In this paper, we propose an APK-Agnostic Adversarial Attack Method (termed as A4M) for FCG-based Android malware detection, enabling the deployment of large-scale malware adversarial examples. Meanwhile, this perturbation can also greatly accelerate existing APK-specific attacks. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of A4M. A4M achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 85.17% on 7 target detectors (built with MAMADroid, APIGraph and GNN), significantly surpassing the state-of-the- art attack MalPatch by 28.17%. Experiments also demonstrate A4M can markedly accelerate the APK-specific attacks HIV_CW, HIV_JSMA and DQN, reducing about 88 queries per adversarial example.},

  abstract     = {The issue of transaction security has attracted widespread attention due to the frequent occurrence of financial fraud. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively detect financial fraudulent behavior by capturing transaction relationships. However, many existing methods lack the consideration of modeling user behavior patterns at diverse timescales. Moreover, GNN-based approaches usually fail to adaptively perceive neighborhood information from global and local perspectives, resulting in some transaction node embeddings merging the information from partially irrelevant neighboring transaction nodes and leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, this work proposes a Multi-Temporal Partitioned graph attention Network (MTPNet) for financial fraud detection. In particular, we design a multi-temporal partitioned graph construction algorithm that generates multi-temporal series graphs at various timescales. These graphs effectively express the periodic variations in users’ transaction behavior pattern, allowing GNNs to learn knowledge from these graphs and extract richer semantic information. Then, we propose a global-local neighborhood-aware encoder to enable transaction node embeddings to adaptively aggregate their most relevant neighborhood information based on the attention mechanism. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of MTPNet on large-scale financial fraud datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Although Federated Learning (FL) offers significant potential for developing model marketplaces through collaborative training and privacy preservation, challenges such as insufficient training data and arbitrage issues severely impede the development of FL-based model marketplaces. Existing studies either lack satisfactory security guarantees or are too profit-driven to address potential arbitrage issues. In this paper, we propose a novel Personalized prIvacy-prEserving inCentive mEchanism named PIECE, with the aim of achieving social optimality while avoiding arbitrage. Specifically, we first formulate a dual-objective optimization problem to simultaneously maximize social utility and model performance while ensuring arbitrage-free conditions through differential privacy. Due to dynamic model training and heterogeneous privacy budgets that complicate the design of arbitrage-free properties, we model the transformation between local and global privacy requirements across scenarios as a privacy choice game. This game guarantees the identification of a constraint to generate desired model versions based on Nash equilibrium. Next, by generalizing the properties of different data-owner groups under equilibrium conditions, we prove that the dual-objective optimization problem is always conflict-free, thus allowing transformation into a social optimal problem without arbitrage. Furthermore, to tackle the significant difficulty in characterizing the model revenue and interpolating pricing, we propose a two-stage solution based on subadditivity relaxation. The first stage establishes a set of ideal prices as the target, while the second stage establishes polynomial-time solvability and provides rigorous arbitrage-free boundaries. Finally, comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the efficacy of PIECE. The results indicate a minimum 8% boost in model revenue within the specified marketplace scale, and a maximum 16.67% improvement in model performance compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.},

Finally, we implement these functions in BSFOIMToken and deploy a prototype on the Ethereum blockchain, demonstrating its practicality and robust performance.

However, this extensive interconnectivity also poses significant security challenges, particularly in data transmission. Traditional security mechanisms often incur high computational costs and long processing times, which are impractical for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure data processing and transmission scheme for the IIoT called ECGSH. This scheme combines certificateless signcryption and homomorphic encryption to enable homomorphic processing in an encrypted state, thus enhancing both security and flexibility. Moreover, it reduces the complexity of large-scale data processing by eliminating bilinear pair computations. The ECGSH scheme also supports homomorphic data transmission in the IIoT. A rigorous security analysis proves that the scheme has the properties of confidentiality, non-repudiation, and forward security under the random oracle model. An attack resistance analysis proves that the scheme can effectively resist man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, replay attacks, and eavesdropping attacks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that ECGSH excels in terms of security, computational efficiency, and communication overhead. It requires at most 31% CPU utilization, and less than 1.2% memory footprint on IIoT hardware, making it particularly suitable for IIoT environments with limited resources and high transmission costs.},

A hybrid discriminator, integrating autoencoder-based signal reconstruction fidelity and key-matching validation, enables robust legitimacy verification. The prototype experiments using USRP SDR and RIS hardware show that the verification accuracy of the scheme can reach 100%, when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is above 10dB, the number of training sample points is more than 128, and the codebook dimension is near 32.},

  abstract     = {Local differential privacy federated learning has attracted wide attention because it can solve the problem of data islands without damaging data privacy, but it faces data heterogeneity problems on the client side. Existing solutions commonly cluster clients with similar data distributions into the same training groups by leveraging clients’ model parameters, thus mitigating the impact of data heterogeneity on federated learning performance. However, model parameters, as an indirect representation for client data, often fail to accurately reflect the true data distribution, resulting in inaccurate client groupings. Furthermore, these solutions perturb high-dimensional parameter vectors dimension-by-dimension to protect client data privacy, which introduces substantial LDP noise that significantly further compromises the client grouping accuracy. To tackle these challenges, we propose PCFed-LDP, a privacy-preserving clustered federated learning framework that improves the federated learning performance while protecting client data and satisfying LDP in heterogeneous environments. Specifically, we introduce a client clustering method based on geometric properties of client data subspaces, which conducts label grouping-based principal angle analysis on client data subspaces to accurately capture the similarities in client data distributions, thereby enabling precise client grouping. To reduce the amount of introduced LDP noise, we design an adaptive noise addition method that utilizes the Haar wavelet technique to decouple the relationship between the noise amount and vector dimensionality, and employs noise error minimization strategy-based vector segmentation to inject LDP noise with finer granularity. Theoretical analysis and experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our solution not only satisfies the constraints of local differential privacy but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

To fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel defense algorithm that effectively counters syntax-based as well as special-token-based backdoor attacks. The algorithm replaces semantically meaningful words in sentences with entirely different ones but preserves the syntactic templates or special tokens, and then compares the predicted labels before and after the substitution to determine whether a sentence contains triggers.

Physical layer authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results, our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06 compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.},

It is a multi-step attack with the intention of destroying the system- or data-privacy, such as network stealing. Current methods usually generate single-step alerts first and then perform correlation analysis. However, it is difficult for these methods to perform fine-grained annotation and alert amount control for single-step alerts, as well as to completely correlate the alerts of different phases into a chain due to alert fatigue. In this paper, we propose Traffic2Chain, an innovative unsupervised traffic behaviour correlation method to detect covert multi-step attacks from the network side. Traffic2Chain (1) generates alerts at different phases in real-time and annotates to sub-techniques based on MITRE ATT&CK knowledge database; (2) performs alert clustering based on SIMCSE and automatically generates event descriptions based on the Large Language Model (LLM) technique, and (3) extracts the attack chain through multi-dimensional information correlation to reveal the complete attack process. Experimental results demonstrate that the F1 score of Traffic2Chain reaches 98.36%, which has a significant advantage over other methods. In the real-world network, the detection speed can reach 40 Gbps. Most importantly, we discovered an unknown attack pattern based on Traffic2Chain - attackers delivered a variant of the Silver Fox Trojan by impersonating VPN services, eventually building a botnet with stealing capabilities and a node size of more than one million.},

  abstract     = {Electroencephalography (EEG) biometrics draws increasing attention in high-security requirements due to its advantages of anti-spoofing, live traits, and non-duplicated. However, existing EEG datasets, which rely on external stimuli or task-specific instructions for data collection, often intertwine identity-related information with biases such as emotional states, cognitive tasks, and disease markers. Besides, EEG signals are time-varying, while identity information within EEG signals is relatively fixed, which poses challenges for extracting identity features from EEG to perform accurate person identification. This high correlation hampers the promotion of brainprint recognition in real-life applications. In this paper, we propose a disentangled representation learning based identity recognition framework, which disentangles the EEG signal into intrinsic identity-related information and biased identity-invariant information, thus enhancing the performance of EEG biometrics. First, two parallel encoders are used to extract intrinsic identity-relevant and bias identity-irrelevant factors, respectively, and each encoder consists of a temporal filter module and a novel spatial-temporal attention module. Then, we further refine the disentanglement process through a correlation-driven loss that minimizes factor similarity across spatial-temporal and global representational domains. Adversarial training and reconstruction regularization are introduced to facilitate the identity and biased representations to be independent and complementary to each other. Additionally, we extend supervised contrastive learning to the component level, minimizing cross-component similarity and encouraging each component to independently reflect its unique information, thereby improving the disentanglement efficacy. Our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets encompassing emotional, motor imagery, and pathological conditions, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed brainprint identity recognition model.},

  abstract     = {The evolving Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is shifting towards decentralized collaborative manufacturing, posing heightened network security issues within interconnected value chains, thus requiring advanced Network Intrusion Detection (NID) systems to identify potential threats. In this context, traditional centralized NID systems are insufficient due to cross-industrial privacy concerns and interconnected secure threats. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution to enable the sharing of security insights without compromising privacy across participants. However, establishing an FL-based NID framework in realistic IIoT scenarios faces several hurdles, including the limited availability of large-scale devices and heterogeneous attack data distributions. The former leads to inconsistent client participation and degraded performance, while the latter hinders model convergence. To address these, we propose a novel Federated Learning-based Industrial Network Intrusion Detection (FedIn-NID) framework, incorporating a multidimensional client selection strategy and a dynamic global aggregation strategy. The selection strategy synergistically considers multidimensional factors including client availability, local dataset distribution, and dataset size. This approach accommodates clients with varying availability and avoids the selection of biased clients with data concentrated in a few categories. During model aggregation, the proposed strategy leverages the concept of exponential moving average to dynamically balance the holistic yet slightly older knowledge in the global model with the partial but relatively newer knowledge in local models, ensuring effective aggregation and convergence of the global NID model. Experiments demonstrate that FedIn-NID outperforms baselines by 10% to 30%, showcasing remarkable robustness with increasing data distribution heterogeneity and device count.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural network (DNN) models embody the intellectual property of a model owner, as the process of training the DNN model is a complex and resource-intensive task that requires significant investments in data preparation and computing resources. Numerous efforts have been made to protect the intellectual property of DNN models. However, existing methods often come with a critical limitation: they lack robustness, proving effective only in specific intellectual property threat scenarios or they either sacrifice the utility/accuracy of the model owner’s classifier because it interferes with the classifier’s training. To address these issues, we propose GMFIP, a novel generator-based model fingerprinting technology tailored for DNN intellectual property protection. GMFIP stands out for its robustness, extending its utility to various intellectual property threat scenarios rather than specific ones. Furthermore, GMFIP ensures that the utility/accuracy of the model is not affected by protection measures. Specifically, GMFIP begins with the training of the generator, which lays the groundwork for the model fingerprint. The generator generates fingerprints of the unique properties of the source model for verifying model ownership. To further improve the quality of these fingerprints, an extra selection phase dedicated to refining the fingerprints is integrated. Moreover, GMFIP is complemented by a binary classifier, which adapts the threshold setting to get optimal results. Our empirical evaluation includes an ablation study over four state-of-the-art technologies and three image benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that GMFIP outperforms other state-of-the-art technologies in effectively distinguishing pirated models from benign models.},

  abstract     = {In wireless communications, traditional malicious jamming attacks that employ a single jammer and focus on a single domain are becoming increasingly ineffective due to the rapid advancements in learning-based anti-jamming technology. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel multi-domain cooperative jamming method for DRL-based anti-jamming frequency hopping (FH) communications. At the jamming side, intelligent multi-domain attacks could be effectively implemented by coordinating the adjustment of frequency and power parameters among multiple jammers to disrupt the legitimate user’s communication. In this context, the interaction between the legitimate user and multiple cooperative jammers is modeled as a One-Leader Multi-Follower (OLMF) Stackelberg game, where the efficient jamming resource allocation problem among the cooperative jammers is formulated as a potential game. Then, the existence of Nash equilibrium for the potential game is demonstrated, which further ensures the Stackelberg equilibrium for the OLMF Stackelberg game. Additionally, a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) method is introduced to approach the final equilibrium for the cooperative jammers with a high-dimensional action space. Simulation results demonstrate that when facing DRL-based anti-jamming agents, the proposed multi-domain cooperative jamming approach achieves a jamming success rate that is 35% higher than traditional jamming, 20% higher than reactive jamming, and 15% higher than DRL-based non-cooperative jamming. Even when the legitimate user employs the opponent modeling based dynamic best response anti-jamming strategy, our method still converges to the Stackelberg equilibrium and achieves a 10% jamming performance gain compared to the multi-tone intelligent jamming method and the non-cooperative jamming method.},

  abstract     = {The primary challenge in unsupervised gait recognition lies in generating meaningful and diverse supervisory signals to guide representation learning. The effectiveness of such methods largely depends on the richness of the supervisory signals. Unlike previous methods that construct supervisory signals solely from a single modality, we propose a novel framework, named Multimodal Mutual Learning (M3L), that leverages the identity consistency and complementary nature of both silhouette and skeleton modalities to generate richer and more informative supervisory signals. To fully leverage the richer supervisory signals, M3L encourages mutual prediction between the silhouette and skeleton modalities, guiding the network toward modality-invariant representations. However, mutual prediction alone is hindered by the inherent modality gap, so we introduce a Multimodal Collaborative Module to explicitly bridge this gap and promote cross-modal knowledge transfer. Moreover, to make the framework practical when only one modality is available at inference, we introduce a Multimodal Disentanglement Module. Multimodal Disentanglement Module decouples the two branches and distills a shared representation, preserving the gains of multimodal training while allowing the model to maintain robust performance under single-modality conditions. Extensive experiments on four widely used gait datasets—Gait3D, GREW, CASIA-B, and SUSTech1K—demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight its potential to advance unsupervised gait recognition.},

  abstract     = {The vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to adversarial attacks poses a significant challenge to their deployment in safety-critical applications. While extensive research has addressed various attack scenarios, the no-box attack setting—where adversaries have no prior knowledge, including access to training data of the target model—remains relatively underexplored despite its practical relevance. This work presents a systematic investigation into leveraging large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP, as surrogate models for executing no-box attacks. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal a key limitation in the execution of no-box attacks stemming from insufficient discriminative capabilities for direct application of vanilla CLIP as a surrogate model. To address this limitation, we propose MF-CLIP (Margin-based Fine-tuned CLIP), a novel framework that enhances CLIP’s effectiveness as a surrogate model through margin-aware feature space optimization. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse architectures and datasets demonstrate that MF-CLIP substantially advances the state-of-the-art in no-box attacks, surpassing existing baselines by 15.23% on standard models and achieving a 9.52% improvement on adversarially trained models. Our code is made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and future research in this direction.},

To investigate this issue, we devised covert eavesdropping attacks by perturbing and replaying events generated during the user’s normal activation of the voice assistant. The results demonstrate the feasibility and harmfulness of such eavesdropping attacks. To counter these covert voice eavesdropping attacks, we propose an effective defense scheme called CrossUnwind. This scheme leverages the groundtruth that voice assistant wake-up requires hardware to generate and send wake-up events. Specifically, we designed a novel tombstone file parsing process and an accurate event discrimination algorithm to obtain detailed call station information of the wake-up event without compromising the system. This allows us to determine whether the current wake-up event was generated by hardware. We deployed CrossUnwind on real devices and compared it to well-known machine learning and deep learning methods. The results demonstrate that CrossUnwind can achieve high accuracy in eavesdropping detection with faster speeds and lower resource utilization.},

However, similar to graph neural networks (GNNs), GCL models are susceptible to graph structural attacks. As an unsupervised method, GCL faces greater challenges in defending against adversarial attacks. Furthermore, there has been limited research on enhancing the robustness of GCL. To thoroughly explore the failure of GCL on the poisoned graphs, we investigate the detrimental effects of graph structural attacks against the GCL framework. We discover that, in addition to the conventional observation that graph structural attacks tend to connect dissimilar node pairs, these attacks also diminish the mutual information between the graph and its representations from an information-theoretical perspective, which is the cornerstone of the high-quality node embeddings for GCL. Motivated by this theoretical insight, we propose a robust graph contrastive learning framework with a learnable sanitation view that endeavors to sanitize the augmented graphs by restoring the diminished mutual information caused by the structural attacks. Additionally, we design a fully unsupervised tuning strategy to tune the hyperparameters without accessing the label information, which strictly coincides with the defender’s knowledge.

This poses a significant threat to the confidentiality of sensitive applications, known as the Source Location Privacy (SLP) problem. Conventional packet encryption methods are ineffective in defending against SLP attacks since attackers do not need to know the content of the packets. A commonly used method to address the SLP problem is to establish fake transmission paths, making attackers follow fake paths and thus extending the time required to trace back to the source node. Existing SLP solutions that use fake transmission paths only consider individual source nodes, where the fake paths constructed for different source nodes are independent and cannot cooperate to resist attacks. In this paper, a Fake Path Co-Construction source location privacy protection protocol (FPCC) suitable for UWSNs is proposed. FPCC combines the existing transmission paths and creates co-constructed fake paths to simultaneously protect two source nodes. Simulation results confirm that FPCC, when compared with existing well-performed SLP protection protocols, extends safety time without increasing the number of nodes involved in transmitting fake packets.},

  abstract     = {Certifiable robustness gives the guarantee that small perturbations around an input to a classifier will not change the prediction. There are two approaches to provide certifiable robustness to adversarial examples– 1) explicitly training classifiers with small Lipschitz constants, and 2) Randomized smoothing, which adds random noise to the input to create a smooth classifier. We propose SPLITZ, a practical and novel approach which leverages the synergistic benefits of both the above ideas into a single framework. Our main idea is to split a classifier into two halves, constrain the Lipschitz constant of the first half, and smooth the second half via randomization. Motivation for SPLITZ comes from the observation that many standard deep networks exhibit heterogeneity in Lipschitz constants across layers. SPLITZ can exploit this heterogeneity while inheriting the scalability of randomized smoothing. We present a principled approach to train SPLITZ and provide theoretical analysis to derive certified robustness guarantees during inference. We present a comprehensive comparison of robustness-accuracy trade-offs and show that SPLITZ consistently improves on existing state-of-the-art approaches in the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For instance, with $\ell _{2}$ norm perturbation budget of $\epsilon =1$ , SPLITZ achieves 43.2% top-1 test accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset compared to state-of-art top-1 test accuracy 39.8%.},

Matchmaking encryption is a novel cryptographic primitive that provides bilateral access control to maintain user trust and data integrity. However, this primitive faces a challenge in terms of achieving secure multi-receiver construction. In a multi-user environment, users need to encrypt the data many times, resulting in inefficiencies under this approach. To address this challenge, we focus on the underlying construction of identity-based broadcast matchmaking encryption (IBBME). This paper presents a new IBBME construction with $\textsf {DBDH}$ and $q\text {-}\textsf {SDH}$ assumptions under the standard model. Specifically, we propose a new approach that abandons the generalized transformations that already existed previously in multiple receivers. Specifically, we adopt the “two-level” method to guarantee privacy and authenticity, where the identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) level guarantees privacy, while the signature level guarantees authenticity. In addition, we present a strict security proof, which shows that our construction satisfies privacy and authenticity exactly. Moreover, we compare the existing ME constructions with our construction through theoretical and performance analysis. The analysis shows that the ciphertext size in our construction can be reduced to be independent of the number of receivers, which is more efficient.},

In this paper, we propose UTRDCL, a novel stealthy obfuscation technique that leverages system APIs instead of conventional DCL-related APIs, and employs an automated footprint cleanup strategy to minimize runtime traces. Based on UTRDCL, we construct three real-world attack instances by embedding it into existing malware and benign applications, demonstrating how it can be used to evade detection. To counter such threats, we design and implement a lightweight defense mechanism by patching a previously overlooked vulnerability in the Android system that UTRDCL exploits in this specific context. This system-level mitigation closes the attack surface leveraged by UTRDCL, offering a more fundamental defense than behavioral detection. Extensive experiments show that attacks leveraging UTRDCL can evade 11 state-of-the-art malware detectors from open-source, academic, and commercial sources. We further validate our defense mechanism on real devices, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing UTRDCL-based attacks without introducing noticeable overhead. Our proof-of-concept of UTRDCL and its defense is publicly available at https://github.com/AnonymousFEI/UTRDCL},

  abstract     = {In complex jamming environments with multi-user spectrum sharing, existing distributed anti-jamming strategies are constrained by significant communication overhead, limited efficiency in knowledge dissemination, and low collaborative effectiveness. To address these challenges, a distributed anti-jamming strategy based on local knowledge diffusion and differential weighted fusion mechanisms (LKD-DWF-M) is proposed. In this strategy, a local knowledge diffusion mechanism is introduced to facilitate knowledge sharing among communication nodes, enabling each node to gain a comprehensive understanding of its neighbors’ behavior. Subsequently, a knowledge contribution measurement method based on mutual information is proposed, and a differential weighted fusion (DWF) mechanism is designed to effectively integrate the policy and value parameters of neighboring nodes. This integration enables accurate global value estimation while optimizing individual anti-jamming strategies. Additionally, the existence of the Nash equilibrium (NE) for each node’s policy and value parameters is theoretically established using Kakutani’s fixed-point theorem. Furthermore, through the construction of a Lyapunov function, it is demonstrated that the proposed strategy can stabilize and converge to the NE in the long-term jamming counteraction process. Simulation results indicate that, in comparison to anti-jamming strategies employing global knowledge diffusion and differential weighted fusion mechanism (GKD-DWF-M), global knowledge diffusion and average fusion (GKD-AF-M), and local knowledge diffusion and average fusion (LKD-AF-M), the proposed distributed anti-jamming strategy achieves respective improvements of 4%, 17%, and 20% in system normalized throughput under statistical jamming (SJ). Under dynamic sweeping jamming (DSJ), the system normalized throughput improves by 8%, 11%, and 11.5%, respectively; under intelligent comb jamming (ICJ), it increases by 10%, 10.5%, and 19%, respectively; and under intelligent block jamming (IBJ), it increases by 5%, 16%, and 21%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed strategy exhibits superior convergence speed compared to other strategies. When the jammer alternates between SJ, DSJ, ICJ, and IBJ, the proposed distributed anti-jamming strategy responds quickly, demonstrating robustness in dynamic jamming environments.},

  abstract     = {Electric network frequency (ENF) is an important criterion in audio forensic analysis. However, environmental uncertainties often introduce various types of noises, diminishing the number of useful ENF samples in audio recordings. This issue is even more challenging in short-duration recordings. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive-window-based harmonic recombination (AWHR) method, which can accurately estimate ENF from noisy audio. Initially, we identify noisy samples and use a metric called noise ratio (NR) to determine the optimal harmonic. Adaptive windows are selectively applied to the noisy samples of the optimal harmonic to mitigate frequency spikes, prevent distortions, and preserve signal quality. This step also reduces computational complexity by minimizing the number of samples requiring enhancement. Finally, via a proposed harmonic recombination mechanism, we improve the number of useful ENF samples, which reduces the NR. Given the lack of ENF datasets designed to evaluate considerably contaminated audio, we have also built an ENF noisy audio harmonic (ENF-NAH) dataset. Experiments on public ENF-WHU and our ENF-NAH datasets show that the proposed AWHR method is effective in handling varying levels of contamination and is applicable to both long and short audio recordings.},

In outsourced query scenarios, building query indexes is crucial for balancing data utility and data privacy protection. The hypercube tree is a widely used index for multi-dimensional data, supporting various query types. Although secure hypercube tree-based queries have been extensively studied in existing works, they are not applicable for building a hypercube tree over vertically distributed ciphertext data. To address this issue, we propose the first efficient and secure hypercube tree building scheme for vertically distributed data, named SCTBuild. We first design a flexible three-party secret sharing (fTPSS) scheme, allowing data owners to flexibly configure secret sharing forms based on real-world computational, communication, and storage constraints. Then, we design a communication-efficient data outsourcing algorithm, a secure data permutation algorithm, and a secure data comparison algorithm based on the fTPSS scheme. After that, we propose our SCTBuild scheme based on the aforementioned algorithms, in which data owners first perform pre-computation on their data to improve tree-building efficiency. We prove that our fTPSS scheme, private algorithms, and the SCTBuild scheme are semantically secure in the simulation-based real and ideal worlds security model; and conduct experiments to validate their high efficiency.},

This paper promotes LiSB, a novel approach for validating software/firmware integrity and ensuring secure boot-up for resource-constrained embedded devices. LiSB is lightweight, yet very robust. A hardware primitive is used as a Root-of-Trust to support the confidentiality of generated digests and the security of the attestation protocol. Specifically, LiSB employs Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to make the digest device-specific without storing any secrets in the device memory. The performance and robustness of LiSB are validated using a prototype implementation on an FPGA. The results demonstrate that LiSB outperforms recently-published and prominent commercial attestation schemes like TPM, and consumes 25 times less power than SHA-256, which serves as the core component of most existing attestation schemes.

The early and accurate detection of these schemes is crucial for preserving trust in the rapidly expanding cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, existing detection methods primarily rely on post-event analysis and heuristic-based approaches, which are often inadequate for real-time and precise identification of PD activities. In this paper, we present PumpWatcher, an innovative framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning to detect PD schemes by modeling transaction behaviors within temporal graphs. PumpWatcher integrates advanced transaction graph construction, temporal GNNs, and contrastive learning techniques to enhance node and edge representations, thereby improving the detection of intricate and covert PD operations. We validate PumpWatcher on a dataset from Uniswap, encompassing 924,508 transactions across 858 tokens within December 2022. The results show that PumpWatcher outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a superior balanced accuracy of 92.3%, while significantly minimizing false positives and negatives. These outcomes highlight its potential to set a new standard in real-time detection of market manipulation, paving the way for more secure and resilient DeFi ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Evaluating cryptographic implementations with respect to side-channel analysis (SCA) has been mandated at high security levels. Typically, the evaluation involves four stages: detection, modeling, certification and recovery. In pursuit of a specific goal at each stage, inherently different techniques were previously considered necessary. However, since the recent Eurocrypt 2022 and Eurocrypt 2024, linear regression analysis (LRA) has become the unique technique well-applied throughout all the stages. In this paper, we concentrate on this “silver bullet” technique within the field of SCA. In the first part of this paper, we answer three fundamental questions organized progressively. The first one relates to “why use LRA?”. Our discussion of the nominal and binary nature elucidates its critical role in underpinning the state-of-the-art techniques. Having understood the merits, a natural follow-up is “how to use it (correctly and effectively)?”. A theoretical analysis of the design matrix is provided, regarding the sample distribution of plaintext and the chosen degree of polynomial. We summarize the conditions for eliminating multicollinearity, a problem that can be harmful to all LRA-based techniques. The last question “who should use LRA?” reveals an intriguing evaluator-advantageous property: LRA can only unleash its full potential when the key is known. In the second part of this paper, we clarify the connections between LRA and traditional SCA techniques. Our proofs provide new insights into the prior investigation of SCA reduction, fostering a comprehensive understanding of this linear family. The conclusions suggest that the core working mechanisms of the state-of-the-art techniques can be traced back to those of earlier differential side-channel analyses. Experimental results are in line with the theory, confirming its correctness in practice.},

  abstract     = {Traditional malware detection techniques often struggle against the sophisticated obfuscation methods employed by modern malware. To address this challenge, this paper proposes HyperMD, a multi-modal malware detection method that leverages Xen as the malware analysis platform. HyperMD detects malware by using time-series Xen performance counter data collected at the hypervisor layer while running samples in a virtual machine (VM). Additionally, it incorporates an out-of-VM runtime process memory dump module to capture the target process’s memory. The acquired memory snapshots are then converted into images using SimHash. Finally, HyperMD fuses features from both time-series data and memory images to train a multi-modal deep learning model. We evaluated HyperMD using a dataset collected from VirusTotal and VirusShare, comprising sophisticated samples designed to evade detection or trigger false alarms. HyperMD achieves an accuracy of 97.53%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting rootkits and process injection malware. This proposed method can help detect obfuscated malware due to the utilization of hypervisor-layer features. Furthermore, HyperMD demonstrates a classification accuracy of 97.56% for five different malware families. The performance of HyperMD is also compared with other state-of-the-art static and dynamic detection methods, which further demonstrates the advantages of HyperMD. The robustness, resilience and scalability of HyperMD are also evaluated.},

  abstract     = {Text-based Person Search (TBPS) is a critical task in multimodal retrieval that seeks to identify target individuals in an image gallery using textual descriptions. The core challenge lies in establishing robust cross-modal alignment to reconcile the inherent heterogeneity between textual and visual representations. While recent advances leverage large-scale vision-language pretrained models (e.g., CLIP and ALBEF) to embed both modalities into a shared latent space, they often prioritize global feature alignment, neglecting localized interactions between textual tokens and image regions. To address these limitations, we propose the Learnable Prompts with Neighbor-aware Correction (LPNC) framework, which aligns identity-specific semantics across modalities while resolving fine-grained domain discrepancies. Specifically, we design a Learnable Prompt-guided Semantic Alignment (LPSA) module that dynamically fuses visual region features and textual token embeddings into a unified pseudo-token within a language-conditioned latent space. By introducing a cross-modal attention mechanism, LPSA enforces part-aware consistency, i.e., localized interactions between noun phrases and their corresponding visual patches, while suppressing modality-specific noise. To mitigate retrieval bias, we further propose the k-nearest Neighbor Correction (kNC), a training-free strategy that calibrates initial scores by leveraging local neighborhood relationships in a reference embedding space, ensuring balanced accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely-used TBPS datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LPNC method. Notably, our method exhibits consistent performance gains, demonstrating robust improvements of 1%–4% in Rank-1 accuracy compared to competing methods on various datasets.

  abstract     = {Due to the widespread use of mobile devices, it is essential to authenticate users on mobile devices to prevent sensitive information leakage. Biometrics-based authentication is prevalent on smart devices to verify the legitimacy of users, but is vulnerable to replay attacks. In this paper, we propose to leverage the distinctive finger tap gesture during unlocking smartphone to establish a secure multi-factor authentication system, named FingerVib. Compared with other biometric-based authentication systems, FingerVib does not require users to remember any complicated information (e.g., hand gestures, doodles) and the working type is unobtrusive. When users unlock their phones by tapping, FingerVib utilizes the microphone to record the sound produced by fingers tapping on the phone and adopts IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to extract the vibration of users’ smartphones. One key contribution is that we model the inherent correlation between sounds and vibration signals. Specifically, FingerVib captures two novel reactions to describe how the individual’s contact palm modulates signals in two different domains. Based on these two responses, we develop a real-time noise-resistant unlocking activity detection algorithm, which allows accurate unlocking signal segmentation even if the two modalities are interfered. Further, we develop a modal fusion model where the model extracts cross-modal features and acquires inter-modal correlation features to ensure consistent performance of inference even when modalities are disturbed. In a user study with 41 participants, FingerVib achieves an authentication accuracy of 98.53% and an average performance of 1.36% FAR, 2.76% FRR and 2.72% EER against replay attacks and impersonation attacks. FingerVib’s fusion approach improves identification performance by roughly 9.7% and 11.6% over Wavocie and AUDIOIMU, respectively, within existing multi-modal fusion systems. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FingerVib under various conditions.},

This model takes into account static basic rewards, dynamic whale rewards related to network protocol, and expenditures tied to players’ strategies. Unlike traditional incentive models that assume players continuously mine by default, we find players prefer to halt mining at the beginning of each mining cycle to reduce operational expenses and then resume mining at an appropriate time to enhance their rewards. We further prove players’ optimal strategy exists and it is determined by reward parameters. We implement a modified PoW blockchain system simulator and comprehensively validate these results using 256 full nodes in it of three mainstream PoW blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum 1.x, and Bitcoin Cash.

  abstract     = {This paper studies the online reward poisoning problem, wherein an adversary deliberately manipulates the reward function during training to mislead the learning agent into adopting a mischievous policy. While the majority of existing reward poisoning research focuses on offline attacks, which assume prior knowledge of the transition probability, our work explores a more practical yet challenging dynamics-agnostic scenario. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the adversary has access to the agent’s replay buffer and can modify the reward data without the knowledge of transition probabilities. We formalize the poisoning task as an optimization problem and employ a reformulation method to circumvent the double-sampling issue. The proposed algorithm is provably convergent in the tabular setting and can be extended to the function approximation setting, where the poisoned reward network and the poisoned Q-value network are jointly learned to solve the problem. The algorithm’s effectiveness is validated through four distinct experimental evaluations.},

These improvements in portability and stealth have led to the practical applicability of inaudible attacks and their adaptation to a wider range of scenarios. We demonstrate how the recent advancement in metamaterials can be utilized to design a voice attack system with carefully selected implementation parameters and commercial off-the-shelf components.

  abstract     = {Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables an untrusted server to collect and analyze sensitive data while preserving user privacy. Recent studies reveal that LDP protocols are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an adversary can manipulate aggregated frequencies by controlling malicious users to send forged data to the server. Some countermeasures have been proposed to mitigate poisoning attacks, but they have limitations: 1) requiring prior knowledge of the attack type; 2) exhibiting poor resistance to the adaptive maximal gain attack, i.e., MGA-A. To address the two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel detection scheme named Group Filter Detection (GFD) to defend against poisoning attacks on LDP frequency estimation. GFD is a universal defense scheme, which can be applied to any LDP frequency estimation protocol without the prior knowledge of attack types, and exhibits high robustness against various poisoning attacks. GFD can first identify the adversary’s target itemset and then filters the suspicious perturbed data (from malicious users). In this way, GFD can exclude malicious data with high confidence, thereby improving the accuracy of LDP frequency estimation. Compared with the existing solutions, experimental results demonstrate the highest effectiveness of GFD.},

With the assistance of 6G mobile communication facilities and artificial intelligence technology, the IoD system progressively enables real-time communication among remote users, ground control centers and drone clusters. At the same time, the dynamically updated, open, and interoperable communication environment also poses some risks to the IoD system’s security and privacy. The security attributes of the IoD system are insufficiently met by the authentication schemes currently in use. In light of the aforementioned factors, this paper suggests CSAP-IoD, a lightweight secure communication protocol for anonymous interactions that uses the initial value sensitivity and orbital unpredictability of chaotic map. It utilizes fuzzy verifier technology to achieve three-factor security and facilitates mutual authentication and key agreement among the three-party communicating entities of IoD. Real-or-Random (ROR) model, informal security analysis, and the Scyther tool are used to assess the protocol’s security in multiple dimensions, and it has been demonstrated that CSAP-IoD can withstand a variety of attacks. Based on simulation results and a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art IoD communication protocols in terms of security features, computation cost, communication cost, and energy consumption, CSAP-IoD shows the optimal security performance while emphasizing the efficiency advantage, offering a dependable solution to guarantee the information security of IoD system communication.},

  abstract     = {Speculative execution introduces serious security vulnerabilities, particularly in the form of speculative cache side-channel (SCS) attacks, which exploit the states of the cache system to leak sensitive data from a victim’s memory space. Existing hardware defense solutions against SCS attacks remain limited in effectively addressing these threats in real-world scenarios due to their significant overhead and/or inadequate security. Therefore, this paper proposes SCSGuardian, a practical hardware defense framework against SCS attacks. SCSGuardian addresses two key issues in defending against SCS attacks, i.e., when to initiate and lift protection for unsafe speculative memory access micro-operations ( $\mu $ ops), and what the scope of such $\mu $ ops that require protection is. On the above basis, a low-overhead method is proposed for tracking unsafe speculative memory access $\mu $ ops based on various speculation windows within processors and attack principles of SCS attacks. Tailored hardware $\mu $ op-delaying strategies are then proposed, which delay unsafe speculative memory access $\mu $ ops at different stages of the memory access pipeline based on their impact on various states of the cache system. These strategies efficiently protect cache system components from SCS attacks while avoiding unnecessary delays on memory access $\mu $ ops, ensuring comprehensive security with optimized performance. SCSGuardian has been implemented in two versions, i.e., v1 and v2, targeting single-core and multi-core processors, respectively. SCSGuardian v1 and v2 defend against the SCS attacks with negligible hardware resource overheads of only 0.111 % and 0.268 %, respectively. Moreover, on SPEC2017, SCSGuardian v1 exhibits performance overheads of only 4.62% and 3.82%, and v2 only 5.97% and 5.47%, both in the RISC-V core-based FPGA prototype experiment and the x86 out-of-order CPU model-based Gem5 simulation, respectively.},

In this paper, we put forward the Feedback-information Enhanced Password Guesser (FEPGuesser). We demonstrate, for the first time, how Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning can integrate password knowledge, natural language understanding and bidirectional attention mechanisms to well capture semantic in password sets. Additionally, we propose the novel structure of PassExBertVAE which integrates pre-trained model with Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) architecture for password guessing. We devise the algorithm which can make full use of the inherent properties of the password latent space generated by PassExBertVAE. This algorithm simulates real-world attack scenarios by leveraging attack feedback information to enhance cracking effectiveness. Experiments show that FEPGuesser overall achieves better results than PCFG, FLA, OMEN, PassGAN, PassFlow, DPG and VAEPass. Especially, on the most complex 000webhost dataset, FEPGuesser surpasses the latest PCFG model by 8.75 percentage points and exceeds the DPG model based on representation learning by 34.11 percentage points. Furthermore, cross-site attack experiments show that FEPGuesser is more target-adaptive than PCFG and other deep learning models.},

To address this issue, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving spatial-keyword range query processing in cloud in this paper. First, a keyword, location and range vectorization model is proposed. By using the vectorization and vector encryption, the spatial-keyword information is encrypted for confidentiality preservation. On the basis of the vectorization model and vector encryption, an equal partition-based keyword-location inverted index (EPKI-index) is constructed, and then we introduce the baseline spatial-keyword range query scheme (EPSRQ) by adopting the EPKI-index. To improve query efficiency, a binary keyword-filtering tree index (BKFtree-index) is designed, and the corresponding optimized range query scheme (EPSRQ+) is proposed. In addition, the game simulation-based proof is presented to analyze the security of the proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has better performance on the query efficiency and storage.},

  abstract     = {Differential privacy federated learning (DPFL) has garnered tremendous attentions for its ability to preserve clients’ privacy during model training. However, directly training multi-modal models within DPFL frameworks often results in inferior learning performance because: 1) Multi-modal imbalance, a common issue in model training, is not considered in DPFL when determining scales of artificial noises (ANs) generated by differential privacy (DP); 2) ANs will alter the impacts of individual modalities on the training process, further deteriorating the performance of multi-modal learning. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal differential privacy federated learning (MDPFL) framework to address these issues. To be specific, we first design a parameter-clipping method that is capable of handling heterogeneous quality of modalities. Then we theoretically analyze the influence of variations in modality quality on learning performance by deriving the upper bound of loss functions. Next, based on our analysis, we construct a heuristic criterion to effectively assess the contributions of each client’s uni-modal models (obfuscated by ANs) to the overall learning performance. We further design a modality selection algorithm to enhance learning performance by discarding modalities with low contributions (due to the influence of ANs). Extensive experimental results validate our theoretical analysis on modality contributions to the learning performance in terms of accuracy. Also, experimental results demonstrate that our parameter-clipping method tailored for the MDPFL significantly enhances the accuracy performance compared to conventional clipping method within DPFL frameworks, yielding improvements of up to 10%, and the proposed modality selection algorithm can further boost classification accuracy by 4%.},

  abstract     = {The Classic McEliece key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), a candidate in the fourth-round post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization process by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), stands out for its conservative design and robust security guarantees. Its deployment is impeded by exceptionally large public and secret keys. Modern GPUs offer abundant parallelism and global memory, making them well suited to such key sizes and to high-throughput cryptographic workloads. However, there has not been a systematic implementation of Classic McEliece on GPU platforms. This paper presents the first high-performance implementation of Classic McEliece on NVIDIA GPUs. Firstly, we present the first GPU-based implementation of Classic McEliece, utilizing a “CPU-GPU” heterogeneous approach and a kernel fusion strategy. We significantly reduce global memory accesses, optimizing memory access patterns. This results in encapsulation and decapsulation performance of 28,628,195 ops/s and 3,051,701 ops/s, respectively, for McEliece348864. Secondly, core operations like Additive Fast Fourier Transforms (AFFT), and Transpose AFFT (TAFFT) are optimized. We introduce the concept of the (T)AFFT stepping chain and propose two universal schemes: Memory Access Stepping Strategy (MASS) and Layer-Fused Memory Access Stepping Strategy (LFMASS), which achieve a speedup of 30.56% and 38.37%, respectively, compared to the native GPU-based McEliece6960119 implementation. Thirdly, extensive experiments on the NVIDIA RTX4090 show significant performance gains, achieving up to $344\times $ higher encapsulation and $125\times $ higher decapsulation compared to the official CPU-based AVX implementation, decisively outperforming existing ARM Cortex-M4 and FPGA implementations.},

However, current fake image detection models and databases focus on binary classification without understandable explanations for the general populace. This weakens the credibility of authenticity judgment and may conceal potential model biases. Meanwhile, large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited immense vision-language capabilities on various tasks, bringing the potential for explainable fake image detection. Therefore, we pioneer the probe of LMMs for explainable fake image detection by presenting a multimodal database encompassing descriptions of textual authenticity, the FakeBench. For construction, we first introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of generative visual forgery concerning human perception, based on which we collect forgery descriptions in human natural language with a human-in-the-loop strategy. FakeBench examines LMMs with four evaluation criteria: detection, reasoning, explanation and fine-grained forgery analysis, to obtain deeper insights into image authenticity-relevant capabilities. Experiments on various LMMs confirm their merits and demerits in different aspects of fake image detection tasks. This research presents a paradigm shift towards transparency for the fake image detection area and reveals the need for greater emphasis on forensic elements in visual-language research and AI risk control.

  abstract     = {Data cleaning improves quality and consistency by detecting, localizing, and repairing “dirty” data without compromising sensitive information. Collaborative Data Cleaning employs a distributed model to avoid single points of failure and trust issues in centralized systems, although it incurs additional communication overhead. Blass et al. (S&P’23) were the first to implement CDC via balanced Private Set Intersection (PSI). Unbalanced PSI (e.g., uPSI-CA, USENIX’23) does not address the localization of intersections within datasets and thus cannot be directly applied to CDC. uPSI-based data cleaning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an efficient CDC scheme for unbalanced datasets, named uECDC. uECDC employs oblivious key-value stores for slice matching, achieving: 1) a reduction of 18% $\thicksim ~85$ % in offline phase runtime, and 2) a reduction of 8% $\thicksim ~43$ % in online phase runtime (under large-scale data settings on the server side), when compared to the slice-linking approach of uPSI-CA. Moreover, we encode server-side data for fast localization of intersection data in unbalanced settings. Under the semi-honest adversary model, uECDC is provably secure.

  abstract     = {Vertical federated learning for boosting trees has gained significant attention due to its ability to enable participants to collaboratively train high-quality models while preserving data privacy. However, existing privacy-preserving vertical boosting tree schemes suffer from high computation and communication costs or potential security vulnerabilities. Recently, SGBoost, a federated outsourced training and inference scheme, was proposed to address these challenges. However, its performance and security still require significant improvements. Therefore, we propose SGBoost+, an efficient and privacy-preserving vertical boosting tree framework for federated outsourced training and inference. Building upon the strengths of SGBoost, we introduce an RLWE-based lossless and secure internal node construction and an efficient oblivious inference algorithm to finish the model training and inference, significantly enhancing both security and efficiency. To reduce communication cost, we design a ciphertext compression algorithm for model training, which drastically minimizes data transmission costs. Additionally, we analyze the security of a symmetric encryption scheme, specify the required security conditions and parameters, and optimize our model inference based on its improved and secure version. Detailed security analysis confirms that SGBoost+ offers strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGBoost+ achieves efficient model training and inference with significantly lower computation and communication costs compared to state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Graph encryption is a form of searchable encryption that enables a cloud server to handle private queries on graphs. Ghosh, Kamara, and Tamassia (ASIA CCS 2021) proposed the first graph encryption scheme (GES) that supports single-pair shortest path (SPSP) queries. This means that given two vertices in a graph, the scheme can return the shortest path between them. In traditional SPSP queries, clients are required to provide complete and precise information about their departure and destination points. However, in real-life situations, individuals often only have a general idea of their intended locations, lacking specific details. To address this issue, we introduce a new type of SPSP query known as the SPSP fuzzy query, which accommodates this uncertainty. In addition, we propose PathFQ-GES, an efficient graph encryption scheme that supports both conventional SPSP queries and the new SPSP fuzzy queries. PathFQ-GES utilizes a novel data structure along with the SP-matrix (ASIA CCS 2021) to effectively perform these query functions while maintaining adaptive security based on the defined leakage profile of PathFQ-GES. We take a method that executes the GKT scheme multiple times for SPSP fuzzy queries as the baseline and have experimentally validated the performance of PathFQ-GES on nine real-world datasets. The results show that PathFQ-GES can effectively handle the proposed SPSP fuzzy queries. It can achieve a decrease of over 50% in response time compared to the baseline.},

  abstract     = {For preeminent unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (US-VI-ReID), existing studies typically adhere to a two-step paradigm, i.e., intra-modality clustering and inter-modality matching. Nevertheless, high intra-modality variations may result in suboptimal clusters containing intricate pedestrians, while significant inter-modality discrepancies further complicate their cross-modality associations. Most existing methods fail to adopt a differentiated approach for samples of varying difficulty, especially intricate ones. To address this, we propose enabling the model to gradually establish cross-modality associations from easy to hard, mimicking human learning patterns to avoid error accumulation caused by intricate pedestrians. To this end, we propose a Cross-modality Self-paced Association Network, termed CSANet, embracing Twain Bipartite Graph Matching (TBGM), Cross-curriculum Association Prompter (CAP) and Instance-Prototype Consistency Constraint (IPCC) modules. TBGM conceives a graph-driven metric to tailor a three-level curriculum (plain, moderate and intricate) for self-paced cross-modality learning. CAP transfers high-confidence associations deduced from the plain subsets to intricate ones, prompting exploring more complex cross-modality relationships. Alongside CAP, IPCC further enforces the intricate instances to mimic their prototype characteristics, facilitating their discriminative feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate CSANet’s superiority over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential of self-paced learning for US-VI-ReID.},

  abstract     = {Due to the strong untraceability of mixing services, numerous criminals exploit these services to engage in illicit activities, posing a significant threat to the blockchain ecosystem. This paper addresses the challenge of linking transaction addresses in Tornado Cash, a popular mixing service on Ethereum. While existing state-of-the-art solutions like MixBroker attempt to address this problem, two fundamental limitations persist: insufficient utilization of neighbor information and neglect of address information asymmetry. To address these gaps, a novel framework termed “MixLinker” is proposed, which enhances neighbor information utilization and models information asymmetry. Specifically, a Normalized Adjusted Personal PageRank (NAPPR) module is designed to prioritize significant neighbor nodes while mitigating interference from super and irrelevant addresses. Additionally, tensors are employed to model transactions, capturing rich interaction features related to transaction attributes. Based on historical transaction sequences, Tensor Long Short-Term Memory (TLSTM) is used to obtain high-quality initial input features for the Graph Neural Network (GNN) module, enabling effective learning of nonlinear dynamics. To ensure symmetric output results and model asymmetric information, a temporal-aware symmetry classifier is constructed that leverages asymmetric information through permutation operations and an order-aware classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixLinker outperforms other methods, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach and confirming the two underlying motivations.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) enables vehicles to collaboratively train a global model for intelligent transportation systems while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, the openness and dynamic nature of VANETs introduce significant security challenges, including identity privacy leakage, model inversion attacks, and compromised model integrity. Existing cryptographic solutions, such as differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, provide partial mitigation but suffer from drawbacks including inefficiency, limited data utility, and vulnerability to data poisoning attacks. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces FedLG, a generic certificateless (CL) authentication scheme with conditional anonymity. FedLG ensures trustworthy FL by integrating multiple security mechanisms that together guarantee model authenticity, data integrity, and privacy. Specifically, FedLG leverages Type-T signatures as a blackbox to ensure the authenticity and integrity of model parameters shared by anonymous vehicles. Additionally, we introduce a novel public key reconstruction mechanism to enhance the security of traditional CL-based systems, effectively mitigating common public key replacement attacks. FedLG also incorporates batch verification with an adaptive group batch verification algorithm, dynamically adjusting batch sizes to identify invalid signatures while preserving valid data, thereby facilitating faster model convergence. Moreover, FedLG maintains the utility of user-contributed data and can seamlessly integrate it with data poisoning attack prevention mechanisms to enhance security further. Experimental results show that FedLG is model-independent, as its integration does not affect the original model’s performance on its dataset. Moreover, it reduces the computational overhead of signature generation and verification by at least 30.8% and 56.3%, respectively, achieving an overall efficiency improvement of 49.69% compared to state-of-the-art FL authentication protocols for VANETs.},

We propose FakePPG, which utilizes a low-cost Liquid Crystal Modulator (LCM) device to mimic the PPG signals of a legitimate user, thus deceiving both the PPG-based health assessment and potential authentication applications. To implement FakePPG in practical scenarios, we build the attack prototype using commercial off-the-shelf electronic components and further design an automated optimization and attack framework. By leveraging the modified multi-Gaussian model for parameterization, the evolutionary strategy for optimization, and the reference heart rate model for heartbeat variability alignment, FakePPG can achieve efficient, flexible, and automated PPG forgery against arbitrary users and heart states. Extensive experimental results show that FakePPG can achieve a success rate of 96.7% for Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) spoofing and 91.2% for identity spoofing, respectively, revealing a realistic threat to PPG systems.},

  abstract     = {Cryptocurrencies and permissionless blockchains allow nodes from all over the world to join, and their rapid development has created enormous blockchain networks with nodes spanning the globe. Blockchain network partitioning attacks split the network into separate node groups through disrupting communication, causing information inconsistency, and facilitating malicious behaviors like double-spending and selfish mining, threatening the blockchain security. Existing research primarily studies concrete partitioning attack methods. However, it is hard to analyze practical post-attack security and efficiency impacts on blockchains and design effective countermeasures. This paper studies practical network partitioning attacks’ impacts on existing proof-of-work-based (Bitcoin) and proof-of-stake-based (Ethereum) permissionless blockchains. We theoretically analyze and experimentally confirm the adverse effects of network partitioning on blockchain performance and security. Network partitioning will cause blockchain throughput to plummet, and cause block generation delay to increase rapidly. In our experiments on Ethereum 2.0, when the bandwidth between the partitioned networks is lower than 768 Kbps, the throughput begins to plummet precipitously until it ultimately falls to 0. What’s worse, network partitioning will significantly increase the success rate of double-spending. In our experiments on Bitcoin, when the bandwidth between the partitioned networks is less than 256 Kbps, the success rate of double-spending reaches 50%. To solve the above issues, we propose countermeasures leveraging a freezing threshold to safeguard the security of permissionless blockchains and resist double-spending attacks. We experimentally validate that the countermeasures enhance the resistance of permissionless blockchains to network partitioning attacks. It reduces the probability of double-spending in partitioned networks, thereby ensuring security and reliability.},

To this end, an adaptive modulus (AM) encryption algorithm is first proposed. To further enhance security without requiring additional storage for new key matrices, a self-updating encryption order (SUEO) algorithm is designed. Furthermore, a diagonal block local transpose key matrix (DBLTKM) encryption algorithm is presented, which effectively expands the feasible domain of the key space. Building upon these three algorithms, a novel joint AM-SUEO-DBLTKM encryption algorithm is constructed. Making full use of the strengths of the proposed joint algorithm, a two-way RFID authentication protocol, named AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID, is proposed specifically for mobile RFID systems. In addition, the Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and security analysis indicate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol can effectively combat various typical attacks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM algorithm can save 99.59% of tag storage over traditional algorithms. Finally, the proposed AM-SUEO-DBLTKM-RFID protocol achieves both low computational complexity and low storage overhead, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained, low-cost RFID tags.},

  abstract     = {Byzantine broadcast (BC) is a fundamental problem in distributed systems. To build communication-efficient BC protocols, erasure coding is a key tool. In systems under the $f\lt n/3$ setting, where n is the total number of parties (also called replicas) and f is the number of Byzantine failures, correct replicas can simply encode the data block through erasure coding, share data fragments, and interact to validate that the decoded data is consistent with the original data block. Such a paradigm is powerful in primitives such as BC, asynchronous verifiable information dispersal, and atomic broadcast. However, in systems with corrupt majority or even in the $f\lt n/2$ setting, it becomes less straightforward to use erasure coding to build communication-efficient protocols. In this work, we introduce an erasure coding proof (ECP) system which allows the encoder to prove succinctly and non-interactively that an erasure-coded fragment is consistent with a constant-sized commitment to the original data block. Each fragment can be verified independently of the other fragments. We present two synchronous BC protocols from the ECP system, one under the $f\lt (1-\epsilon)n$ assumption and one under the $f\lt n/2$ assumption, where $\epsilon $ is a constant and $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ . Both protocols improve the communication complexity and time complexity compared to the state-of-the-art BC protocols.},

  abstract     = {Previous studies identified NTT-based polynomial multiplication in Dilithium as a primary target for side-channel analysis. Specifically, the leakage of $\hat {\mathbf {u}} = \hat {\mathbf {c}} \hat {\mathbf {s}}_{1}$ has been exploited to recover the private key $\mathbf {s}_{1}$ using correlation power analysis (CPA). However, evaluating the side-channel resistance of NTT-based polynomial multiplication solely through CPA is insufficient. Given that template attack (TA) is information-theoretically the most powerful form of side-channel attack, it is imperative to evaluate the resistance of NTT-based polynomial multiplication in Dilithium under TA. Moreover, previous studies have not exploited the leakage of $\hat {\mathbf {w}} = \hat {\mathbf {A}} \hat {\mathbf {y}}$ to recover $\mathbf {s}_{1}$ . In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that the leakage of $\hat {\mathbf {w}} = \hat {\mathbf {A}} \hat {\mathbf {y}}$ can be effectively exploited in TA to recover $\mathbf {s}_{1}$ . Notably, the leakage of $\hat {\mathbf {w}} = \hat {\mathbf {A}} \hat {\mathbf {y}}$ can be up to K times the leakage of $\hat {\mathbf {u}} = \hat {\mathbf {c}} \hat {\mathbf {s}}_{1}$ , offering significant improvements in the efficiency of TA. We further propose a multivariate template attack (MTA) that jointly exploits both leakage sources $\hat {\mathbf {w}} = \hat {\mathbf {A}} \hat {\mathbf {y}}$ and $\hat {\mathbf {u}} = \hat {\mathbf {c}} \hat {\mathbf {s}}_{1}$ to recover $\mathbf {s}_{1}$ , thus achieving even higher efficiency in key recovery. We evaluate three versions of TA in both simulated and real-world scenarios. In the simulated scenario where the signal-to-noise ratio of both leakage sources ranges from 1 to 0.1, MTA consistently performs the best. In a real-world scenario targeting the Dilithium reference implementation on a Cortex-M4 processor, MTA again achieves the best performance, requiring only 15, 11, and 9 traces to recover $\mathbf {s}_{1}$ for Dilithium 2, 3, and 5, respectively. Overall, MTA is proved to be a powerful tool for evaluating the side-channel resistance of NTT-based polynomial multiplication in Dilithium in leakage profiling scenarios.},

However, these ML solutions face challenges in producing explainable and human-readable results, limiting their practical deployment. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for transparent ML malware analysis through analyzing character-level features. Despite this potential, the redundant nature of binary files and ambiguous reasoning patterns pose fundamental challenges in applying LLMs to malware binary analysis. To address these challenges, we propose Anti-Virus Agent (AV-Agent), a framework based on large language models for malware detection. AV-Agent implements a streamlined feature processing pipeline, including multi-layer hierarchical feature classifiers, character feature extraction, and two-phase reasoning. By capturing critical malware features, AV-Agent leverages frontier LLMs’ inherent knowledge to achieve transparent and effective malware analysis. Experimental results on a representative dataset indicate that AV-Agent attains comparable performance to analogous machine learning methods, while also providing an explainable malware analysis process. Additionally, the experiments analyzed the parameter settings of AV-Agent and characteristics of experimental results, demonstrating that AV-Agent achieved optimal performance under the specified parameter conditions while maintaining sufficient stability in malware classification outcomes.

Furthermore, obtaining high-precision recognition models is greatly hindered by pattern variance, a notable challenge with the palmprint modality given the current technology pipeline. To address the above problems, we first collect a palmprint dataset, WebPalm, that contains the largest number of identities as well as images that have been disclosed so far. To reduce pattern variance, we propose RegPalm, a novel framework that unifies palmprint orientations (UPO) and learns pairwise spatial registration of palmprints (PPR) in an end-to-end manner. UPO harmonizes the pattern variance between left and right orientations, hence enhancing the network’s perceptual capabilities. PPR decreases both inter-class and intra-class pattern variance to improve the model’s ability to recognize hard examples. RegPalm reinforces the model by discriminating subtle palmprint features, thereby improving its performance under extremely low FAR. RegPalm not only surpasses the current state-of-the-art by 9.3 percentage points (pp) and 12.2 pp in TAR@FAR=1e-6 under the 1:1 and 1:3 open-set protocols, respectively, but also consistently achieves a 16 pp improvement in TAR@FAR=1e-9 on the WebPalm benchmark. The experimental results fully reveal the practicability and superiority of RegPalm in the real world.},

  abstract     = {Generalized age feature extraction is crucial for age-related facial analysis tasks, such as age estimation and age-invariant face recognition (AIFR). Despite the recent successes of models in homogeneous-dataset experiments, their performance drops significantly in cross-dataset evaluations. Most of these models fail to extract generalized age features as they only attempt to map extracted features with training age labels directly without explicitly modeling the natural ordinal progression of aging. In this paper, we propose Order-Enhanced Contrastive Learning (OrdCon), a novel contrastive learning framework designed explicitly for ordinal attributes like age. Specifically, to extract generalized features, OrdCon aligns the direction vector of two features with either the natural aging direction or its reverse to model the ordinal process of aging. To further enhance generalizability, OrdCon leverages a novel soft proxy matching loss as a second contrastive objective, ensuring that features are positioned around the center of each age cluster with minimal intra-class variance and proportionally away from other clusters. By modeling the ageing process, the framework can enhance generalizability by improving the alignment of samples from the same class and reducing the divergence of direction vectors. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets in homogeneous-dataset evaluations for both age estimation and AIFR. In cross-dataset experiments, OrdCon outperforms other methods by reducing the mean absolute error by approximately 1.38 on average for the age estimation task and boosts the average accuracy for AIFR by 1.87%.},

In auctions, bidders’ bids and participants’ identities are considered critical private information. However, existing works either only achieve bid privacy or fail to provide complete protection of identity. In this work, we propose the first sealed-bid auction scheme that achieves both bid privacy and identity privacy, called Boreas. We propose three fundamental protocols as the building blocks. In particular, anonymous submission enables sellers to submit items anonymously, oblivious bidding and locker transaction enable the seller and the winner to confirm the auction results and complete the transaction without knowing each other’s identity. Meanwhile, we formally define the security goal of identity privacy and formalize a new security property called: fully anonymous. We prove the security of our scheme in the semi-honest adversary model. We implement Boreas and run experiments comparing its performance against existing schemes. Our experiments show that Boreas improves computation time by 12.6% and reduces communication costs by $10^{3} \times $ in handling a large-scale auction, while offering stronger security guarantee.},

However, its three-chain model has poor robustness against the performance attacks, particularly the forking attack. Some recent works have employed the two-chain model to enhance the robustness, but they either lose the optimistic responsiveness or introduce huge latency. In our work, we present Short-HotStuff, a two-chain BFT algorithm with linear communication complexity and optimistic responsiveness. In the two-chain model without waiting for a maximum network delay, the leader has to convince the other nodes that its proposed block is on a safe path when the previous leader fails, otherwise, the hidden lock will cause the liveness issue. Contrary to some existing BFT algorithms that rely on broadcasting multiple Quorum Certificates (QCs) or introduce extra phases, our Short-HotStuff requires the leader to broadcast the highest QC, as well as the evidence performed by a threshold signature with only a constant size, and such evidence can prove that its proposed block is indeed extended from a safe path. We have conducted the experiments to compare our Short-HotStuff with HotStuff, Marlin and Fast-HotStuff. The results indicate that compared with HotStuff, Short-HotStuff achieves a 35% reduction in average latency without the leader failing, and doubles the average throughput in the face of forking attacks. In the event of the leader failing, the average latency of Short-HotStuff is reduced by 43% and 82% respectively compared with Marlin and Fast-HotStuff.},

To address these issues, this paper proposes a new access control policy language called PERM, which achieves flexible support for various fine-grained access control models by separating authorization logic from specific policy rules, and significantly reduces the complexity of policy definition. In addition, we also design a distributed PERM enforcement framework named List-Leafed Decision Tree (L2DT), which leverages a list-tree structure and distributed key-value storage to achieve efficient policy storage and execution. We implement prototypes of PERM and L2DT based on Java and Python, and conduct comprehensive evaluations using OpenStack and XACML datasets. Experimental results show that L2DT can achieve scalable policy execution with small latency overhead (an average of 8.63% in the OpenStack scenario and 5.45% in the XACML scenario).

  abstract     = {Model Inversion Attacks (MIAs) against face recognition systems aim to reconstruct facial images of specific individuals from the recognition models. Existing MIA approaches commonly optimize the latent variables of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) iteratively, which can result in non-smooth optimizations due to the complexity and entanglement of latent space. Furthermore, the optimization guided by the target model’s gradients may generate high-confidence images with poor perceptual similarity to the target class. This paper introduces a novel perspective by reformulating the inversion attack as a conditional data distribution learning task. Based on this, we propose a Feature-Guided Model Inversion Attack (FGMIA), which learns the facial data distribution and integrates feature guidance as a conditional signal. Specifically, we treat the deconstructed target model as a feature encoder, which provides guidance during the training of a specialized feature-guided diffusion model. During the attack, feature encodings implicit in the target model are extracted and utilized to guide the reconstruction of private data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGMIA accurately reconstructs private data from face recognition models and significantly improves evaluation accuracy and perceptual similarity compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable target confidence scores.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising collaborative framework within the field of machine learning (ML), offering the potential to train ML models on sensitive real-world data while maintaining data privacy. The primary security concerns surrounding FL, particularly the protection of local gradients’ privacy and ensuring the correctness of aggregated gradients, have attracted growing attention in both industry and academia. Recently, Du et al. proposed SVHFL, a secure and verifiable hybrid FL system. In this context, the term “secure” means that SVHFL functions as a privacy-preserving federated learning (PPFL) system, capable of protecting the privacy of local gradients from being learned by the server (i.e., the aggregator) and the clients, and “verifiable” implies that SVHFL can achieve the aggregation verification, i.e., it guarantees the correctness of aggregated gradients returned by the server. However, in this article, we propose two attacks that compromise SVHFL, demonstrating that SVHFL cannot protect the privacy of local gradients from being learned by the server and the clients. We analyze the internal causes of these privacy breaches in SVHFL and propose alternative solutions to prevent such privacy leaks. We hope that the exposure of these security vulnerabilities will act as a catalyst to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future design of PPFL systems.},

Our approach introduces a novel index construction method based on prime number aggregation, which significantly reduces the number of comparisons required in multi-keyword searches, thereby improving efficiency. Security analysis confirms that $\mathsf { STE}$ - $\mathsf { BQ}$ satisfies CQA2-security. Experimental evaluations further demonstrate that $\mathsf { STE}$ - $\mathsf { BQ}$ achieves optimal performance in conjunctive query processing.

We prove the selective chosen-ciphertext security of our construction under the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption, zero-knowledge, and soundness of a non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof system.

Limited by enormous parameter spaces, current methods rely on heuristic tests to evaluate interference potential but cannot thoroughly investigate the full spectrum of potential hidden interference. The observation that similar interference trigger configurations lead to the same impact has motivated us to use machine learning algorithms for understanding different impact samples around decision boundaries. By leveraging generalized knowledge of responses against specific attack scenarios, we aim to improve the efficiency of automated attack surface assessment of electromagnetic interference on new targets. To this end, we introduce EMFuzz, an automated mechanism to fuzz hardware to quantify varying adverse effects. We evaluate EMFuzz on 16 new servos within real-world scenarios, where it achieves an 86% accuracy in classifying different attack vectors. With the same test time, EMFuzz uncovers over twice the effective attack configurations of the baseline, greatly improving assessment efficiency. To further validate its efficacy, we apply EMFuzz to assess the attack surface of a new actuator from a robot transfer unit, and it can successfully reveal three distinct adverse effects.},

  abstract     = {In panoramic and immersive virtual reality (VR) scenarios, users type on a floating and invisible keyboard, which cannot be observed by external adversaries, creating the illusion that their input is confidential. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging side-channel information (e.g., vision, Wi-Fi) to eavesdrop on keystrokes in VR, they assume users typically type with fixed gestures, similar to using traditional physical keyboards. However, in real world scenarios, VR creates a 3D immersive environment, allowing users to type from varying orientations. This variation significantly degrades the quality of side-channel information (e.g., occlusion in vision, instability in Wi-Fi channels), leading to ineffective inference. In this study, we propose a multi-modal keystroke eavesdropping attack called WiViLeak, which combines Wi-Fi and vision information to complement each other. To address low-quality side-channel data caused by users’ varying orientations, we develop a theoretical model to explore the relationship between users’ hand movements in physical space (from the vision modality) and fluctuating Wi-Fi signals (from the wireless modality) as users change orientation. Based on this, we design a fully transformer based orientation calibration module to recover users’ vision data, aligning it as if they were facing the camera (i.e., in a front-facing view). Meanwhile, WiViLeak reconstructs Wi-Fi data to correspond to the front-facing view, utilizing the orientation angle derived from vision data. Finally, WiViLeak extracts effective features from reconstructed, high-quality vision and Wi-Fi data to predict keystrokes. We implement a WiViLeak prototype, achieving 89.2% accuracy in eavesdropping keystrokes and 93.6% top-100 password theft accuracy, while also demonstrating robustness across various real world VR scenarios, including payments, chatting, and meetings.},

  abstract     = {Existing deepfake detectors predominantly process entire facial images as input, which limits their sensitivity to local forgery cues due to representation bias and information loss through CNN feature aggregation. To address these limitations, we propose IDCNet, a novel deepfake detection framework based on image decomposition and cross-view distillation. Our key insight is that decomposing images into complementary views enables specialized processing of global and local forgery cues, while cross-view distillation facilitates their mutual enhancement. Specifically, the framework employs a lightweight U-Net generator with a dual-objective mechanism to decompose input images into global content and local detail views, optimized through reconstruction and classification losses. A cross-view distillation strategy is then applied to enhance complementary feature learning between views. Furthermore, to integrate local artifact information into existing detection models without architectural modifications, we propose a feature alignment method. Extensive experiments across 14 forgery methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 4.4% AUC improvement on the CDFV2 dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract     = {The fifth-generation mobile communication technology (5G) supports wireless data transmission across civil, commercial, industrial, and even military networks, where vast amounts of privacy data are constantly transmitted. However, the open nature of the air interface in 5G systems makes them vulnerable to various attacks. Physical-layer key generation (PKG) has been recognized as a highly promising technology for ensuring data security in 5G systems, while existing PKG schemes achieve low key entropy (i.e., low key randomness) due to poor channel probing and quantization. In this paper, we propose a PKG scheme with high key entropy, tailored to the unique characteristics of 5G systems. First, we design a channel probing method based on the demodulation reference signal in accordance with 5G standards, enhancing the similarity between channel measurements. Next, we introduce a quantization method based on local increment and monotonicity, which effectively leverages channel characteristics to achieve high-speed key generation and improve key entropy. Finally, we use both MATLAB simulation and real-world channel measurements to achieve comprehensive verification of the proposed scheme. The simulation results showed that the proposed scheme increases the key entropy by at least 25% with nearly the same key generation rate compared with existing PKG schemes for 5G systems. The experiment using real-world channel measurements also confirmed that the proposed scheme has higher key entropy.},

  abstract     = {Facial video-based remote physiological measurement (rPPG) has gained prominence for its ability to non-invasively estimate vital signs such as heart rate (HR). rPPG measures HR by detecting variations in the diffuse reflection of light caused by blood volume changes in the skin, which is influenced by light conditions. Inspired by this property, we identify a new task, that is, to embed malicious information into facial video by subtly altering the light conditions. With this task, we can mislead state-of-the-art rPPG HR methods through natural and imperceptible lighting changes, aiming for two objectives: testing the resilience of rPPG methods against light variations and safeguarding heart rate data, which is crucial for individual privacy. However, such a task is non-trivial and should be able to adapt to different input videos automatically and generate natural and imperceptible spatial-temporal lighting perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose the AdversariaL vidEo Relighting aTtack (ALERT) method, which involves three modules: video lighting estimation (VLightE), adversarial temporal lighting prediction (AdvTLight), and adversarial temporal lighting injection (AdvTLightInj). VLightE is to estimate the spatial-temporal lighting conditions of the original video. AdvTLight predicts the adversarial spatial-temporal lighting conditions that are imperceptible but can mislead the HR detectors according to the original lighting conditions automatically. The final module (i.e., AdvTLightInj) is to inject the predicted adversarial lighting conditions into the input video and render a new one. Extensive experiments on UBFC-rPPG and PURE datasets demonstrate that ALERT generates realistic, imperceptible adversarial videos, effectively misleading 11 rPPG-based HR methods and outperforming all baseline methods. Moreover, our method can be used to protect the HR privacy of users directly and outperform two SOTA Privacy-protection-oriented methods significantly.},

  abstract     = {Publishing graph data is widely desired to enable a variety of structural analyses and downstream tasks. However, it also potentially poses severe privacy leakage, as attackers may leverage the released graph data to launch attacks and precisely infer private information such as the existence of hidden sensitive links in the graph. Prior studies on privacy-preserving graph data publishing relied on heuristic graph modification strategies and it is difficult to determine the graph with the optimal privacy–utility trade-off for publishing. In contrast, we propose the first privacy-preserving graph structure learning framework against sensitive link inference attacks, named PPGSL, which can automatically learn a graph with the optimal privacy–utility trade-off. The PPGSL operates by first simulating a powerful surrogate attacker conducting sensitive link attacks on a given graph. It then trains a parameterized graph to defend against the simulated adversarial attacks while maintaining the favorable utility of the original graph. To learn the parameters of both parts of the PPGSL, we introduce a secure iterative training protocol. It can enhance privacy preservation and ensure stable convergence during the training process, as supported by the theoretical proof. Additionally, we incorporate multiple acceleration techniques to improve the efficiency of the PPGSL in handling large-scale graphs. The experimental results confirm that the PPGSL achieves state-of-the-art privacy–utility trade-off performance and effectively thwarts various sensitive link inference attacks.},

  abstract     = {Split federated learning (SFL) is a compute-efficient paradigm in distributed machine learning (ML), where components of large ML models are outsourced to remote servers. A significant challenge in SFL, particularly when deployed over wireless channels, is the susceptibility of transmitted model parameters to adversarial jamming that could jeopardize the learning process. This is particularly pronounced for embedding parameters in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), which are learned feature vectors essential for domain understanding. In this paper, rigorous insights are provided into the influence of jamming embeddings in SFL by deriving an expression for the ML training loss divergence and showing that it is upper-bounded by the mean squared error (MSE). Based on this analysis, a physical layer framework is developed for resilient SFL with LLMs (R-SFLLM) over wireless networks. R-SFLLM leverages wireless sensing data to gather information on the jamming directions-of-arrival (DoAs) for the purpose of devising a novel, sensing-assisted anti-jamming strategy while jointly optimizing beamforming, user scheduling, and resource allocation. Extensive experiments using both LLMs and VLMs demonstrate R-SFLLM’s effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across various natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, datasets, and modalities. The proposed methodology further introduces an adversarial training component, where controlled noise exposure significantly enhances the model’s resilience to perturbed parameters during training. The results show that more noise-sensitive models, such as RoBERTa, benefit from this feature, especially when resource allocation is unfair. It is also shown that worst-case jamming in particular translates into worst-case model outcomes, thereby necessitating the need for jamming-resilient SFL protocols.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, encrypted video streaming takes up an increasing proportion of mobile network traffic, with encrypted video streams playing a significant role in illegal video detection. However, there are challenges in performing content analysis of encrypted video streams, including label limitations and complex calculations. In this paper, we proposed a low-dimensional embedding method based on Byte Rate Sequences (BRS), named EVS2vec (Encrypted Video Stream to Vector), to solve these problems effectively. It can represent the content of encrypted video streams with low-dimensional vectors by mapping the indefinite-length sequence into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. EVS2vec can thereby be applied for not only supervised analysis but also unsupervised analysis. Furthermore, using BRS can also save the time overhead on fine-grained network traffic parsing. In order to ensure the content-related distinguishability of the embedding result, inspired by contrastive learning, we designed a network structure based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with self-attention mechanism in EVS2vec and trained it using triplet network. The experiments on a public dataset show that EVS2vec saves storage overhead while containing enough video content information. EVS2vec can achieve a high accuracy of similarity threshold, reaching 96.89%. An 8-dimensional fingerprint for each video is constructed. Moreover, classification and clustering analysis can also be performed with acceptable results.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI) is a physical-layer authentication technique that identifies devices by extracting radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs) from received signals. Open-set SEI (OS-SEI) refers to classifying known classes while rejecting unknown classes, which typically requires a sufficient amount of labeled training samples. However, in open-world scenarios, labeled samples are often limited, and unlabeled samples may contain unknown classes. Moreover, open-world recognition not only requires detecting unknown class samples but also identifying specific novel classes within these unknown samples and integrating them into the recognition model. Current OS-SEI methods can only categorize all unknown samples as a single class, lacking the ability to further differentiate these unknown classes. To address these challenges, we formulate a novel semi-supervised open-world SEI (SSOW-SEI) problem, which aims to overcome the shortcomings of OS-SEI in utilizing unlabeled data, distinguishing unknown classes, and addressing class distribution mismatches between labeled and unlabeled data. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end similarity-adaptive (SAA) framework for SSOW-SEI. Specifically, after automatically extracting sample features, SAA first identifies novel classes by measuring pairwise similarities between the features, and then recognizes known classes using adaptive cross-entropy, which balances the learning rate between known and novel classes to prevent model bias toward known classes. Additionally, entropy regularization is applied to mitigate model overfitting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SAA framework effectively leverages limited labeled data, handles large volumes of unlabeled data, and accurately identifies both known and novel classes. The results also highlight its strong generalization, stability, and enhanced adaptability to novel classes.},

  abstract     = {Radar sensing is gaining increasing attention due to its unique advantages, including being device-free, privacy-preserving, and capable of penetrating obstacles. It has been extensively studied in various applications such as human activity recognition, vital sign monitoring, and person identification. However, most existing research focuses on a single specific application, and there remains a lack of studies or datasets dedicated to multi-task radar sensing. In this paper, we collected a dataset for two sensing tasks, including gesture recognition and person identification, via a miniature mm-wave radar. The raw radar signals were processed using micro-Doppler and range-Doppler techniques to extract spectral and spatial representations. We propose an improved multi-task radar sensing framework (MT-DualFormer) that incorporates attention-based cross-task feature distillation and contrastive learning to maximize task performance. MT-DualFormer consists of dual branches with CNN and Transformer modules, capturing both spatial and temporal dependencies in radar data. Attention-based cross-task feature distillation enables knowledge transfer between gesture recognition and person identification tasks. Meanwhile, contrastive learning ensures embedding space separability, facilitating robust task-specific classification. In the evaluation, MT-DualFormer achieves accuracy rates of 98.87% for gesture recognition and 97.96% for person identification, surpassing five representative multi-task approaches and ten state-of-the-art models. This study underscores the importance of leveraging task correlations to enhance the performance of radar-based sensing systems.},

  abstract     = {Ring signatures enable a user to sign a message on behalf of a group while preserving both anonymity and unforgeability. Despite these strong privacy guarantees, they present regulatory challenges. To address these issues, we introduce a novel cryptographic primitive: timed anonymous ring signatures (TARS). Unlike group signatures, which rely on a trusted third party, TARS maintains the decentralization and unforgeability of traditional ring signatures while incorporating timed anonymity, allowing the signer’s identity to be disclosed by any user after a predetermined time period, denoted as T. To realize this, we propose a new CCA-secure timed public key encryption (TPKE) scheme that ensures correct decryption without the secret key after the time T. Building upon TPKE, we present two concrete TARS constructions that guarantee anonymity until time T and unforgeability at all times. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply TARS to a decentralized bidding system that is anti-collusion between the auctioneer and the bidders. The system ensures anonymous bidding while disclosing the winner’s identity after the bid announcement, maintaining a transparent, fair, and decentralized bidding process. Finally, experimental evaluations confirm the practicality and efficiency of the proposed schemes. Crucially, the TARS scheme extends conventional ring signature schemes with timed anonymity by introducing only a moderate computational overhead (experimentally measured at $\approx 1.37$ seconds under our configuration) while preserving their cryptographic robustness.},

  abstract     = {In next-generation wireless networks, integrated satellite-terrestrial networks are regarded as a pivotal solution for supporting seamless coverage and elevated data rates, but the physical layer security performances are severely degraded under both jamming and eavesdropping attacks due to wide field of line of sight. Thus, this paper designs an aerial hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (aerial hybrid RIS) communication system to enhance secure and reliable communication for integrated satellite-terrestrial networks, where an active eavesdropper aims to jam legitimate channels and eavesdrop on any data stream from RIS simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a resource scheduling approach that jointly optimizes the position of the aerial RIS, the hybrid beamforming matrix, the satellite beamforming design, and the satellite transmission power to maximize the ground users’ (GUs) secrecy rate under quality of service (QoS) requirements. To address the optimization problem in complex and dynamic communication environments, we reformulate the problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and propose a secure resource scheduling method based on the relay hindsight experience replay-softmax deep double deterministic policy gradients (RHER-SD3) algorithm. The proposed RHER-SD3 algorithm effectively schedules the secure hybrid active-passive beamforming matrix, the aerial position of the RIS, the satellite beamforming vectors, and the satellite power allocation to avoid both jamming and eavesdropping attacks, even though the behavior information of the attacker is imperfect. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in improving system secrecy performance and QoS satisfaction against hybrid attacks.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems (RSs) have become crucial in helping users navigate the vast amount of online content available today. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been applied to RSs to capture complex user–item relationships, but existing methods compromise privacy or require centralized data storage. Current works attempt to perform GNN-based RSs under federated learning settings to prevent privacy leakage. However, these works need to perform explicit graph propagation during training, which still introduces potential privacy leakage and data collusion. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-based model called Laplacian graded link prediction (LapGLP) that leverages infinite graph propagation with a constant weight matrix. Instead of actually performing infinite graph propagation, the model abstracts the underlying relations between embeddings after propagation with a weighted minimum squared error problem. Furthermore, we propose a federated framework named FedLapGLP to improve privacy in federated GNN-based RSs, which splits the objective loss function into independent parts that are calculated by each user. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art federated RS methods demonstrate the advantages of our proposed approach in terms of high-order connectivity, comprehensive graph information, social relations, full-interaction protection, collusion resistance, and user-embedding protection. The implementation of the proposed framework is available at https://github.com/Limhady/LapGLP},

  abstract     = {Facial recognition systems are vulnerable to physical (e.g., printed photos) and digital (e.g., DeepFake) face attacks. Existing methods struggle to simultaneously detect physical and digital attacks due to: 1) significant intra-class variations between these attack types, and 2) the inadequacy of spatial information alone to comprehensively capture live and fake cues. To address these issues, we propose a unified attack detection model termed Frequency-Aware and Attack-Agnostic CLIP (FA3-CLIP), which introduces attack-agnostic prompt learning to express generic live and fake cues derived from the fusion of spatial and frequency features, enabling unified detection of live faces and all categories of attacks. Specifically, the attack-agnostic prompt module generates generic live and fake prompts within the language branch to extract corresponding generic representations from both live and fake faces, guiding the model to learn a unified feature space for unified attack detection. Meanwhile, the module adaptively generates the live/fake conditional bias from the original spatial and frequency information to optimize the generic prompts accordingly, reducing the impact of intra-class variations. We further propose a dual-stream cues fusion framework in the vision branch, which leverages frequency information to complement subtle cues that are difficult to capture in the spatial domain. In addition, a frequency compression block is utilized in the frequency stream, which reduces redundancy in frequency features while preserving the diversity of crucial cues. We also establish new challenging protocols to facilitate unified face attack detection effectiveness. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that FA3-CLIP significantly improves performance, reducing ACER by over 1.2% on UniAttackData, and increasing AUC by more than 3% as well as reducing EER by over 4% on the JFSFDB dataset.

  abstract     = {Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency, deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results, they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the real world, obtaining such data (i.e.e.g., identity information) is often prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns. Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.},

This technique allows for person retrieval or tracking in surveillance systems when the target person’s RGB photo is not available. While previous research predominantly focused on bridging the modality gap between sketches and RGB photos, the influence of the inherent subjectivity in hand-drawn sketches on re-ID performance remains under-explored. This subjectivity, originating from the artist’s unique style, perceptions, and interpretations, introduces inaccuracies in depicting pedestrian appearances, thereby posing additional challenges such as feature distortion and stylistic variation. This paper introduces a Contrastive-Generative-Contrastive (CGC) framework for subjective style-insensitive re-ID. The framework employs a generative model optimized through self-supervision by contrasting positive and negative pairs of pedestrian sketches and RGB photos. In this manner, it simulates an additional artist specializing in transforming original sketches from various subjective styles into uniform ones. Besides, a simple yet effective weighted contrastive learning loss is proposed to further enhance the model’s focus on pedestrian ID-relevant features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the influence of subjectivity in feature extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks pose a serious security threat to Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, allowing adversaries to manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers. Although backdoor detection methods have been developed to address this issue, existing approaches based on trigger inversion are effective only for simple, visible triggers. These methods struggle to handle semantically enhanced, invisible triggers and often fail to provide accurate backdoor determinations due to reliance on unreliable heuristics, making it difficult to reliably distinguish backdoored models from benign ones. This presents a critical gap in current detection techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trigger inversion SemInv that consists of two key contributions: consistent semantics inversion and identifiable condition inspection. Consistent semantics inversion introduces a new regularization technique into the trigger optimization process, enabling more effective inversion of semantically constrained triggers. Identifiable condition inspection assesses the attack performance margin across different identifiable conditions, providing robust evidence for distinguishing backdoored models from benign ones. We evaluate SemInv using the TrojAI round 6–8 datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both backdoor detection accuracy and trigger inversion performance. Our method also proves effective against models with stealthy triggers, advancing the field of NLP security by offering a more comprehensive solution for identifying backdoor attacks.

We successfully apply eBPF’s excellent kernel observability and tracing capability to Android unpacking, both on real devices and emulators. Operating within the kernel space, BPFDex avoids drawbacks of common unpacking techniques. BPFDex monitors apps across both native and kernel layers, restores Dex data from memory, and adapts to different packing strategies according to observed packing behaviors. Furthermore, we summarize patterns in anti-unpacker behaviors among Android packers, establishing criteria to improve existing unpacking strategies. We conduct extensive experiments on BPFDex by leveraging more than 3k apps packed by over eight different packers. The results demonstrate that BPFDex successfully bypasses anti-unpacker strategies and unpacks apps packed by various packers, in contrast to other unpackers that can handle at most two packers.},

  abstract     = {Text-to-image person re-identification aims to utilize textual descriptions to retrieve specific person images from large image databases. The core challenge of this task lies in the significant feature differences between the abstract nature of text and the intuitiveness of images. Existing solutions primarily rely on explicit alignment of global or fine-grained local features, which lack flexibility and struggle to effectively capture and leverage subtle features and relationship information in multimodal data. Particularly, for different images of the same person, the emphasis in feature extraction should be adjusted according to the differences in text descriptions. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Cross-Modal Symbiotic Network (CMSN) based on implicit alignment. First, CMSN employs an Implicit Multi-scale Feature Integration (IMFI) module to implicitly extract and fuse multi-scale features from images and text, thereby adaptively capturing the feature relationships between the two modalities. Second, a Combined Representation Learning (CRL) module is used to produce a combined representation of the text and image features, utilizing a Combined-Representation Identity Alignment (CRIA) loss to align and constrain the identity centers of the three feature vectors. Finally, we design a Semi-Positive Triplet (SPT) loss function, which defines semi-positive samples using other images and texts of the same identity, providing additional supervisory information to the model and further reducing modality heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on the CUHK-PEDES dataset demonstrate that CMSN achieves an impressive Rank-1 and mAP accuracy of 76.46% and 70.28%, respectively, significantly outperforming existing SOTA methods.},

Based on the switching mechanism of piecewise homogeneous sojourn probabilities, an asynchronous PID-RMPC controller is designed, which uses time-varying mode estimation probabilities to compensate for the mode mismatch caused by attacks, and the mean square stability conditions of the closed-loop system are rigorously derived. Simulation experiments show that the proposed RAETP can increase the effective data transmission rate under attacks compared with the static event-triggered (SETP) protocol, and the PID-RMPC strategy has achieved rapid convergence and robust stability in two simulation examples, verifying the engineering applicability of the theoretical method.},

Existing approaches focus on extracting highly discriminative features for closed-set architectures, increasing the confidence of the prediction when the samples come from closed-set models/architectures, or estimating the distribution of unknown samples, i.e., samples from unknown architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for open set attribution of synthetic images, named BOSC (Backdoor-based Open Set Classification), that relies on backdoor injection to design a classifier with rejection option. BOSC works by deliberately including class-specific triggers inside a portion of the images in the training set to induce the network to establish a matching between in-set class features and trigger features. The behavior of the trained model with respect to samples containing a trigger is then exploited at inference time to perform sample rejection using an ad-hoc score. Experiments show that the proposed method has good performance, always surpassing the state-of-the-art. Robustness against image processing is also very good. Although we designed our method for the task of synthetic image attribution, the proposed framework is a general one and can be used for other image forensic applications.},

While much effort has been invested in this field, most of the existing studies pay little attention to the influence of situational contexts on criminal activities, which hinders further improvement in prediction performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel context-aware Bayesian tensor decomposition framework, namely cBTD-Crime, for citywide multi-step crime prediction. More specifically, cBTD-Crime first constructs a third-order tensor to simultaneously model spatial, temporal, and contextual factors and then applies the CP decomposition to exploit the intricate relationships between the three factors to facilitate the prediction process. To reduce the parameter tuning cost, cBTD-Crime further reformulates the problem from a probabilistic perspective, where a range of carefully selected distributions are placed on the spatial, temporal, and contextual latent factors. Finally, an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure is developed to generate a series of samples and the arithmetic mean is computed to obtain the predicted number of crime incidents. Experimental results show that cBTD-Crime achieves superior performance on real-world crime datasets in terms of different evaluation metrics.},

  abstract     = {Smartphone users are susceptible to a privacy leakage attack called App Fingerprinting (AF), where traffic analysis is used to infer the apps in use. Despite packet encryption, AF attacks leverage packet size and timing information to identify apps, posing a privacy threat. However, existing attacks fail when a few apps are used concurrently, causing unsegmented traffic with app multiplexing and overlapping. The key reason is that they cannot accurately identify active time boundaries for the apps. This paper presents a novel AF attack, FOADA, the first to accurately predict both the location and label of a target app in traffic. FOADA approaches AF as an object detection problem, training a deep learning model to estimate boundary positions and classify traffic segments. Accurate boundary predictions help the model focus on the most relevant traffic segment, enhancing its classification performance. FOADA excels in handling noisy app traffic. With app multiplexing, it achieves an F1-score of 0.96 for predicting only app labels and an F1-score of 0.92 for predicting both app labels and their locations. FOADA surpasses the state-of-the-art attack PacketPrint, which achieves F1-scores of 0.80 and 0.48 in these two scenarios, respectively. The inference time of FOADA is 2,000 times faster than PacketPrint.},

  abstract     = {Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in various downstream tasks by effectively capturing the relational dependencies among nodes in graphs. However, this capability also brings significant privacy risks: when GNNs encode topological information and node features into their output, sensitive information can be inadvertently exposed, leading to severe privacy breaches. Existing privacy-preserving GNNs primarily focus on protecting the existence of individual nodes or edges, overlooking practical scenarios where nodes and edges are often publicly accessible and only specific sensitive attributes require protection, resulting in a lack of consideration for attribute sensitivity and challenges in balancing privacy and utility. In this paper, we study the problem of hiding sensitive information during GNN training and limiting its exposure in the outputs, while better defending against attribute inference attacks (AIAs) and achieving improved performance. To achieve this, we propose an attribute-oriented differentially private graph neural network (AODP-GNN) that enforces attribute-specific privacy guarantees through dynamic privacy budgets and relevance-aware noise injection, optimizing the balance between privacy and utility. Specifically, we design a neighborhood-aware private embedding generation mechanism and a mutual information minimization-based optimization strategy that operate before the deep interactions of feature interaction and model optimization to strengthen defense against AIAs. To enhance the balance between privacy and utility, we further develop a relevance-grained noise adaptation technique that dynamically allocates higher noise to less relevant attributes. Theoretical analysis shows that the AODP-GNN satisfies privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach can achieve up to around 10.04% and 9.21% higher accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art centrally differentially private GNN ProGAP and DPDGC, and also shows a higher defense capability against AIAs.},

  abstract     = {Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAA) require near-field spherical wave modeling due to the substantial increase in the number of antennas, which introduces new spatial dimensions to physical layer key generation (PLKG). We investigate multi-user PLKG in near-field environments, where a base station with an ELAA simultaneously generates secret keys with multiple users. We derive an analytical expression for the key rate (KR). By utilizing spatial dimensions of distance and angle in near-field environments, we apply eigenvalue decomposition and singular value decomposition to design precoding matrices to reduce interference among user equipments (UEs) and extract uncorrelated subchannels. Given that the KR is non-convex, we approximate it and optimize the precoding matrix to increase the KR. After precoding design, the KR depends on the transmit power allocated to the subchannels. Two optimization problems are formulated to further optimize transmit power allocation. The first problem focuses on maximizing the sum KR. We apply the Lagrange multiplier method to determine the optimal power allocation variables by searching the Lagrange multiplier. To reduce computational complexity, a supervised feedforward neural network (FNN) is designed to capture the relationship between the power allocation variables and the Lagrange multiplier. The second optimization problem focuses on KR fairness. By introducing a slack variable that is smaller than the KRs of all users, we use the CVX toolbox to find optimal power allocation variables that maximize this slack variable. To further reduce complexity, the Lagrange multiplier method offers an analytical solution for power allocation variables in terms of Lagrange multipliers determined by the slack variable in the high-power case. We employ a bisection algorithm to find the slack variable. Furthermore, we propose an FNN to map transmit power to the slack variable. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods efficiently leverage near-field effects for multi-user PLKG, reducing pilot overhead.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of face manipulation systems has brought entertainment and convenience to users while posing significant challenges to media forensics. Conventional active defense strategies typically generate adversarial images by introducing perturbations into the original images. When adversarial images undergo facial manipulation, they often exhibit distortions or speckle artifacts, which helps reduce the dissemination of forged content on social media platforms. Nevertheless, the widespread dissemination of degraded images may contribute to facial stigmatization. Furthermore, conventional perturbation techniques are vulnerable to failure under JPEG compression and various image processing operations on OSN platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce a robust and unstigmatized imperceptible perturbation (RUIP) method designed to counteract face manipulation. First, RUIP utilizes an end-to-end adversarial training framework to generate robust and imperceptible perturbations. Second, to mitigate facial stigmatization, we incorporate both pixel-level and feature-level guidance losses during training, ensuring that the output images remain visually natural and closely aligned with the original images. Finally, we develop a novel module, the Flexible Random Enhancement Generator (FREG), to simulate complex JPEG compression and diverse image processing operations on OSN platforms, enhancing the model’s robustness against perturbations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively defends against face manipulation attacks while preserving the visual quality of facial images under JPEG compression and other image processing operations on OSN platforms. We propose an effective and unstigmatized defense algorithm to safeguard privacy and maintain the stability of the social media ecosystem. Code is available at https://github.com/silencecmsj/RUIP},

  abstract     = {Recently, the breathtaking development and potential misuse of deepfake technology has raised numerous privacy and security concerns, triggering widespread apprehension. Existing deepfake detection methods focus on the analysis of local regions for faces, such as mouth movement, eye blinking frequency, etc., which, however, are limited in their ability to capture the global inconsistencies present in forged faces. Some researchers attempt to seize 3D artifacts related to facial global information, but typically treat the 3D information as mere input, lacking the in-depth analysis. To address these shortcomings and mine the inherent and delicate 3D artifacts in the forged faces, this paper innovatively proposes the 3D Artifact Detector (3DAD) method, which leverages the spatio-temporal inconsistency on the 3D semantic space in the forgery videos to uncover the deepfake clues. Specifically, we employ 3D Analysis Unit (3DAU) to pre-train the face reconstruction task within 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) space, thereby obtaining the high-level inherent 3d representation. Concurrently, for the multi-levels of information in the face, we utilize the Texture Perception Unit (TPU) to extract the texture information in the low-level semantic space of the images. Ultimately we feed the two distinct modalities into the spatiotemporal fusion model for final detection. Through extensive intra- and cross-dataset experiments on publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method.

  abstract     = {Robot Operating System (ROS) is very popular in robotic software development. To ease the process management of ROS programs, ROS provides a special lifecycle mechanism that can conveniently manage the state of each running process, which often involves resource allocation, initialization, and release; and this mechanism has been widely used in real-world ROS programs. However, due to code concurrency of ROS programs, a lifecycle-related function is inevitably concurrently executed with other functions, introducing the security risk of dangerous concurrency bugs involving null-pointer dereference and use after free. Due to the non-determinism of thread scheduling, these concurrency bugs are difficult to find and reproduce. In this paper, we design and implement a new coverage-guided fuzzing framework named ROCF, which can effectively detect and reproduce lifecycle-related concurrency bugs in ROS programs, with two novel techniques. First, we propose a lifecycle-aware fuzzing approach that uses lifecycle pair sequence as a new coverage metric to effectively describe lifecycle-related thread interleavings, for input-mutation guidance of ROS concurrency fuzzing. Second, we propose a heuristic-based reproducing method that identifies minimal input sequences that can stably and efficiently reproduce the found concurrency bugs, with strategical input pruning and delay injection. We evaluate ROCF on eight popular robotic programs in ROS2, and it finds 32 new and real concurrency bugs, all of which have been confirmed by ROS developers, and 19 have been assigned CVE IDs.},

  abstract     = {The blockchain technology provides a revolutionary solution for information exchange through its decentralized, tamper-proof, and highly secure characteristics. It has wide application in many industries, with the potential to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and promote innovation. However, the full replication mechanism of blockchain results in the need for each device to store complete blockchain data, leading to inefficient storage. Additionally, as the scale of the blockchain network expands, the increasing data volume and frequent transactions can cause network congestion and latency, posing scalability issues for blockchain. Coded sharding blockchain has been proposed to address these issues. However, the current solutions face challenges such as dealing with malicious nodes and low computational efficiency, which hinder the enhancement of their scalability and computational performance. To resolve these problems, we propose AdaptiveShard by combining coded sharding blockchain with adaptive verifiable coded computing (AVCC). This solution is designed based on the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and is suitable for cryptocurrency transaction scenarios. Compared to traditional coded sharding blockchain solutions, AdaptiveShard can: 1) enhance the computational performance of coded sharding blockchain during block validation by combining AVCC with Gaussian variant of Freivalds algorithm (GVFA), reducing the decoding complexity to $O(N^{2}\log {N})$ ; 2) validate the computation results of each shard using GVFA and replace balance check verification functions with matrix multiplication, reducing the computational complexity of verification to $O(\sqrt {n})$ ; 3) reduce the additional number of nodes required to resolve malicious nodes from two to one using verifiable computation; 4) balance the system in the presence of straggler or malicious nodes through dynamic coding techniques, eliminating their impact and improving system reliability. Experiments demonstrate that at t=1000, the throughput is 25.6% higher compared to Polyshard. Compared to the solution without dynamic coding, the solution with dynamic coding can reduce the running time by 9.7% at t=50.},

While deep learning techniques have achieved state-of-the-art performance in vein recognition due to their powerful pattern recognition capabilities, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a simplified version of LSTM, still faces limitations: 1) inability to process sequence information in parallel, leading to inefficient training; 2) loss of sensitivity to local features crucial for pattern recognition, despite excelling at modeling long-distance dependencies. To address these issues, we propose WTxGRN, a Wavelet Transform-based extended Gated Recurrent Network, which simultaneously extracts global and local features and supports parallel sequence processing. Specifically, we modify the GRU memory structure to enable parallel training and enhance feature representation through exponential gating and stabilization techniques, resulting in an extended GRU architecture called xGRU. We integrate xGRU into a wavelet transform-based residual backbone to form the xGRU Block. By incorporating a wavelet convolution branch and two Mixer Modules, we facilitate multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, enhancing vein recognition robustness and yielding the WTxGRU Block. Stacking these blocks constructs the WTxGRN. Furthermore, we present Spiking WTxGRN, an energy-efficient spiking version of WTxGRN, pioneering the application of spiking neural networks in vein recognition. Spiking WTxGRN offers high energy efficiency while maintaining excellent recognition performance, making it suitable for real-time vein recognition tasks.

However, RFFs extracted from wireless signals are inherently susceptible to noise, particularly for narrowband signals. Furthermore, the noisy domain adaptation (NDA) problem presents a substantial challenge for RFF identification due to the variable noise interference across different noisy domains. To address this, the squared cross power spectral density (SCPSD) as new device RFFs is derived theoretically as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Combined with the proposed high-precision SNR estimation algorithm, SCPSDs under low SNR can be reconstructed to the same feature distribution as those under high SNR. Because of the interpretability, ten samples under high SNR from each device under test (DUT) and a shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) are trained for experimental evaluation on the NDA problem. Tested on 60 off-the-shelf ZigBee DUTs, the improvement of identification accuracy is around 26% for SNR between 5 dB and 10 dB, and the overall improvement is more than 20% compared to the baseline. It outperforms the three other compared methods across all testing SNR and is highly practical.},

This low-cost and efficient approach to artistic re-creation promotes the dissemination and communication of art. However, misuse of unauthorized artistic style images for ZSST may infringe on the copyrights of artists. One countermeasure is robust watermarking, which tracks image propagation by embedding copyright watermarks into carriers. Unfortunately, the stylized image generated by ZSST lose the structural and semantic information of the original style image, hindering end-to-end robust tracking by watermarks. To fill this gap, we propose StyleMark, the first robust watermarking method for black-box ZSST, which can be seamlessly applied to artistic style images achieving precise attribution of artistic styles after ZSST, without compromising the social usability of artworks. Specifically, we propose a new style watermark network that adjusts the mean activations of style features through multi-scale watermark embedding, thereby planting watermark traces into the shared style feature space of style images. Furthermore, we design a distribution squeeze loss, which constrain content statistical feature distortion, forcing the reconstruction network to focus on integrating style features with watermarks, thus optimizing the intrinsic watermark distribution. Finally, based on solid end-to-end training, StyleMark mitigates the optimization conflict between robustness and watermark invisibility through decoder fine-tuning under random noise. Experimental results demonstrate that StyleMark exhibits significant robustness against black-box ZSST and common pixel-level distortions, maintains high watermark decoding accuracy under complex multi-stage processing scenarios, and securely defending against malicious adaptive attacks.},

  abstract     = {As the scope and impact of cyber threats have expanded, analysts utilize provenance graphs constructed from kernel logs to hunt for threats and investigate attacks. The high frequency of kernel events and the persistence of attacks pose challenges for the efficient storage of provenance graphs. Current approaches can be categorized into two types: pruning-based storage (e.g., LogGC, CPR, and NodeMerge) and encoding-based storage (e.g., DeepZip, SLEUTH, ELISE, and Leonard). However, none of these methods simultaneously satisfy the following three requirements: 1) lossless content, 2) storage efficiency, and 3) query support. To address this gap, we propose Dehydrator, an efficient provenance graph storage system that fulfills all these requirements. For the logs generated by auditing frameworks, Dehydrator uses field mapping encoding to filter field-level redundancy, hierarchical encoding to filter structure-level redundancy, and finally learns a deep neural network to support batch querying. We have conducted evaluations on seven datasets totaling over one billion log entries. Experimental results show that Dehydrator reduces the storage space by 84.55%. Dehydrator is $7.36\times $ more efficient than PostgreSQL, $7.16\times $ than Neo4j, and $16.17\times $ than Leonard (the work most closely related to Dehydrator, published at Usenix Security’23).},

  abstract     = {Voice assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous in smart devices, and are highly valued for their ability to perform a variety of tasks through voice interaction, offering users hands-free convenience. However, the always-on microphones of VAs have raised significant privacy concerns in recent years. In this paper, we propose and implement NUSGuard, a novel and practical anti-eavesdropping system. To our knowledge, it is the first system to utilize the built-in speakers of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices for anti-eavesdropping, thereby eliminating the need for dedicated ultrasonic transmitters. Specifically, it exploits human ears’ insensitivity to near-ultrasonic signals and the inherent non-linearity of mic to inject jamming noises into the microphones of unauthorized smart devices. Furthermore, we propose a robust mixed-noise scheme and a lexical-level automatic jammer control strategy, effectively disrupting unauthorized recordings while maintaining seamless voice interaction with authorized VA devices. Extensive digital and real-world experiments have demonstrated NUSGuard’s superior performance in terms of jamming effectiveness and security.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple data owners to jointly train machine learning models by sharing local models instead of raw private data, alleviating data privacy concerns. However, as the local computation of data owners is unpredictable, it increases its vulnerability to Byzantine attacks, where compromised data owners submit abnormal local models that can severely degrade global model accuracy. Existing Byzantine-robust FL methods depend on a semi-honest server executing predefined Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (ByRules) to filter out abnormal local models, but these methods fail when the server is compromised. Although recent serverless Byzantine-robust FL approaches mitigate the risk of a compromised server, they suffer from challenges in achieving consensus on ByRules and impose a heavy burden on privacy protection. In this paper, we propose ROBY, a novel serverless FL framework that extends existing ByRules to a decentralized setting, effectively defending against Byzantine attacks and ensuring privacy protection for local models. ROBY introduces a shared, dynamically updated consensus dataset that serves as a reliable benchmark for applying ByRules and enabling efficient consensus on ByRules among decentralized data owners. Moreover, we design a dual-layer privacy shielding strategy in ROBY to protect local model privacy without sacrificing global model accuracy or incurring extra computational and communication overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ROBY substantially enhances both Byzantine robustness and privacy protection compared to server-based FL methods.},

  abstract     = {Backscatter communication (BC) is a promising wireless communication technology due to its low cost, ultra-low power consumption, and ease of maintenance. However, the broadcasting and openness nature of BC by backscattering incident radio signals for message transformation introduces severe security threats, creating a bottleneck that hinders its further development. Mutual and handover authentication across multiple access points (APs) is essential to secure large-scale BC systems containing mobile backscatter devices (BDs). However, an effective scheme is still absent in the current literature. In this paper, we propose HABC, a mutual and handover authentication scheme designed to secure BC systems, which can resist various attacks. HABC leverages the physical layer feature channel impulse response (CIR) to authenticate BD. Using secret keys, the BD can verify the source of a received signal. When a BD transits from the coverage of a source AP to a target AP, HABC supports handover authentication through the control of a server based on BD location prediction to maintain continuous communications. Theoretical analysis and numerical experimental evaluation validate the satisfactory performance of HABC in terms of accuracy and robustness, as well as its superiority through comparison with cutting-edge related work.},

  abstract     = {In wireless communications, the communication channel between the transmitter and receiver can be monitored by an eavesdropper. The eavesdropper uses deep learning (DL) to quickly identify the modulation parameters of signals and further disrupt legitimate communications. Since DL has been proven to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, this paper proposes to attack the eavesdropper’s model by designing adversarial waveforms, preventing the eavesdropper from correctly identifying the modulation schemes used by legitimate users, and thereby preventing the eavesdropper from interfering with normal communications. This paper proposes an attention-based black-box attack method, which uses the prediction of different networks in the ensemble model to assign adversarial attention factors to each network. This greatly improves the transmission attack performance of the designed adversarial examples. In addition, by analysing the influence of the channel on the adversarial waveform, we further design the adversarial waveform that can be transmitted in the channel to improve the practicability of the attack algorithm. Finally, we theoretically derive the bounds of the adversarial risk increase that the attack brings to the target model. Simulation results show that the proposed method can improve the success rate of the attack on the eavesdropper’s modulation detection model, cause the model to misidentify the signal modulation type, and improve the security and reliability of legitimate transceivers in wireless communication systems.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of digital media, protecting image property has become a critical issue. Visible watermarks, once a key tool for copyright protection, have become increasingly vulnerable to removal methods using deep neural networks (DNNs). This poses a significant threat to the ability of visible watermarks to protect image ownership and copyright. To address this increasingly severe challenge, we propose a novel visible watermark protection mechanism based on information hiding. Unlike traditional methods of directly adding perturbations to protected images, we hide adversarial perturbations in watermarked images through a specially designed reversible information exchange (RIE) module, which includes multiple discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and affine coupling blocks. This design can concentrate the perturbations on textured areas of the watermarked images, making them less visually noticeable. Meanwhile, theoretical analysis indicates that the difference between the adversarial image (i.e., the watermarked image after embedding the adversarial perturbation) generated by our method and the watermarked image is completely controllable. To evaluate the proposed mechanism in various scenarios, based on several widely used datasets (i.e., LOGO-Gray, LOGO-H, and LOGO-L), we further synthesize two new datasets, namely LOGO-Multi and LOGO-Full. LOGO-Multi contains images embedded with multiple watermarks, and LOGO-Full contains images embedded with a watermark covering the whole image. Extensive testing on five datasets demonstrates that, compared to the baseline methods, the proposed scheme can greatly improve the visual quality of adversarial images and enhance their capability to resist various watermark removal techniques.

  abstract     = {Web applications encompass various aspects of daily life, including online shopping, e-learning, and internet banking. Once there is a vulnerability, it can cause severe societal and economic damage. Due to its ease of use, PHP has become the preferred server-side programming language for web applications, making PHP applications a primary target for attackers. Data flow analysis is widely used for vulnerability detection before deploying web applications because of its efficiency. However, the high complexity of the PHP language makes it difficult to achieve precise data flow analysis, resulting in higher rates of false positives and false negatives in vulnerability detection. In this paper, we present Yama, a context-sensitive and path-sensitive interprocedural data flow analysis method for PHP, designed to detect taint-style vulnerabilities in PHP applications. We have found that the precise semantics and clear control flow of PHP opcodes enable data flow analysis to be more precise and efficient. Leveraging this observation, we established parsing rules for PHP opcodes and implemented a precise understanding of PHP program semantics in Yama. This enables Yama to precisely address the high complexity of the PHP language, including type inference, dynamic features, and built-in functions. We evaluated Yama from three dimensions: basic data flow analysis capabilities, complex semantic analysis capabilities, and the ability to discover vulnerabilities in real-world applications, demonstrating Yama’s advancement in vulnerability detection. Specifically, Yama possesses context-sensitive and path-sensitive interprocedural analysis capabilities, achieving a 99.1% true positive rate in complex semantic analysis experiments related to type inference, dynamic features, and built-in functions. It discovered and reported 38 zero-day vulnerabilities across 24 projects on GitHub with over 1,000 stars each, assigning 34 new CVE IDs. We have released the source code of the prototype implementation and the parsing rules for PHP opcodes to facilitate future research.},

  abstract     = {Speaker attribute perturbation offers a feasible approach to asynchronous voice anonymization by employing adversarially perturbed speech as anonymized output. In order to enhance the identity unlinkability among anonymized utterances from the same original speaker, the targeted attack training strategy is usually applied to anonymize the utterances to a common designated speaker. However, this strategy may violate the privacy of the designated speaker who is an actual speaker. To mitigate this risk, this paper proposes an any-to-any training strategy. It is accomplished by defining a batch mean loss to anonymize the utterances from various speakers within a training mini-batch to a common pseudo-speaker, which is approximated as the average speaker in the mini-batch. Based on this, a speaker-adversarial speech generation model is proposed, incorporating the supervision from both the untargeted attack and the any-to-any strategies. The speaker attribute perturbations are generated and incorporated into the original speech to produce its anonymized version. The effectiveness of the proposed model was justified in asynchronous voice anonymization through experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech datasets. Additional experiments were carried out to explore the potential limitations of speaker-adversarial speech in voice privacy protection. With them, we aim to provide insights for future research on its protective efficacy against black-box speaker extractors and adaptive attacks, as well as generalization to out-of-domain datasets and stability.

  abstract     = {Contrastive adversarial training has shown great potential in enhancing model robustness and has been adopted in point cloud classification. There are varying spatial distributions and densities across different regions in point cloud data, which makes adversarial perturbations always exhibit non-uniform patterns of attack intensity and distribution in different regions. However, existing approaches always rely on uniform feature contrast without considering the granularity in the context of point cloud data, limiting their capacities to counter adversarial perturbations effectively. To address this issue, we propose a novel frequency-aware contrastive adversarial training framework, which considers feature contrast via a “divide-and-conquer” method. Specifically, we systematically “divide” point clouds into distinct frequency components and “conquer” feature contrast within each frequency band, which fosters fine-grained feature consistency learning and leads to more informative as well as robust representations. Besides, existing methods typically apply group-level contrastive learning, which emphasizes category-wise similarity but often overlooks the nuanced structural variations among instances. To remedy this, we incorporate instance-level contrastive learning to capture per-instance geometric variations. Moreover, a frequency-specific hard-masked sample generation module is designed to construct challenging sample pairs by masking keypoint features in each frequency band, thereby promoting the model to learn more robust feature representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in adversarial robustness for point cloud classification.

Several schemes have been proposed to address various issues in popularity-based secure deduplication, but they still have drawbacks. Firstly, most of existing schemes are vulnerable to privacy learning attacks (PLAs). An adversary could infer users’ privacy through launching PLAs, which is a severe security threat. Additionally, unprotected reasonable thresholds in existing schemes incur the leakage of data sensitivity and compromise data privacy. In this paper, we propose PopeDup, a popularity-based encrypted deduplication scheme with PLAs resistance and protected thresholds. On the one hand, we design a two-phase server-aided tag generation method to protect the information about which users hold identical data for defending against PLAs. On the other hand, based on threshold signature scheme, we implement protected thresholds to preserve the reasonability of user-assigned thresholds while protecting data sensitivity. Moreover, we design a popularity detection method tailored for protected thresholds by utilizing the property of threshold signature scheme, called oblivious popularity detection, through which popularity level can be transmitted without revealing thresholds. We conduct a comprehensive security analysis and experimental evaluations on PopeDup. The results show that PopeDup provides stronger security protection with limited overhead compared with existing schemes.},

However, despite the success of deep learning techniques, research has shown that they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. These adversarial perturbations can cause deep learning classifiers to misclassify images even though the perturbations are imperceptible to human eyes. To understand the vulnerabilities of deep-learning-based forensic algorithms, we propose a novel anti-forensic framework inspired by generative adversarial networks that is capable of falsifying an image’s source camera model. To accomplish this, we design a generator to anti-forensically falsify camera model traces in an image without introducing visually perceptible changes or artifacts. We propose two techniques to adversarially train this generator depending on the knowledge available to the attacker. In a white-box scenario when complete knowledge of an investigator’s camera model identification network is available to an attacker, we directly incorporate the network into our generator’s adversarial training strategy. In a black-box scenario when no internal details of the camera model classifier are available to the attacker, we construct a substitute network to mimic its decisions, then utilize this substitute network to adversarially train our generator. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our attack against several well-known CNN-based camera model classifiers. Experimental results show that our attack can successfully fool these CNNs in both white-box and black-box scenarios. Furthermore, our attack maintains high image quality and can be generalized to attack images from arbitrary source camera models.},

However, it is inherently difficult to acquire traffic of target HSs (HST) for fingerprinting model training, because the physical location of the services is hidden due to the design of Tor protocol. In order to solve this problem, some alternatives such as mirrored HST (MHST) and client-side HST (CHST) have been proposed for training fingerprinting model. These alternatives are easy to acquire and aim to closely match the characteristics of the target HST. However, they cannot perfectly replace the target HST for the aspects of consistency of both response and protocol. In this paper, we propose a proxied fingerprinting approach called PF. A Proxy HS is deployed to acquire proxied HS traffic (PHST) as an alternative to conduct traffic fingerprinting attack, which satisfies both response and protocol consistency and is easy to acquire. In order to mitigate the impact introduced by Proxy HS, PF also introduces Burst Reshaping which includes burst reconstruction and pseudo-label learning to enhance the similarities between PHST and target HST. Experiments show that, PHST is a superior alternative to target HST, fingerprinting model trained using PF achieved an accuracy of 92.2%, surpassing the models trained with MHST and CHST by 72% and 34%, respectively. Additionally, PF is an add-on approach capable of improving the HS deanonymization effectiveness of any fingerprinting model architecture.

  abstract     = {Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

This innovative approach not only thwarts counterfeiting attempts of digital signatures but also effectively evades the scrutiny of potential hackers, thereby protecting the authentication scheme proactively. The core idea involves superimposing the digital signature onto the message and harnessing the capabilities of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) techniques to obfuscate the signature. We demonstrate that the total detection error probability (sum of false alarm and miss detection probability) of the signature approaches unity with an increasing number of transmitter antennas, indicating the undetectability of the signature, regardless of its transmission power. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of this covert verification on the signature decoding error probability and the authenticated message throughput, providing insights into the overall effectiveness of the proposed technique in protecting the authenticity of the message. We also investigate how artificial noise affects the total detection error probability and the authenticated message throughput. Finally, we compare two approaches to signature protection: signature secrecy which prevents eavesdroppers from gaining any meaningful information about the signature and signature covertness which hides the signature transmission.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has become a promising technology to provide edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to its advantages in privacy protection and reduced communication costs. However, FL is still confronted with privacy leakage issues because the sharing local model may expose the training data information. Existing works typically utilize secure aggregation techniques to eliminate privacy leakage, where local model parameters in FL are obfuscated before they are sent to the aggregator. Nevertheless, secure aggregation makes poisoning attacks more convenient given that existing anomaly detection methods mostly require access to plaintext local models. A Poisoning-Defense Secure Aggregation in FL (PDSA-FL) is proposed to enhance the privacy protection of honest clients and defend against poisoning attacks from malicious clients. Specifically, a Secure Aggregation scheme based on Random Parameters Decomposition (SARPD) is designed to protect client privacy during the FL aggregation process and eliminates the impact of dropped clients on the aggregation results. Secondly, a Poisoning Detection method based on Similarity Grouping (PDSG) is proposed to mitigate the impact of poisoning attacks on the global model of FL without leaking client model parameters. The security analysis discusses the effectiveness of the proposed PDSA-FL in terms of privacy protection. Extensive simulation results show that PDSA-FL can effectively defend against poisoning attacks, significantly improve the convergence performance of global models, and reduce the computation time of clients.},

Cross-chain transaction association identifies and matches unique transactions executed by bridge DApps, which is important research to enhance the traceability of cross-chain bridge DApps. However, existing methods rely entirely on unobservable internal ledgers or APIs, violating the open and decentralized properties of blockchain. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of this issue and then present Connector, an automated cross-chain transaction association analysis method based on bridge smart contracts. Specifically, Connector first identifies deposit transactions by extracting distinctive and generic features from the transaction traces of bridge contracts. With the accurate deposit transactions, Connector mines the execution logs of bridge contracts to achieve withdrawal transaction matching. We conduct real-world experiments on different types of bridges to demonstrate the effectiveness of Connector. The experiment demonstrates that Connector successfully identifies 100% deposit transactions, associates 95.95% withdrawal transactions, and surpasses methods for CeFi bridges. Based on the association results, we obtain interesting findings about cross-chain transaction behaviors in DeFi bridges and analyze the tracing abilities of Connector to assist the DeFi bridge apps.},

  abstract     = {Delegatable Anonymous Credentials (DAC) enhance Anonymous Credentials (AC) systems by allowing credential owners to use and delegate their credentials anonymously. However, traditional DAC systems only support delegating credentials with all attributes, lacking the ability to manage fine-grained delegation, including the delegation of specific attributes and controlled further delegation. Additionally, while some DAC systems support credential revocation in case of unexpected events, they typically limit revocation to the lowest-level users or credentials, which is inadequate as revocation may be necessary at any level within the delegation chain. This is especially concerning, as malicious users delegated by the original malicious credentials may retain access to the resource even after those credentials have been revoked. To address these issues, we propose a delegatable attribute-based anonymous credential with fine-grained delegation management and chainable revocation (FDAAC-CR), which simultaneously achieves: 1) A delegator can delegate a credential on parts of attributes to others, 2) controlled delegation management that restricts further delegation capabilities at a fine-grained level, including depth and attribute sets, and 3) chainable revocation, ensuring that if a credential in the delegation chain is revoked, all subsequent credentials derived from it are also invalid. Moreover, we present a practical FDAAC-CR instance based on a novel primitive called structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes on vector commitments (SPSEQ-VC). Furthermore, FDAAC-CR instance maintains a constant credential size, regardless of the delegation chain length and the number of attributes. We formally prove the security of our scheme, and show the practicality through performance benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Audio-visual matching techniques aim to recognize and match information across different identities by learning a similarity metric across modalities. However, modal differences arise from insufficient cross-modal correlations and noise interference, which substantially hinder the performance of traditional deep metric learning methods in audio-visual matching tasks. To address the modal differences issue, we propose a novel Adaptive Interactive and Correction Attention Network (AICANet). This network efficiently captures deep information connections, generating modality-consistent feature embeddings within a unified metric framework. The core of AICANet is its two-pronged approach to reducing modal differences. First, we propose the Adaptive Interactive Attention (AIA) module, which flexibly establishes associations among cross-modal local features using dynamically generated pseudo-labels. Second, we propose the Adaptive Correction Attention (ACA) mechanism, which employs an adaptive threshold to de-interference effectively and accurately adjust the representation of local feature associations. Notably, the ACA mechanism is suitable for both intra-modal and inter-modal refined attention correction. Additionally, we design a relative distance stretching metric loss ( ${\mathcal {L}}_{RDSM}$ ), which reinforces the similarity invariance of feature embeddings in a uniform space and enhances matching accuracy. Extensive tests on the VoxCeleb and VoxCeleb2 datasets demonstrate that AICANet outperforms leading existing algorithms across several evaluation metrics, validating its superior performance.

  abstract     = {Network access detection plays a crucial role in global network management, enabling efficient network monitoring and topology measurement by identifying unauthorized network access and gathering detailed information about mobile devices. Existing methods for endpoint-based detection primarily rely on deploying monitoring software to recognize network connections. However, the challenges associated with developing and maintaining such systems have limited their universality and coverage in practical deployments, especially given the cost implications of covering a wide array of devices with heterogeneous operating systems. To tackle the issues, we propose Magnifier for mobile device network access detection that, for the first time, passively infers access patterns from backbone traffic at the gateway level. Magnifier’s foundation is the creation of device-specific access patterns using the innovative Domain Name Forest (dnForest) fingerprints. We then employ a two-stage distillation algorithm to fine-tune the weights of individual Domain Name Trees (dnTree) within each dnForest, emphasizing the unique device fingerprints. With these meticulously crafted fingerprints, Magnifier efficiently infers network access from backbone traffic using a lightweight fingerprint matching algorithm. Our experimental results, conducted in real-world scenarios, demonstrate that Magnifier exhibits exceptional universality and coverage in both initial and repetitive network access detection in real-time. To facilitate further research, we have thoughtfully curated the NetCess2025 dataset, comprising network access data from 42 different models across 9 brands, covering the majority of mainstream mobile devices. We have also made both the Magnifier prototype and the NetCess2025 dataset publicly available (https://github.com/SecTeamPolaris/Magnifier).},

Prevailing face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches generally concentrate on the single-frame scenario; however, purely photometric-driven methods overlook the dynamic spoofing clues that may be exposed over time. This may lead FAS systems to conclude incorrect judgments, especially in cases where it is easily distinguishable in terms of dynamics but challenging to discern in terms of photometrics. To this end, we propose the Graph Guided Video Vision Transformer (G2V2former), which combines faces with facial landmarks for the fusion of photometric and dynamic features. We factorize the attention into space and time and fuse them via a spatiotemporal block. Specifically, we design a novel temporal attention, called Kronecker temporal attention, which has a wider receptive field and is beneficial for capturing dynamic information. Moreover, we leverage the low-semantic motion of facial landmarks to guide the high-semantic change of facial expressions based on the motivation that regions containing landmarks may reveal more dynamic clues.

However, PLCs have many vulnerabilities and might be configured inappropriately. With the trend of PLCs connecting to the Internet, such weaknesses will lead to various cyberattacks and have prompted many studies on the threat assessment for PLCs. Previous research has ignored PLCs’ security settings, such as operating mode and read/write authentication etc., which are the general security functionalities significantly affecting PLCs’ security. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose a security settings-based threat assessment framework (SSTAF) to assess PLCs’ security. SSTAF consists of SScanner, a novel scanner to automatically extract the real-time configurations of security settings from PLCs, and the threat assessment criteria, serving to assess the appropriateness of PLC configurations and analyze risk levels of attacks based on PLCs’ security settings. Subsequently, using SSTAF, we implement an Internet-wide threat assessment for PLCs exposed to the Internet. We deploy SScanner on the Internet and interact with 41K ICS devices in cyberspace to acquire their configurations of security settings. Based on the scanning result and the threat assessment criteria, we reveal that 93.32% of PLCs have not appropriately configured their security settings. Additionally, each PLC might be subject to 4.96 attacks on average, of which 3.32 attacks are due to the inappropriate configurations of security settings.},

Our time-varying estimators have uniquely equipped to perform a joint estimation of the system state, sensor and actuator attack signals despite the presence of the intermittent DoS attacks. The main features of the developed time-varying observers are twofold: firstly, they involve time-varying gains corresponding to the DoS attack off/on transitions, and secondly, they entail augmenting the estimations of sensor and actuator FDI attacks within the piecewise observer error dynamics, thus providing a comprehensive and rigorous estimation and control methodology. By introducing the conceptions of minimum and maximum sleeping/active durations of DoS attacks, a new time-varying DoS attack instant-dependent piecewise Lyapunov function approach is proposed to analyze the $H_{\infty }$ stability of the augmented estimation error system and closed-loop control system under sensor and actuator FDI attacks. Based on the obtained $H_{\infty }$ stability analysis results, time-varying gains of state and attack observers are formulated to construct the DoS-resilient observers. Besides, the time-varying feedback gains are also obtained to construct the DoS-resilient controllers by attack compensation based on the actuator FDI attack estimations of time-varying observers, thus achieving the mitigation of sensor and actuator FDI attacks. Case studies are performed on a three-area interconnected power systems under DoS and FDI attacks to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the developed theoretical findings.},

We present FASTLMPI, a new approach to accelerate private TBM inference through fine-grained computation optimization. Specifically, through the fine-grained co-design of homomorphic encryption and secret sharing, FASTLMPI achieves efficient protocols for matrix multiplication, SoftMax, LayerNorm, and GeLU. In addition, FASTLMPI introduces a precise segmented approximation technique for differentiable non-linear functions, improving its fitting accuracy while maintaining a low polynomial degree. Compared to solution BOLT (S&P’24), FASTLMPI shows a remarkable 25.1% to 55.3% decrease in runtime and an impressive 39.0% reduction in communication costs.},

  abstract     = {Computer-aided prohibited item detection is applied in X-ray security inspection to maintain public safety. However, existing prohibited item detectors are limited to a small set of categories in current X-ray datasets, posing potential risks to public security. Since constructing bigger datasets and annotating hundreds of categories is time-consuming and labor-intensive, scaling detectors to more categories with minimal supervision is of great importance. To this end, in this paper, we adopt an open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) method to detect arbitrary unlabeled novel categories of prohibited item. OVOD methods typically rely on datasets with caption annotations, which are lacking in the domain of prohibited item detection. To support the research on OVOD in X-ray security inspection scenarios, we contribute PIXray Caption dataset, the first X-ray dataset with image-caption pair annotations, which could benchmark and facilitate researches in the community. Further, we propose a novel Open-Vocabulary Prohibited Item Detection (OVPID) network to leverage textual information from captions. OVPID contains two core modules, i.e., Interference Resistant Module (IRM) and Prediction Module (PM). Specifically, IRM includes two submodules, namely Edge Perception (EP) and Foreground Activation (FA), which are designed to address the dilemma of interference caused by overlapping problem and complex background in X-ray images. PM consists of two branches for classification and localization. In classification branch, PM generates more accurate prompts for X-ray dataset via large multimodal model (LMM). In localization branch, PM aligns the student embeddings with both teacher and caption embeddings. Extensive experiments on PIXray Caption dataset demonstrate that OVPID outperforms other OVOD methods by delivering a higher accuracy on novel categories.},

However, current online password managers do not hide the account passwords or the master password from the password manager itself, which highlights their real-world vulnerability and lack of user confidence in the face of malicious insiders and outsiders that compromise the password management service especially given its online nature. We attempt to address this crucial vulnerability in the design of online password managers by proposing a cloud-based password manager that does not learn or store master passwords and account passwords. We introduce the protocol design and report on a full implementation of the system. Our implementation provides several security features, including enforcement of a unique and secure password per each service, robustness to online password guessing attacks against the password manager and the web service, robustness to password dictionary attacks upon compromise of the password manager and the web service, and security against phishing attacks. Furthermore, to assess users’ perceptions of the security and usability of our password manager, we conducted a lab-based study. The findings from the study suggest that our system is close to being practical for everyday use and is viewed by users as both usable and more secure/trustworthy.},

However, local measurement is susceptible to outliers, and data sharing leads to privacy and security issues. In this paper, a secure and privacy-preserving distributed Kalman filter (SPP-DKF) is developed to simultaneously address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, the outlier-resistant mechanism is embedded to improve the resilience of the distributed Kalman filter, which employs the saturation function to suppress the mutation of innovation caused by outliers. An event-triggered privacy-preserving scheme based on dynamic mask is designed to protect privacy of local state against different adversaries. Meanwhile, to ensure security, the digital signature based on homomorphic encryption and hash function is adopted to detect false data injection attacks. Furthermore, the mean-square estimation performance and the upper bound of the error covariance of the proposed SPP-DKF are analyzed. In addition, the privacy and security performance of the proposed algorithm are also ensured. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed SPP-DKF provides reliable estimation performance while ensuring the privacy and security of the exchanged data.},

  abstract     = {The pseudonymity nature of Ethereum provides a protective umbrella for criminal activities, allowing criminals to develop a series of black industries such as phishing scams in unregulated areas. In order to exploit the relational inductive bias to discover the real identity of anonymous accounts, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in Ethereum fraud detection tasks as an effective and powerful framework. However, the expressive power of GNN’s 1-hop message passing mechanism is bounded by the Weisfeiler-Leman (1-WL) test, degrading the fraud detection performance on the Ethereum network. This paper proposes a structure-aware Mamba framework, named SAMamba. Specifically, SAMamba uses a subgraph encoding strategy to capture complex structural patterns and introduces Mamba’s exceptional sequence modeling capabilities to route global information. In order to filter task-relevant information from dense information, the attention mechanism and the selection mechanism are introduced from local and global perspectives, respectively. These tailor-made designs enable SAMamba to distinguish subtle differences in structural patterns and selectively aggregate task-oriented information, thereby demonstrating exceptional performance in fraud detection tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world Ethereum data demonstrate that SAMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The codes are publicly available on Github: https://github.com/deepang-ai/SAMamba},

Although previous work has studied the learning of Bayesian networks under centralized differential privacy, to the best of our knowledge, the problem of learning Bayesian networks under local differential privacy (LDP) remains open. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing two solution methods for learning Bayesian networks under LDP: LDP-BN and LDP-BN+. Our first solution called LDP-BN utilizes a novel algorithm for computing mutual information values necessary for building a Bayesian network under LDP, but it suffers from high utility loss since the privacy budget needs to be divided into many pairs of attributes and candidate parent sets. To reduce the amount of noise, we propose LDP-BN+ which utilizes a novel density-aware covering design algorithm that ensures all necessary mutual information values will be computed while the privacy budget is used more effectively. We experimentally evaluate LDP-BN and LDP-BN+ using multiple utility metrics and datasets. Results show that LDP-BN+ outperforms LDP-BN and enables the generation of high-utility Bayesian networks that can be used in practice.},

  abstract     = {With the reducing size of fingerprint collection modules in mobile devices, partial fingerprints are increasingly characterized by smaller overlapping areas and higher self-similarity. Existing methods either aggregate similarity scores from individual Single-to-Single recognition or directly employ a Single-to-Multiple network to verify the match between the query and templates. However, these methods either lack sufficient interaction between templates, or fail to provide adequate supervision for the alignment process, a crucial step in fingerprint recognition, thereby limiting overall accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel partial fingerprint recognition strategy termed Calibrated Single-to-Multiple (CaS2M), which first calibrates template fingerprints individually, then combines them with the query fingerprint in a matcher network for feature fusion. Building upon this strategy, we develop a dual-stage framework tailored to real-world applications. During enrollment, a lightweight patch-based feature indexing algorithm and a template selection strategy are employed accounting for limited hardware resources. For authentication, independent calibration is first applied, followed by an attention-based matcher network to verify identity consistency. Experimental results on multiple public datasets (NIST 302, NIST SD4, SpoofGAN, FVC2002 DB1A & DB3A) and a self-build dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art algorithms, providing new insights for multi-template partial fingerprint recognition.},

  abstract     = {Backdoor attacks are a security threat to deep learning, where attackers inject malicious trigger features into the training data. This causes the model to behave normally during regular operations but produce predetermined incorrect outputs when specific trigger conditions are met. Current advanced text backdoor attack methods use grammar or text style as invisible backdoor trigger features. Although these methods are highly stealthy, their attack performance is poor, and they struggle to counter defenses based on fine-tuning strategies. In this paper, we propose a new multitask backdoor attack framework (CLaFS) for pretrained language models, which uses supervised contrastive learning and feature space isolation auxiliary tasks to increase textual backdoor attack performance. Supervised contrastive learning can enhance the ability of the auxiliary task to learn from poisoned samples, improving backdoor attack effectiveness through parameter sharing. The feature space isolation task enhances the sensitivity of the model to backdoor trigger features by separating poisoned data from other types of data in the feature space, reducing the model’s resistance to backdoor attacks. In addition, we propose a special attack method called Zero Poison Attack, which aims to indirectly achieve backdoor embedding without contaminating the training data of the target task. The experimental results show that our proposed methods significantly improve the performance of invisible textual backdoor attacks and perform well in various special attack scenarios, demonstrating good generalizability and robustness.},

These attacks may target either worker nodes or servers, potentially leading to faulty results that can significantly degrade the overall performance. Therefore, detecting Byzantine attackers and mitigating their effects are crucial in such systems. Motivated by the goal of establishing a secure decentralized matrix-multiplication system, we first introduce a verification method named Common Tag, inspired by the well-known Freivalds’ algorithm, able to verify the multiplication results independent of their associated input matrices. Then, we propose two schemes for sparse matrix multiplication where a group of nodes collaboratively performs a computation task over a logical ring. We consider a subset of Byzantine nodes in the system that may arbitrarily corrupt either their result or any other result passing through them. In Scheme I considering the highly sparse nature of input matrices, we assume that each node has sufficient capacity to store the entire input matrices, and the nodes forward the read-only versions of their computed blocks so that other nodes cannot corrupt them. In Scheme II, we relax the above assumptions, firstly, by considering a limited storage capacity for each node. Secondly, we introduce more powerful adversaries capable of corrupting other nodes’ results by relaxing the read-only assumption. The results demonstrate the feasibility of both schemes and show a significant improvement in terms of distortion over the case where no detection happens. The results also provide a trade-off between the computational complexity required at each node and the reconstruction distortion in both schemes.},

Prior anomaly-based studies lack the capability to interpret the attack scenario, while rule-based approaches struggle with detecting novel attack patterns. We introduce eaGle, an end-to-end framework that takes original host-based data as input and reconstructs the potential attack scenario as output. It leverages an anomaly-based algorithm and a fine-grained misuse detection module to assign anomalous scores to host data, constructs the potential attack scenario using a novel anomalous subtree detection algorithm, and generates the interpretable attack scenario graph through a coarse-grained rule matching method. We assess the performance of eaGle using three attack scenarios from the DARPA TC dataset and three deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate that eaGle can effectively uncover the hidden attack scenario within the host data and outperforms three state-of-the-art attack scenario reconstruction systems.},

  abstract     = {Node identification is the first line of defense for the security of wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT), which prevents illegal devices from accessing the network and launching attacks. Hardware features originating from innate hardware manufacturing imperfections are considered promising fingerprints for identification; among which, the hardware clock feature has been put under the spotlight due to its practicality and ease of extraction. However, current extractions of hardware clock features over wireless networks rely on the transmissions of time information, which, per se, enable significant vulnerabilities such as spoofing and replay attacks. In this paper, we propose a covert method to extract the hardware clock features, which does not rely on the insecure time information transmissions that are adopted in most existing schemes. We also analyze the security of the proposed covert extraction. We further propose SNICK, a secure node identification scheme based on our tailored implementation of covert clock feature extraction and machine learning. We implement and evaluate the proposed approach on a real IoT testbed consisting of a Long Range (LoRa) gateway and heterogeneous end nodes. We conduct experiments to prove the security of the proposed scheme and evaluate the proposed scheme under three scenarios: short-term, long-term, and cross-environment. Experimental results of three scenarios demonstrate average identification accuracies of 98.53%, 85.9%, and 88.3%. We further reveal the identification performance under parameter and environmental variations.},

  abstract     = {While interrupts play a critical role in modern OSes, they have been exploited as a wide range of side channel attacks to break system confidentiality, such as keystroke interrupts, graphic interrupts and network interrupts. However, as previous attacks mainly focus on the exploitation of movable interrupts, they are required to determine which core is handling the target interrupts before their attack, which is non-trivial. The exploitability of non-movable interrupts, which cannot be reassigned by privileged softwares at will, remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on exploitable non-movable interrupts and their contribution to interrupt-based side-channel leakages in x86-based systems. We propose a dynamic analysis technique to investigate how various types of non-movable interrupts are influenced by different workloads. We then conduct a model fingerprinting attack as the benchmark to show that 7 types of non-movable interrupts are exploitable. To demonstrate the viability of these non-movable interrupts, we have created two concrete side channels, called ThermalScope and TimerScope. Specifically, ThermalScope exploits the thermal event interrupts that are triggered only when the CPU temperature exceeds a pre-determined threshold, and TimerScope exploits timer interrupts that are activated regularly to enable the process schedule. Both techniques are adaptable to different attack scenarios, functioning regardless of whether the attacker and victim share the same core or reside on separate cores. Last, we successfully apply them to mount realistic case studies, ranging from constructing cross-core covert channels to breaking kernel address space layout randomization. We also demonstrate successful DNN model fingerprinting attacks under browser scenarios when the frequency scaling is disabled and attacker core is isolated from movable interrupts, where previous HertzBleed, ThermalBleed, and movable interrupt-based attacks are ineffective.},

In this paper, we propose a novel Hyperbolic Metric Learning method for generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing, namely HML-FAS. Compared with the widely used Euclidean metric learning, the inherent hierarchical structure of anti-spoofing data can be well captured in the hyperbolic metric space. In particular, HML-FAS consists of an initial hyperbolic feature embedding step, followed by a Hyperbolic adversarial Data Augmentation (HDA), a Hyperbolic Optimal Transport (HOT), and a final hyperbolic classifier. To learn robust features, the hyperbolic Stein variational gradient descent algorithm is used for HDA to broaden the feature distribution bounds of each training domain. To learn domain-invariant features, the Kantorovich potential network is utilized for HOT to map the feature distributions of all training domains to a common hyperbolic space. Combined with the final hyperbolic classifier, out-of-distribution robust, domain-invariant, and discriminative face anti-spoofing features can be learned by our HML-FAS. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of HML-FAS compared with its Euclidean version EML-FAS, and the previous state-of-the-art methods under unseen scenarios and for unknown attacks.},

  abstract     = {The private and secure distributed matrix multiplication (PSDMM) has broad applications in fields such as finance, e-health, and machine learning. The PSDMM problem introduces a public matrix library $\mathcal {L}$ and aims to securely compute the product of a private matrix with a matrix confidentially selected from $\mathcal {L}$ . In this setting, the user leverages the assistance of d server nodes to perform this computation while ensuring that no information about the private matrix or the index of the selected matrix is disclosed to colluding servers. In most prior works, $\mathcal {L}$ is stored in a replicated form across the servers, resulting in significant storage inefficiency. This paper proposes the use of $(d,K)$ -maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to encode the library and distribute it across the servers, thus enhancing storage efficiency. Building on this, the orthogonality property of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes and their dual codes is exploited to design PSDMM schemes that consistently achieve the optimal recovery threshold. Compared to existing MDS-coded storage PSDMM schemes, the proposed schemes offer lower decoding complexity, as the user only requires a single Lagrange interpolation during the decoding phase. Furthermore, to minimize download costs during decoding phase, subspace polynomial technique from repairing RS codes is introduced, resulting in a communication-efficient PSDMM (CE-PSDMM) scheme. Theoretical analysis shows that the CE-PSDMM scheme reduces the amount of data downloaded from each server compared to conventional PSDMM schemes.},

  abstract     = {Critical infrastructures are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including large language models (LLMs), into essential systems and services that are vital to societal functioning. Fine-tuning LLMs for specific domain tasks are crucial for their effective deployment in these contexts, but this process must carefully address both privacy and security concerns. Without proper safeguards, such integration can introduce additional risks, such as data leakage during training and diminished model trustworthiness due to the need for model compression to operate within limited bandwidth and computational capacity constraints. In this paper, we propose Hardening LLM Fine-tuning framework (HardLLM), which addresses these challenges through two key components: (i) we develop a differentially private data selection method that ensures privacy protection by training the model exclusively on sampled and synthesized public data, thereby preventing any direct use of private data and enhancing leakage resilience throughout the training process, and (ii) we introduce a trustworthiness-aware model quantization approach to improve LLMs performance, such as reducing toxicity, enhancing adversarial robustness, and mitigating stereotypes, while maintaining negligible impact on model utility. Experimental results show that, the proposed algorithm ensures differential privacy when privacy budget is set at $\epsilon = 0.5$ , with only a 1% drop in accuracy, while other state-of-the-art methods experience an accuracy drop of at least 20% under the same privacy budget. Additionally, our quantization approach improves the trustworthiness of fine-tuned LLMs by an average of 3-4%, with only a negligible utility loss (approximately 1%) at a 50% compression rate.},

There is a need to authenticate users before they can use the healthcare devices. For this reason, Electroencephalography (EEG) based authentication is a necessary security solution. In recent years, EEG-based authentication has witnessed significant advancements, but traditional models face challenges in capturing the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in EEG signals. This work aims to address these limitations and explore the effect of Transformer model in the domain of EEG-based authentication. In particular, we devise a modified Vision Transformer model (ViT) to handle the specific characteristics of EEG data, such as spatial and temporal dependencies. In the evaluation, we compare our approach with the similar methods in the literature and examine the effect of fine-tune based on two datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach can effectively capture long-range dependencies and outperform conventional models.},

  abstract     = {Aiming to retrieve pedestrian images based on a textual description query, Text-Based Pedestrian Search (TBPS) gains increasingly attention due to its applications in security surveillance. As a fine-grained classification task, TBPS requires identifying images of individuals with different semantic contexts yet the same identity, as well as distinguishing images of individuals who share similar appearances but distinct identities. Consequently, TBPS is challenged by semantic variations in positive pairs and appearance similarity between negative pairs. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Prompt-guided Transformer and MLLM Interactive learning (PTMI) model to learn identity-discriminative representations across different modalities. PTMI consists of three components: the Prompt-guided Transformer (Promformer), MLLM Interactive Learning (MIL) and Dual-branch Cross-modal Learning (DCL). Firstly, the Promformer is designed to handle semantic variations in positive pairs by introducing learnable prompts, composing of three types: instance-shared, instance-specific and layer-specific. Optimized by Cross-modal Intra-class Consistency (CIC) loss, these prompts minimize intra-class variations and retrieve positive images with various semantics. Secondly, the MIL component is introduced to address appearance similarity between negative pairs by focusing on key image patches and description words filtering by the local discriminator. Powered by Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), the local discriminator adopts soft attention to highlight important image regions and descriptive words, which preserves semantic information while emphasize discriminative details. Lastly, the DCL integrates global and local branches to bridge modality discrepancies. The global branch employs SDM loss for heterogeneous distribution alignment, while the local branch applies Anchor-Based Contrastive (ABC) loss for instance-level contrastive learning. Unlike conventional contrastive loss, ABC loss leverages MLLM features as anchors to decouple modality and semantic differences, enhancing alignment efficiency. Extensive experiments on three TBPS datasets have validated the effectiveness of PTMI.},

To tackle this, we propose the Dual Attention Refinement Network (DARN), a novel method that enhances the spatiotemporal consistency of EEG representations without requiring frequent retraining. DARN combines a lightweight CNN backbone with two complementary attention modules: the Spatial Feature Refinement Unit (SFRU), which prioritizes consistent spatial patterns, and the Inter-channel Refinement Unit (ICRU), which captures stable inter-channel dependencies, jointly refining the spatial and channel dimensions of extracted EEG feature maps. Evaluated on two public multi-session VEP datasets with 30 and 54 subjects, with sample durations of 6 seconds for the 30-class dataset and 4 seconds for the 54-class dataset, DARN surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving identification accuracies of 93.83% (30 classes) and 84.55% (54 classes), and authentication equal error rates of 3.05% and 3.85%, respectively. Moreover, our analysis highlights the pivotal role of visual stimulus diversity in improving cross-session generalization, offering practical insights for designing robust VEP-based biometric systems.

  abstract     = {In the realm of large vision language models (LVLMs), jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to bypass guardrails and uncover safety implications. Existing jailbreaks predominantly focus on the visual modality, perturbing solely visual inputs in the prompt for attacks. However, they fall short when confronted with aligned models that fuse visual and textual features simultaneously for generation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt Attack (BAP), which executes jailbreaks by optimizing textual and visual prompts cohesively. Initially, we adversarially embed universally adversarial perturbations in an image, guided by a few-shot query-agnostic corpus (e.g., affirmative prefixes and negative inhibitions). This process ensures that the adversarial image prompt LVLMs to respond positively to harmful queries. Subsequently, leveraging the image, we optimize textual prompts with specific harmful intent. In particular, we utilize a large language model to analyze jailbreak failures and employ chain-of-thought reasoning to refine textual prompts through a feedback-iteration manner. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations on various datasets and LVLMs, demonstrating that our BAP significantly outperforms other methods by large margins (+29.03% in attack success rate on average). Additionally, we showcase the potential of our attacks on black-box commercial LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini.

However, many binary-level CFI approaches suffer from weaknesses in safeguarding forward edges, particularly for the obfuscated binaries, due to the imprecision in binary analysis or heuristic algorithms. Moreover, these approaches often involve non-negligible overhead and are challenging to deploy, as they instrument plenty of code or employ hardware tracing to enforce the CFI policies. This paper introduces Mobius, the first complete implementation of security-instruction-based binary-only CFI solution on commercial processors. Mobius leverages the Branch Target Identification (BTI) technology in Arm v8.5 to safeguard the forward edges of binaries and shared libraries efficiently. It determines the forward-edge targets without false negatives and carefully instruments the $\textsf {bti}$ instructions to conduct the CFI checking efficiently. Then, it mounts a runtime monitor to detect potential attacks. We deploy Mobius on an Alibaba Cloud server with Yitian 710 processors in practice without modifying the kernel or loader. Remarkably, Mobius successfully provides efficient protection for real-world applications, including obfuscated code, with marginal overhead (5.78% on SPEC2006).},

  abstract     = {Facial sketch synthesis (FSS) has advanced significantly in recent years, but challenges remain in few-shot settings. Some few-shot learning methods can convert photos (source domain) into sketches of a specified style (target sketch domain). However, they overlook the available samples of other sketch styles (non-target sketch domains). We argue that the information in these samples can help the model enhance its mapping ability from the source domain to the target domain. This paper proposes a progressive domain gap reduction (PDGR) method for few-shot facial sketch synthesis, which consists of three stages: teacher training, knowledge distillation, and intra-domain few-shot adaptation. In the first stage, we adapt a pretrained StyleGAN to a non-target sketch domain with more available samples than the target sketch domain. To generate diverse and high-quality sketches, we employ a dual-discriminator adversarial mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the overall structure and style, as well as multi-scale details and textures. In the second stage, the knowledge from StyleGAN is transferred to a U-Net for more efficient image translation. In the third stage, we adapt the output of the U-Net from the non-target sketch domain to the target sketch domain in few-shot settings. To alleviate overfitting, preserve individual characteristics, and enhance detail representation, we leverage the FFHQ dataset to construct dual training paths and design a domain-directional triple loss. Experiments show that PDGR significantly outperforms previous few-shot learning methods and even outperforms the state-of-the-art FSS methods trained on the full dataset.},

  abstract     = {To improve communication efficiency and handle data heterogeneity challenges in federated learning (FL), fine-tuning the pre-trained large models rather than training neural networks from scratch has received increasing attention in recent years, especially under cross-domain settings. However, such a cross-domain federated fine-tuning scenario opens up a broader attack surface for new threats, especially backdoors, posing significant security risks. Existing backdoor attacks mainly focus on label shift scenarios and use explicit triggers, which lack transferability and effectiveness in cross-domain settings, thereby exhibiting significant weaknesses. In this paper, we propose Silent Penetrator, an innovative penetration scheme tailored for cross-domain federated fine-tuning, which exploits a feature shift-induced backdoor to elicit specific symptoms in the trusted private data of targeted victims. In Silent Penetrator, the attacker can obtain a high-quality poisoned dataset by leveraging the available domain information as the text prompts for Stable Diffusion, and inject a domain-sensitive backdoor that can be unconsciously triggered by unmodified private data of the victims. To achieve stronger and more persistent penetration, we thoroughly explore the adversary’s configurable space and enhance our backdoor injection utilizing contrastive-enhanced boundary deviation and cross-domain predictive confrontation. Extensive experiments on three cross-domain datasets and four state-of-the-art federated fine-tuning frameworks validate the effectiveness of Silent Penetrator in successfully compromising target clients. Furthermore, our backdoor enhancement strategy improves the penetration accuracy by over 10% in most scenarios and significantly enhances the durability of the penetration compared to four state-of-the-art backdoor enhancement techniques.},

  abstract     = {While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on large-scale models have shown revolutionary advancements across various vision-language tasks, research on improving VLM robustness remains underexplored. Existing studies primarily focus on attacking VLM after the pretrained visual or textual encoders, typically requiring obvious noise or long inference time. In this study, we look into VLM structure and highlight alignment module’s role as a protective filter that enhances VLM robustness against various perturbations. Motivated by these insights, we investigate VLM from both user and model developer perspectives and introduce the alignment perturbation strategy, which consists of multimodal, visual, and textual perturbations. Multimodal perturbation aims to achieve targeted textual output generation and is further utilized to enhance VLM robustness. Minimal perturbations to visual or textual inputs can lead to significant changes in the overall output of VLMs, revealing their sensitivity to both visual and textual input variations. Building on the alignment perturbation strategy, we propose alignment robust training, which efficiently improves VLM robustness by finetuning the parameters of alignment module without excessive resource consumption. Experiment results across various tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed alignment perturbation and alignment robust training. These methods deepen the understanding of VLM robustness, allowing for secure and reliable deployment towards diverse real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development and widespread adoption of digital media, deceptive behaviors have raised numerous ethical and security issues, making the research and advancement of deception detection technology particularly important. Most previous automated deception detection methods primarily focus on facial information in a visual context. However, from a psychological perspective, deceptive behavior extends beyond mere changes in facial expressions; it can also manifest through limb behaviors and subtle incoordination among body components. Motivated by this inconsistency, this paper attempts to model body behaviors and their relationships for deception detection. It is worth noting that some mainstream video understanding methods can roughly model head and limb information, but their holistic video input approach is easily affected by background interference. This limits their ability to focus on key body regions and subtle motion cues that reflect deception, thereby restricting detection performance. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a Dynamic Learning Framework leveraging Body Part Relationship-Aware Modeling (DLF-BRAM). Within this framework, we segment and model the head and limb regions to reduce irrelevant background interference and enhance the accuracy of feature learning. The framework includes two main components: the Head-Limb Relationship-Aware Representation (HLRAR) module and the Dynamic Assessment Learning Strategy (DALS). The HLRAR module reveals the spatiotemporal relationship of the head, limbs, and their interactions, and learns deep feature representations for each cue, thereby highlighting the uniqueness of these cues. DALS evaluates the learning effectiveness of the three spatiotemporal relationships during training and dynamically adjusts their learning weights, preventing dominance by any single branch and promoting balanced learning. Extensive benchmark and ablation experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms most existing approaches, verifying its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is susceptible to poisoning attacks. To defend against such threats, robust aggregation rules (AGRs) are typically deployed on the server to identify or filter clients’ potentially malicious submissions based on statistical similarity. Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used in FL to facilitate collaborative learning among clients that have heterogeneous model architectures by aggregating and distilling architecture-independent model outputs (i.e., logits). However, the KD process introduces a novel poisoning attack surface, where adversaries can manipulate local model output logits to ruin the global model performance. To fully reveal and explore such a new security vulnerability and effectively poison the global model in the existence of robust AGRs, in this paper, we propose the first untargeted poisoning attack scheme to KD-based FL under robust AGRs, named ManipulatingKD. It manipulates compromised clients to send well-designed malicious logits during the KD process. To ensure attack effectiveness and stealthiness, ManipulatingKD models attacks as constrained optimization problems. This allows for crafting satisfactory malicious logits that are statistically similar to benign logits but can generate poisoned aggregated logits to provide deviated supervision and mislead the global model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ManipulatingKD under both non-robust and robust AGRs. Particularly, under robust AGRs, the global model accuracy degradation caused by our attacks can exceed $2\times $ that of state-of-the-art attacks.},

  abstract     = {Identifying vulnerabilities in complex 5G network protocols is a challenging task. Manual analysis is time-consuming and often inadequate. Modern ML and NLP methods, though effective, are resource-intensive and struggle to find implicit vulnerabilities. In this research, we utilize GPT-4’s advanced language understanding to detect vulnerabilities directly from 5G specifications. To assess GPT-4’s fundamental capabilities in this domain, we first adopt a zero-shot approach that relies solely on the specification text without external guidance. For detecting more sophisticated vulnerabilities that require deep contextual understanding, we introduce a novel domain-aware strategy, where we explicitly teach GPT-4 about security properties and hazard indicators from related works using few-shot learning. We further employ chain-of-thought prompting to guide the model through structured reasoning steps to identify violations or exploitations that may lead to vulnerabilities. A two-tier filtering process ensures that only promising test-cases are retained. Our method has identified 47 potential vulnerabilities in 5G mobility management procedures, including 27 previously unreported issues, and generated corresponding test-cases. Simulating 14 of them, we have found 9 vulnerabilities, five of which are new. The zero-shot approach is effective in detecting procedural and validation flaws, while the domain-aware method excels in finding protocol violations and advanced attack scenarios. These findings validate our methodology and demonstrate its strength in discovering both known and novel vulnerabilities in 5G protocols.},

Traditionally, the delayed feedback is used as a way to share secret key between the legitimate parties. Then encrypting the transmitted message by this key and applying any coding scheme to the same model without feedback and secrecy issue, it has been shown that the capacity of the same model without feedback and secrecy constraint is also an achievable secrecy rate of the GFSM-WTCs-DF. However, note that this secret key scheme may not be optimal for multi-user cases of the GFSM-WTCs since feedback increases the channel capacities. In this paper, first, we show that a Schalkwijk-Kailath (SK) type linear feedback scheme achieves the secrecy capacity of the GFSM-WTCs-DF for single-user case. Then we extend this scheme to the multiple-access situation, and show that our extended scheme outperforms the secret key scheme, and it is optimal for a symmetric case. Finally, we explain the results of this paper by numerical examples.},

To tackle these challenges, we propose HFL-AD, a hierarchical federated learning framework specifically designed for detecting DDoS attack traffic by resolving the data contamination issue. In our approach, a federation of lower-layer clients train local anomaly detection models using diverse raw data. A selected few clients, possessing a small supplementary dataset, serve as upper-layer clients, responsible for excluding model updates uploaded by lower-layer clients that have been trained on contaminated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HFL-AD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions in DDoS detection, particularly when some training datasets are contaminated.},

In this work, we address this critical challenge by proposing ULRL (UnLearn and ReLearn for backdoor removal), a novel two-phase approach for comprehensive backdoor removal. Our method first employs an unlearning phase, in which the network’s loss is intentionally maximized on a small clean dataset to expose neurons that are excessively sensitive to backdoor triggers. Subsequently, in the relearning phase, these suspicious neurons are recalibrated using targeted reinitialization and cosine similarity regularization, effectively neutralizing backdoor influences while preserving the model’s performance on benign data. Extensive experiments with 12 backdoor types on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB, and Tiny-ImageNet) and architectures (PreAct-ResNet18, VGG19-BN, and ViT-B-16) demonstrate that ULRL significantly reduces the attack success rate without compromising clean accuracy—even when only 1% of clean data is used for defense.},

  abstract     = {Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), as one of the key paradigms in federated learning, is commonly employed in scenarios where multiple parties share the same sample set but possess different features for these samples. Previous studies have demonstrated that VFL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks due to its inherent characteristics. However, the issue of backdoor attacks in encryption-protected VFL has been underexplored. In such scenarios, adversaries cannot directly access plaintext sample-level gradients, which seemingly offers enhanced security for VFL. Adversaries are restricted to leveraging their own bottom model and a small subset of auxiliary samples to conduct backdoor attacks, rendering many existing attack strategies ineffective. In this paper, we propose a powerful backdoor attack: BAEVFL (Backdoor Attack on Encryption-protected Vertical Federated Learning), which is executed through three key stages: pseudo-label inference, trigger optimization, and backdoor poisoning. Our attack can be successfully launched without access to plaintext gradient information or auxiliary samples including all classes. Instead, it requires only the adversary’s bottom model and a minimal set of target class samples. We conducted extensive experiments demonstrating that BAEVFL outperforms various state-of-the-art baseline methods, achieving over 98% ASR on four benchmark datasets, while maintaining a utility drop of less than 0.3%. Additionally, we evaluated the effectiveness of current representative defense methods against our BAEVFL. The results indicate that existing defenses fail to strike a balance between defense and utility, and we provide key suggestions for potential improvements to these methods. The BAEVFL, with its stealth and effectiveness, exposes significant security vulnerabilities in encryption-protected VFL, underscoring the urgent need for future research on robust defense mechanisms for this paradigm.},

We begin by constructing a Multi-modal Person Re-identification (MPR) dataset comprising RGB, infrared (IR), and depth modalities. Then, the unified re-id framework is established by integrating an Adaptive Modality Aggregation Module (AMAM) and Multi-modal Auto-aligned Learning (MAL). The former autonomously aggregates distinct modalities by thoroughly exploring their relationships. It not only benefits modal-fusion re-id by promoting the modal-fusion representations, but also enhances cross-modal re-id by performing modal consistency learning on the modal-fusion features to narrow modal gaps. The latter automatically aligns multiple modalities through contrastive learning constraints to lessen modal gaps for multiple cross-modal re-id tasks. So, these two modules respectively balance the tasks of distinct types and various tasks of the same type, which are beneficial to realize more re-id tasks with diverse modal scenarios. Moreover, we evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) multi-modal methods in terms of plentiful testing settings constructed on MPR dataset. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed unified method that only needs to be trained once outperforms existing methods that require multiple training processes with specific modalities. Besides, it can cope with more scenarios. Extensive ablation studies investigate the effects of the proposed modules on all re-id tasks.

  abstract     = {Backscatter communication (BC) enables resource-constrained backscatter devices (BDs) to communicate by reflecting signals from external radio frequency sources (RFSs), thereby avoiding active RF components, making it a cutting-edge technology for the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT). However, the open nature of BC makes it vulnerable to passive and active attacks, and existing methods fail to offer robust mutual authentication suitable for mobile BC systems while keeping a low computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose AuthScatter, an accurate, robust, and scalable physical-layer mutual authentication scheme between the RFS and multiple BDs by leveraging channel fading and random numbers as a one-time pad to protect the identity key exchange procedure during the authentication. Specifically, AuthScatter constructs shared identity keys as physical-layer fingerprints for efficient identification and employs a challenge-response authentication mechanism to enable secure key exchange between the RFS and the BD. In the authentication, the one-time pad effectively prevents eavesdropping, spoofing, replay, and counterfeiting attacks, while legitimate devices leverage channel reciprocity and random number knowledge to authenticate efficiently without channel estimation or complex processing. It is tailored for high-mobility scenarios by completing the exchange within the channel coherence time while incorporating a key-update mechanism to ensure sustained security in the long term. Additionally, it includes a re-authentication mechanism to enhance resistance against wireless attacks and a batch authentication framework leveraging time-division duplexing (TDD) to enable scalability in large-scale BC deployments. Comprehensive security analysis demonstrates the resistance of AuthScatter to various threats, including eavesdropping, identity spoofing, replay, and counterfeiting attacks. Extensive simulations further validate its high authentication accuracy across diverse channel conditions, robustness against various attack vectors, and scalability with a large number of BDs, highlighting its superiority over state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Multi-dimensional range query (MRQ) over outsourced data has been extensively applied in various domains. However, security and efficiency are still two aspects that cannot be easily balanced in private MRQs, as improving security inevitably incurs high computation, storage, and communication costs. Several schemes perform encrypted data retrieval in the trusted execution environment (TEE), which balances security and performance. Unfortunately, they focused on keywords or single-dimensional range queries, failing to address private MRQs. With the TEE (i.e., Intel SGX), we propose a response-hiding MRQ scheme over encrypted data (SGX-MRQ) in this paper. We first design an index structure called SDic, which can achieve efficient range queries while hiding the responses to each query from the server. Moreover, based on the security properties of SGX, we construct the encrypted polynomials of each dimension on the enclave and implement the intersection computation of multi-attribute queries by the server, which greatly improves the system efficiency. We present the formal definition of SGX-MRQ and perform a rigorous proof. We implement a prototype of SGX-MRQ and conduct extensive experiments on real datasets. The evaluation results validate the feasibility of our scheme in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The Space Information Network (SIN) plays a crucial role in terrestrial communication, delivering time-bound services from ground stations to users. It relies on moving low-orbit earth (LEO) satellites for uninterrupted coverage. However, untrustworthy connectivity poses several security challenges during handover services for users maintained by the satellites. While traditional cryptographic techniques provide a degree of security, the advent of quantum computing exposes significant vulnerabilities. This work proposes a quantum-safe and continuous authentication mechanism with handover provision. The proposed authentication protocol uses post-quantum primitives of the Frodo key encapsulation mechanism, currently an approved mechanism under ISO/IEC 18033-2. It ensures privacy and ensures users’ anonymity. The security of the proposed protocol is analyzed using the quantum random oracle (QROM) model. Formal verification confirms its safety for practical adoption as a post-quantum candidate. Further, the performance evaluation shows an authentication delay and energy consumption of the proposed protocol within practical limits, making it a suitable candidate for privacy-preserved post-quantum adoption for SIN.},

Two image representation variants are suggested, namely the symmetric and asymmetric recurrence plots. Another noteworthy contribution is a modified vision transformer architecture for this task that incorporates key adjustments such as the removal of class token and positional embeddings. Rather, we facilitate a local pattern classification by considering the use of feature aggregation strategy for decision making. Additionally, we incorporate an efficient attention mechanism within the transformer encoder, that reduces both computational and memory complexity by simplifying the attention process. To further boost model performance, we integrate the Gradient Harmonizing Mechanism with binary cross-entropy loss, which dynamically adjusts the loss function based on gradient magnitudes. The proposed system is evaluated on three publicly available datasets, and the results obtained are at par to state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a true-and-false (T/F) frequency multiplexing based anti-intercepting transmission scheme capable of concealing truth while showing fake (CTSF), integrating both offensive and defensive strategies. Specifically, through multi-source cooperation, true and false signals are transmitted over multiple frequency bands using non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing. The decoy signals are used to deceive non-cooperative eavesdropper, while the true signals are hidden to counter interception threats. Definitions for the interception and deception probabilities are provided, and the mechanism of CTSF is discussed. To improve the secrecy performance of true signals while ensuring decoy signals achieve their deceptive purpose, we model the problem as maximizing the sum secrecy rate of true signals, with constraint on the decoy effect. Furthermore, we propose a bi-stage alternating dual-domain optimization approach for joint optimization of both power allocation and correlation coefficients among multiple sources, and a Newton’s method is proposed for fitting the T/F frequency multiplexing factor. In addition, simulation results verify the efficiency of anti-intercepting performance of our proposed CTSF scheme.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning and federated learning (FL) play a crucial role in ensuring the security of industrial control systems (ICSs), but they also face severe security threats, especially the threat of backdoor attacks. Most FL backdoor defense methods primarily focus on a single clustering strategy, resulting in low true positive rates (TPR) and true negative rates (TNR) in the attack classification task. Due to the excessive combination scheme of currently available clustering strategies, it is difficult to manually select an appropriate combination scheme of clustering strategies to defense backdoor attacks in federated ICSs. This work is the first time to automatically design a multi-objective clustering combination-based backdoor defense for federated intrusion detection in ICSs, called MoCC-BD-FID. The automated design issue of clustering strategies combination for backdoor defense is formulated as a mixed-variable multi-objective optimization problem, which considers both combinatorial variables, i.e., the combination length and the specific combination of clustering strategies, and continuous variables, i.e., the confidence levels of each combined clustering as the decision variables, and considers maximization of both TPR and TNR as the two objectives. To describe and evolve the different combinations of 12 clustering strategies with confidence levels, we develop an efficient mixed and variable-length encoding mechanism, and the specifically tailored crossover operation and mutation operation under the framework of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II. The experiments are conducted on the three widely-used ICS datasets including Secure Water Treatment, Water Distribution, and Power System Attack datasets under two different backdoor attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that MoCC-BD-FID outperforms the single clustering strategy-based backdoor defense methods and five existing backdoor defense methods, i.e., Krum, Weak-DP, FoolsGold, DeepSight, and CrowdGuard, in terms of the classification accuracy of the poisoned model on regular samples and backdoor samples, TPR, and TNR.},

  abstract     = {Secure cloud-edge data sharing has been researched recently to provide high quality on-demand data service. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a promising solution that achieves data confidentiality and flexible access control simultaneously. But three major issues remain when adapting ABE in cloud-edge, namely reliable user revocation, high performance on devices, and trust issues of public cloud. First, existing direct user revocation mechanisms focus on preventing a revoked user from decrypting header ciphertexts even when key exposure occurs, but ignore the payload security. Second, how to conveniently apply deployment on diverse platforms and run programs on resource-constrained devices with high efficiency is a challenge. Finally, no universal guarantee of cloud computation and management tasks, thus lazy or malicious cloud may not follow the protocol and perform improper actions on purpose. In this work, we propose a Hardware-Assisted Hybrid Fully Outsourced Revocable Attribute-Based Proxy Re-Encryption (H2O-RABPRE) scheme that supports reliable user revocation for full data traffic and hardware-assisted fully outsourced computation. Moreover, we design a hardware-assisted data-sharing framework with rapid deployment for cloud-edge, which integrates the developed SGX-MCL to protect outsourced tasks executed by cloud/edge devices against malicious behaviors and utilizes the enhanced WebAssembly runtime, WasmCrypto, a unified deployment approach for IoT devices with near-native performance. We implement the scheme on an SGX cloud server, a laptop, a Raspberry Pi, and an ESP32 board, and the results indicate that the proposed scheme is practical.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on maximizing the sum secrecy rate in secure multi-user MISO communication systems that use stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM). SIM technology manipulates electromagnetic waves and improves secure communication by combining several metasurface layers with discrete phase-shifting capabilities. We propose a methodology for optimizing beamforming vectors at the base station and phase shifts across metasurface layers, with the goal of maximizing the sum secrecy rate while adhering to practical power constraints. The non-convex optimization problem, induced by discrete phase shifts and coupled design beamforming parameters, is dealt by using an alternating optimization (AO) method. This method employs successive convex approximation for beamforming and projected gradient ascent for phase shift adjustment, resulting in convergence to locally optimal solutions. The proposed approach is thoroughly assessed in simulated scenarios to discover how it performs under various system configurations. The findings reveal that increasing the number of metasurface layers and meta-atoms significantly increases the sum secrecy rate by improving spatial control, lowering interference, and effectively repelling eavesdropping threats. Furthermore, the AO algorithm demonstrates rapid convergence and computational efficiency, making it appropriate for practical use. The framework demonstrates strong flexibility to changes in transmit power, antenna design, and user densities while retaining stable and scalable performance. This research emphasizes the potential of SIM-assisted systems in improving security in wireless communications by enhancing spatial architecture and beamforming, which can complement existing security strategies.},

  abstract     = {Although Software-Defined Networking (SDN) introduces architectural innovations, it retains fundamental network properties. As a result, Low-rate Denial of Service (LDoS) attacks, which exploit bottleneck links and TCP congestion control mechanisms, still pose a serious threat to SDN. Currently, to accurately detect LDoS attacks at lower average attack rates, many methods focus on extracting and analyzing single-dimensional features. However, these methods are often complex and offer only limited improvements in detection accuracy. Moreover, critical security vulnerabilities in mainstream mitigation strategies highlight their inability to ensure long-term stability. To this end, we propose BDTM, a cross-dimensional bidirectional detection and traceability mitigation scheme. Through attack parameter estimation with a precision of 0.1s, BDTM achieves precise detection of LDoS attacks that incorporate IP spoofing. In terms of mitigation, we have identified, verified, and resolved critical vulnerabilities in existing mainstream mitigation strategies for the first time. Upon detecting an attack, BDTM rapidly mitigates the ongoing anomaly while performing reverse-flow tracing to pinpoint the attacking host. Ultimately, BDTM enforces port-level isolation targeting the attacker rather than the attack flows, ensuring more effective and comprehensive mitigation. Experimental results demonstrate that BDTM achieves a high detection accuracy of 98.85%, with an average response time of just 5.67s when performing attack traceability.},

In federated representation learning (FRL), a central server collaborates with N clients, each holding private data, to jointly learn representations of entities (e.g., users in a social network). However, existing embedding aggregation protocols often fall short in either ensuring privacy protections or fully leveraging aggregation opportunities, leaving sensitive data exposed or vulnerable to collusion. To address these challenges, we propose SecEA, a secure embedding aggregation protocol that fully exploits all potential aggregation opportunities across all entities among clients while providing provable privacy guarantees. SecEA defends both local entities and their embeddings—ensuring computational security against a curious server and statistical privacy against up to $T \lt N/2$ colluding clients. Comprehensive experiments on various representation learning tasks in cross-silo scenarios demonstrate that SecEA incurs a negligible performance loss (within 5%) compared to protocols with weaker or no privacy guarantees, and its additional computational latency significantly diminishes when training deeper models on larger datasets. A parallel mechanism is also included, which helps further improve the efficiency linearly. These results underscore that SecEA not only provides full privacy protections for both entity and embedding, but also preserves the utility of the learned representations.},

Among the myriad of potential attack vectors, passive traffic analysis (PTA) stands out as a pervasive and surreptitious threat, which allows attackers to discern the specific services utilized by unsuspecting victims without their noticing. In this work, we present a pioneering approach to achieve fine-grained service identification by adopting an unexplored perspective: mapping traffic transmission patterns to physical layer time-frequency occupancy patterns, which we refer to as Passive Time-Frequency Traffic (PTTF). Additionally, it selects the uplink control channel that carries the acknowledgment/negative acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) feedback within the Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) process as the data source. Statistical features of ACK/NACK time-frequency resources are extracted for traffic classification, and activities are recognized from a three-tier classification algorithm. For validation, we conduct field experiments targeting commercialized smartphones within the real-world operator’s network. This setup effectively mirrors practical scenarios, as the resources within the target frequency band can also be allocated to other equipment in the operator’s network. Furthermore, cross-validation experiments involving different smartphone brands and various network formats are conducted in order to ascertain the generalizability of the proposed PTTF.},

The framework employs a novel multi-qubit broadcast protocol and a quantum average method to secure the information transmission process. The multi-qubit broadcast protocol overcomes the limitations of existing protocols by allowing the transmission of an arbitrary S-qubit state from one sender to multiple (Q) receivers, whereas earlier protocols were restricted to broadcast one or two qubit state to recipients. Additionally, we propose an averaging method for quantum states, which exploits the probabilistic cloning technique to achieve aggregation in MB-QFL. The security analysis demonstrates that MB-QFL can effectively protect against inference attacks from malicious clients, as well as eavesdropping and intercept-and-resend attacks during communication. The algorithm complexity of MB-QFL is significantly lower than existing QFLs. Besides, the experimental results indicate that MB-QFL achieves higher classification accuracy than other QFLs.},

Firstly, there is a lightweight and efficient Transformer-CNN hybrid model. Secondly, it includes a closed-loop quality driven fusion mechanism. This mechanism is equipped with a quality prediction module, Weighted Complementary Fusion (WCF), and quality feedback. Thirdly, there is a jointly optimized combined loss function, which is accompanied by an asynchronous cross-training strategy. Unlike traditional paradigms, we change the optimization objective. It is shifted from information maximization to quality maximization, which is more appropriate for fingerprint. Experimental evaluations have been conducted, covering aspects such as fingerprint quality, matching performance, and network model ablation. The method we proposed demonstrates superiority in terms of quality score and matching performance. It outperforms both traditional and state-of-the-art approaches. It gives a new research path to boost fingerprint identification performance in identity security authentication.},

  abstract     = {Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection. Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise. However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations, and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries. Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we propose Malsight, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode. Specifically, we construct the first malware summary dataset, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort. At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS and benign pseudocode datasets. Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary. Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting summaries’ usability, accuracy, and completeness. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed Malsight. Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger Code-Llama.},

  abstract     = {Trajectory publication under local differential privacy (LDP) has recently become a research focus. Existing solutions rely on geospatial discretization, elevating trajectory description granularity to alleviate noise injection. However, discretization itself also leads to trajectory information loss. Determining discretization granularity to balance differential noise and trajectory accuracy is challenging. Besides, these solutions commonly protect trajectory privacy via whole-region perturbation yet ignore the actual reachable range of trajectories, resulting in impractical published trajectories. To address these issues, we propose LDPTP, a novel LDP-based trajectory publication method that achieves high-quality publication by perceiving regional popularity in a privacy-preserving way. Specifically, we design a privacy-accuracy balancing mechanism for discretization granularity selection, which can effectively measure the impact of different granularities on noise error and information loss through the Bernoulli model and information entropy, enabling optimized discrete trajectories acquisition. Furthermore, a regional popularity-based perturbation method is presented, which utilizes trajectory distribution features to capture popular regions and then combines region similarity to generate private mobility patterns that better preserve trajectory utility. Finally, we devise a transition probability correction method to enhance the accuracy of Markov model learned from these private patterns, realizing high-utility trajectory synthesis for publication. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world and synthetic datasets under three levels of utility metrics. The results demonstrate that our proposed LDPTP significantly outperforms the baseline methods.},

Asynchronous BFT protocols are widely used because they can tolerate uncertain communication delays in the real world. However, asynchronous BFT protocols need to perform many rounds of broadcasts to reach agreement on a transaction subset, which consumes a lot of communication, computing, and storage resources. In this paper, we present Volia, an asynchronous BFT protocol which resolves above problem. We design new broadcast protocol to reduce the number of broadcast rounds needed for agreement. It reduces the communication overhead. Voting broadcast is used to maintain the order of transaction subsets rather than threshold signature to reduce computation cost. Above mechanisms speeds up the agreement phase, reduces the accumulated transaction subsets waiting for agreement and thus saves storage resources. We conduct experiment on Volia and the results show that Volia exhibits about $2\sim 65\times $ throughput, $2\sim 25$ % latency, and 30% storage cost compared to other asynchronous BFT protocols.},

  abstract     = {Many Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) leverage the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) to block incoming malicious requests. The CRS consists of different sets of rules designed by domain experts to detect well-known web attack patterns. Both the set of rules and the weights used to combine them are manually defined, yielding four different default configurations of the CRS. In this work, we focus on the detection of SQL injection (SQLi) attacks, and show that the manual configurations of the CRS typically yield a suboptimal trade-off between detection and false alarm rates. Furthermore, we show that these configurations are not robust to adversarial SQLi attacks, i.e., carefully-crafted attacks that iteratively refine the malicious SQLi payload by querying the target WAF to bypass detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose (i) using machine learning to automate the selection of the set of rules to be combined along with their weights, i.e., customizing the CRS configuration based on the monitored web services; and (ii) leveraging adversarial training to significantly improve its robustness to adversarial SQLi manipulations. Our experiments, conducted using the well-known open-source ModSecurity WAF equipped with the CRS rules, show that our approach, named ModSec-AdvLearn, can (i) increase the detection rate up to 30%, while retaining negligible false alarm rates and discarding up to 50% of the CRS rules; and (ii) improve robustness against adversarial SQLi attacks up to 85%, marking a significant stride toward designing more effective and robust WAFs.

  abstract     = {In blockchain, proof-of-work (PoW) is a popular consensus mechanism in which block publishers secure block contents through competitive computation. This competition has led to the emergence of specialized computing devices, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Consequently, block publishing has become monopolized by a small group of top publishers equipped with ASICs and benefiting from economy of scale. This monopoly undermines immutability and security that are derived from the decentralized structure of blockchains. In this paper, we introduce a type of blockchain consensus algorithm named error-correction code verifiable computation consensus (ECCVCC), which includes conventional PoW. After that, we propose a novel ECCVCC utilizing a syndrome decoding problem as its crypto puzzle. The ECCVCC algorithm suppresses the development of efficient ASICs by utilizing time-varying cryptographic puzzles. As a result, the decentralization of a blockchain with ECCVCC can be improved compared to the blockchains with other consensus algorithms. Our analysis and simulation demonstrate that ECCVCC achieves robust control over block-generation time and difficulty under practical scenarios. Finally, we discuss that ASIC-resistant consensus algorithms, such as ECCVCC, sustain a blockchain network decentralized for a significantly longer period compared to conventional hash-PoW.},

  abstract     = {Community search on attributed graphs has gained significant attention in recent years for its ability to provide meaningful and personalized results. Given a query community, a similar community search aims to identify the communities that are similar in structural and attributed characteristics to the query community. As real-world networks continue to grow in complexity and size, outsourcing graph data and search tasks to cloud servers not only saves local storage space but also significantly enhances search efficiency. Nonetheless, this inevitably raises concerns about data privacy since cloud servers are not completely trustworthy. In this paper, we research on privacy-preserving similar community search on graphs. We propose a privacy-preserving closest similar community search scheme for attributed graphs that leverages cloud servers to enhance search efficiency while safeguarding the sensitive information in the graph. We consider packaging communities using center vertices to evaluate relationships across communities without accessing details within the communities. To achieve this, we design a centrality score function that integrates attribute contribution and closeness centrality to identify the center vertex of a community. To ensure the security of sensitive information in the attribute graph, we construct three secure indexes for the original graph utilizing diverse cryptographic primitives. By searching secure indexes, cloud servers can answer the closest similar community searches without possessing any sensitive information about the attribute graph. We employ Paillier homomorphic cryptosystem and related protocols to support efficient and secure evaluation of the distance and similarity between two communities on secure indexes. The security analysis confirms that the proposed scheme can be against adaptive chosen-query attacks so as to achieve CQA2-security and experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.},

To address this issue, graph unlearning methods have been proposed in the domain of graph data. However, applying existing graph unlearning methods directly to hypergraph data affects model utility. Specifically, the graph unlearning methods severely damage the higher-order structural information of hypergraphs and fail to remove all the information that needs to be unlearned. In this paper, we propose Hyperedge Size-Based Core-Sharing Decomposition, a novel hypergraph unlearning framework tailored to the structural characteristics of hypergraph data. Its contributions include a subgraph partitioning method specific to hypergraphs and an aggregation method based on node coverage. We conduct extensive experiments on seven real-world hypergraph datasets to demonstrate the unlearning efficiency and model utility.

There is increasing research interest in implementing massive MIMO systems using low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) to reduce the hardware cost and energy consumption. Meanwhile, the broadcast nature of wireless communications systems poses security risks, exposing user information to potential eavesdroppers (Eve), and this issue has been studied less in the context of low-resolution massive MIMO systems. This paper investigates the potential of low-resolution massive MIMO systems to enhance physical layer security (PLS) without relying on artificial noise (AN). We propose a novel spatial Sigma-Delta modulation technique that strategically leverages quantization noise to obscure confidential communications from Eve, even with limited channel state information. Our design shifts quantization noise away from legitimate users while maintaining its presence near Eve, thus improving PLS. We formulate the resulting non-convex, semi-infinite design problem and apply a proximal majorization-minimization (PMM) algorithm, ensuring convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. To enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a proximal distance algorithm (PDA) that addresses the constraints independently, yielding closed-form solutions for projections and proximal operators. Extensive numerical experiments validate our approach, demonstrating effective noise shaping for both users and Eve. Our findings illustrate that quantization noise can be a valuable asset in securing communications in low-resolution massive MIMO systems.},

Presently, despite the efficacy demonstrated by state-of-the-art LAD approaches in processing static log events, their performance significantly degrades when confronting changes of log event types from system updates. To construct a reliable LAD model that could adapt well to the evolution of log data, we propose a method grounded in semi-supervised domain adaptation on the rationale of incremental log anomaly detection dubbed as SSDALog, which dynamically updates the model utilizing limited labeled samples to reconcile distributional shifts between evolving and historical data. Specifically, the proposed approach addresses the issue through two primary mechanisms: (i) creation of a cross-domain mixup algorithm, which computes the feature salience of log discrete sequences through occlusion strategy, thus enhancing the adaptability of the model to unknown patterns by mixing evolving features; and (ii) design of an incremental semi-supervised domain adaptation training framework based on noisy label learning to obtain a robust feature extractor, thus improving the generalization ability of the detection model. We empirically assess the efficacy of the SSDALog approach across two publicly available datasets.

While numerous attack mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, the lack of standardized evaluation parameters and metrics has led to inconsistent and even conflicting comparison results. To address this issue and facilitate a systematic analysis of these disparate findings, we introduce MIBench, a comprehensive benchmark that includes a suite of carefully designed evaluation scenarios (ESs) and evaluation metrics to provide a consistent framework for assessing the efficacy of various MI techniques. The ESs are crafted to encompass four critical factors: intra-dataset distance distribution, inter-sample distance within the target dataset, differential distance analysis, and inference withholding ratio. In total, MIBench includes ten typical evaluation metrics and incorporates 84 distinct ESs for each dataset. Using MIBench, we conducted a thorough comparative analysis of 15 state-of-the-art MI attacks across 588 ESs, seven widely adopted datasets, and seven representative model architectures. Our analysis revealed 83 instances of Conflicting Comparison Results (CCR), providing substantial evidence for the CCR Phenomenon. We identified two CCR types: Type 1 (single-factor) and Type 2 (dual-factor). The distribution of CCR instances across the four critical factors was: inter-sample distance (40.96%), differential distance (37.35%), inference withholding ratio (19.28%), and intra-dataset distance (2.41%).

  abstract     = {Most existing Domain Generalizable Person Re-identification (DG-ReID) methods focus on addressing style disparities between domains but often overlook the impact of unpredictable camera view changes, which we have identified as a significant factor responsible for poor generalization performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach from a 3D perspective, utilizing a customized 2D-to-3D reconstruction model to convert images captured from arbitrary camera views into canonical view images. However, merely applying a 3D reconstruction model in isolation may not result in improved DG-ReID performance, as reconstruction quality can be influenced by multiple factors, such as insufficient image resolution, extreme viewpoint, and environmental variations. These factors may lead to error accumulation and the loss of critical discriminative clues in the reconstructed results. To address this difficulty, we propose fusing the canonical view image with the original image using a transformer-based module. The transformer’s cross-attention mechanism is ideal for aligning and fusing the key semantic clues of the original image with the canonical view image, compensating for reconstruction errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments in various evaluation settings, achieving superior DG-ReID performance compared to existing approaches. Our approach addresses the impact of unpredictable camera view changes and provides a new perspective for designing DG-ReID methods.},

  abstract     = {In cooperative intelligent transportation systems (CITS), federated learning enables vehicles to train a global model without sharing private data. However, the lack of an unlearning mechanism to remove the influence of vehicle-specified data from the global model potentially violates data protection regulations regarding the right to be forgotten. While the existing federated unlearning (FU) methods exhibit promising unlearning effects, their practicality in CITS is hindered due to the time-consuming retraining steps required by other vehicles and the non-negligible performance sacrifice on the un-forgotten data. Therefore, achieving effective unlearning without extensive retraining, while minimizing performance degradation on the un-forgotten data remains a challenge. In this work, we propose FedEditor, an efficient and effective FU framework in CITS that addresses the above challenge by reconfiguring the global model’s representation space to remove critical classification-related knowledge from the unlearned data. Firstly, FedEditor enables vehicles to perform the unlearning process locally on the global model, eliminating the participation of other vehicles and improving efficiency. Secondly, FedEditor captures and aligns the representations of the unlearned data with those of the nearest incorrect class centroid derived from non-training data, ensuring effective unlearning while preserving the un-forgotten data’s knowledge relatively intact for achieving competitive model performance. Finally, FedEditor refines the global model’s output distributions using the vehicles’ remaining data and incorporates a drift-mitigating regularization term, minimizing the negative impact of unlearning operations on model performance. Experimental results show that FedEditor reduces the unlearning rate by up to 99.64% without time-consuming retraining, while limiting the predictive performance loss of the resulting global model to less than 3.88% across five models and seven datasets.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a stochastic sampling framework for privacy-aware data sharing, where a sensor observes a process correlated with private information. A sampler determines whether to retain or discard sensor observations, balancing the tradeoff between data utility and privacy. Retained samples are shared with an adversary who may attempt to infer the private process, with privacy leakage quantified using mutual information. The sampler design is formulated as an optimization problem with two objectives: $(i)$ minimizing the reconstruction error of the observed process using the sampler’s output, $(ii)$ reducing the privacy leakages. For a general class of processes, we show that the optimal reconstruction policy is deterministic and derive the optimality conditions for the sampling policy using a dynamic decomposition method, which enables the sampler to control the adversary’s belief about private inputs. For linear Gaussian processes, we propose a simplified design by restricting the sampling policy to a specific collection, providing analytical expressions for the reconstruction error, belief state, and sampling objectives based on conditional means and covariances. Additionally, we develop a numerical optimization algorithm to optimize the sampling and reconstruction policies, wherein the policy gradient theorem for the optimal sampling design is derived based on the implicit function theorem. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving accurate state reconstruction, privacy protection, and data size reduction.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies show that privacy leakages may occur in vertical federated learning (VFL), where parties hold split features of the same samples. While various attacks, including label and feature inference, focus on record-level privacy risks in VFL, few studies delve into the distribution-level privacy threat. In this paper, we explore property inference attacks (PIAs) in VFL, where an adversarial party seeks to deduce global distribution information about a target property in the victim party’s training set. Our key observation is that the $L_{p}$ -norm distribution of intermediate results in VFL could reflect the fraction of the target property in a training set. Inspired by this, we present ProVFL, a novel PIA framework involving distribution comparison and correlation augmentation modules. To achieve property inference, we design a distribution comparison module by creating various intermediate-result populations with different proportions, aiming to learn the relationship between $L_{p}$ -norm distributions and their fractions. Then, we theoretically analyze the factors that contribute to the attack effectiveness and develop a correlation augmentation module based on label replacement and model refinement to amplify property information leakage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our attacks can achieve inferences with low estimation errors as low as 1%. This poses the immediate threat of property information leakage from private training data in the VFL setting.},

  abstract     = {The shuffle model employs a shuffler to anonymize and permute user messages, thereby enhancing privacy/utility trade-offs compared to the local model. Ideally, it assumes perfect message anonymity protection against adversaries, allowing each user to hide among a large population. However, in contexts like mobile/edge networks or in scenarios where the shuffler is curious, this assumption is frequently unrealistic. In this study, we demonstrate the vulnerability of the shuffle model to communication side-channel attacks, which substantially compromise privacy amplification via shuffling. We categorize side-channel information in the shuffle model into three types: (i) in-out information, revealing the victim user’s participation and timing, (ii) message-cardinality information, indicating the victim’s message count, and (iii) message-length information, disclosing the victim’s message length(s). Numerical results indicate these attacks increase privacy loss by 200% to 4100%, revealing secret value with probability more than 90%. After theoretically analyzing the remaining privacy amplification effects, we suggest several countermeasures and principles to alleviate degradation caused by these attacks: (a) appending padding bits to each message to counter message-length attacks, (b) maximizing query parallelization to elude in-out attacks and increase the population for privacy amplification, and (c) sending dummy messages to exchange communication costs for improved privacy amplification effects. The newly proposed paradigms and principles significantly save privacy budget in comparison to current models under attack.},

  abstract     = {The development of wireless technology enables numerous applications of remote-controlled devices (e.g., uncrewed aerial vehicles), yet their intrusion poses significant threats to restricted areas, including military bases, airports, and private spaces belonging to individuals and organizations. To effectively counter the intruders, we propose a novel sensing assisted jamming (SAJA) scheme in two-stage transmission protocol, where we are the first to employ beam scanning to enhance the jamming gain to neutralize intruders. In the first stage, we determine the number of sensing beams L for detecting intruders. We show that a larger L leads to a more accurate angle range, thus enabling a higher jamming beam gain. In the second stage, robust jamming beamforming is designed to disable the intruders within the estimated angle range. The problem facing a single intruder is already non-convex, and we decouple it into two subproblems and develop algorithms for both single- and multi-intruder scenarios. In single-intruder scenarios, we first derive the closed-form expression for robust beamforming design with fixed L, and then apply the bisection search method to determine the minimum L. Facing multiple possible intruders, we further design a multi-round anti-intruder algorithm to address power insufficiency. In each round, we check the problem feasibility with $L=L_{max}$ ( $L_{max}$ is the maximum number of sensing beams) and use a jamming-to-noise-ratio based method to selectively target intruders until the problem is feasible. Furthermore, we derive a semi-closed-form solution to the robust jamming beamforming vector using Lagrange duality theory. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed SAJA scheme against existing schemes.},

Existing methods mainly fall into a centralized learning paradigm, which is inapplicable in the practical medical scenario that only has access to distributed data islands. Federated Learning has the potential to offer a distributed solution but struggles with heavy training instability due to client-wise domain heterogeneity (including distribution diversity and class imbalance). In this paper, we propose a novel Federated Client-tailored Adapter (FCA) framework for medical image segmentation, which achieves stable and client-tailored adaptive segmentation without sharing sensitive local data. Specifically, the federated adapter stirs universal knowledge in off-the-shelf medical foundation models to stabilize the federated training process. In addition, we develop two client-tailored federated updating strategies that adaptively decompose the adapter into common and individual components, then globally and independently update the parameter groups associated with common client-invariant and individual client-specific units, respectively. They further stabilize the heterogeneous federated learning process and realize optimal client-tailored instead of sub-optimal global-compromised segmentation models. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FCA framework for federated medical segmentation.},

  abstract     = {Audio anti-spoofing algorithms struggle with fake samples from unseen spoofing techniques, even when trained with diverse data sets or data augmentation strategies. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) algorithms have the potential to mitigate this challenge. Typically, UDA assumes that the source and target domains are distinct distributions with clear boundaries and seeks to align model representations between them. However, in anti-spoofing, various spoofing algorithms could cause the distributions of the generated samples to overlap, resulting in unclear domain boundaries. This hinders UDA algorithms from effectively measuring and aligning domain discrepancies. Moreover, forcibly aligning samples with significant discrepancies could diminish the model’s discriminative capability. To solve this problem, we propose a domain attention algorithm with optimal transport (OT), termed Sinkhorn Domain Attention (SHDA). Unlike traditional attention mechanisms, SHDA identifies the optimal transfer plan by analyzing the global probability differences among cross-domain samples. Specifically, we first extract audio representations from various domains to compute the overall cost matrix between the source and target domains. Next, we employ Sinkhorn’s iteration to calculate the OT coupling matrix, where cross-domain samples with minor differences receive higher transfer weights, while those with substantial differences receive lower weights. Finally, we use the coupling and cost matrices to compute the adaptation loss, effectively transferring the anti-spoofing model from multiple sources to the target domain. We conducted eight cross-domain experiments using eleven well-known anti-spoofing corpora. The results indicate that our label-free SHDA surpassed the state-of-the-art model by 40%.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks.

  abstract     = {In the security operation center, false positive alerts generated by security devices overwhelm security operators, leading to alert fatigue and inefficiency in identifying real threats. This paper introduces DeepDRAC, a disposition recommendation method for alert clusters that is based on security event patterns. Our main idea is to reconstruct isolated alerts into security events and capture their essential threat characteristics as patterns. By recommending pattern information, we enable batch interpretable disposal of alerts. First, DeepDRAC aggregates correlated alerts to a graph, representing a security event. Then, it extracts the features of the security event from two aspects: basic features via statistical methods and detailed features via a carefully designed Graph Neural Network (GNN) that focuses on edge features. Since many false alerts triggered by the same cause often recur in a fixed pattern, DeepDRAC translates basic features into interpretable descriptors to define the basic pattern, whereas GNN embeddings complement detailed semantic information, serving as the detailed pattern, together forming the pattern of the security event. The pattern describes the critical information of the security event, so security events with the same pattern are clustered for batch processing. Finally, with few manually labeled security events, DeepDRAC can conduct automatic disposition recommendations for newly arrived alerts, significantly reducing the workload of alert analysis. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets (i.e., DARPA 1999 and CIC-IDS2017) and a real-world dataset from a large power company. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can alleviate alert fatigue more efficiently and accurately than the two state-of-the-art defense approaches can.},

  abstract     = {Deepfake detection presents a significant challenge, particularly when the available training data is constrained to a limited set of semantic categories—a common and realistic scenario. In deepfake detection, the training labels typically indicate whether an image is real or fake, without specifying the semantic content, such as object classes. Moreover, we cannot know in advance the object categories present in an image to be detected. Ideally, a deepfake detection model should perform consistently across different semantic categories during inference, irrespective of the content. However, existing methods often exhibit significant performance bias between seen and unseen classes, struggling to generalize effectively. To address this issue, we propose Semantic-AGnostic artifact Network (SAGNet), an innovative and efficient approach designed to decouple semantic-agnostic artifacts from content-specific distributions in the training data. Our method eliminates semantic-specific biases, ensuring that the model focuses on universal artifacts related to image authenticity rather than content-dependent features. By employing this decoupling strategy, SAGNet greatly enhances the model’s generalization capacity, even when trained on limited data. Remarkably, through experiments, we demonstrate that SAGNet achieves performance comparable to models trained with 10 times more data, despite being trained on only 2 classes (comparing SAGNet trained on 2 classes with Ojha et al. (2023) trained on 20 categories). Furthermore, through extensive experiments, we show that SAGNet’s improvements are not only evident across different semantic categories but also extend to various generative methods, including multiple GAN-based and diffusion-based models. This cross-method generalization emphasizes SAGNet’s versatility and effectiveness in diverse generative scenarios. Overall, our method represents a significant advancement in deepfake detection, particularly in realistic situations where the training data is limited.

However, their dynamic and distributed nature poses significant challenges for secure communication and key management. Traditional authentication and key agreement (AKA) schemes for VANETs often rely on centralized trust architectures, resulting in system security and reliability issues. Despite the introduction of distributed trust architecture schemes that have appeared recently, they fail to solve one issue, i.e., how the key agreement requests can be authenticated in the distributed communication scenario where the authentication authorities are all non-full-credible and have differentiated credibility. To solve this issue, we propose a hierarchical AKA scheme for VANETs with cloud-edge collaboration powered by consortium blockchain. Specifically, we first proposed a vehicle reputation evaluation algorithm for evaluating the trustworthiness of the vehicle, so that the AKA requests sent by vehicles with low reputation will be rejected. On the basis of the reputation evaluation algorithm, we proposed a hierarchical threshold-based AKA scheme for VANETs where cloud servers (CSs) and edge servers (ESs) can collaboratively authenticate the AKA requests, so that the authentication service can be trusted upon getting authenticated by a series of valid combinations of CSs and ESs. Both formal and informal security proofs validate the security of our proposed scheme, and simulation experiments demonstrate its efficiency.},

However, the inherent complexity and diversity of data traffic present significant challenges for the detection of IVN anomalous flows. Meanwhile, the introduction of various novel technologies has introduced new security vulnerabilities to IVNs. These vulnerabilities significantly impact the security of IVNs and the accuracy of in-vehicle Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight and efficient anomaly detection method based on knowledge distillation technology, termed Knowledge Distillation from BERT to CNN-BiLSTM (KDBC). Specifically, the KDBC distills the deep semantic knowledge from the BERT model into a more lightweight CNN-BiLSTM architecture, significantly reducing computational overhead and storage requirements without substantially compromising detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the KDBC model enhances both security and versatility, achieving superior detection accuracy in identifying abnormal attacks across diverse IVN data, including automotive Ethernet and CAN networks. Moreover, the KDBC model has been validated for its effectiveness and robustness in actual in-vehicle gateway environments, achieving an accuracy of over 0.98 and an F1 score greater than 0.98.},

  abstract     = {Security patches play a crucial role in the battle against Open Source Software (OSS) vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, to facilitate the development of OSS projects, both upstream and downstream developers often maintain multiple branches. Due to the different code contexts among branches, multiple security patch variants exist for the same vulnerability. Hence, to ease the management of OSS vulnerabilities, locating all patch variants of an OSS vulnerability is pretty important. However, existing works are mainly designed for locating a patch or several patches for a vulnerability but cannot locate all its patch variants. In this paper, we study the problem of how to accurately locate all variants of a given security patch. We motivate the problem with a preliminary study, which shows that it is rather challenging to locate all patch variants, even with a reference patch, due to the diverse practice of OSS developers in backporting patches. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new patch location method to locate all variants of a patch in a code repository (e.g., a software or a specific version). Based on our findings in the preliminary study, our method employs a rule-based model and incorporates two-dimensional code commit features that are specifically designed for the task of patch variant location: similarity features and representative features. With a ground truth patch variants dataset, our method achieves a precision of 99.68% and a recall of 98.81% and significantly outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines (PatchScout and Tracer). Besides, our method shows strong capability in locating patch variants at both upstream and downstream code repositories.},

  abstract     = {Specific emitter identification (SEI), a crucial technology at the physical layer of communication protocols, exploits unique radio frequency fingerprints (RFFs) to distinguish between individual emitters. Deep learning (DL) has been widely applied to SEI due to its remarkable capability in uncovering hidden features and distinguishing between different devices. However, DL-based SEI approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios, thus limiting their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel few-shot SEI (FS-SEI) method based on bi-interpolative metric learning (Bi-InterML), highly reducing the amount of data needed to adapt the algorithm to a new environment and simultaneously avoiding pretraining. Our approach enhances data quality through wavelet coefficient-based and sequence bi-interpolation, generating enriched data used alongside the original dataset for classification via a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CVCNN). Additionally, interpolative metric learning (IML) is employed to constrain feature distances, enhancing feature discriminability. Experimental results on a real-world Wi-Fi dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Bi-InterML-based FS-SEI method, achieving an identification accuracy of 91.48% with 10 samples per category, while it outperforms comparative methods by a margin of 9.64% to 43.18% in the case of 1 sample per category. Furthermore, its generalizability is validated on the base station (BS) dataset, where the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in few-shot scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Industrial cloud storage systems enhance data availability and offer intelligent services to enterprises. However, they also bring significant concerns about data integrity since the cloud space provider may not consistently retain the outsourced data. Existing cloud storage verification methods impose a significant computational burden on edge devices, so they are unsuitable for industrial cloud storage systems. Although the light-weight homomorphic authenticator somewhat alleviates the computational load on the fog node, its effectiveness remains limited and it further complicates proof generation and verification. To address these problems, we propose Ascina, a new proof of retrievability framework for industrial cloud storage systems. We employ verifiable secret sharing to delegate tag computation tasks to the computing server without disclosing the signing key. Once the fog node completes its initial configuration, no further computations are required. Additionally, we propose the improved Ascina by utilizing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) technology to further alleviate the computational burden on the fog node. Furthermore, we propose a batch verification algorithm that simultaneously validates the integrity of multiple files while maintaining the same security assurances as single auditing. We evaluate the performance of Ascina through experiments and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the computational overhead on the fog node in Ascina is $5\times $ - $251\times $ lower than that of Edasvic and our proof verification time and proof size are reduced by $5\times $ - $16\times $ and $977\times $ - $3285\times $ , respectively. As the size and quantity of files grow, Ascina demonstrates greater efficiency in both time and space.},

  abstract     = {While Tor provides strong anonymity, it also facilitates the concealment of malicious activities, which poses a significant challenge to cybersecurity surveillance. As an effective anti-anonymity technique, Website Fingerprinting(WF) enables the inference of which websites a user is visiting, thereby uncovering potential attacker activities. State-of-the-art(SOTA) methods have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. However, a large number of labeled traffic is required to ensure effectiveness, and without timely updates, these models will encounter serious challenges of concept drift due to the dynamic nature of website content and network conditions. The core reasons lie in the independently and identically distributed assumption, while in challenging open-world scenarios, the long-term spatial and temporal dynamics complicates data consistency and effective knowledge transfer. To address these issues, this paper presents WF-TFC, an open-world few-shot anonymous WF model via self-supervised contrastive learning and time-frequency consistency. It aligns time- and frequency-based representations in the latent time-frequency space, enhancing the sustained effectiveness of inherent patterns across various websites. Consequently, it accommodates diverse few-shot target domains with varying dynamics, facilitating data consistency and knowledge transfer in unobserved long-term temporal and spatial environments. For instance, with only 5 traces per website, WF-TFC achieves 92.62% accuracy on traces collected six weeks after pre-training, exceeding the SOTA(i.e., NetCLR) by 2.12%. On similar but mutually exclusive traces, it attains an F1 score of 87.20%, surpassing the SOTA by 6.12%.},

First, based on the formulation of the spatiotemporal optimal control problem, the existence, uniqueness, and some estimates of the strong solution of the controlled system are obtained using the truncation method and semigroup theory. Then, the existence of the optimal pair is verified through the minimization sequence technique. Subsequently, the first-order necessary optimality condition for the optimal control problem of PDEs is derived by proving the differentiability of the control-to-state mapping.

However, existing methods focus on position-fixed adversarial patches, neglecting tailored considerations for the domain-specific texture patterns and mobility required by aerial platforms. To address the issues above, we proposed a novel method of physical adversarial camouflage generation for the first time in optical remote sensing, which paints adversarial camouflage with specialized textures onto the targets to escape detection from DNN-based models. In pursuit of achieving a synthesis of visual harmony and adversarial attack potency, we propose a “latent variable-based” adversarial camouflage generation approach, in which we introduce a texture generator controlled by a group of latent variables to generate camouflage patterns with adversarial properties. By employing this idea, we can constrain the searching domain for adversarial examples to the domain characterized by camouflage exhibiting textures with high visual harmony, and easily focus on finding the most threatening ones during the optimization. We chose airplanes as the object of interest and object detection as the typical reconnaissance method in experiments. Our method achieved high attack success rates (ASRs) against a majority of existing detection models. Comparison with existing pixel-level optimization methods confirmed that the integration of a dedicated generator helps solve the trade-off dilemma between visual harmony and adversarial potency. Real-world experiments involving targets painted by our developed adversarial camouflage confirmed the adversarial attack potency and practicality, with a more than 50% increase on average in the ASRs compared to the conventional camouflage.},

We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction.

  abstract     = {Inherent communication noises have the potential to preserve privacy for wireless federated learning (WFL) but have been overlooked in digital communication systems predominantly using floating-point number standards, e.g., IEEE 754, for data storage and transmission. This is due to the potentially catastrophic consequences of bit errors in floating-point numbers, e.g., on the sign or exponent bits. This paper presents a novel channel-native bit-flipping differential privacy (DP) mechanism tailored for WFL, where transmit bits are randomly flipped and communication noises are leveraged, to collectively preserve the privacy of WFL in digital communication systems. The key idea is to interpret the bit perturbation at the transmitter and bit errors caused by communication noises as a bit-flipping DP process. This is achieved by designing a new floating-point-to-fixed-point conversion method that only transmits the bits in the fraction part of model parameters, hence eliminating the need for transmitting the sign and exponent bits and preventing the catastrophic consequence of bit errors. We analyze a new metric to measure the bit-level distance of the model parameters and prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies $(\lambda,\epsilon)$ -Rényi DP and does not violate the WFL convergence. Experiments validate privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed mechanism and demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art Gaussian mechanisms that are channel-agnostic and add Gaussian noise for privacy protection.},

Secondly, the concerned attack mechanism yields great disruption compared to the periodic or Bernoulli-distributed DoS attack models. Additionally, the joint consideration of the limited average attack rate (AAR) and energy allocation procedure (EAP) reflecting energy constraints of DoS attacks, are merged into a unified random framework. The relationship between these constraints and attack probability is established by resorting to stochastic analysis methods.

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), severely deteriorating model performance on various tasks. Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective approaches to enhance model robustness by incorporating AEs into the training process. Notwithstanding the efficacy of AT, recent studies have unveiled that adversarial perturbations on AEs predominantly impact core features—essential for accurate predictions—more than spurious features, which are incidentally aligned with training labels but irrelevant to the model’s classification. This unequal impact induces the models trained with AT to excessively rely on spurious features, resulting in a pronounced feature shift that compromises robustness and generalization against AEs at inference. In this work, we introduce a novel Core Feature-aware Adversarial Training (CoFAT) framework to cope with these challenges. CoFAT employs core feature extraction to dynamically generate core partners by selectively retaining benign sample regions on feature maps with high-weight while masking low-weight ones, thereby ensuring the model focuses on core features. Furthermore, contrastive feature alignment is proposed to reduce intra-class feature distances and increase inter-class separability by maintaining a center bank of class feature representations, thus mitigating reliance on spurious features. Compared to state-of-the-art AT methods, CoFAT demonstrates superior performance against diverse adversarial attacks. Remarkably, CoFAT improves the robustness of ResNet-18 against AutoAttack on CIFAR-10, SVHN, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet by approximately 2.14%, 3.20%, 1.69%, and 1.86%, respectively, embodying significant advancements in AT.

  abstract     = {Inherent broadcast characteristics can raise privacy risks of wireless networks. The specifics of antenna ports, antenna types, orientation, and beamforming configurations of a transmitter can be susceptible to manipulation by any device within range when the signal is transmitted wirelessly. Personal and location information of users connected to the transmitter can be intercepted and exploited by malicious actors to track user movements and profile behaviors or launch targeted attacks, thus compromising user privacy and security. In this paper, we propose a novel precoding perturbation approach for privacy preservation in wireless communications. Our approach perturbs the precoding matrix of the transmitter using a Riemannian manifold (RM) structure that adaptively adjusts the magnitude and direction of perturbation based on the geometric properties of the manifold. The approach ensures robust privacy protection while minimizing the distortion of the transmitted signals, thus balancing privacy preservation and data utility. Privacy can be preserved without relying on additional cryptographic mechanisms, resulting in the computational and communication overhead reduction.

  abstract     = {Bag-based classification is a supervised machine learning method that makes a prediction based on a bag of items. Unfortunately, it can be misused as an attribute profiling attack, where the attacker’s objective is to infer a privacy-sensitive attribute of a target user from that user’s shared social media profile, i.e., a bag of images or other media. Despite this threat, existing studies on profiling attacks are limited to the item-level perspective, i.e., attack and defense of a single item. In this work, we move obfuscation defenses against attribute profiling beyond the existing single-item research to study the multi-item, bag-based case, which is more practically relevant because it considers the full attack surface. Defense against bag-based profiling is difficult, because, in general, content shared on social media can never be completely deleted. For this reason, we study defenses that involve extensions, referred to as pivoting additions, to existing profiles, which aim to change (i.e., pivot) the output of the bag-based classifier without removing items contained in the original profile. We propose three different pivoting additions: Adversarial Noise (AdvN), Adversarially Perturbed Items (AdvPI), and Natural Items (NatI). We experimentally demonstrate the ability of these pivoting additions to compromise the performance of three deep bag-based classifiers, representing late-, intermediate- and early-fusion approaches. Overall, our work provides an introduction to the risk of bag-based profiling and a systematic study of defenses.},

  abstract     = {Face super-resolution (FSR) is a crucial step in the face analysis pipeline, achieving remarkable progress by applying deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNN-based FSR models are not robust enough and may suffer significant performance degradation due to subtle adversarial perturbations. In addition, the high-frequency details of images restored by existing models are insufficient, especially at large upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware decomposition network (FDNet) for robust face super-resolution, which aims to defend against adversarial attacks and obtain face images with fidelity. Observing that the noise introduced by adversarial attacks is often intricately mixed with the high-frequency information of the input image, we decompose and process the features of different frequencies separately to eliminate harmful perturbations and enhance high-frequency information. Specifically, by leveraging the frequency-aware capability of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), we propose an EMD-based multi-branch structure. The framework implicitly compels different branches to adaptively extract features from distinct frequency bands, limiting the adversarial noise into decoupled components restricted to specific branches. It also improves the recovery of high-frequency information, which is conducive to producing more credible results. Furthermore, we introduce a high-frequency noise suppressor capable of randomly eliminating imperceptible noise in the high-frequency components. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superior robustness of our proposed method against adversarial attacks, showing better fidelity in image reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art FSR methods, especially for upscaling factors of 8 and 16.},

  abstract     = {As cyberattack operators have progressed to encompass group and nation-state levels, the nature of attacks has evolved into more sophisticated forms such as cyber campaigns. In response to these large-scale campaigns, tactical cyber threat intelligence (CTI) which focuses on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) has gained significant attention. However, the data-driven aspects of tactical CTI confront two primary challenges: (i) the extreme scarcity of campaign data and (ii) the difficulty of effectively integrating security domain knowledge. To this end, this paper presents MuCamp, a novel campaign generation method that operates in the context of limited campaign data while also considering the unique characteristics of large-scale attacks. The proposed method assumes that campaigns are TTP sequences, and based on this assumption, it generates valid campaign variants by replacing target TTP words with TTP synonyms, and preserves the strategic goals of the seed campaigns. MuCamp offers a scalable and interpretable augmentation strategy, enhancing CTI effectiveness under data scarcity and facilitating rapid adaptation to evolving threat landscapes. We also prepared a dataset consisting of 858 real-world campaigns labeled by security experts, including 14 tactics and 206 techniques, enabling reliable performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that each component of MuCamp contributes to embedding-based group attribution by improving the separability of the correct group from alternative candidates, while effectively reflecting domain knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Differential private learning is widely used in machine learning (ML) to protect continuous and scalar-valued data. The demand for discrete and matrix-valued computations is increasing, particularly in quantized neural networks and graph learning, which require discrete-valued parameters and large-scale matrix operations for efficient data processing. However, privacy protection for discrete and matrix-valued data is less explored. Traditional differential private mechanisms fail to maintain the discrete nature of data after perturbation and often overlook data correlations, struggling to balance privacy and utility. In this paper, we propose a Discrete Matrixing Differentially Private Learning (DM-DPL) framework, which protects the privacy of discrete and matrix-valued data during ML training by adding discrete matrix-variate Gaussian noise. First, we propose a novel Discrete Matrix-Variate Gaussian (DMVG) mechanism with rigorous conditions necessary to guarantee $(\epsilon, \delta)$ -differential privacy. Additionally, we present an eigenvalue-weighted analysis-based precision budget allocation strategy, designed to maintain the utility of significant dimensions while providing consistent privacy guarantees. Finally, the results illustrate that our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods when applied to quantized federated learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to specifically protect discrete and matrix-valued data during ML training.},

  abstract     = {Load frequency control (LFC) application in power systems has an essential role in improving the system’s stability. However, the presence of the automatic generation control service incorporated into the LFC application, being a system dependent on communication networks, makes the LFC system susceptible to cyber threats. Falsifying measurement and control signals through communication networks, known as data integrity attacks (DIAs), can severely affect the system’s dynamic performance. This paper studies the frequency regulation issue of an interconnected power system under stealth DIAs. Accordingly, a novel identification scheme consisting of the dynamic multiplicative watermarking technique, an estimator, an anomaly detector, and a trigger mechanism is introduced to identify the DIAs. The watermarking concept is the intentional overlay of a watermark signal onto the source signal transmitted through the communication network. Achieving this requires using a specific watermarking filter, and the result is that operators gain greater flexibility in regulating the transmitted signals, which in turn provides improved signal integrity. In the proposed identification scheme, there is a multiplicative superimposition, where the watermark equalizing filter on the opposite end of the network can cancel out the impact of the watermarking, leading to the retrieval of the original signal. After identifying the attack, the proposed trigger mechanism blocks the manipulated ACE signal and submits the estimated ACE signal to the secondary controller. A model-free sliding mode control method is also implemented as the secondary frequency controller to regulate the system’s frequency under DIAs, load disturbances, and physical limitations. The Speedgoat-based real-time simulation results reveal that the developed defense method can timely identify stealth DIAs and significantly improve the system’s dynamic responses compared to the other techniques under these attacks.},

  abstract     = {Deep learning-based detectors have been widely proposed to predict vulnerabilities in smart contracts, yet their unreliable predictions pose severe security risks to financial transactions, making it critical to verify the reliability of vulnerability predictions. However, existing methods only produce prediction results, failing to provide an evidence chain to check whether these predicted vulnerabilities genuinely exist and deliver further guidance for fixing the vulnerabilities. Thus, making these vulnerability predictions verifiable remains an unexplored problem. In this paper, we propose SmartGuard, a novel verifiable vulnerability prediction framework for deep learning-based detectors and specifically designed for smart contracts. It integrates a deep learning-based detector with a symbolic prediction validator, where the latter acts as the backend formal engine to verify vulnerability predictions. Specifically, we present a graph-sequence multi-task learning model to detect vulnerabilities while generating transaction sequences that serve as evidence chains, explicitly revealing the triggering logic behind vulnerabilities. To bridge the gap between deep learning-based detectors and symbolic validators, we symbolically execute the generated transaction sequences against the verification conditions of vulnerability predictions. Furthermore, we propose a new metric, Vulnerability Prediction Suspiciousness (VPS), to evaluate the reliability of the predicted results. We implement SmartGuard on three representative types of vulnerabilities (Reentrancy, Ether-leaking, and Suicidal) to evaluate its performance in real-world scenarios. Our experimental results show that SmartGuard can effectively verify doubtful vulnerability predictions in real-world scenarios. It also outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by consistently reducing false reports by at least 15% across various Solidity versions. Case studies on complex contracts and DApps further demonstrate SmartGuard’s effectiveness in practice.},

Simultaneously, research has exposed FL’s susceptibility to backdoor attacks. However herein lies the dilemma, traditional client selection methods and backdoor defenses stand at odds, so their integration is an elusive goal. To resolve this, we introduce Grace, a resilient client selection framework blending combinational class sampling with data augmentation. On the client side, Grace first proposes a local model purification method, fortifying the model’s defenses by bolstering its innate robustness. After, local class representations are extracted for server-side client selection. This approach not only shields benign models from backdoor tampering but also allows the server to glean insights into local class representations without infringing upon the client’s privacy. On the server side, Grace introduces a novel representation combination sampling method. Clients are selected based on the interplay of their class representations, a strategy that simultaneously weeds out malicious actors and draws in clients whose data holds unique value. Our extensive experiments highlight Grace’s capabilities. The results are compelling: Grace enhances defense performance by over 50% compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) backdoor defenses, and, in the best case, improves accuracy by 3.19% compared to SOTA client selection schemes. Consequently, Grace achieves substantial advancements in both security and accuracy.},

With the continuous evolution of malware traffic, traditional MTC methods are difficult to adapt efficiently to new traffic categories, and manually designed neural network structures suffer from performance bottlenecks and low design efficiency. Hence, we propose an enhanced MTC method based on expandable class incremental learning (CIL) with architecture search. The architecture search can automatically design the optimal neural network structure tailored to different network traffic characteristics, avoiding the limitations of manually designing network structures and improving classification performance. Meanwhile, expandable CIL allows the MTC model to gradually learn new traffic categories without forgetting previous knowledge, avoiding the computational overhead and efficiency loss caused by frequent retraining of the model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CIL-MTC approach surpasses advanced incremental learning methods on both the Edge-IIoTset and ISCX VPN-nonVPN datasets, achieving superior classification performance while maintaining lower average trainable parameters and training costs. Especially, it achieves an average incremental accuracy of 98.55% and 99.09% on the Edge-IIoTset dataset with incremental tasks of 5 and 2, respectively.},

The emergence of unknown emitters is frequent in non-cooperative environments, and Open-set Specific Emitter Identification (OSSEI) based studies are becoming increasingly critical. Besides, Radio Frequency (RF) signals contain a substantial number of features that are irrelevant to emitter categories, as a result the distributions of signals are extremely sparse in the feature space. Existing OSSEI methods cannot be capable in extracting categorical representations for such signals, which may lead to wrong recognition. In this work, based on a set of Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) models, we propose a robust OSSEI framework designed to handle class-irrelevant features. Specifically, we first use the proposed class-independent VAEs to construct categorical representations for each emitter, leveraging signal distributions in the feature space. In addition, to enhance the distinction among inter-class representations and constrain intra-class distributions, we design a supervised contrastive learning (SupCL) based method that generates positive samples for data augmentation by means of sampling from the corresponding distributions. Furthermore, we calculate the category affiliation of signals by integrating reconstruction probabilities and statistical representation features, facilitating the identification of both known and unknown emitters. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice conversion (VC) models generate high-quality and natural-sounding voices efficiently. While existing studies have focused on detecting voice spoofing attacks, this study explores a proactive approach to safeguard speaker identity from such threats. Attackers can exploit voice biometrics by using either advanced VC techniques or traditional methods. Although zero-shot VC has been applied for source speaker anonymization, it typically fails to protect the identity of the target speaker. To address this gap, we propose a speaker privacy preservation framework that combines zero-shot AutoVC with a multi-target voice frame fusion technique. This method anonymizes the source speaker while also preventing leakage of the target speaker’s identity by blending voice frames from multiple targets. The VCTK public dataset is employed to assess the performance of the proposed model. The average cosine similarity between the original and anonymized voices yielded a result closer to the inter-speaker voice cosine similarity, which is the most suitable benchmark for speaker anonymization. Additionally, speaker identification models trained on original and vocoded data yielded low identification accuracies of 27.4% and 41.2%, respectively. The mean opinion score (MOS) evaluation confirmed that the anonymized voice quality adeptly preserved linguistic content and naturalness. Overall, the proposed method effectively anonymizes both source and target speakers, offering robust protection against voiceprint spoofing.},

  abstract     = {With the development of big data, cloud computing is widely used by individual and enterprise users due to its powerful computing and storage capabilities. How to share the encrypted data stored in cloud servers flexibly to a group of users and provide effective access control to the users is a hot topic in current research. For that, this paper proposes fair and verifiable identity-based broadcast proxy re-encryption with designated sender (FV-IBBPRE-DS) for Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), which gives the system model, formal definition, and security model of FV-IBBPRE-DS, and constructs a concrete FV-IBBPRE-DS scheme. The data owner in the FV-IBBPRE-DS scheme is able to designate a sender, which is given the decryption privilege of the encrypted data to a set of receivers. The scheme ensures that the participating entities perform the process of data sharing fairly and are able to verify the consistency of the ciphertexts. The FV-IBBPRE-DS scheme achieves chosen ciphertext attack security. The performance analysis demonstrates that the scheme in this paper has significant advantages in re-encrypted ciphertext generation and decryption phase, and can be applied to resource-constrained MIoT devices.},

  abstract     = {Generative steganography is renowned for its exceptional undetectability. However, prevalent generative methods often have insufficient capacity for concealing secret images. Furthermore, the sensitivity of commonly utilized generative models exacerbates the challenge of ensuring robustness against channel distortions such as JPEG compression. In this paper, we introduce a generative image hiding network that employs two invertible generators to transform secret images into stego images within a disparate image domain. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate an up-and-down sampling module (UDM) within these generators to facilitate efficient decoupling of the intermediate representations obtained by each generator. The UDM serves multiple purposes: preserving coherence between the intermediate representations, enhancing resilience against JPEG compression, and safeguarding the confidentiality of the concealed images. To address the complexity of mapping both uncompressed and compressed stego images to a unified intermediary representation, we implement two distinct flows for the forward and backward processes of the generator associated with the stego images. The experimental results show that our scheme offers concurrent advantages in terms of full-size image hiding ability, undetectability, confidentiality, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) enables geographically distributed clients to collaboratively train machine learning models by exchanging local model parameters while preserving data privacy. In practice, FL faces two critical challenges. First, it is vulnerable to security issues as malicious clients would artificially harm the functionality of FL by launching poisoning attacks. Second, the inherent data heterogeneity among clients (termed Non-IID data in FL) naturally arises from distributed data ownership and significantly degrades model convergence and accuracy. However, with studies separately devoted to these two research lines, the interplay between data heterogeneity and security remains poorly understood. In this paper, we systematically investigate the relationship between data heterogeneity and adversarial robustness in FL. Specifically, we propose novel data partitioning algorithms that simulate Label-Conditional Non-IID and Feature-Conditional Non-IID with quantifiable heterogeneity levels. Further, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate classical defense methods in the practical FL environment under state-of-the-art untargeted attacks. With results in various settings, we separately analyze the connection between Non-IID to defenses and attacks. Regarding attacks, with similar effects on models, Non-IID impacts the training in a different way compared with attacks. The interaction between attacks and Non-IID provides an opportunity to cause severe damage to FL. Regarding defenses, Non-IID induces heterogeneity in model distribution among clients which raises the difficulty of maintaining fidelity and robustness for defense methods.},

Due to the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, detecting such laundering activities is difficult. Although substantial research has been conducted, almost all existing methods detect cryptocurrency laundering from an individual perspective, ignoring the fact that money laundering is typically a group behavior. Group information should be very helpful in laundering behavior analysis, but such laundering groups are hard to be recognized due to anonymity and diversity of purposes of cryptocurrency transactions. To address this challenge, we design a multi-persona grouping algorithm that can effectively group accounts into persona subgraphs. Then, we extract two subgraph features: cycle basis number and cycle overlapping ratio, and build an unsupervised model to evaluate laundering scores of each subgraph. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, our proposed method can improve detection accuracy by 17.4percentage points on average. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on group-based detection of cryptocurrency laundering.},

With the rapid advancement of generative models, generative steganography has gained renewed vitality. As a key medium on the Internet, audio has also become a focus of steganographic research. However, existing audio steganography methods rely on traditional audio synthesis models, which often suffer from suboptimal synthesis quality. In contrast, diffusion models perform well in audio synthesis tasks, but there is a lack of targeted secure audio steganography methods based on them. In addition, existing steganography schemes are generally limited to transmitting only the steganographic object, and other key elements need to be negotiated in advance, which limits their practicality. To address these issues, we propose CoAS, a composite audio steganography method based on text and speech synthesis. Firstly, we use a provably secure linguistic steganography method to embed the synchronous side information required for audio steganography, and then replace the gaussian noise in the diffusion models with message-driven sampling during the audio generation process. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the security and practicality of our composite steganography method in the real world.

  abstract     = {In recent years, there has been an increasing number of information hiding techniques based on network streaming media, focusing on how to covertly and efficiently embed secret information into real-time transmitted network media signals to achieve concealed communication. The misuse of these techniques can lead to significant security risks, such as the spread of malicious code, commands, and viruses. Current steganalysis methods for network voice streams face two major challenges: efficient detection under low embedding rates and short duration conditions. These challenges arise because, with low embedding rates (e.g., as low as 10%) and short transmission durations (e.g., only 0.1s), detection models struggle to acquire sufficiently rich sample features, making effective steganalysis difficult. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Dual-View VoIP Steganalysis Framework (DVSF). The framework first randomly obfuscates parts of the native steganographic descriptors in VoIP stream segments, making the steganographic features of hard-to-detect samples more pronounced and easier to learn. It then captures fine-grained local features related to steganography, building on the global features of VoIP. Specially constructed VoIP segment triplets further adjust the feature distances within the model. Ultimately, this method effectively address the detection difficulty in VoIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy of streaming voice steganalysis in these challenging detection scenarios, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods and offering superior near-real-time performance.},

Despite its potential, hiding a secret image using existing generative steganographic models remains a challenge, especially in lossy or noisy communication channels. This paper proposes a robust generative steganography model for hiding full-size image. It lies on three reversible concatenated mappings proposed. The first mapping uses VQGAN with an order-preserving codebook to compress an image into a more concise representation. The second mapping incorporates error correction to further convert the representation into a robust binary representation. The third mapping devises a distribution-preserving sampling mapping that transforms the binary representation into the latent representation. This latent representation is then used as input for a text-to-image Diffusion model, which generates the final stego image. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme can freely customize the stego image content. Moreover, it simultaneously attains high stego and recovery image quality, high robustness, and provable security.},

However, existing research has not effectively addressed these three security requirements under a strong threat model. To tackle this issue, we propose an Efficient Aggregation for Federated Learning with Robustness, Verifiability, and Privacy (EARVP): 1) The Privacy-Preserving Two-Party Kernel Principal Component Analysis (PPTKPCA) combined with the DP-Tolerant Two-Party Density Clustering (DPTTDC) achieves strong robustness; 2) The Distributed Trust Aggregation Integrity Verification (DTAIV) ensures strong verifiability even in the presence of collusion; 3) The Gradient-Lossless Enhancement of Client-Level Differential Privacy (GLECLDP) ensures that the lossless gradient generation stage satisfies malicious privacy security and that gradient updates meet $(\epsilon,\delta)$ -DP during the defense stage; and 4) The entire process employs lightweight protocols to achieve efficiency. Theoretical analysis proves that EARVP ensures semi-honest privacy security, malicious privacy security, and aggregation verifiability. Experimental results further demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the system. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, EARVP improves test accuracy by 14.51%, detection accuracy by 13.37%, reduces poisoning success rate by 1.89%, lowers defense overhead by 13.78% compared to homomorphic encryption schemes, and reduces verification costs by a large magnitude.},

To this end, the pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model has become a de facto choice for deepfake detection, thanks to its powerful learning capability. Despite favorable results achieved by existing ViT-based methods, they have inherent limitations that could result in suboptimal performance in scenarios with continuously evolving forgery techniques, such as overfitting to single forgery patterns or placing excessive emphasis on dominant forgery regions. In this paper, we propose CUTA, a simple yet effective deepfake detection paradigm that utilizes ViT adapters as the medium and fully exploits the spatial- and frequency-domain features of given images to overcome the limitations of existing methods. Specifically, CUTA focuses on frequency domain masking within the input space, which obscures parts of the high-frequency image to intensify the training challenge while preserving subtle forgery cues in the frequency domain to facilitate comprehensive forgery representations. Furthermore, we propose two task-customized modules within the ViT model, i.e., the texture enhancement module and the multi-scale perceptron module, to seamlessly integrate local texture and rich contextual features. These two modules ensure an organic interaction between the task-specific forgery patterns and general semantic features within the pre-trained ViT framework. The experimental results on several publicly available benchmarks demonstrate CUTA’s superiority in performance, particularly showcasing its significant advantages in both cross-dataset and cross-manipulation scenarios.

  abstract     = {The rapid development of photo-realistic face generation methods has raised significant concerns in society and academia, highlighting the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection (FFD) techniques. Although existing approaches mainly capture face forgery patterns using image modality, other modalities like fine-grained noises and texts are not fully explored, which limits the generalization capability of the model. In addition, most FFD methods tend to identify facial images generated by GAN, but struggle to detect unseen diffusion-synthesized ones. To address the limitations, we aim to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), to achieve generalizable diffusion face forgery detection (DFFD). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fine-grained CLIP (MFCLIP) model, which mines comprehensive and fine-grained forgery traces across image-noise modalities via language-guided face forgery representation learning, to facilitate the advancement of DFFD. Specifically, we devise a fine-grained language encoder (FLE) that extracts fine global language features from hierarchical text prompts. We design a multi-modal vision encoder (MVE) to capture global image forgery embeddings as well as fine-grained noise forgery patterns extracted from the richest patch, and integrate them to mine general visual forgery traces. Moreover, we build an innovative plug-and-play sample pair attention (SPA) method to emphasize relevant negative pairs and suppress irrelevant ones, allowing cross-modality sample pairs to conduct more flexible alignment. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.

  abstract     = {Mini-apps, which run on super-apps, have attracted a large number of users due to their lightweight nature and the convenience of supporting the authorized use of super-app user information. Super-apps employ encryption to protect the transmission of sensitive identity information authorized by users to the mini-app, using the session key as the key. However, we have identified a risk of session key leakage, which could be exploited to maliciously manipulate sensitive user identity information, thereby posing a significant threat to user data security. To reveal this damage, we explore potential business scenarios of session key leakage in detail. Nevertheless, the diversity in design among various mini-apps makes automated testing of these business scenarios at a large scale challenging. This diversity is reflected in the inconsistent naming of identical types of controls and the disparate execution orders of controls within the same business scenarios across different mini-apps. To overcome these challenges, we propose Whiskey, which can adaptively and intelligently optimize dynamic testing strategies for mini-apps with diverse designs using large language models to detect session key leakage at scale. We evaluated Whiskey on 157,063 WeChat mini-apps and 10,000 TikTok mini-apps, and found that 15,712 of WeChat mini-apps and 678 of TikTok mini-apps had session key leakage vulnerabilities. Further analysis showed that this leakage could lead to account takeover and promotion abuse attacks. We responsibly reported the detection results to Tencent and the mini-app vendors. At the time of submission, 17 reported issues had been assigned CNVD IDs.},

  abstract     = {In 2021, the pioneering work TypeNet showed that keystroke dynamics verification could scale to hundreds of thousands of users with minimal performance degradation. Recently, the KVC-onGoing competition (https://sites.google.com/view/bida-kvc/) has provided an open and robust experimental protocol for evaluating keystroke dynamics verification systems of such scale. This article describes Type2Branch, the model and techniques that achieved the lowest error rates at the KVC-onGoing, in both desktop and mobile typing scenarios. The novelty aspects of the proposed Type2Branch include: i)synthesized timing features emphasizing user behavior deviation from the general population, ii) a dual-branch architecture combining recurrent and convolutional paths with various attention mechanisms, iii) a new loss function named Set2set that captures the global structure of the embedding space, and iv) a training curriculum of increasing difficulty. Considering five enrollment samples per subject of approximately 50 characters typed, the proposed Type2Branch achieves state-of-the-art performance with mean per-subject Equal Error Rates (EERs) of 0.77% and 1.03% on evaluation sets of respectively 15,000 and 5,000 subjects for desktop and mobile scenarios. With a fixed global threshold for all subjects, the EERs are respectively 3.25% and 3.61% for desktop and mobile scenarios, outperforming previous approaches by a significant margin.

  abstract     = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been shown effective in strengthening the physical layer security of wireless systems, and the two-timescale design was proposed to tackle the challenges in channel estimation and phase-shift control. However, existing maximum ratio transmission (MRT) based precoding design is not efficient in mitigating information leakage. To this end, this paper considers the performance analysis and two-timescale design for RIS-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) secure communications with regularized zero-forcing (RZF) and zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, which is not available in the literature. The major challenges come from the two-hop channel and the inverse structure in the precoding matrix. By utilizing random matrix theory, we first evaluate the fundamental limits of the considered system by deriving a closed-form expression for the ergodic secrecy sum rate (ESSR). Then, we determine the optimal regularization factor of the RZF precoder and evaluate the ESSR over independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channels in the high SNR regime. The results indicate that when the number of reconfigurable elements at the RIS is overwhelmingly larger than that of transmit antennas and users, the ESSR of the two-hop channel approaches that of the single-hop channel. Based on the performance analysis, we propose a two-timescale algorithm to maximize the ESSR by optimizing the regularization factor of RZF and the phase shifts of the RIS alternatively. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Owing to the large cross-modal differences between face sketches and photos, extracting and aligning cross-modal features is still considered a challenging task in the face sketch recognition community. This paper presents a novel cross-modal aligned identity-discriminative feature learning network (CAIFL-Net) for face sketch recognition. Specifically, in this paper, an identity-discriminative feature preservation module is designed to capture the identity-discriminative features of face sketches and photos by eliminating features that are weakly related to recognition. In addition, a sketch-photo cross-reconstructed feature alignment module is proposed to obtain cross-modal aligned features for effective recognition by reconstructing and embedding global features of one modality into another. Extensive experiments on the Uom-SGFS and CUFSF datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CAIFL-Net.},

However, existing authentication schemes based on anonymous credentials still face single-point failure in multi-authority scenarios. In addition, in traditional anonymous credential schemes, the public key of credential authority is used directly to verify the credential, which may increase the risk of vehicle privacy being misused. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized threshold credential management system with fine-grained authentication for VANETs. The decentralized credential management architecture is proposed for VANETs with multiple credential authorities, each credential authority consists of multiple credential managers who issue credentials using the threshold mechanism, effectively solving the single-point failure. Based on this architecture, we design a fine-grained, privacy-preserving authentication scheme that allows vehicles to autonomously perform selective attribute disclosure, credential aggregation, and randomization before requesting verification from the Cloud Service Provider, thereby achieving a balance between privacy preservation and authentication efficiency. The security proofs and analysis show that our scheme satisfies the target security properties. Performance evaluations indicate that our scheme enables efficient, flexible credential management and authentication in VANETs while ensuring privacy preservation.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been confirmed to exhibit vulnerability, as they are susceptible to deception by adversarial examples. Transfer-based attacks perturb a surrogate model and use the transferability of adversarial examples to attack other models. The effectiveness of these attacks relies heavily on the surrogate model, which often focuses on non-critical regions like backgrounds or object edges, leading to poor transferability. The intrinsic properties of the surrogate model fundamentally determine the performance of transfer-based attacks, yet this aspect has rarely been the focus of research. Therefore, we respectively design image masking operations for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), forcing the model to reallocate attention to the critical regions. The attention of the surrogate model on the masked image and the original image is then aligned by inserting an alignment network inside the model. The modified surrogate model becomes more proficient in capturing the critical regions within the image, thereby generating more powerful adversarial examples. The proposed alignment network can be integrated into existing transfer-based attacks, significantly enhancing their performance. In addition, we also propose a novel feature-level attack based on the aligned attention, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art feature-level attacks.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has found widespread applications across diverse scenarios. Since the DRL training process requires substantial time and financial costs, well-trained DRL policies should be considered as intellectual property (IP) which deserves proper protection. However, to date, there are only a few studies on IP protection on DRL and the existing methods are limited to passive copyright verification. In this paper, we propose the first active authorization control method for DRL which can proactively protect deep reinforcement learning policy. The DRL policy trained with this method can be used by authorized users normally, but cannot be used by unauthorized users (i.e., the protected policy’s performance for unauthorized users is paralyzed). Specifically, we train a trigger injection network and a discriminator network based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). During the DRL policy training phase, we use trigger injection network to insert sample-specific triggers to all observations and use triggered observations to train the protected policy. Our approach is applicable across various deep reinforcement learning algorithms. We conduct effectiveness experiments on different DRL policies trained using different DRL algorithms, and the experimental results revealed that the performance of authorized users is on par with the performance of clean DRL policy trained normally (baseline), whereas the performance of unauthorized users significantly deviates from that of the baseline. Specifically, the authorized performance of protected Breakout-DQN, Breakout-A2C, MsPacman-DQN and MsPacman-A2C policies are 416.4 (baseline 397.8), 403.0 (baseline 415.0), 2552.0 (baseline 2472.0), and 1964.0 (baseline 1828.0). Comparatively, the unauthorized performance of protected Breakout-DQN, Breakout-A2C, MsPacman-DQN and MsPacman-A2C policies are only 4.4 (baseline 397.8), 2.0 (baseline 415.0), 74.0 (baseline 2472.0), and 514.0 (baseline 1828.0). Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits robustness against pruning, fine-tuning, and adaptive attacks.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the problem of distributed learning (DL) with devices transmitting sign information of the local gradients to the server under communication constraints, where the devices are susceptible to Byzantine attacks. For this problem, a sign-based gradient descent method with majority vote and stochastic 1-bit quantization (Sign-M-stochastic) has been proposed very recently. However, the Byzantine resilience of Sign-M-stochastic is inherently limited, based on the fact that all Byzantine devices and honest devices participate equally in the training process. To overcome this drawback and enhance the resilience to Byzantine attacks, inspired by the audit-based distributed detection systems, we propose a novel DL method with an audit mechanism (DL-AM). In each iteration, the sign information of the local gradients are obtained by the devices from stochastic 1-bit quantization. All devices, partitioned into groups, send the sign information to the server through multiple paths, both directly and via other devices in the same group. This approach provides the server with additional information about the identities of the devices, which enables the server to form the global model update by aggregating the sign information of different devices with varying weights. We analyze the convergence performance of the proposed method from a theoretical perspective. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the superiority of DL-AM over the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Encrypted traffic classification is highly challenging in network security due to the need for extracting robust features from content-agnostic traffic data. Existing approaches face critical issues: (i) Distribution drift, caused by reliance on the closed-world assumption, limits adaptability to real-world, shifting patterns; (ii) Dependence on labeled data restricts applicability where such data is scarce or unavailable. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in offering generalizable solutions across a wide range of tasks, achieving notable success in various specialized fields. However, their effectiveness in traffic analysis remains constrained by challenges in adapting to the unique requirements of the traffic domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel traffic representation model named Encrypted Traffic Out-of-Distribution Instruction Tuning with LLM (ETooL), which integrates LLMs with knowledge of traffic structures through a self-supervised instruction tuning paradigm. This framework establishes connections between textual information and traffic interactions. ETooL demonstrates more robust classification performance and superior generalization in both supervised and zero-shot traffic classification tasks. Notably, it achieves significant improvements in F1 scores: APP53 (I.I.D.) to 93.19%(6.62% $\uparrow $ ) and 92.11%(4.19% $\uparrow $ ), APP53 (O.O.D.) to 74.88%(18.17% $\uparrow $ ) and 72.13%(15.15% $\uparrow $ ), and ISCX-Botnet (O.O.D.) to 95.03%(9.16% $\uparrow $ ) and 81.95%(12.08% $\uparrow $ ). Additionally, we construct NETD, a traffic dataset designed to support dynamic distributional shifts, and use it to validate ETooL’s effectiveness under varying distributional conditions. Furthermore, we evaluate the efficiency gains achieved through ETooL’s instruction tuning approach.},

  abstract     = {Text-based person search aims to identify specific target person from the database according to the given text description. Early work adopted separately pretrained encoders to extract visual and textual features, but benefit from the bloom of visual language pre-training, recent work uses unified pretrained visual language models such as CLIP as backbone. However, visual language models are generally pretrained from coarse-grained image-text pairs, while image-text pairs in text-based person search are more fine-grained to distinguish different persons. In addition, visual and linguistic concepts naturally organize themselves in a hierarchy, which is not explicitly captured by current large-scale vision and language models such as CLIP. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Granularity-Aware Hyperbolic Representation learning method for mining granularity and capturing semantic hierarchy. Notably, we consider both token-level and instance-level granularity. For token-granularity alignment, we present a Bidirectional Attention Interaction module to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained visual tokens and text tokens. For instance-granularity alignment, we equip the contrastive learning loss with Semantic Margin Softmax so that image-text pairs can perceive the similarity granularity of different samples during training. Besides, the global features of images and texts are mapped into hyperbolic space through Hyperbolic Representation Learning to embed tree-like data to capture semantic hierarchy. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the three widely acknowledged benchmarks, namely CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReID.

  abstract     = {Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is essential for ensuring device security in ubiquitous wireless communications and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although deep learning (DL) and self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have significantly enhanced RFFI system performance, they often depend on data sourced from open internet datasets or collected in uncontrolled environments. This dependency heightens the risk of malicious data tampering, particularly in adversarial environment, thereby exacerbating security vulnerabilities. To address this issue, this paper investigates the vulnerability of SSL-based RFFI systems to backdoor attacks and introduces a novel method utilizing a spectrum-enhanced insensitive perturbation (SEIP) trigger. We develop an SSL-based RFFI backdoor attack framework, providing new insights into SSL security within the signal processing domain. The SEIP trigger introduces subtle perturbations in the frequency domain, enabling highly effective and covert backdoor attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the SEIP trigger outperforms existing triggers regarding attack effectiveness across various channel conditions while maintaining strong stealthiness against backdoor defense mechanisms. These findings confirm that the SEIP trigger achieves an optimal balance between attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Moreover, this paper offers a new perspective for evaluating the security of RFFI systems and the resilience of backdoor defense strategies.},

  abstract     = {High throughput is demanding in real-world iris recognition applications. The challenges mainly originate from the variability in image quality under high-throughput capture conditions. Most of the degraded images are typically filtered out by traditional iris systems through Image Quality Assessment (IQA) module, adversely affecting efficiency and leading to low throughput and poor user experience. Therefore, a better and practical solution is to make the utmost of degraded iris images. In order to investigate the key problems of high-throughput iris recognition, we collect a novel iris sequence dataset under Near-infrared (NIR) illumination. This dataset is specifically constructed for high-throughput evaluation, which faithfully simulates the process of iris sequence acquisition in real-world iris systems. Comprehensive evaluations were conducted to figure out the deficiencies of current iris recognition algorithms. To this end, a testing methodology along with specific evaluation metrics is proposed. It is capable of assessing the throughput performance, e.g., the newly proposed Frame Consumption per Match (FCM). Through performance analysis, several insights were gathered to guide potential directions for developing high-throughput iris recognition algorithms. Furthermore, we consider to leverage iris sequence features for better throughput performance. Continuity sequence criteria and cumulative sequence feature strategy are proposed to enhance the throughput performance of existing algorithms with minimal cost. In summary, this work provides valuable data and rational insights for high-throughput iris recognition studies.

  abstract     = {Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been used to noninvasively image the 3D structure of fingertip skin at high resolution. Unlike traditional 2D sensors (e.g., infrared light or capacitive technologies), the friction ridge information in 3D OCT fingerprint measurements requires reconstruction through layer segmentation. Accurate layer segmentation is helpful for fingerprint recognition and antispoofing applications. OCT volumes contain information corresponding to different directions that naturally provide complementary views. Inspired by this fact, we propose a novel orthogonal view-based attention network called OVA-Net, which exploits orthogonal views to learn the complementary information implied in the 3D fingerprint structure. Specifically, 3D convolutions and an A-line-based attention module are proposed in the B-scan view to model the long short-term intraslice correlations, whereas their counterparts in the C-scan view aim to model interslice correlations. An optical flow-based attention module is also proposed in the B-scan view to extract correlations between B-scans, which complements the interslice correlation learned in the C-scan view. Features from orthogonal views are progressively incorporated into a fusion pipeline for 3D layer segmentation. The effectiveness of OVA-Net is comprehensively evaluated in terms of layer segmentation accuracy, fingerprint reconstruction quality, and recognition performance.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL), as a promising machine learning paradigm for large-scale distributed data, faces two security challenges of privacy and robustness: the transmitted model updates potentially leak sensitive user information, and the lack of central control over local model updates leaves the global model susceptible to malicious attacks. Current solutions attempting to address both problems under the one-server FL setting fall short in the following aspects: 1) design for simple validity checks that are insufficient against advanced attacks (e.g., checking norm of individual update); and 2) have partial privacy leakage for more complicated robust aggregation algorithms (e.g., distances between model updates are leaked for multi-Krum). In this work, we formalize a novel security notion of aggregated privacy that characterizes the minimum amount of user information, in the form of aggregated statistics of users’ updates, that is necessary to be revealed to accomplish more advanced robust aggregation. We develop a general framework PriRoAgg, utilizing Lagrange coded computing and distributed zero-knowledge proof, to execute a wide range of robust aggregation algorithms while satisfying aggregated privacy. As concrete instantiations of PriRoAgg, we construct two secure and robust protocols based on state-of-the-art robust algorithms, for which we provide full theoretical analyses on security and complexity. Extensive experiments are conducted for these protocols, demonstrating their robustness against various model integrity attacks, and their efficiency advantages over baselines.},

  abstract     = {Deep neural networks are proven to be vulnerable to finely designed adversarial examples, and adversarial defense algorithms draw more and more attention nowadays. Pre-processing based defense is a major strategy, as well as learning robust feature representation, has been proven an effective way to boost generalization. However, existing defense works lack considering different depth-level visual features in the training process. In this paper, we first highlight two novel properties of robust features from the feature distribution perspective: 1)Diversity (robust features within the same class should maintain appropriate variety). 2) Discriminability (robust features from different classes should be sufficiently separated). We find that state-of-the-art defense methods aim to address both of these mentioned issues well. It motivates us to increase intra-class variance and decrease inter-class discrepancy simultaneously in adversarial training. Specifically, we propose a simple but effective defense based on decoupled visual representation masking. The designed Decoupled Visual Feature Masking (DFM) block can adaptively disentangle visual discriminative features and non-visual features with diverse mask strategies, while the suitable discarding information can disrupt adversarial noise to improve robustness. Our work provides a generic and easy-to-plugin block unit for any former adversarial training algorithm to achieve better protection integrally. Extensive experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art defense approaches.

However, most existing strategies constrained by two persistent limitations: suboptimal utilization of cross-modal interactive information, and inherent discrepancies across hierarchical textual representation. To address these challenges, we propose the Modality-Specific Interactive Attack (MSI-Attack), a novel approach that integrates semantic-level image perturbations with embedding-level text perturbations, all while maintaining minimal inter-modal constraints. In our image attack methodology, we introduce Multi-modal Integrated Gradients (MIG) to guide perturbations toward the core semantics of images, enriched by their associated deeply text information. This technique enhances transferability by capturing consistent features across various models, thereby effectively misleading similar-model perception areas. Additionally, we employ a momentum iteration strategy in conjunction with MIG, which amalgamates current and historical gradients to expedite the perturbation updates. For text attacks, we streamline the perturbation process by operating exclusively at the embedding level. This reduces semantic gaps across hierarchical structures and significantly enhances the generalizability of adversarial text. Moreover, we delve deeper into how semantic perturbations with varying degrees of similarity affect the overall attack effectiveness. Our experimental results on image-text retrieval tasks using the multi-modal datasets Flickr30K and MSCOCO underscore the efficacy of MSI-Attack. Our method achieves superior performance, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark, all without the need for additional mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has garnered significant research attention from both academic and medical institutions. However, the sensitive medical data involved in IoMT raises security and privacy concerns. To mitigate these, ring signature has surfaced as a proper solution, which offers unforgeability and anonymity. Unfortunately, most multi-signer ring signature schemes require a predetermined number of signers and are difficult to adjust dynamically. Additionally, traditional ring signatures have limited adaptability for IoMT due to their reliance on a single entity. It is challenging to effectively define different signature permissions for users of various entities, such as patients and doctors. Therefore, research focusing on constructing a dynamic multi-signer ring signature for multi-party participation remains a critical and ongoing challenge. In this paper, we present ASMR, an anonymity-enhanced sequential multi-signer ring signature scheme for secure medical data sharing in IoMT. ASMR contains two different rings, PR and DR, for patients and doctors, respectively. It allows patients in PR to anonymously sign their electronic healthcare record (EHR) owned by doctors in DR, overcoming the reliance on a single entity in existing approaches while enhancing the anonymity of the signature. Meanwhile, ASMR introduces the concept of signature chaining, allowing multiple users in DR to co-sign information in sequence. In addition, it ensures that each generated signature is traceable, offering a transparent system. We also formally prove the security of ASMR in the random oracle model. Comprehensive performance evaluations indicate that ASMR excels in both computational and storage overhead. In the best case, computational overhead is reduced by approximately $4.7\times $ - $61.7\times $ , while storage overhead is reduced by approximately $26.7\times $ - $212.8\times $ compared to prior arts.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial training (AT) is considered the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. However, a recent study revealed that $\ell _{\infty }$ -norm adversarial training ( $\ell _{\infty }$ -AT) will also induce unevenly distributed input gradients, which is called the inequality phenomenon. This phenomenon makes the $\ell _{\infty }$ -norm adversarially trained model more vulnerable than the standard-trained model when high-attribution or randomly selected pixels are perturbed, enabling robust and practical closed-box attacks against $\ell _{\infty }$ -adversarially trained models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called Input Gradient Distillation (IGD) to release the inequality phenomenon in $\ell _{\infty }$ -AT. IGD distills the standard-trained teacher model’s equal decision pattern into the $\ell _{\infty }$ -adversarially trained student model by aligning input gradients of the student model and the standard-trained model with the Cosine Similarity. Experiments show that IGD can mitigate the inequality phenomenon and its threats while preserving adversarial robustness. Compared to vanilla $\ell _{\infty }$ -AT, IGD reduces error rates against inductive noise, inductive occlusion, random noise, and noisy images in ImageNet-C by up to 60%, 16%, 50%, and 21%, respectively. Other than empirical experiments, we also conduct a theoretical analysis to explain why releasing the inequality phenomenon can improve such robustness and discuss why the severity of the inequality phenomenon varies according to the dataset’s image resolution.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces Elliptic Curve Modulation (ECM), a novel modulation scheme that can be leveraged to effectively shuffle transmitted data while maintaining symbol error probability (SEP) performance equivalent to unencrypted systems. By utilizing the well-distributed elliptic curve points over the field of large primes, ECM enhances symbol obfuscation, making it a powerful foundation for physical-layer encryption (PLE). Each symbol is mapped from a predefined key while preserving a minimum Euclidean distance constraint, ensuring strong security against adversarial inference without compromising error performance. Building on ECM’s strong obfuscation capabilities, we propose ECM with dynamic rotation (ECM-DR) as a practical PLE scheme that achieves near-maximal obfuscation while balancing precomputation complexity. By leveraging a reduced subset of precomputed elliptic curve points and key-based dynamic constellation rotation, ECM-DR ensures that each transmission remains unpredictable, significantly enhancing security compared to traditional PLE schemes without additional computational cost. Security analysis confirms ECM’s resilience to brute-force attacks, while numerical results demonstrate its strong obfuscation capabilities. Furthermore, ECM-DR achieves near-maximum information entropy while preserving the SEP performance of unencrypted quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), offering an extremely robust solution for secure wireless communications.},

  abstract     = {Owing to flexible management and low overhead, wireless physical layer security (PLS) has been applied to support many critical applications (e.g., data dissemination) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-based mobile communication networks in emergency scenarios. Although the impact of static network scenarios or receiver mobility on PLS has been well studied, there is no much work that studies the impact of UAV-based transmitter mobility on PLS. To fill this gap, in this paper, we investigate PLS of a scenario, where a random mobile UAV-based transmitter transmits information to a static ground entity under Rayleigh fading channel. More specifically, we consider a communication system, in which a mobile UAV hovers over a region to collect information and then disseminates this information to a static ground network entity in a confidential manner under the presence of an eavesdropper. Because of popularity and practicality, the UAV is assumed to hover following the random way point (RWP) mobility model. We investigate the secrecy characteristics of the UAV under steady running state in terms of ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC), positive secrecy capacity probability (PSCP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP) for the communication between the UAV and the receiver. We then investigate the secrecy performance of the proposed system while considering the pause time of the RWP mobility model adopted by the UAV. We further extend our proposed theoretical model to other realistic scenarios, including the presence of multiple cooperative and non-cooperative eavesdroppers, and study the PSCP and SOP metrics of the corresponding system. Furthermore, we propose three types of secrecy improvement strategies for the considered communication model. We strike a good trade-off between the secrecy improvement and transmit outage probability. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate our theoretical analysis as well as the effectiveness of the proposed secrecy improvement strategies.},

  abstract     = {Recent progress of randomized fully asynchronous BFT consensus not only presents appealing performance but also ensures superior robustness against an asynchronous adversary that can arbitrarily delay network communication. But these results are mostly discussed in a static setting with fixed nodes. The root reason for the limit is the heavy dependence on a pre-configured threshold cryptosystem, which is critical to practically generate common randomness for overcoming FLP impossibility, but also fixes a designated set of participants. Even worse, most existing asynchronous BFT protocols rely on another strong assumption that messages sent among honest nodes must eventually be delivered, which could be plausible in the static setting (as all nodes can stay online forever to deliver messages) but becomes elusive in a dynamic blockchain, because a departing node might stop transmitting messages and subsequently cause inevitable message omissions as well as potential security violations. To accommodate the enticing asynchronous BFT consensus into real-world blockchains where participating nodes are joining and leaving, we introduce $\textsf {Turritopsis}$ , a novel dynamic asynchronous BFT framework that can 1) efficiently re-configure threshold cryptosystem to accommodate the change of consensus nodes and 2) tolerate admissible message omissions caused by leaving participants. We first propose a dedicatedly optimized asynchronous distributed key refresh protocol that can quickly reset key materials of discrete logarithm threshold cryptosystem (e.g. BLS threshold signature), from which common randomness can be derived to ensure both safety and liveness despite the rotation of participating nodes. We then extend asynchronous BFT to tolerate a combination of t Byzantine nodes and l honest leaving nodes, where $3t+2l$ is smaller than the total number n of currently participating nodes. This allows us to tolerate up to l leaving nodes that might behave like crashes due to their departures, while simultaneously preserving maximal resilience against $\lfloor (n - 2l) /3 \rfloor $ malicious corruptions. We instantiated $\textsf {Turritopsis}$ and implemented it in Python 3. Extensive experiments were conducted, spanning a network of up to $n=60$ AWS EC2 nodes across 15 cities, revealing that $\textsf {Turritopsis}$ exhibits performance closely comparable to its fixed-committee counterpart in both latency and throughput.},

Recent studies have demonstrated that black-box single-modality and cross-modality re-id models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), leaving the robustness of multi-modality re-id models unexplored. Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality) re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative metric disruption loss. Extensive experiments show that our MUA method can effectively attack the omni-modality re-id models, achieving 55.9%, 24.4%, 49.0% and 62.7% mean mAP Drop Rate, respectively.},

Transfer-based attacks do not require access to the target model’s information, have emerged as a substantial threat to the deployment of DNNs in real-world scenarios. Although considerable works have been conducted to enhance adversarial transferability from various perspectives, the transferability remains suboptimal. In this work, we propose a novel transfer-based attack, termed Gradient Aggregation Attack (GAA). Inspired by the observation that flatter local minima can improve transferability, GAA incorporates both the worst-aware loss and substitute loss into the objective function. The worst-aware loss represents the maximum loss within the neighborhood of the adversarial example, while the substitute loss quantifies the difference between the worst-aware loss and the empirical loss, serving as a measure of the flatness of the local minima region. By optimizing the empirical loss alongside these two losses, GAA is capable of generating adversarial examples within a flat local minimum region while simultaneously enhancing its flatness, ultimately surpassing all baselines. Specifically, since directly optimizing the worst-aware loss incurs substantial computation during adversarial example generation, we approximate the worst-aware loss with a first-order Taylor expansion to mitigate this computational cost. Via rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GAA method generates adversarial examples corresponding to flatter local minima regions. Compared to existing transfer-based attacks, GAA effectively enhances adversarial transferability, regardless of whether the model is a normally trained or an advanced defense model.},

As the number of participants increases, the performance of multi-party PSI protocols is significantly influenced, primarily by the number of interaction rounds needed. In this study, we propose two novel multi-party PSI protocols: the first one is $1\textsf {M}\mathbb {P}\textsf {SI}$ , and the second is $2\textsf {M}\mathbb {P}\textsf {SI}$ . The $1\textsf {M}\mathbb {P}\textsf {SI}$ appears as a wheel structure where the parties need only one round of interactive communication online. $1\textsf {M}\mathbb {P}\textsf {SI}$ is based on the Ring version of Oblivious Linear-function Evaluation (OLE). Benefiting from the wheel structure, $1\textsf {M}\mathbb {P}\textsf {SI}$ supports parallel computation and achieves competitive efficiency between the leader and the other participants (OLE receivers) after input-independent precomputation. The $2\textsf {M}\mathbb {P}\textsf {SI}$ adopts a dual-core star structure and introduces Oblivious Key-Value Store (OKVS), which results in better performance when handling larger set sizes and more participants. Our protocols are designed with simplicity and ease of implementation in mind.

  abstract     = {Recently, Li et al. proposed an identity-based linearly homomorphic network coding signature (IB-HNCS) scheme for secure data delivery in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, and they claimed that the IB-HNCS scheme can resist pollution attacks. However, this paper shows that the IB-HNCS scheme is vulnerable to pollution attacks, as anyone who only has the public parameter can forge a new file identifier or a valid signature on a corrupted data packet to pollute legitimate sensor data. To enhance security and performance in network coding-based IoT networks, we propose a secure and efficient certificateless linearly homomorphic network coding signature scheme for IoT data delivery, which is free of burdensome certificate management and key escrow issue. In addition, our scheme is proved to be secure against adaptive chosen identity and adaptive chosen subspace attacks under two types of adversaries in the algebraic group model and random oracle model. Therefore, our scheme can verify the validity of data packets and allow data packets to be computed, so as to resist pollution attacks. The performance evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is more efficient and practical than existing secure schemes. Specifically, for a 73-dimensional data vector, the costs of signature generation and verification in our scheme are reduced by 38.588%-86.076% and 38.570%-85.664% respectively under the symmetric bilinear pairing setting, and the costs of signature generation and verification in our scheme are reduced by 17.740%-49.752% and 29.697%-58.645% respectively under the asymmetric bilinear pairing setting.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid expansion of data volumes in cloud computing, more data owners are opting to outsource their data to cloud service providers to reduce local storage and management costs. However, data outsourcing deprives data owners of direct physical control over their data, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and exposure of sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, various privacy-preserving keyword search schemes with access control have been developed, but many are vulnerable to leakage-abuse attacks due to the exposure of access, search or volume patterns, which can lead to privacy breaches in outsourced data and queries. To solve this problem, we propose an oblivious encrypted keyword search scheme with fine-grained access control, called OEKA. It enables efficient oblivious keyword search over encrypted multi-maps by using the adapted XOR filter and distributed point function, ensuring protection of access, search and volume patterns. Moreover, OEKA enforces role-based access control by using polynomial-based access strategy and keyword-based private information retrieval, allowing access policies of retrieved objects to be detecting without revealing the objects themselves. A formal security analysis verifies the scheme’s robustness, and experimental results demonstrate its practical efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) aims to match pedestrian sequences across modalities by extracting modality-invariant sequence-level features. As a high-level semantic representation, language provides a consistent description of pedestrian characteristics in both infrared and visible modalities. Leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model to generate video-level language prompts and guide the learning of modality-invariant sequence-level features is theoretically feasible. However, the challenge of generating and utilizing modality-shared video-level language prompts to address modality gaps remains a critical problem. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet powerful framework, video-level language-driven VVI-ReID (VLD), which consists of two core modules: invariant-modality language prompting (IMLP) and spatial-temporal prompting (STP). IMLP employs a joint fine-tuning strategy for the visual encoder and the prompt learner to effectively generate modality-shared text prompts and align them with visual features from different modalities in CLIP’s multimodal space, thereby mitigating modality differences. Additionally, STP models spatiotemporal information through two submodules, the spatial-temporal hub (STH) and spatial-temporal aggregation (STA), which further enhance IMLP by incorporating spatiotemporal information into text prompts. The STH aggregates and diffuses spatiotemporal information into the [CLS] token of each frame across the vision transformer (ViT) layers, whereas STA introduces dedicated identity-level loss and specialized multihead attention to ensure that the STH focuses on identity-relevant spatiotemporal feature aggregation. The VLD framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two VVI-ReID benchmarks. On the HITSZ-VCM dataset, it improves the Rank-1 accuracy by 7.3% and mAP by 7.6% (infrared-to-visible) and the Rank-1 accuracy by 10.4% and the mAP accuracy by 9.3% (visible to infrared) and requires only 2 hours of training, 2.39M additional parameters, and 0.12G FLOPs.

  abstract     = {As three-dimensional (3D) point cloud technology has advanced, the security concerns that surround point cloud classification models have garnered increasing attention. Attackers poison the training dataset of a model to mislead model classification, which is known as a backdoor attack. Considering the uncertainty in environmental factors and point cloud sampling equipment, point cloud data may be subject to various types of corruption. While some existing classification models, e.g., PointNet and PointNet++, include corruption invariance in their designs, backdoor triggers are more vulnerable to corruption because of their small size. When corrupted, backdoor samples are more likely to be misclassified into their original categories than are clean samples. The reason is that the backdoor samples, which manipulate the model, are closer to the decision boundary than the clean samples are. To mitigate the detrimental effects of sample feature deviation, this paper proposes a novel backdoor attack method that is robust to corruption. We introduce the concept of affinity based on the high-level idea that the affinity category can facilitate the shift of sample features when corrupted. Afterward, we apply the adversarial attack method to distort the decision boundary to generate backdoor samples. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a high attack success rate and exhibits superior robustness against corruption compared with previous backdoor attack methods.},

Field semantics deduction is an essential step in protocol reverse engineering following the discovery of the message field. Most existing methods rely on knowledge-based analysis for specific fields of common protocols, which require too numerous assumptions and lack semantic knowledge about ICPs. In this paper, we propose a new concept, pattern series, and design the first classification framework for inferring the semantic types of unknown ICPs. Specifically, we first present the definition of pattern series and design the field pattern series generation algorithm for building training data, then develop a field semantics classification model to learn and apply semantic features from known protocols to predict semantic types in unknown protocols. Lastly, we implement a probability-maximizing selection algorithm to obtain optimal semantic types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments with five popular ICPs, including their mixed protocols. Evaluations show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in field semantic recognition, achieving $\geq 90.8$ % F1-score.},

  abstract     = {Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) plays a pivotal role in video surveillance systems for safeguarding public safety. As a fine-grained retrieval task, TPR faces the significant challenge of precisely capturing highly discriminative features across image and text modalities. Existing methods primarily focus on establishing modality-shared feature spaces to bridge cross-modal discrepancies. However, these methods are prone to disturbances from irrelevant information, such as background noises in the visual modality, and often over-emphasize specific local regions while neglecting the capture of diverse discriminative modal features, thereby limiting the robustness of cross-modal matching. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, termed the Diverse Co-saliency Feature Learning Network (DCFL), which mines the co-saliency information between image and text modalities and enhances the diversity of cross-modal discriminative features while mitigating the interference of noise. Specifically, to construct cross-modal co-saliency features, we devise the Intra-modal Saliency Feature Learning (ISFL) and Cross-modal Saliency Feature Matching (CSFM) modules. ISFL employs a weighted mask mechanism to guide the model in reducing the impact of noise information in both modalities. Complementing ISFL, CSFM establishes consistent relationships between saliency features across modalities, leveraging text descriptions to align pedestrian-relevant visual regions. Furthermore, we propose the Diverse Co-saliency Feature Mining (DCFM) to bolster the diversity of discriminative co-saliency features across both image and text modalities. This module integrates a diversity regularization term, enabling the extraction of varied visual cues and capturing comprehensive features of the target individual. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate a substantial superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ysh-strive/DCFL},

  abstract     = {The focus of Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) is shifting toward improving generalization performance in unseen scenarios. Traditional methods employing adversarial learning and meta-learning aim to extract or decouple generalizable features to address these challenges. However, enhancing performance solely through facial features remains challenging without additional informative inputs. To address this, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with robust generalization capabilities have recently been introduced to FAS. Despite their potential, these VLMs typically adopt a late alignment strategy, relying only on encoder output features for modality alignment, which largely neglects mutual guidance between modalities. To bridge this gap, inspired by recent advancements in prompt learning, we employ learnable prompts and masking as intermediaries to enhance interaction between text and visual modalities, enabling the extraction of more generalizable features. Specifically, we propose ME-FAS, a Modality-Enhanced cross-domain FAS model integrating Prompt Fusion Transfer (PFT) and Text-guided Image Masking (TIM). PFT facilitates the integration of text features with visual information, improving domain adaptability in alignment with the textual context. Meanwhile, TIM leverages text features to mask image patches, directing visual features toward critical generalizable facial information, such as the eyes and mouth. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks and various visualizations demonstrate significant performance gains, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

However, this method merely searches in a deterministic latent space, resulting in suboptimal latent codes. Additionally, existing distributional MI schemes assume that an attacker can access the structures and parameters of the target model, which is not always feasible in practice. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Distributional Black-Box Model Inversion (DBB-MI) attack by constructing a probabilistic latent space for searching private data. Specifically, DBB-MI does not require the target model’s parameters or specialized GAN training. Instead, it identifies the latent probability distribution by integrating the output of the target model with multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques. Then, it randomly selects latent codes from the latent probability distribution to uncover private data. As the latent probability distribution closely mirrors the target privacy data in the latent space, the recovered data effectively leaks the privacy of the target model’s training samples. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets and networks demonstrate that our DBB-MI outperforms state-of-the-art MI attacks in terms of attack accuracy, K-nearest neighbor feature distance, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.},

The primary challenge in the VIReID task is to reduce the modality discrepancy between visible and infrared images. Current methods mainly utilize the spatial information, often neglecting the discriminative potential of frequency information. To address this issue, this paper aims to mitigate the modality discrepancy from a frequency domain perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Frequency Domain Nuances Mining (FDNM) method, which mainly includes a Salience-guided Phase Enhancement (SPE) module and an Amplitude Nuances Mining (ANM) module, to effectively explore the cross-modality frequency domain information. These two modules are mutually beneficial to jointly explore frequency-domain visible-infrared nuances, thereby significantly reducing the modality discrepancy in the frequency domain. Additionally, we propose a Center-guided Nuances Mining (CNM) loss to ensure that the ANM module retains discriminative identity information while discovering diverse cross-modality nuances. Extensive experiments show that the proposed FDNM has significant advantages in improving the performance of VIReID. For instance, our method respectively outperforms the second-best method by 5.2% in Rank-1 accuracy and 5.8% in mAP on the SYSU-MM01 dataset under the indoor search mode. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed FDNM method in the challenging visible-infrared face recognition task.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm allowing participants to train a global model collaboratively without sharing training data. The distributed nature makes FL vulnerable to the untargeted or backdoor model poisoning attacks (MPAs). Hence, lots of defense methods are proposed to secure FL. However, existing defenses are ineffective in defending against the emerging stealthy layer-space MPA, since the defenses either focus on the model space or ignore the disparities between the layers. In this paper, we propose a novel layer-space defense method called FLGuardian that can protect the global model from the state-of-the-art MPAs. FLGuardian first employs a new layer-wise detection to find out the benign clients for each layer through pairwise cosine distances and pairwise Euclidean distances combined with a clustering algorithm. Then, FLGuardian assigns a trust score for each client according to the detection results of all the layers, where a deeper layer in the model brings a higher weight in the scoring. Finally, we select several clients with the highest scores for updating the global model. Experimental results show that FLGuardian excels nine typical defense methods against seven state-of-the-art MPAs in most cases. Particularly, under LPattack, the emerging layer-space backdoor MPA, FLGuardian secures Backdoor Success Rate (BSR) below 3% while other defenses have over 93% BSRs on CIFAR-10. Moreover, FLGuardian remains robust against adaptive attacks tailored to FLGuardian.},

  abstract     = {The Onion Router (Tor) is a controversial network whose utility is constantly under scrutiny. On the one hand, it allows for anonymous interaction and cooperation of users seeking untraceable navigation on the Internet. This freedom also attracts criminals who aim to thwart law enforcement investigations, e.g., trading illegal products or services such as drugs or weapons. Tor allows delivering content without revealing the actual hosting address, by means of .onion (or hidden) services. Different from regular domains, these services cannot be resolved by traditional name services, are not indexed by regular search engines, and they frequently change. This generates uncertainty about the extent and size of the Tor network and the type of content offered. In this work, we present a large-scale analysis of the Tor Network. We leverage our crawler, dubbed Mimir, which automatically collects and visits content linked, obtaining a dataset of 25k sites. We analyze the topology of the Tor Network, including its depth and reachability from the surface web. We define a set of heuristics to detect the presence of replicated content (mirrors) and show that most of the analyzed content in the Dark Web ( $\approx 82$ %) is a replica of another site. Also, we train a custom classifier to understand the type of content the hidden services offer. Overall, our study provides new insights into the Tor network, highlighting the importance of the initial seeding during the crawling process. We show that previous work on large-scale Tor measurements does not consider the presence of mirrors, which biases their understanding of the Dark Web topology and the distribution of content.},

  abstract     = {Both truth discovery and pattern analysis are effective methods for extracting valuable insights from data streams in mobile crowdsensing. However, existing privacy-preserving schemes either suffer from low data utility or provide high utility at the cost of weak privacy protection. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust privacy-preserving scheme that facilitates high-utility truth discovery and pattern analysis over mobile crowdsensing data streams. Concretely, we leverage the Square Wave mechanism, a randomized reporting technique, to perturb the data to prevent privacy breaches. To reduce the utility loss caused by perturbation, we design a budget allocation algorithm. This algorithm ensures that adjacent timestamps with approximate data share a perturbed value derived from their accumulated budgets. Furthermore, to facilitate robust pattern analysis, we propose a data splitting method that divides the perturbed data into two parts: one part records patterns randomly, while the other part recovers the perturbed values. Theoretical analysis confirms that our scheme satisfies $\omega $ -event $\epsilon $ -differential privacy level. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our scheme outperforms existing schemes, delivering more accurate results for both truth discovery and pattern analysis under the same privacy constraints.},

Only information-theoretical security can transmitter defend against malicious receiver. However, private information are always entangled with pragmatic information in feature space, which leads global perturbation to degrade communication performance. To handle these difficulties, in this paper a privacy preserving semantic communication system is proposed. Different from traditional paradigm, a novel privacy preserving semantic encoder is designed to realize targeted privacy protection while remaining useful information unaffected. Within proposed privacy preserving semantic encoder, feature decoupling module aims to disentangle semantic information by learning two sets of basis vectors which can express private and pragmatic information of data, respectively. Accordingly differential privacy mechanism is employed to provide information-theoretical security. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed method not only achieves better communication performance in both data recovery and pragmatic task, but also more effectively degrades the accuracy of malicious receiver to infer sensitive information than global perturbation does.},

While previous researches have explored attacks on high-level radar perception, the vulnerability of low-level radar imaging to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce mmHide, the first general attack framework on mmWave radar imaging that utilizes neural rendering of meta-materials to hide imaging targets (e.g., handguns). mmHide’s novelty lies in its three-fold approach: 1) an implicit neural rendering network that efficiently represents and optimizes complex 3D meta-material structures, 2) an explicit differentiable forward imaging model that provides physical constraints, and 3) a self-supervised learning strategy that iteratively refines the meta-material design. This unique combination enables mmHide to create an “invisible cloak” for target objects while maintaining plausible imaging results. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate mmHide’s effectiveness in significantly reducing target visibility while preserving background similarity. A user study confirms its high success rate in deceiving human observers, outperforming existing methods. These findings not only showcase the potential of our approach but also underscore the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms in mmWave imaging systems.},

  abstract     = {Encrypted traffic classification plays a critical role in network security and management. Currently, mining deep patterns from side-channel contents and plaintext fields through neural networks is a major solution. However, existing methods have two major limitations: 1) They fail to recognize the critical link between transport layer mechanisms and applications, missing the opportunity to learn internal structure features for accurate traffic classification. 2) They assume network traffic in an unrealistically stable and singular environment, making it difficult to effectively classify real-world traffic under environment shifts. In this paper, we propose FG-SAT, the first end-to-end method for encrypted traffic analysis under environment shifts. We propose a key abstraction, the Flow Graph, to represent flow internal relationship structures and rich node attributes, which enables robust and generalized representation. Additionally, to address the problem of inconsistent data distribution under environment shifts, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to select robust node attributes. Finally, we design a classifier, GraphSAT, which integrates GraphSAGE and GAT to deeply learn Flow Graph features, enabling accurate encrypted traffic identification. FG-SAT exhibits both efficient and robust classification performance under environment shifts and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in encrypted attack detection and application classification.},

To address these challenges, we propose a Unified Multi-Domain Face Normalization Network (UMFN), which is designed to process facial images with diverse variations from various domains and reconstruct frontal, neutralized facial prototypes in the target domain. As an unsupervised domain adaptation model, the UMFN facilitates concurrent training across multiple cross-domain datasets and demonstrates robust prototype reconstruction capabilities. Notably, the UMFN functions as a joint prototype and feature learning framework, extracting domain-agnostic identity features through a decoupling mapping network and adversarial training with a feature domain classifier. Furthermore, we design an efficient Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR) network that integrates these domain-agnostic features and the identity-discriminative features extracted from normalized prototypes, enhanced by contrastive learning to improve identity recognition accuracy. Empirical evaluation on multiple cross-domain benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the UMFN for face normalization and the superiority of the HFR network for heterogeneous face recognition.},

This paper addresses the problem of robust blind face restoration (BFR) against adversarial attacks. BFR refers to recovering the HQ images from the LQ images, which suffer from diverse unknown degradation, such as noise, blur, artifact removal, low resolution, etc. Although existing BFR methods exhibit good performance, they experience significant degradation when subtle distortions and perturbations are introduced into the input images. This paper is the first to investigate, improve comprehensively, and evaluate BFR methods towards adversarial attacks. Project Gradient Descent (PGD) is employed to generate adversarial examples, and multiple types of attacks were used to thoroughly assess the robustness of various BFR methods across different objectives, regions, and levels. We evaluate the robustness of multiple BFR methods and analyze the advantages of their structures and modules towards adversarial attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that the method utilizing latent feature encoding and pre-trained discrete HQ codebook achieves better robustness than other methods, with the latter outperforming the former. Similarly, multi-scale semantic guidance information also exhibits superior performance in enhancing robustness. Therefore, we propose a powerful BFR method to mitigate this issue while maintaining better performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate our method’s state-of-the-art robustness in different scenarios.},

However, a key challenge for forgery detection is generalising to diffusion models not seen during training. In this paper, we address this problem by focusing on image noise. We observe that images from different diffusion models share similar noise patterns, distinct from genuine images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel Noise-Aware Self-Attention (NASA) module that focuses on noise regions to capture anomalous patterns. To implement a SOTA detection model, we incorporate NASA into Swin Transformer, forming an novel detection architecture NASA-Swin. Additionally, we employ a cross-modality fusion embedding to combine RGB and noise images, along with a channel mask strategy to enhance feature learning from both modalities.

Toward this end, we devise a novel semantic security communication system wherein the random shuffling pattern plays the role of the shared secret key. Intuitively, the permutation of feature sequences via shuffling would distort the semantic essence of the target data to a sufficient extent so that eavesdroppers cannot access it anymore. The proposed random shuffling method also exhibits its flexibility in working for the existing semantic communication system as a plugin.

These bugs, termed irreproducible kernel bugs, highlight the challenge of statefulness issue-related irreproducibility in kernel fuzzing, which is an open research without definitive solutions. Our investigation reveals that suboptimal seed quality distribution in fuzzing is the root obstacle preventing effective tracking of the states leading to crashes. Inspired by this insight, we introduce Reverse Fuzzing ( $\text{RF}$ ), an innovative approach that infers hard-to-reach states by continuously reverse-oriented deriving from subsequently encountered bridge states to increase reproduction probability. $\text{RF}$ differentiates between the “trigger” seed, which directly causes crashes, and “activator” seeds, which establish the necessary preconditions, prioritizing exploration around trigger while simultaneously regenerating and maintaining activators during fuzzing, which effectively facilitate restructuring such elusive states from “yesterday”. We implement $\text{YOME}$ , a prototype leveraging $\text{RF}$ to strike a balance between fuzzing efficiency and effectiveness through customized scheduling and mutation strategies, armed with a refinement mechanism to improve seed quality distribution. Our evaluations validate that $\text{YOME}$ reproduces 110% more bugs than previous kernel fuzzers and demonstrate its practicality in real-world scenarios. $\text{YOME}$ generated 125 PoCs (30.1% of the total) and uncovered 23 unique bugs, with 40 confirmed and 5 assigned CVEs.},

Offering robust evaluation services for unlearning is critical, not only to uphold privacy legislation but also to assess and improve existing unlearning methods. Lots of existing methods employ backdoor methods to evaluate unlearning effectiveness, which can only verify the unlearning effect of backdoored samples and negatively impact the model utility as they need to embed backdoors into the model first. In this paper, we propose an evaluating machine unlearning (EMU) method, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning and verify data removal without the aforementioned adverse effects. Machine unlearning inherently creates a difference on the model before and after unlearning. The model difference contains information about the unlearned samples, which can be extracted through reconstruction models for unlearning effectiveness evaluation. To efficiently generate the model differences as input for evaluation, we simulate the model changes based on the influence function theory. Additionally, we design a multi-task information bottleneck structure to enhance the scalability of EMU and simplify the analysis of different learning tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis of how the similarity between erased and remaining samples, as well as task types, affects the extent of unlearning—factors that have been largely overlooked. Extensive experiments on various model architectures and representative datasets confirm our analysis, demonstrating the effective evaluation for unlearning without any degradation in the service model utility.},

Hence, this paper proposes a diffusion model based secure sensing system (DFSS). Specifically, we first propose a discrete conditional diffusion model to generate graphs with nodes and edges, which guides the ISAC system to appropriately activate wireless links and nodes, ensuring the sensing performance while minimizing the operation cost. Using the activated links and nodes, DFSS then employs the continuous conditional diffusion model to generate safeguarding signals, which are next modulated onto the pilot at the transmitter to mask fluctuations caused by user activities. As such, only authorized ISAC devices with the safeguarding signals can extract the true CSI for sensing, while unauthorized devices are unable to perform the effective sensing. Experiment results demonstrate that DFSS can reduce the activity recognition accuracy of the unauthorized devices by approximately 70%, effectively shield the user from the illegitimate surveillance.},

Additionally, they struggle to capture domain-specific features of the target domain, reducing the effectiveness of steganalysis models in discriminating stego texts. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Adversarial unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CADA) method, which operates in two stages. In the first stage, Class-aware Adversarial Pre-Training (CAPT), we design the Weighted Class-Aware Domain Distance (WCADD) to leverage class information of stego and cover texts. This ensures accurate class-aware alignment across domains. In the CAPT stage, the steganalysis model is pre-trained with WCADD, Class-Aware Adversarial Training (CAAT), and Class-Aware Label Smoothing (CALS) to enhance its ability to extract domain-invariant features, thereby improving its generalization. In the second stage, Class-aware Fine-Tuning (CFT), we employ the pre-trained steganalysis model alongside the Class-Aware Progressive Strategy (CAPS) to generate pseudo-labels for the target domain. Fine-tuning the model with these pseudo-labels enhances its ability to recognize domain-specific features, thereby improving its performance in discriminating stego texts within the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Privacy in federated learning is crucial, encompassing two key aspects: safeguarding the privacy of clients’ data and maintaining the privacy of the federator’s objective from the clients. While the first aspect has been extensively studied, the second has received much less attention. We present a novel approach that addresses both concerns simultaneously, drawing inspiration from techniques in knowledge distillation and private information retrieval to provide strong information-theoretic privacy guarantees. Traditional private function computation methods could be used here; however, they are typically limited to linear or polynomial functions. To overcome these constraints, our approach unfolds in three stages. In stage 0, clients perform the necessary computations locally. In stage 1, these results are shared among the clients, and in stage 2, the federator retrieves its desired objective without compromising the privacy of the clients’ data. The crux of the method is a carefully designed protocol that combines secret-sharing-based multi-party computation and a graph-based private information retrieval scheme. We show that our method outperforms existing tools from the literature when properly adapted to this setting.},

  abstract     = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are widely used for speech censoring. Speech Adversarial Example (AE) offers a novel approach to protect speech privacy by forcing ASR to mistranscribe. However, existing speech AE faces two challenges in real-time voice communication scenarios, such as IP telephone, voice chat, or video conference, it cannot be generated in real-time, and its defensive capability is significantly reduced after the essential audio compression for network transmission. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Phoneme Filter Template (APFT) to address these issues. The key features of APFT include: 1) Phoneme-level Templates for universal AE generation in real-time, 2) Filter, which eliminates redundant signals to improve compression robustness. 3) Adaptive Band Filtering, which limits the attack area from the frequency band without affecting the attack effectiveness and improves speech quality. The comprehensive experimental results show that APFT has four advantages: 1) Real-time Generation, with AE generation time below 1.1ms for 1s speech; 2) Compression Robustness, achieving a WER of 0.64 under AAC and Opus codecs; 3) Transferability, with an average WER of 0.72 across datasets and ASR systems; 4) Stealthiness, achieving a MOS of 4.07 for high-quality speech. In addition, the experiment on Telegram voice calls further proves the practical applicability of APFT. The demo of APFT can be obtained in https://yihuan-qaq.github.io/APFT.github.io/},

  abstract     = {Worker recruitment for area coverage maximization, typically requires participants to upload location information, which can deter potential participation without proper protection. While existing studies resort to geo-indistinguishability to address this concern, they primarily focus on either specific task locations (Target Coverage) or operate under pre-defined recruitment quotas for an interested region (Area Coverage). These focuses not only yield suboptimal area coverage when scaled but also fail to leverage valuable prior knowledge in the form of participants’ noisy historical registered locations, to enhance both location obfuscation and worker identification processes. To address these limitations, we present WILTON, which optimizes area coverage under geo-indistinguishability by recruiting the minimum number of participants through the strategic utilization of noisy prior knowledge. In WILTON, to generate obfuscated locations, we propose a probabilistic and weight-aware input perturbation mechanism, which groups and weights prior locations rather than using only personal prior locations. To privately identify the recruited workers, we design a grid-based worker identification method, which provides a worst-case performance guarantee of ratio $1 - \frac {1}{e}$ to the optimum. We provide a theoretical analysis of the privacy, utility, and complexity guarantees of WILTON. Experimental results over two real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset show that WILTON surpasses the state-of-the-arts by at least 8% in area coverage improvement.},

Advances in IoV technologies also resulted in more complex and dynamic communication protocols/patterns, which are hard for the underlying wireless network to satisfy. Besides, security considerations of IoV communications require that key management must be stringently prohibit global failure mode of key management, meaning that, if a single IoV node compromises its private key, it will not lead to total security failure of the entire IoV network. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a heterogeneous parallel key-insulated multi-receiver signcryption scheme for IoV (HPKI-MRSC). Firstly, the proposed scheme can realize one-to-many heterogeneous transmission, in which RSUs are deployed on certificateless cryptography (CLC) system, while vehicles are allocated in identity-based cryptography (IBC) system. In this manner, we observe that message transmission efficiency is improved greatly. Secondly, the parallel key-insulated mechanism can employ two helper keys to update private key periodically, and then solve key disclosure problem. Finally, when the number of receiver n is greater than or equal to 3, the proposed scheme has a lower signcryption overhead than other comparative schemes, and thus it is more suitable for IoV.},

Besides, the attack traces also contain valuable information that can be used in the training process to assist model learning. In this paper, we propose a profiled SCA approach based on contrastive learning named CL-SCA to address these issues. This approach extracts features by emphasizing the similarities among traces, thereby improving the effectiveness of key recovery while maintaining the advantages of the original SCA approach. Through experiments of different datasets from different platforms, we demonstrate that CL-SCA significantly outperforms other approaches. Moreover, by incorporating attack traces into the training process using our approach, we can further enhance its performance. This extension can improve the effectiveness of key recovery, which is fully verified through experiments on different datasets.},

However, sharing datasets directly is typically prohibited under GDPR due to potential privacy breaches. Therefore, privacy-preserving joint clustering for vertically distributed datasets is highly desired. In this paper, we propose Privacy-Preserving Vertically Federated Clustering (PPVFC), a solution that not only achieves this goal but also significantly reduces computational and communication overhead for each data owner (DO). Unlike most previous works that achieve the goal with a single privacy-enhancing technology, PPVFC jointly leverages multiparty homomorphic encryption (MHE) and multiparty computation (MPC) to efficiently interleave communication-lightweight homomorphic computations on the local dataset with operations over collectively secret-shared intermediate data. Specifically, we design a coefficient-wise encoding for MHE to pack large datasets and minimize communication costs. Additionally, we develop a round-efficient bit extraction protocol for determining the minimum distance. Through extensive experiments and security analysis, we demonstrate the practical performance and robust security guarantees of PPVFC.},

To enable the CA-FAS to “know what it doesn’t know”, we propose to estimate its confidence during the prediction of each sample. Specifically, we build Gaussian distributions for both the live faces and the known attacks. The prediction confidence for each sample is subsequently assessed using the Mahalanobis distance between the sample and the Gaussians for the “known data”. We further introduce the Mahalanobis distance-based triplet mining to optimize the parameters of both the model and the constructed Gaussians as a whole. Extensive experiments show that the proposed CA-FAS can effectively recognize samples with low prediction confidence and thus achieve much more reliable performance than other FAS models by filtering out samples that are beyond its reliable range.},

  abstract     = {Research on electroencephalogram (EEG)-based person identification is increasing because EEG signals must be collected from the living body, making them difficult to steal or alter. However, EEG signals are greatly influenced by subjects’ states, and most studies on EEG-based person identification have overlooked this influence. In this study, we proposed an interpretable contrastive learning transformer to tackle the impact of state changes on EEG-based person identification. Contrastive learning transformers construct pairs of EEG signal feature samples to capture state-independent and identity-distinct features. Specifically, the power spectral density (PSD) of EEG signals from the same user in different paradigms is used as positive samples, while the PSD from other users is used as negative samples. Pairs of samples are encoded to obtain corresponding features and then projected into a contrastive space through a multi-layer perceptron. Then, the NT-Xent loss function minimizes the distance between positive samples within the same batch and maximizes the distance between negative samples. Finally, to eliminate bias between positive sample pairs from different paradigms, we introduced the cross-paradigm alignment loss for the first time to capture individual consistency. We evaluated our model on two datasets. Dataset 1 contains EEG signals from 109 individuals, recorded across multiple paradigms designed to elicit different states. Dataset 2 consists of EEG signals from 71 individuals, collected across two sessions, with each session including two paradigms. We evaluated the accuracy of both single-paradigm and cross-paradigm recognition. Our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models for EEG-based person identification. We also conducted experiments on electrode attention visualization to capture the brain regions that the model focuses on, and the results demonstrate that, unlike in a single-paradigm, models trained in cross-paradigm focus on fewer electrodes and more concentrated regions.},

The DTM provides a unique use of Gaussian distributions in modeling trust relationships within data, offering a novel way to balance recommendation accuracy with user privacy. This mechanism innovatively applies differential privacy principles, using Gaussian noise addition to protect individual user data from inference attacks, while maintaining the integrity and utility of the overall dataset. Unlike traditional anonymization techniques that often compromise data utility or vulnerability to reverse engineering, DTM provides a robust solution by dynamically adjusting privacy levels based on the trustworthiness of data requests. By combining DTM with existing mainstream recommendation algorithms, the prediction accuracy of MAE and RMSE increases by at least 6.60% and 2.69%, respectively. This dual benefit positions DTM as a significant advancement in secure data processing, especially relevant for online businesses and platforms where personalized recommendations are crucial yet privacy concerns are paramount.},

OCT captures volume data up to 3mm below the skin surface in the form of a series of B-scan images, enabling the reconstruction of internal fingerprints (IF) and internal sweat pores (ISP), thereby enhancing the security of biometric recognition. Despite the advantages, OCT images suffer from speckle noise and tissue discontinuity, making the extraction of subcutaneous biometric features challenging. Traditional hardware and software-based enhancement methods often result in over-smoothing and structural loss. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) offer promising alternatives, with supervised DL methods showing efficacy when trained with high-quality paired datasets. However, the absence of ground-truth (GT) data makes it impossible to apply these models. This study proposes a novel supervised enhancement method for fingertip OCT images, with a paired dataset generation strategy. An OCT few-shot GAN and a Quality Estimation Module are proposed and incorporated into the strategy to realize translation from minimal GT manual augmentation to high-quality paired dataset, effectively addressing the challenge of data scarcity.

  abstract     = {In multi-user adversarial scenarios involving external malicious jamming and internal co-channel interference, environmental instability and increased decision-making dimensions cause traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based anti-jamming schemes to suffer from insufficient exploration. Agents must choose policies from a large action set, leading to a significant decline in anti-jamming performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-agent discrete soft actor-critic (MA-DSAC) algorithm-based collaborative anti-jamming strategy, integrating frequency, power, and modulation-coding domains. This strategy first introduces a Markov game to model and analyze the multi-user anti-jamming problem. Next, the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is discretized to handle the multi-dimensional discrete action space. Finally, through information exchange between communication transceivers and based on a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, it is extended to a multi-agent DRL algorithm to achieve efficient multi-user cooperative anti-jamming. Simulation results show that in various anti-jamming scenarios with both fixed-mode and intelligent jammers, the proposed anti-jamming strategy’s performance improves by more than 25% compared to traditional value-based DRL strategies, including independent deep Q-network (I-DQN) and multi-agent virtual exploration in deep Q-learning (MA-VEDQL). Furthermore, through information exchange between communication transceivers, the instability problem of multi-agent DRL is effectively alleviated, enabling the communication transceivers to balance competition and cooperation. Consequently, its anti-jamming performance improves by more than 6% compared to the independent DSAC (I-DSAC) strategy.},

  abstract     = {We propose a joint covert beamforming design and jamming strategy to protect the communication process between Alice and Bob from being discovered by Willie with the help of another pair of neutral nodes. Specifically, with the help of irrelevant communication parties that commonly exist in practical communication scenarios, Jammer increases his transmission power by interfering with the neutral receiver, thus indirectly increasing the interference to Willie, which can be viewed as leveraging the force to make a big impact with a small effect. In our designed beamformer, we jointly optimize the beam power allocation factor, Alice’s transmission power, and Jammer’s transmission power when Alice transmits, to maximize the covert rate, which also maximizes Alice’s transmission power. In the perfect channel state information (CSI) scenario, the transformed optimization problem is solved via a one-dimensional search method and CVX solver. Due to the solution’s high complexity, we further propose a method to determine the optimal power allocation factor. For the imperfect Willie’s CSI scenario, three cases are investigated: Alice to Willie imperfect CSI, Transmitter to Willie imperfect CSI, and Jammer to Willie imperfect CSI. We utilize the S-procedure to tackle the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.},

  abstract     = {Decentralized identity (DID) is a transformative paradigm that leverages blockchain, decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials (VCs) to enable self-sovereign and decentralized identity management with myriad application areas. However, existing DID implementations are confronted with two key challenges: insufficient decentralization and vulnerability to mobile adversary attacks. First, they paradoxically introduce central identity resolvers, intermediaries or static committees to manage critical identity services, key management or credential issuance, which violates the decentralized controlling aim against a single point of failure. Second, these systems are vulnerable to mobile adversaries who can gradually compromise multiple nodes or committee members over a long period, eventually seizing control of the system. In this paper, we propose DP-DID, the first dynamic and proactive decentralized identity system specifically designed to resist mobile adversary attacks in dynamic committee settings. To eliminate centralized authorities, DP-DID leverages blockchain, dynamic committees and BLS (Named after Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham) signatures, which achieves decentralization. In addition, we design a dynamic and batch proactive secret sharing (DBPSS) scheme for DP-DID to ensure proactive security against mobile adversary attacks. This is achieved by allowing at most t (threshold) committees to be corrupted per period, with the set of corrupted committees changing dynamically even if all players are eventually compromised. By incorporating DBPSS, DP-DID achieves efficient key management for multiple users in dynamic settings, enhancing overall system scalability. Through rigorous analysis, DP-DID is proven to be forward secure and secure against mobile adversary attacks under a widely adopted malicious model. Extensive experiments show that DP-DID has efficient performance, and our DBPSS scheme outperforms FaB-DPSS by over $11.67\times $ in key handover efficiency.},

However, data-driven models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, even when deployed in highly secure control centers. Considering the similarity in the semantic features extracted by structurally diverse data-driven models when addressing the same downstream tasks, this paper proposes a transferable attention-distracting adversarial attack tailored for power systems. This attack first introduces an adversarial perturbation selection framework with physical constraints specific to power systems. It also offers different loss functions to distract attention and strategies to weaken the significance of features. Simulation experiments confirm that distracting the model’s attention results in more stable transferable attack effects and significantly reduces the performance of data-driven models across different task scenarios. The experimental results underscore the importance of not neglecting the security and robustness of models in security-critical scenarios like power systems, even while achieving optimal performance.},

  abstract     = {The XOR Arbiter PUF was introduced as a strong PUF in 2007 and was broken in 2015 by a Machine Learning (ML) attack, which allows the underlying Arbiter PUFs to be modeled individually by exploiting reliability information of the measured responses. To mitigate the reliability-based attacks, state-of-the-art understanding shows that the reliability of individual Arbiter PUFs and the overall XOR Arbiter PUF can be boosted to an arbitrarily high level, thus rendering all known reliability-based ML attacks infeasible; alternatively, an access control interface around the XOR Arbiter PUF can prevent the same challenge-response pairs from being accessed repeatedly, thus eliminating the leakage of reliability information. We show that, for the first time, a perfectly reliable XOR Arbiter PUF can be successfully attacked in a divide-and-conquer manner, meaning each underlying Arbiter PUF in an XOR Arbiter PUF can be attacked individually. This allows us to attack large XOR Arbiter PUFs efficiently, even without reliability information or any side-channel information. Our key insight is that, instead of reliability information, the responses of highly correlated challenges also reveal how close the responses are to the response decision boundary. This leads to a chosen challenge attack on XOR Arbiter PUFs by carefully choosing correlated challenges to measure and aggregate the collected information. We validate our attack by using PUF simulation, as well as an XOR Arbiter PUF implemented on FPGA. We also demonstrate that our chosen challenge methodology is compatible with the state-of-the-art combined gradient-based multi-objective optimization attack. Finally, we discuss an effective countermeasure that can prevent our attack but with a relatively large area overhead compared to the PUF itself.},

  abstract     = {Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) aims to measure physiological signals and Heart Rate (HR) from facial videos. Recent unsupervised rPPG estimation methods have shown promising potential in estimating rPPG signals from facial regions without relying on ground truth rPPG signals. However, these methods seem oblivious to interference existing in rPPG signals and still result in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a novel De-interfered and Descriptive rPPG Estimation Network (DD-rPPGNet) to eliminate the interference within rPPG features for learning genuine rPPG signals. First, we investigate the characteristics of local spatial-temporal similarities of interference and design a novel unsupervised model to estimate the interference. Next, we propose an unsupervised de-interfered method to learn genuine rPPG signals with two stages. In the first stage, we estimate the initial rPPG signals by contrastive learning from both the training data and their augmented counterparts. In the second stage, we use the estimated interference features to derive de-interfered rPPG features and encourage the rPPG signals to be distinct from the interference. In addition, we propose an effective descriptive rPPG feature learning by developing a strong 3D Learnable Descriptive Convolution (3DLDC) to capture the subtle chrominance changes for enhancing rPPG estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on five rPPG benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DD-rPPGNet outperforms previous unsupervised rPPG estimation methods and achieves competitive performances with state-of-the-art supervised rPPG methods.

However, the issue of biometric information leakage can still pose a serious threat to user privacy and anonymity. Currently, there is no cancelable biometric template generation scheme specifically designed for vein biometrics. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative cancelable vein biometric generation scheme: ColorVein. Unlike previous cancelable template generation schemes, ColorVein does not destroy the original biometric features and introduces additional color information to grayscale vein images. This method significantly enhances the information density of vein images by transforming static grayscale information into dynamically controllable color representations through interactive colorization. ColorVein allows users/administrators to define a controllable pseudo-random color space for grayscale vein images by editing the position, number, and color of hint points, thereby generating protected cancelable templates. Additionally, we propose a new secure center loss to optimize the training process of the protected feature extraction model, effectively increasing the feature distance between enrolled users and any potential impostors. Finally, we evaluate ColorVein’s performance on all types of vein biometrics, including recognition performance, unlinkability, irreversibility, and revocability, and conduct security and privacy analyses. ColorVein achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

Motivated by this, we show that subcarrier allocation plays a key role in enhancing the PKG performance in OFMDA networks. We prove that when a single user terminal selects a finite number of subcarriers for key generation, adopting uniformly spaced subcarriers is the optimal solution as it leads to higher secret key rates and better randomness. Moreover, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum secret key rate and introduce a low-complexity near-optimal algorithm that can achieve an appropriate subcarrier allocation policy in a timely manner. Simulation results show that our proposed near-optimal algorithm exhibits significant advantages in maximizing the sum secret key rate and improving key randomness compared with existing subcarrier allocation algorithms.},

  abstract     = {The constantly changing landscape of the Internet presents a significant challenge in the detection and tracking of covert attackers and their sophisticated methods. To address this issue, various techniques, such as network flow watermarking (NFW) and traffic correlation, embed attack labels in data streams to identify attack pathways or aid post-analysis. However, existing solutions are often tailored to specific scenarios, resulting in lacking robustness, adaptability, and anonymity under non-cooperative or incomplete information heterogeneous environments. To this end, this paper proposes CorreFlow, a Transfer Learning (TL) based invisible network flow correlation framework utilizing time channel graph fingerprinting modulation. It considers the fragmentation and reassembly of data packets during transmission. In stable network environments, CorreFlow utilizes TL for rapid correlation across flows, enabling efficient linkage of related traffic segments. In complex heterogeneous network, where traditional correlation methods may fail due to encryption and variability, it embeds watermarking information by regulating the Inter Packet Delay (IPD) in encrypted communication streams, realizing effective identification and tracking. Multiple experiments conducted on real network traffic and public datasets have demonstrated that CorreFlow achieves highly efficient traffic correlation with minimal false positive rate, improved adaptability, and steganography. Specifically, it has achieved over 97.31% accuracy in various network environments and promotes network traffic correlation in open heterogeneous network environments from low correlation to 95%.},

While some existing methods have shown promising results in forgery detection, they often underutilize facial semantic information. To address this issue, this paper introduces the Semantic Token Transformer for Face Forgery Detection. By incorporating facial semantic information with a transformer network, the input tokens of the transformer are transformed into tokens of varying shapes and sizes based on their importance, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the detector. To achieve this objective, we first employ an image processing stage to manipulate the image based on facial semantic information. Subsequently, we introduce a scoring network, guided by prior knowledge, which adaptively categorizes tokens into different clusters based on their importance and relevance to the results of the preprocessing stage. Finally, we merge the tokens within the clusters using an attention mechanism and input them into the detector for forgery detection. Through experiments conducted on multiple datasets and cross-dataset evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods.},

In particular, the challenge is derived from a mixed strategy obtained by solving a zero-sum game against the intruder, which in turn decides its own positions. In addition, we derive the optimal strategy for multi-round authentication, where the CR-PLA procedure is iterated over several rounds. We also consider the energy minimization problem, where legitimate users want to minimize the energy consumption without compromising the security performance of the protocol. The performance of the proposed scheme is tested in terms of both security and energy consumption through numerical simulations, considering different protocol parameters, different scenarios (urban and rural), different drone altitudes, and also in the context of drone swarms.},

  abstract     = {Ample profits of GPU cryptojacking attract hackers to recklessly invade victims’ devices, for completing specific cryptocurrency mining tasks. Such malicious invasion undoubtedly obstructs normal device usage and wastes computation resources. To resist the threat of GPU cryptojacking, existing works aim to timely detect and clear away it, by distinguishing the dissimilitude between it and legitimate applications. However, these detection mechanisms inappropriately rely on two conflict cornerstones, manifested in leveraging mutable samples of illegitimate cryptojacking to design supervision-based detection models requiring samples with stable patterns. This limitation compromises the practicability of existing detection mechanisms in the face of mutable cryptojacking samples. To fill the gap, we explore the superiority of unsupervised learning in handling this issue and further propose an unsupervised manner-enabled detection mechanism named MagInspector, only using legitimate applications’ magnetic signatures from GPU side channels for model construction. MagInspector innovates in training an unsupervised autoencoder network by an adversarial mode that well learns the stable signature patterns of legitimate applications, while incompatible with mutable cryptojacking ones. In the process of model training, we elaborately extract mutual energy cumulation distribution features to represent legitimate applications to overcome the impact of their inter-type differences. Meanwhile, a locality sensitive hashing-driven outlier removal algorithm is designed to enhance MagInspector’s robustness to the noise samples. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on GPUs covering four generations of common NVIDIA architectures and two generations of AMD architectures; the results show that applying MagInspector to mutable cryptojacking signature detection achieves a significant average accuracy improvement of 25.5% and 17.8%, respectively.},

This gap imposes significant yet unaddressed challenges in both security and efficiency, hindering the practical adoption of MPC systems. To address these challenges, we build upon the pseudorandom correlation generator (PCG) concept by Boyle et al.

Our core technique, termed verifiable silent preprocessing, enables virtually unbounded, on-demand generation of diverse correlated randomness with provable correctness while effectively reducing offline overhead in a correlation-agnostic manner. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we experimentally evaluate HPCG and compare it with other preprocessing techniques. We also show how HPCG can further optimize specialized secure computation tasks (e.g., shuffling and equality test) by promoting new, customized correlations, which may be of new interest.},

  abstract     = {The right to be forgotten has incentivized machine unlearning, but a key challenge persists: the lack of reliable methods to verify unlearning conducted by model providers. This gap facilitates dishonest model providers to deceive data contributors. Current approaches often rely on invasive methods like backdoor injection. However, it poses security concerns and is also inapplicable to legacy data—already released data. To tackle this challenge, this work initializes the first non-invasive unlearning verification framework which operates at triple-granularity (class-, volume-, sample-level) to assess the data facticity and volume integrity of machine unlearning. In this paper, we propose a framework, named TruVRF, encompasses three Unlearning-Metrics, each tailored to counter different types of dishonest model providers or servers (Neglecting Server, Lazy Server, Deceiving Server). TruVRF leverages non-invasive model sensitivity to enable multi-granularity verification of unlearning. Specifically, Unlearning-Metric-I checks if the removed class matches the data contributor’s unlearning request, Unlearning-Metric-II measures the amount of unlearned data, and Unlearning-Metric-III validates the correspondence of a specific unlearned sample with the requested deletion. We conducted extensive evaluations of TruVRF efficacy across three datasets, and notably, we also evaluated the effectiveness and computational overhead of TruVRF in real-world applications for the face recognition dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that TruVRF achieves robust verification performance: Unlearning-Metric-I and -III achieve over 90% verification accuracy on average against dishonest servers, while Unlearning-Metric-II maintains an inference deviation within 4.8% to 8.2%. Additionally, TruVRF demonstrates generalizability across diverse conditions, including varying numbers of unlearned classes and sample volumes. Significantly, TruVRF is applied to two state-of-the-art unlearning frameworks: SISA (presented at Oakland’21) and Amnesiac Unlearning, representing exact and approximate unlearning methods, respectively, which affirm TruVRF’s practicality. In addition, we conducted extensive evaluations around TruVRF, including ablation experiments, trade-offs in computational overhead, and the robustness of model sensitivity, among others.},

  abstract     = {Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is susceptible to various one-party hijacking attacks, such as Replay and Generation attacks, where a single malicious client can manipulate the model to produce attacker-specified results, thereby compromising its reliability in real-world deployments. In this paper, we first uncover the underlying mechanisms of these attacks and observe that successful attacks induce significant discrepancies in the embedding-label associations across different clients. We establish a theoretical framework demonstrating how these discrepancies can serve as reliable indicators for detecting hijacking attempts. Building upon this insight, we propose VFLMonitor, a robust defense mechanism that leverages these embedding-label discrepancies to detect and mitigate hijacking attacks. Specifically, VFLMonitor identifies suspicious queries by analyzing differences in label estimations from multiple clients and applies a majority voting rule to correct or filter out these malicious queries. Moreover, VFLMonitor introduces a novel regularization strategy during training to reduce intra-class variance in embeddings, thereby enhancing their discriminative power and improving defense effectiveness. Extensive experiments were conducted on 5 real-world datasets against 2 different attack types under 3 attack scenarios. The results demonstrate that VFLMonitor can effectively identify and exclude potential hijacked requests in all types of one-party hijacking attacks, while maintaining a meager false positive rate for legitimate queries.},

  abstract     = {Private Set Intersection (PSI) allows two parties, the sender and the receiver, each possessing a private set, to compute the intersection of their sets, with only the receiver learning the intersection and without revealing any additional information. Privacy-Preserving Feature Retrieval PSI ( $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ ) is a variant of PSI. In $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ , the receiver designs a predicate and obtains the intersection of private sets that satisfy this predicate, while the sender learns nothing about the predicate. However, the existing two $\textsf {PRFPSI}$ protocols ( $\textsf {TIFS 2024}$ ), based respectively on the DH key agreement and Oblivious Pseudo-Random Function (OPRF), are not highly efficient due to their reliance on expensive homomorphic encryption. Moreover, the existing DH-based $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ protocol reveals the output size and the original intersection size to the sender. We also observed that the existing $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ protocols do not support threshold retrieval and the logical connective $\textsf {OR}$ and can only work when feature values of the sender have very low dimensionality. This paper also proposes two new $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ protocols, one based on DH key agreement and the other based on OPRF, to fully address the issues present in existing $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ protocols. Our DH-based $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ is $30 \times $ faster than the existing DH-based protocol, with only a 36% increase in communication overhead. Furthermore, our OPRF-based $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ protocol is $2 \times $ as fast as existing OPRF-based protocol and reduces communication overhead by a factor of 4.6. Our DH-based $\mathsf {P^{2}FRPSI}$ protocol completely eliminates the leakage of the original intersection size and the output size. Meanwhile, our protocols support the logical connective $\textsf {OR}$ for linking sub-predicates and also enable threshold-based retrieval. They are proven to be secure in the semi-honest model. Our open-source implementations can be found at https://github.com/ShallMate/pfrpsi, which can help readers understand our protocols and reproduce the experiments.},

TPH-UOKM supports password update. The cloud server can update all protected data of a user with an update token to be accessible only with the new password, which resists password leakage. We present a two-level proactivization mechanism to periodically update user-specific secret key shares and the key servers to thwart perpetual compromise of them, where the renewal of user-specific secret key shares reduces computation and communication costs compared to existing approaches.

  abstract     = {With the rapid evolution of Web3.0, cryptocurrency has become a cornerstone of decentralized finance. While these digital assets enable efficient and borderless financial transactions, their pseudonymous nature has also attracted malicious activities such as money laundering, fraud, and other financial crimes. Effective detection of malicious accounts is crucial to maintaining the security and integrity of the Web 3.0 ecosystem. Existing malicious account detection methods rely on large amounts of labeled data and suffer from low generalization. Label-efficient and generalizable malicious account detection remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ShadowEyes, a framework for detecting malicious accounts by leveraging interaction feature learning with only a small labeled dataset. Specifically, We first propose a generalized account representation named TxGraph, which captures the universal interaction features of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Then we carefully design an account representation augmentation method tailored to simulate the evolution of malicious accounts to generate positive pairs. We conduct extensive experiments using public datasets to evaluate the performance of ShadowEyes. The results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in four typical scenarios. Specifically, in the scenario of across-platform malicious account detection, ShadowEyes maintains an F1 score of around 90%, which is 10% higher than the SOTA method. In the zero-shot learning scenario, it can achieve an F1 score of 79.56% for detecting gambling accounts, surpassing the SOTA method by 10.44%.},

  abstract     = {The Model Inversion Attack (MIA) aims to reconstruct the privacy data used to train the target model, raising significant public concerns about the privacy of machine learning models. Therefore, proposing effective methods to defend against MIA has become crucial. The relationship between MIA and defense is a typical adversarial process. If the upper bound of the attacker’s capability can be estimated through theoretical analysis, a more robust defense method can be achieved by weakening this upper bound. To achieve this goal, we simplify MIA to a problem of reconstructing estimates, and analyze the lower bound of the reconstruction error obtained by the attacker, from which we infer the theoretical upper bound of the attacker’s capability, providing a foundation for designing the defense mechanism. We find that the lower bound of reconstruction error is inversely proportional to the Fisher information. This means that smaller Fisher information can lead to a larger reconstruction error. If the attacker cannot obtain second-order information during the reconstruction estimation, the corresponding Fisher information will be reduced. Consequently, we propose a defense against model inversion attacks via feature purification (DMIAFP). To reduce the Fisher information, DMIAFP hides the private data contained within the features and its second-order information (the relationships between private data) by minimizing the first-order and second-order correlations between private data and output features. Additionally, we introduce Principal Inertia Components (PIC) for the correlation metric, and infer the theoretical upper bound of the attacker’s reconstruction ability through PIC, thereby avoiding the issue of poor defensive performance caused by data-driven instability in defense methods that train by adversarially inverse models. Experimental results show that our method achieves good performance in defense and exhibits significant advantages in removing redundant information contained in features.},

  abstract     = {Despite the end-to-end encryption capabilities provided by network protocols such as QUIC in HTTP/3 and the additional tunneling functions offered by proxy tools like virtual private networks (VPNs) and the onion router (Tor), website fingerprinting (WF) techniques can still identify specific network services by exploiting the spatio-temporal characteristics of network traffic. Therefore, defending against WF attacks is crucial for ensuring comprehensive privacy protection for network services. Existing WF defenses typically rely on proxy-based solutions that require coordinated packet manipulations between the client and the proxy node to counteract WF attacks. These symmetric architectures cannot protect network traffic between proxy nodes and web servers from WF attacks. Furthermore, the ability to counter more powerful traffic analysis tools remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose WF-A2D, an asymmetric adversarial defense method against website fingerprinting for HTTP/3. WF-A2D employs a two-stage cascading adversarial learning strategy, leveraging packet direction and length patterns to enhance defense performance. Position-based perturbation vectors representing packet operations are generated for packet-by-packet manipulations to achieve real-time WF defense. Experimental results on a real-world HTTP/3-QUIC website browsing traffic dataset demonstrate that WF-A2D can achieve a defense success rate of 97.10% on average against seven state-of-the-art traffic analysis tools, while incurring less than 2% bandwidth overhead. More importantly, WF-A2D can operate independently on the client side and ensure end-to-end protection to web servers.},

Although the anonymity is preferred by users, it poses challenges for authorities seeking to regulate financial activities. Researchers are actively engaged in studying methods to de-anonymize Monero. Previous methods usually relied on a specific type of ring called zero-mixin ring. However, these methods have become ineffective after Monero enforced the minimum ringsize. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on maximum weighted matching to de-anonymize Monero. The proposed approach does not rely on the existence of zero-mixin rings. Specifically, we construct a weighted bipartite graph to represent the relationship between rings and transaction outputs. Based on the empirical probability distribution derived from users’ spending patterns, three weighting methods are proposed. Accordingly, we transform the de-anonymization problem into a maximum weight matching (MWM) problem. Due to the scale of the graph, traditional algorithms for solving the MWM problem are not applicable. Instead, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that achieves near-optimal results. Experimental results on both real-world dataset and synthetic dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

By transmitting signals across different frequency bands in a loop-back fashion, the proposed scheme mitigates the adverse effects of HI variations across frequency bands and enhances system security. Theoretical analyses are conducted on the normalized mean square error and the secret key rate of the loop-back mechanism in both FDD and time division duplex (TDD) systems, providing a clear security assessment of the proposed scheme. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that by accounting for HI differences in the frequency domain, the proposed scheme improves channel reciprocity, enhances the secret key rate, achieves a higher key generation rate (KGR), and reduces the key disagreement ratio (KDR) compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

Although increasing attention has been paid to communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), the vulnerability of the communication mechanism in CMARL has not been well investigated, especially when there exist malicious agents that send adversarial communication messages to other regular agents. Existing works about adversarial communication in CMARL focus on black-box attacks where the attacker cannot access any model within the multi-agent system (MAS). However, grey-box attacks are a type of more practical attack, where the attacker has access to the models of its controlled agents. To the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted to investigate grey-box attacks on communication in CMARL. In this paper, we propose the first grey-box attack method on communication in CMARL, which is called victim-simulation based adversarial attack (VSAA). At each timestep, the attacker simulates a victim attacked by other regular agents’ communication messages and generates adversarial perturbations on its received communication messages. The attacker then sends the aggregation of these perturbations to the regular agents through communication messages, which will induce non-optimal actions of the regular agents and subsequently degrade the performance of the MAS. Experimental results on multiple tasks show that VSAA can effectively degrade the performance of the MAS. The findings in this paper will make researchers aware of the grey-box attack in CMARL.},

However, implementing such an architecture requires addressing the challenges associated with ES response data reliability and communication security.

The scheme utilizes a threshold mechanism to sign the data broadcast by the ES, incorporates blockchain to trace malicious signers, and avoids the shortcomings and limitations associated with idealized assumptions for the ES in existing data-sharing schemes. Moreover, considering the communication security and high-speed mobility of vehicles, using the non-interactive signatures of knowledge based on the $\Sigma $ -protocol, a secure and efficient message authentication scheme for vehicles and ESs is provided. Through rigorous security proofs and comprehensive analyses, our scheme satisfies the communication security requirements of vehicular networks. By leveraging the JPBC library for performance analysis, the proposed scheme demonstrates advantages as concerns both computation and communication overheads compared to related schemes.

  abstract     = {Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations.

  abstract     = {Diffusion models pose risks of privacy breaches and copyright disputes, primarily stemming from the potential utilization of unauthorized data during the training phase. Membership inference is aimed to determine whether a specific sample has been used in the training process of a target model, representing a critical tool for privacy violation verification. However, the increased model complexity and stochasticity inherent in diffusion renders traditional shadow-model-based or metric-based methods ineffective when applied to diffusion models. Moreover, existing methods only yield binary classification labels which lack necessary comprehensibility in practical applications. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective for membership inference by leveraging the intrinsic generative priors within the diffusion model. Compared with unseen samples, training samples exhibit stronger generative priors within the diffusion model, enabling the successful reconstruction of substantially degraded training images. Consequently, we propose the Degrade Restore Compare (DRC) framework. In this framework, an image undergoes sequential degradation and restoration, and its membership is determined by comparing it with the restored counterpart. Experimental results verify that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy but also provides comprehensible decision criteria, offering evidence for potential privacy violations.},

The formulated problem is not convex in terms of these two types of coupled variables, which cannot be directly solved. To address this problem, the Lagrange dual method and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions are presented to transform its sum-of-logarithmic objective function into the logarithmically fractional counterpart, which reformulate the original problem into that with respect to RIS phase shift vectors and WPT time scheduling. Next, we propose to apply the Dinkelback algorithm to solve a non-linear fractional programming with respect to the downlink WPT and uplink AJ-WIT RIS phase shifts in an alternating fashion, each of which is derived into a semi-closed solution by utilizing the Riemannian Manifold Optimization (RMO). In addition, the optimal WPT time scheduling is obtained by numerical search. Finally, the numerical results are demonstrated to confirm the improved performance of the proposed approach compared to the benchmark counterparts, which highlights the that RIS can effectively enhance the uplink anti-jamming WIT capability as well as the downlink WPT efficiency.},

The increasing flexibility of biometric recognition systems, which can match multiple template modalities, also escalates the security risks of tampering and misuse. To address these challenges, we propose the FSB-HashNet architecture, which integrates two key components: a periocular-face feature extractor and an adversarial hash generator. The feature extractor identifies and emphasizes shared prominent features between periocular and face modalities, creating modality-invariant representations. Meanwhile, the adversarial network simultaneously generates secure hash codes and ensures alignment across different modalities, preserving modality-invariant characteristics. The FSB-HashNet employs a two-factor protection mechanism using a subject’s biometric data and a user-specific key, resulting in robust, protected hash codes that offer image-level security without compromising recognition performance. Our comprehensive experiments on diverse, in-the-wild datasets under open-set conditions demonstrate the framework’s ability to maintain key security properties—unlinkability, revocability, and non-invertibility while preserving decent recognition accuracy.

  abstract     = {This paper aims to enhance the transferability of adversarial samples in targeted attacks, where attack success rates remain comparatively low. To achieve this objective, we propose two distinct techniques for improving the targeted transferability from the loss and feature aspects. First, in previous approaches, logit calibrations used in targeted attacks primarily focus on the logit margin between the targeted class and the untargeted classes among samples, neglecting the standard deviation of the logit. In contrast, we introduce a new normalized logit calibration method that jointly considers the logit margin and the standard deviation of logits. This approach effectively calibrates the logits, enhancing the targeted transferability. Second, previous studies have demonstrated that mixing the features of clean samples during optimization can significantly increase transferability. Building upon this, we further investigate a truncated feature mixing method to reduce the impact of the source training model, resulting in additional improvements. The truncated feature is determined by removing the Rank-1 feature associated with the largest singular value decomposed from the high-level convolutional layers of the clean sample. Extensive experiments conducted on the ImageNet-Compatible, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate the individual and mutual benefits of our proposed two components, which outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in black-box targeted attacks.},

With the rapid development of deep learning technology, the definition of distortion has evolved from manual design to deep learning design. Concurrently, rapid advancements in image generation have made generated images viable as cover media. However, existing distortion design methods based on machine learning do not fully leverage the advantages of generated cover media, resulting in suboptimal security performance. To address this issue, we propose GIFDL (Generated Image Fluctuation Distortion Learning), a steganographic distortion learning method based on the fluctuations in generated images. Inspired by the idea of natural steganography, we take a series of highly similar fluctuation images as the input to the steganographic distortion generator and introduce a new GAN training strategy to disguise stego images as fluctuation images. Experimental results demonstrate that GIFDL, compared with state-of-the-art GAN-based distortion learning methods, exhibits superior resistance to steganalysis, increasing the detection error rates by an average of 3.30% across three steganalysis.},

Although existing STE-based encrypted database systems achieve high efficiency in query processing, all these schemes struggle to support rich queries with minimal information leakage. In this paper, we present a new STE-based encrypted database system, named Filter-integrated Encrypted Database (FinEDB), which supports exact-match and range queries, conjunctive queries and join operations, while maintaining limited information leakage. We first design a novel secure inverted index to avoid storage overhead blow-up when extending to support rich query capabilities. Then, we integrate Binary Fuse filters into our proposed inverted index to enable efficient query processing. By leveraging the homomorphic property of Binary Fuse filters, our approach leaks less information than existing STE-based solutions. Besides, we provide rigorous proof for our proposed scheme under the simulation paradigm. To evaluate the performance, we implement the prototype of FinEDB and compare it with the baseline STE-based scheme. Experiment results demonstrate that FinEDB is practical and can support rich queries on real-world databases.},

In particular, when the inputs to the controller become too small or too large, actuators may burn out due to unstable system state oscillations. To solve this dilemma, we design and implement FHECAP, an FHE-based controller framework that can homomorphically apply non-linear functions to the actuators to rectify the system inputs. In FHECAP, we first design a novel data encoding scheme tailored for efficient gain matrix evaluation. Then, we propose a high-precision homomorphic algorithm to apply non-arithmetic piecewise function to realize the actuator normalization. In the experiments, compared with the existing state-of-the-art encrypted controllers, FHECAP achieves $4\times $ – $1000\times $ reduction in computational latency. We evaluate the effectiveness of FHECAP in the real-world application of encrypted control for spacecraft rendezvous.

Most existing gradient inversion attacks, however, require control over the central server and rely on substantial prior knowledge, including information about batch normalization and data distribution. In this study, we introduce Poisoning Gradient Leakage from Client (PGLC), a novel attack method that operates from the clients’ side. For the first time, we demonstrate the feasibility of a client-side adversary with limited knowledge successfully recovering training samples from the aggregated global model. Our approach enables the adversary to employ a malicious model that increases the loss of a specific targeted class of interest. When honest clients employ the poisoned global model, the gradients of samples become distinct in the aggregated update. This allows the adversary to effectively reconstruct private inputs from other clients using the aggregated update. Furthermore, our PGLC attack exhibits stealthiness against Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs). Through the optimization of malicious updates and the blending of benign updates with a malicious replacement vector, our method remains undetected by these defense mechanisms. We conducted experiments across various benchmark datasets, considering representative Byzantine-robust AGRs and exploring different FL settings with varying levels of adversary knowledge about the data. Our results consistently demonstrate the ability of PGLC to extract training data in all tested scenarios.},

A critical challenge in DP-SGD is selecting the optimal clipping threshold C, which involves balancing the trade-off between clipping bias and noise magnitude, incurring substantial privacy and computing overhead during hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Clipping DP-SGD (DC-SGD), a framework that leverages differentially private histograms to estimate gradient norm distributions and dynamically adjust the clipping threshold C. Our framework includes two novel mechanisms: DC-SGD-P and DC-SGD-E. DC-SGD-P adjusts the clipping threshold based on a percentile of gradient norms, while DC-SGD-E minimizes the expected squared error of gradients to optimize C. These dynamic adjustments significantly reduce the burden of hyperparameter tuning C. The extensive experiments on various deep learning tasks, including image classification and natural language processing, show that our proposed dynamic algorithms achieve up to 9 times acceleration on hyperparameter tuning than DP-SGD. And DC-SGD-E can achieve an accuracy improvement of 10.62% on CIFAR10 than DP-SGD under the same privacy budget of hyperparameter tuning. We conduct rigorous theoretical privacy and convergence analyses, showing that our methods seamlessly integrate with the Adam optimizer. Our results highlight the robust performance and efficiency of DC-SGD, offering a practical solution for differentially private deep learning with reduced computational overhead and enhanced privacy guarantees.},

Specifically, SoFi has three major technical innovations: (1) it is the first to utilize adversarial examples to automatically perturb fingerprinting techniques; (2) it complies with constraints and integrity of network packets; (3) it achieves a high success rate in spoofing OS fingerprints. We validate the effectiveness of adversarial packets against active and passive OS fingerprints, verifying the transferability and robustness of SoFi. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SoFi automatically identifies applicable and available OS fingerprint features, unlike existing tools relying on expert knowledge.},

  abstract     = {Model inversion (MI) attacks, for which effective defense strategies are still lacking, pose significant risks to privacy by reconstructing private training data through access to well-trained classifiers. Addressing this concern, this study introduces TrapNet, designed to defend against advanced MI attacks while maintaining good model utility. TrapNet intentionally injects trapdoors into the classification manifold of the protected target model. In this way, TrapNet can effectively mislead MI attack optimization. Specifically, TrapNet leverages a conditional GAN (cGAN) trained on the private dataset to generate diverse and realistic trapdoor samples. In addition, we propose a graph-matching self-obfuscation strategy and an entropy regularization technique to optimize trapdoor injection while preserving model utility. Compared to the existing defense, TrapNet can provide universal protection to all target classes without access to any auxiliary public data. Extensive experiments on CelebA, VGG-Face, and VGG-Face2 datasets demonstrate TrapNet’s superior performance over existing defenses, including the most advanced NetGuard and BiDO, against state-of-the-art model inversion attacks, i.e., PLG-MI, LOMMA, and Plug&Play.},

  abstract     = {Precise uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) detection over long distances is of crucial importance for guaranteeing the airspace security. Although deep learning-based vision detectors have been developed, they still rely on a large amount of hand-crafted fixed feature priors. The existing static dense-based detectors suffer from the severe mismatch and imbalance between the small size and the high mobility of UAVs. To solve the problem, a novel multimodal fusion-based dynamic sparse UAV detection framework is proposed. The framework reformulates the feature priors in a completely dynamic sparse paradigm by using the radar data. Based on the framework, a vision-radar fusion-based dynamic sparse network (Vira-DSNet) is proposed for more balanced and robust UAV detection. The Vira-DSNet exploits our designed dynamic sparse candidate generator and radar-guided semantic feature transform to generate a small set of customized high-quality object candidates and semantic features based on the radar data. Moreover, based on Hungarian bisection matching, our Vira-DSNet eliminates the post-processing and is completely end-to-end differentiable. Furthermore, the Vira-DSNet is deployed in our developed actual vision-radar fusion-based UAV detection system to evaluate the performance in the practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our Vira-DSNet achieves an average precision $\rm {AP_{50}}$ of 88.2%. It is also shown that the average recall $\rm {AR_{1}}$ of Vira-DSNet is higher than the state-of-the-art scheme by 10.1%, while maintaining the real-time performance.},

  abstract     = {One-Time Passwords (OTPs) play a crucial role in Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) by adding an additional layer of security. OTPs effectively reduce the risk of static passwords being intercepted and reused. Nevertheless, both academic schemes and industrial solutions face security threats stemming from server/device compromises and OTP factor forgery. Chain-based asymmetric OTP schemes are a promising approach to addressing the problem of server compromise but still face threats from device compromise and pre-generated chain leakage. We emphasize that since devices directly store the OTP seed, OTP authentication is essentially equivalent to verifying device possession. This means that in existing OTP schemes, OTP forgery and device compromise remain prevalent and difficult to overcome. In this work, we propose a brand new scheme to address OTP factor forgery and server/device compromises. For the first time, our scheme constructs a tightly coupled architecture between the password factor and the OTP factor. The OTP seed is derived from a password and a device-stored salt, preventing OTP seed extraction and OTP forgery even in the event of a device compromise. Through the integration of “honeywords” with the tightly coupled OTP architecture, the server stores decoy OTP seeds generated by decoy passwords, providing resistance against server compromises and partial password guessing from devices. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our OTP schemes. The computational overhead is correlated with the number of honeywords, and with the recommended set size of 20, the total verification overhead is approximately $0.24~ms$ . Additionally, we propose formal security properties and application metrics, and rigorously prove our scheme’s resistance against server/device compromise attacks and guessing attacks. Our scheme is the first to achieve comprehensive OTP security with low overhead.},

Image provenance analysis is crucial in this context, as it identifies relevant images within a database and constructs a relationship graph by mining hidden manipulation and transformation cues, thereby providing concrete evidence chains. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end deep learning framework designed to explore the structural information of provenance graphs. Our proposed method distinguishes from previous approaches in two main ways. First, unlike earlier methods that rely on prior knowledge and have limited generalizability, our framework relies upon a patch attention mechanism to capture image provenance clues for local manipulations and global transformations, thereby enhancing graph construction performance. Second, while previous methods primarily focus on identifying tampering traces only between image pairs, they often overlook the hidden information embedded in the topology of the provenance graph. Our approach aligns the model training objectives with the final graph construction task, incorporating the overall structural information of the graph into the training process. We integrate graph structure information with the attention mechanism, enabling precise determination of the direction of transformation. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over previous approaches, underscoring its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of image provenance analysis.},

However, it also carries the danger of exposing private information. Deep hash models are easily influenced by adversarial examples, which can be leveraged to protect private images from malicious retrieval. The existing adversarial example methods against deep hash models focus on universality and transferability, lacking the research on its robustness in online social networks (OSNs), which leads to their failure in anti-retrieval after post-processing. Therefore, we provide the first in-depth discussion on robustness in universal transferable anti-facial retrieval and propose Three-in-One Adversarial Perturbation (TOAP). Specifically, we construct a local and global Compression Generator (CG) to simulate complex post-processing scenarios, which can be used to mitigate perturbation. Then, we propose robust optimization objectives based on the discovery of the variation patterns of model’s distribution after post-processing, and generate adversarial examples using these objectives and meta-learning. Finally, we iteratively optimize perturbation by alternately generating adversarial examples and fine-tuning the CG, balancing the performance of perturbation while enhancing CG’s ability to mitigate them. Numerous experiments demonstrate that, in addition to its advantages in universality and transferability, TOAP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in multiple robustness metrics. It further improves universality and transferability by 5% to 28%, and achieves up to about 33% significant improvement in several simulated post-processing scenarios as well as mainstream OSNs, demonstrating that TOAP can effectively protect private images from malicious retrieval in real-world scenarios.},

First, we analyze the shortcomings of current methodologies through both system modeling and evaluation metrics. Then, we introduce a Learning-based Trajectory Reconstruction Attack (LTRA) to expose the weaknesses, achieving up to 91.2% reconstruction accuracy against the state-of-the-art protection method. Further, based on w-event differential privacy, we propose an $\ell $ -trajectory differentially private mechanism, i.e., OffloadingBD. Compared to the existing works, OffloadingBD provides more flexible and enhanced protection with sound privacy theoretical guarantee. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LTRA and OffloadingBD. The experiment results show that LTRA has good generalization ability and OffloadingBD showcases a superior balance between privacy and utility compared with baselines.},

However, the observation of microdata involvement in various analysis tasks within the data center can indirectly lead to privacy breaches. For instance, when the data center observes microdata involved in a disease-related task, it may reveal information about the corresponding user’s disease. Existing schemes process the entire dataset for each analysis task to prevent privacy breaches, resulting in significant redundancy overhead due to the large amount of task-irrelevant data involved in processing. In this paper, we propose FDC, which can protect privacy and effectively reduce the redundancy overhead. It frees the data center from huge redundancy overhead. Specifically, we propose a co-design of local differential privacy and multiparty computation with preprocessing by the data owner. This design enables the data center to process only task-relevant and LDP noise-induced microdata instead of the entire dataset while maintaining analysis results without accuracy loss. In some scenarios where preprocessing by the data owner is unfeasible, we present a data center-assisted method to complete preprocessing within the data center. Additionally, we design and optimize a secure shuffle protocol within this method. Finally, we implement and evaluate FDC using the aggregation task as a baseline. With different proportions of task-relevant microdata, experimental results show that the runtime of FDC is $2\sim 11$ x faster than existing schemes on LAN and $2\sim 22$ x on WAN, and the communication overhead is up to $3\sim 153$ x lower.},

However, in noisy environments, noise can distort invariant features, leading to different environment-specific losses. Current IRM-related methods such as IRMv1 and VREx underperform in these settings because they enforce uniform losses across environments. While environmental noise causes environment-specific losses, it does not alter the fundamental correlation between invariant representations and labels. Based on this observation, we propose ICorr (Invariant Correlation), which leverages this correlation to extract invariant representations in noisy settings. Unlike existing approaches, ICorr accommodates different environment-specific inherent losses while maintaining a necessary condition for identifying IRM classifiers. We present a detailed case study demonstrating why previous methods may lose ground while ICorr can succeed. Through a theoretical lens, particularly from a causality perspective, we illustrate that the invariant correlation of representation with label is a necessary condition for the optimal invariant predictor in noisy environments, where as the optimization motivations for other methods may not be. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of ICorr by comparing it with other domain generalization methods on various noisy datasets.},

Consequently, many packed malware samples evade detection. To bridge this gap, we propose $\textsf {Gupacker}$ , a novel generalized unpacking framework. $\textsf {Gupacker}$ offers a generic solution for first-generation holistic packer by customizing the Android system source code.

On this basis, we counteract a diverse array of anti-analysis techniques. We conduct extensive experiments on 5K packed Android malware samples, comparing $\textsf {Gupacker}$ with 2 commercial and 4 state-of-the-art academic unpacking tools. The results demonstrate that $\textsf {Gupacker}$ significantly improves the efficiency of Android malware unpacking with acceptable system overhead.

The need to train a dedicated model for each endpoint causes serious scalability problems in VCNs. 3) Current anomaly detection models have difficulty addressing the complex temporal dependency and non-stationarity of VCNs. To address these challenges, we propose a new multilevel feature model MFM and a new unsupervised time-series anomaly detection model GTGmVAE. By combining the basic features with the topology features specifically designed for VCNs, MFM effectively characterizes the patterns of VCNs. GTGmVAE combines the new local-global feature extractor with the latent space following a Gaussian mixture distribution to achieve the strong adaptability to learn multiple normal patterns simultaneously, and achieves the strong temporal modeling capability to effectively address the complex temporal dependency and non-stationarity of VCNs by adequately modeling the global temporal dependencies of the input samples and latent variables. Extensive experiments on the VCN anomaly detection dataset CIC-IDS2018 and the time-series anomaly detection benchmark dataset SMD show that GTGmVAE with MFM achieves the desirable performance, and GTGmVAE outperforms all nine representative state-of-the-art detection models.},

First, a hierarchical cross-modal image generation model is designed to achieve the pixel alignment of different modalities and reconstruct the image information of missing modality. Specifically, a cross-modal texture transfer network is utilized to implement the texture style transformation between different modalities, and then a cross-modal structure generation network is proposed to establish the correlation mapping of structural information between different modalities. Second, multimodal dynamic sparse feature fusion model is presented to obtain more discriminative and reliable representations, which can also enhance the robustness of our proposed model to dynamic changes in image quality of different modalities.

  abstract     = {Existing occluded person re-identification (re-ID) methods mainly learn limited visual information for occluded pedestrians from images. However, textual information, which can describe various human appearance attributes, is rarely fully utilized in the task. To address this issue, we propose a Text-guided Hierarchical Context Blending Network (THCB-Net) for occluded person re-ID. Specifically, at the data level, informative multi-modal inputs are first generated to make full use of the auxiliary role of textual information and make image data have a strong inductive bias for occluded environments. At the feature expression level, we design a novel Hierarchical Context Blending (HCB) module that can adaptively integrate shallow appearance features obtained by CNNs and multi-scale semantic features from visual transformer encoder. At the model optimization level, a Multi-modal Feature Interaction (MFI) module is proposed to learn the multi-modal information of pedestrians from texts and images, then guide the visual transformer encoder and HCB module to further learn discriminative identity information for occluded pedestrians through Image-Multimodal Contrastive (IMC) learning. Extensive experiments on standard occluded person re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed THCB-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available soon.},

  abstract     = {Secure Aggregation (SA), in the Federated Learning (FL) setting, enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model while keeping their raw data and local gradients private. However, when SA is implemented in edge-intelligence-driven FL, the open and heterogeneous environments will hinder model aggregation, slow down model convergence speed, and decrease model generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a Robust and adaptive Secure Aggregation (RaSA) protocol to guarantee robustness and privacy in the presence of non-IID data, heterogeneous system, and malicious edge servers. Specifically, we first design an adaptive weights updating strategy to address the non-IID data issue by considering the impact of both gradient similarity and gradient diversity on the model aggregation. Meanwhile, we enhance privacy protection by preventing privacy leakage from both gradients and aggregation weights. Different from previous work, we address system heterogeneity in the case of malicious attacks, and the malicious behavior from edge servers can be detected by the proposed verifiable approach. Moreover, we eliminate the influence of straggling communication links and dropouts on the model convergence by combining efficient product-coded computing with repetition-based secret sharing. Finally, we perform a theoretical analysis that proves the security of RaSA. Extensive experimental results show that RaSA can ensure model convergence without affecting the generalization ability under non-IID scenarios. Moreover, the decoding efficiency of RaSA achieves $1.33\times $ and $6.4\times $ faster than the state-of-the-art product-coded and one-dimensional coded computing schemes.},

With data exchanges, sellers and buyers can trade data in an efficient and convenient way. However, existing EADT systems are vulnerable to privacy violations. Sensitive information about the data owned by sellers (manifested as attributes of the data) and the purchasing requirements of buyers (manifested as interests) are highly susceptible to leakage. On the one hand, buyers and sellers have direct access to the type of data supplied or desired before the data transaction is established. On the other hand, the information about transactions between the seller and buyer is transparent to the exchange, including the content of the transaction contract. In addition, the participants are likely to repudiate the content of previously accepted contracts or trigger a bidding war by contract first authorized by others, which raises threats towards authenticity and fairness. In this paper, we investigate the contract agreement in actual EADT systems, enumerate the inherent requirements of secrecy and fairness, and formally define them. Then we propose a privacy-preserving and fair contract agreement framework, dubbed PFCA, which consists of order-matching, negotiation, and authorization. We further propose a practical instantiation of PFCA, dubbed BestPFCA, utilizing efficient private set intersection (PSI), secure messaging (SM), and three-party signature (TPS). In addition, we also implement a BestPFCA prototype and conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation, which demonstrates the efficiency and practicality of BestPFCA.},

  abstract     = {Wireless network security is a significant issue in wireless communication systems. Specific emitter identification (SEI) technology, as an effective physical layer authentication method, has been extensively studied. Methods based on deep learning (DL) for SEI have emerged as the predominant approach, attributed to their end-to-end recognition framework and enhanced capability for feature extraction. However, the training of DL models relies on high-quality data, and the data collection in real-world scenarios is often in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, leading to poor model training performance. This paper presents a novel solution, the Multi-Granularity Deep Signal Shrinkage Network (MGDSSN), for the challenging task of SEI in low SNR environments. To this end, the proposed MGDSSN incorporates soft thresholding processing and employs subnetworks for adaptive thresholding, effectively eliminating noise-related features and achieving robust SEI in low SNR environments. Additionally, MGDSSN incorporates a multi-granularity deep signal network architecture that improves the recognition accuracy and stability of the model. This is achieved by capturing the interrelated attributes of in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) signals and features at multiple levels of granularity. Experiments conducted with real-world dataset reveal that the proposed MGDSSN surpasses the current state-of-the-art SEI methods in low SNR environments, demonstrating robust SEI and verifying the superiority of the proposed method.},

Depending on the approach to key management, prevailing biometric template protection strategies can be categorized into declarative and distributive methods. The former are challenged by complexities and vulnerabilities linked to key loss, while the latter are compromised by fixed mapping rules that may expose personal information. We present a biometric template protection method that combines random-fixed factors to handle these challenges, thereby protecting the user’s biometric privacy. Firstly, we introduce a random activation factor generation module that extracts scaling and offset factors from the user’s biometric data. This module randomly binds factors to different positions in each authentication process, rendering distance-dependent bitwise cracking algorithms ineffective. Secondly, we propose a fixed multi-branch mapping module that enhances feature expression and minimizes information loss post-encryption. We also develop a trainable min-max hash method, optimized using an improved approximate contrastive loss. Employing palm veins as a case study, we conducted experiments across five datasets, where our method outperformed other encrypted domain methods and showed competitive advantages over mainstream non-encrypted methods. Moreover, we have demonstrated that our method ensures robust performance while meeting essential security requirements of irreversibility, unlinkability, and revocability.},

Existing malicious encrypted traffic detection methods rely on large amounts of labeled samples for training, limiting their ability to quickly respond to new attacks. These methods also are vulnerable to traffic obfuscation strategies, such as injecting dummy packets. In this paper, we propose SmartDetector, a robust malicious encrypted traffic detection method via contrastive learning. We first propose a novel traffic representation named Semantic Attribute Matrix (SAM), which can effectively distinguish between malicious and benign traffic. We also design a data augmentation method to generate diverse traffic samples, which makes the detection model more robust against different traffic obfuscation strategies. We propose a malicious encrypted traffic classifier that first pre-trains a model via contrastive learning to learn deep representations from unlabeled data, then fine-tunes the model with a supervised classifier to achieve accurate detection even with only a few labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments with five public datasets to evaluate the performance of SmartDetector. The results demonstrate that it outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in three typical scenarios. Specifically, in the evasion attack detection scenario, SmartDetector achieves an F1 score and AUC above 93%, with average improvements of 19.84% and 18.17% over the SOTA method, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Digital audio watermarking is a critical technology widely used for copyright protection, content authentication, and broadcast monitoring. However, its robustness is significantly challenged by recapturing and hybrid attacks, which can easily remove watermarks. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel scheme based on the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), named LRAW (LightGBM-based Robust Audio Watermarking), which is designed to increase the robustness of audio watermarking against various attacks. Specifically, the scheme begins by analysing coefficients derived from the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), graph-based transform (GBT), and singular value decomposition (SVD). The extracted singular values consistently maintain a stable descending order even under recapturing attacks at a slightly greater distance. Leveraging this stability, the watermark information is implicitly embedded into the audio signal using a quantization rule. To simulate a hybrid attack scenario, a comprehensive feature dataset comprising 396,000 pieces of DWT-GBT-SVD feature data is constructed based on 60 original recordings and 9 types of attack. Furthermore, considering the distinct influences of embedding watermark bits 0 and 1 on the quantization of singular values, the watermark extraction process is formulated as a binary classification problem. LightGBM is trained using Bayesian optimization and the feature dataset to classify the watermark bits accurately. Finally, the complete watermark is recovered using a watermark sequence matching algorithm. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LRAW scheme outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking methods in robustness against various recapturing and hybrid attacks, even when the distance between the acoustic source and the receiver is considerable.},

These platforms cater to servers (sellers), enabling them to set prices for access to their data, and clients (buyers), who can subsequently purchase these data, thereby streamlining and facilitating such transactions. However, the current data market is primarily confronted with the following issues. Firstly, they fail to protect client privacy, presupposing that clients submit their queries in plaintext. Secondly, these models are susceptible to being impacted by malicious client behavior, for example, enabling clients to potentially engage in arbitrage activities. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose payable secure computation, a novel secure computation paradigm specifically designed for data pricing scenarios. It grants the server the ability to securely procure essential pricing information while protecting the privacy of client queries. Additionally, it fortifies the server’s privacy against potential malicious client activities. As specific applications, we have devised customized payable protocols for two distinct secure computation scenarios: Keyword Private Information Retrieval (KPIR) and Private Set Intersection (PSI). We implement our two payable protocols and compare them with the state-of-the-art related protocols that do not support pricing as a baseline. Since our payable protocols are more powerful in the data pricing setting, the experiment results show that they do not introduce much overhead over the baseline protocols. Our payable KPIR achieves the same online cost as baseline, while the setup is about $1.3-1.6\times $ slower than it. Our payable PSI needs about $2\times $ more communication cost than that of baseline protocol, while the runtime is $1.5-3.2\times $ slower than it depending on the network setting.},

In response, approaches such as Federated Learning (FL) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) have been proposed and attracted much attention over the past few years. However, they still share the common limitation of being vulnerable to poisoning attacks wherein adversaries compromising edge devices feed forged (a.k.a. “poisoned”) data to aggregation back-ends, undermining the integrity of FL/LDP results. In this work, we propose a system-level approach to remedy this issue based on a novel security notion of Proofs of Stateful Execution ( $\mathsf {PoSX}$ ) for IoT/embedded devices’ software. To realize the $\mathsf {PoSX}$ concept, we design $\mathsf {SLAPP}$ : a System-Level Approach for Poisoning Prevention. $\mathsf {SLAPP}$ leverages commodity security features of embedded devices – in particular ARM TrustZone-M security extensions – to verifiably bind raw sensed data to their correct usage as part of FL/LDP edge device routines. As a consequence, it offers robust security guarantees against poisoning. Our evaluation, based on real-world prototypes featuring multiple cryptographic primitives and data collection schemes, showcases $\mathsf {SLAPP}$ ’s security and low overhead.},

Its design rationale is to leverage the model update contributions of all data points, including ones outside of the source and target classes, to construct an Amplifier set, in which we falsify the data labels before the FL training process, as a means to boost attacks.

Compared with attack rule matching, machine learning approaches offer new perspectives for efficiently detecting attacks by leveraging their inherent ability to autonomously learn from data and adapt to dynamic environments. However, the scarcity of APT samples poses a significant limitation, rendering supervised learning methods that have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in other domains (e.g., malware detection) impractical. Therefore, we propose a system called TAGAPT, which is able to automatically generate numerous APT samples with provenance-level granularity. First, we introduce a deep graph generation model to generalize various graph structures that represent new attack patterns. Second, we propose an attack stage division algorithm to divide each generated graph structure into stage subgraphs. Finally, we design a genetic algorithm to find the optimal attack technique explanation for each subgraph and obtain fully instantiated APT samples. Experimental results demonstrate that TAGAPT can learn from existing attack patterns and generalize to novel attack patterns. Furthermore, the generated APT samples 1) exhibit the ability to help with efficient threat hunting and 2) provide additional assistance to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack detection system (Kairos) by filtering out 73% of the observed false positives. We have open-sourced the code and the generated samples to support the development of the security community.},

  abstract     = {Current state-of-the-art plug-and-play countermeasures for mitigating adversarial examples (i.e., purification and detection) exhibit several fatal limitations, impeding their deployment in safety-critical real-world applications. These limitations include susceptibility to adaptive attacks, adverse impact on benign samples, high time consumption for conducting a complete defense cycle, etc. To bridge the gap, developing more advanced plug-and-play countermeasures is urgently needed to safeguard these applications. Specifically, this paper first proposes a novel method named Gaussian-augmented GAN-based Adversarial Purification (GA-GAP). Unlike previous methods, GA-GAP enhances the density of the training data in low-robustness regions by using random Gaussian noise. Moreover, GA-GAP incorporates a pre-trained deep learning classifier into the training architecture and integrates its classification loss into the training loss function. Then, following the development of GA-GAP, this paper innovatively proposes a dual-function defense framework named Adversarial Detection on Purification (ADoP) to mitigate adversarial examples further. In ADoP, purification and detection complement each other, achieving the effect of $\mathbf {1+1\gt 2}$ , which can more efficiently avoid adaptive attacks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that ADoP outperforms other countermeasures in multiple aspects. These aspects include superior generalization capability in purifying and detecting various adversarial examples, less adverse impact on benign samples, and practical time consumption for conducting a complete defense cycle.},

Firstly, to realize the information security in communication, the original signals are encrypted by fractional order dynamics from the sender, and decrypted by receiver to achieve synchronization. For the process, a hybrid order dynamic optimization is constructed, where the fractional order and the integer order systems are modeled as constraints. Secondly, a transformation formula is developed to convert these constraints into new integer order dynamics, and the equivalence between two dynamic optimizations is obtained. Thirdly, to obtain the synchronization solution, a new iterative learning algorithm is designed, and the adaptive dynamic programming is successfully embedded into the solving process.

First, we construct a practical attack model using the NSL-KDD dataset to provide a realistic representation of DoS attack dynamics, capturing key attributes such as attack duration and frequency. Then, an iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) is introduced to supervise the adaptive sampled-data controller (ADSC), dynamically optimizing the sampling period to enhance control performance while minimizing communication overhead. To further mitigate the impact of DoS attacks, we propose a novel data compression mechanism that adapts to varying network conditions, ensuring efficient bandwidth utilization and preserving critical control data fidelity. In addition, the stability of the NCSs is rigorously verified through Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKFs), demonstrating robust system behavior even under adverse network conditions. Finally, the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach are validated through experimental studies on a 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) helicopter system, confirming its capability to ensure stability, optimize communication efficiency, and mitigate the effects of DoS attacks in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Outsourcing is an essential strategy for enterprises, and leveraging it can offer advantages such as saving costs, improving efficiency, and allowing them to concentrate on their primary business activities. Therefore, announcing and managing service requests is paramount for obtaining suitable quotes and partnering with the right outsourcing service providers. To achieve this, enterprises can employ digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and security of these service requests. However, the irrevocable nature of traditional digital signatures poses challenges, particularly when canceling the service requests is necessary. A withdrawable signature scheme provides a novel property for signers to initially create “withdrawable” signatures, which they can later confirm into additional conventional signatures. Withdrawable signatures can be regarded as withdrawn when the signer has not confirmed them yet. This property provided by the withdrawable signature mechanism can then be adopted as a solution to this problem, allowing the enterprise to retract announced signatures on service requests. However, to meet the demands in the outsourcing system, existing approaches on withdrawable signatures require further development since they only allow signers in outsourcing systems to confirm withdrawable signatures on service requests. This limitation prevents enterprises from accepting quotes for service requests simply by confirming the withdrawable signature. This paper focuses on this problem by applying the withdrawable signature to the outsourcing framework, identifying the limitations of existing withdrawable signature schemes, and proposing solutions. We demonstrate how revisiting of withdrawable signatures can lead to flexible outsourcing systems that ensure the cancellation of announced service requests. Additionally, we provide a performance evaluation demonstrating that our revised withdrawable signature scheme achieves acceptable efficiency and security within the outsourcing system.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning under heterogeneous models, as an innovative approach, aims to break through the constraints of vanilla federated learning on the consistency of model architectures to better accommodate the heterogeneity of data distributions and hardware resource constraints in mobile computing scenarios. While significant attention has been given to backdoor risks in federated learning, the impact on heterogeneous models remains insufficiently investigated, where devices contribute models with varying structures. The reduction in the number of benign local model neurons that the adversary can manipulate through the global model reduces the attack surface. To challenge this issue, we propose a white-box multi-target backdoor attack method, CapsuleBD, against heterogeneous federated learning. Specifically, we design a model decoupling method to separate the benign and malicious task training pipelines through weight reassignment. The model responsible for the benign tasks is structurally larger than the malicious one, resembling a capsule encapsulating harmful substance impacting multiple heterogeneous models. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CapsuleBD in seamlessly embedding triggers into heterogeneous local models, sustaining a remarkable 99.5% average attack success rate against all benign users even with a 50% reduction in the attack space.},

This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an intrusion response use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.},

  abstract     = {Privacy preservation are becoming increasingly significant in machine learning, with recent privacy regulations requiring the deletion of personal data and its impact on models. Although erasing data from storage is simple, removing the influence of data on models remains a challenge. Federated unlearning is an emerging paradigm that aims to forget the knowledge contributed by some specific data to the federated model. In this paper, we design a novel federated unlearning strategy, named FedWiper, which enables exact unlearning in federated learning by erasing specific data and its impact from the federated model. Specifically, based on the granularity of the dataset, we propose training multiple federated submodels to construct a federated unlearning framework, thereby narrowing the scope of the impact of wiped data. Furthermore, the proposed Uni-Adapter structure effectively mitigates the negative impact on model performance from diminishing the dataset scale, while also reducing communication cost. Rather than focusing solely on achieving indistinguishability unlearning of the model for classification task, we extend FedWiper to unlearning for multiple types of tasks and achieve the exact unlearning. Experiments demonstrate that FedWiper can not only accelerate federated unlearning, but also achieve exact unlearning across multiple types of tasks in federated learning while ensuring minimal loss of model performance.

  abstract     = {Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) utilize signature and anomaly-based methods to detect malicious activities within networks. Advances in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have enabled NIDS to analyze large volumes of data and identify complex patterns. However, traditional ML/DL approaches in NIDS have primarily relied on flow-based features and utilized flat data formats, such as vectors or grids, which limit their ability to recognize the structural and contextual nuances of network attacks, particularly in real-time. Additionally, most NIDS depend on supervised or semi-supervised learning, requiring extensive labeled data that is time-consuming to generate and not always feasible. This reliance restricts their ability to detect novel attacks, as they typically only recognize threats similar to those encountered during training. Hence, there is a significant need to develop NIDS that can operate in near real-time, eliminate the need for labeled data, and effectively identify novel attack patterns. We propose GTAE-IDS, a novel unsupervised packet-based graph neural network framework aimed at early and precise anomaly detection in network traffic. GTAE-IDS employs graph embeddings to capture and process network traffic data swiftly, creating sequential packet-based graphs that reflect network communications. Our approach employs graph autoencoders to identify structural and global patterns in benign data without needing labeled graph data, enhancing detection capabilities against novel attacks. Incorporating transformers in the encoder segment, GTAE-IDS effectively discerns contextual patterns in network traffic, achieving over 98% accuracy in identifying malicious activities on benchmark network intrusion data sets.},

It is commonly recognized that SOA holds under linear leakages. In this paper, we revisit SOA from a non-profiling attack perspective. Specifically, we conduct statistical analyses on three non-profiling distinguishers, including Pearson Coefficient Distinguisher (PCD), Spearman Coefficient Distinguisher (SCD) and Kruskal-Wallis Distinguisher (KWD). We find a fundamental connection between SCD and KWD such that SCD is a more generic distinguisher which encompasses KWD. Theoretical explanations for why KWD outperforms SCD under non-linear leakages are provided. We also propose a new adjusted SCD and present its optimal form, which bridges the efficiency gap with KWD. Grounded on this, SOA is extensively assessed and the observations are two-fold. On the one hand, we confirm again the effectiveness of SOA under Hamming weight leakage through the statistical analysis of PCD. On the other hand, we show that SOA can not resist rank-based distinguishers even under linear leakages, which has never been revealed before (to the best of our knowledge). At last, we verify the theoretical findings through both simulated and real-world measurements. Our results demonstrate the advantage of rank-based distinguishers in uncovering non-linear relationships hidden in leakage, enriching the tool-set for non-profiling class of side-channel attacks. Remarkably, we provide an adversary perspective to investigate SOA, highlighting that the side-channel resistance promised by SOA is vulnerable even considering the ideal linear leakage models.},

The modalities include not only traditional offline and online data, but also videos capturing hand movements.

We provide extensive experiments for the consistency between online and offline signatures, as well as between online signatures and movement videos.

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the development of embodied intelligence. By providing a few contextual demonstrations (such as rationales and solution examples) developers can utilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate complex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets, which will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents. However, this paper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and introduces a novel method called Contextual Backdoor Attack. By poisoning just a few contextual demonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of a closed-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent defects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can activate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters specific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM’s contextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize poisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts, reporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in a two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable context-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality activation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program defects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack by developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional visual reasoning. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential impact of our approach by successfully attacking real-world autonomous driving systems. The contextual backdoor threat introduced in this study poses serious risks for millions of downstream embodied agents, given that most publicly available LLMs are third-party-provided. This paper aims to raise awareness of this critical threat. Our code and demos are available at https://contextual-backdoor.github.io/.},

State-of-the-art methods for unlearning use historical data from FL clients, such as gradients or locally trained models. However, studies have revealed significant information leakage in this setting, with the possibility of reconstructing a user’s local data from their uploaded information. Addressing this, we propose Starfish, a privacy-preserving federated unlearning scheme using Two-Party Computation (2PC) techniques and shared historical client data between two non-colluding servers. Starfish builds upon existing FU methods to ensure privacy in unlearning processes. To enhance the efficiency of privacy-preserving FU evaluations, we suggest 2PC-friendly alternatives for certain FU algorithm operations. We also implement strategies to reduce costs associated with 2PC operations and lessen cumulative approximation errors. Moreover, we establish a theoretical bound for the difference between the unlearned global model via Starfish and a global model retrained from scratch for certified client removal. Our theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that Starfish achieves effective unlearning with reasonable efficiency, maintaining privacy and security in FL systems.},

  abstract     = {Aiming to provide people with great convenience and comfort, smart home systems have been deployed in thousands of homes. In this paper, we focus on handling the security and privacy issues in such a promising system by customizing a new cryptographic primitive to provide the following security guarantees: 1) fine-grained, privacy-preserving authorization for smart home users and integrity protection of communication contents; 2) flexible self-sovereign permission delegation; 3) forward security of previous messages. To our knowledge, no previous system has been designed to consider these three security and privacy requirements simultaneously. To tackle these challenges, we put forward the first-ever efficient cryptographic primitive called the Forward-secure Hierarchical Delegable Signature (FS-HDS) scheme for smart homes. Specifically, we first propose a new primitive, efficient Hierarchical Delegable Signature (HDS) scheme, which is capable of supporting partial delegation capability while realizing privacy-preserving authorization and integrity guarantee. Then, we present an FS-HDS for smart homes with the efficient HDS as the underlying building block, which not only inherits all the desirable features of HDS but also ensures that the past content integrity is not affected even if the current secret key is compromised. We provide comprehensively strict security proofs to prove the security of our proposed solutions. Its performance is also validated via experimental simulations to showcase its practicability and effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Image generation technology has brought significant advancements across various fields but has also raised concerns about data misuse and potential rights infringements, particularly with respect to creating visual artworks. Current methods aimed at safeguarding artworks often employ adversarial attacks. However, these methods face challenges such as poor transferability, high computational costs, and the introduction of noticeable noise, which compromises the aesthetic quality of the original artwork. To address these limitations, we propose a Structurally Imperceptible and Transferable Adversarial (SITA) attacks. SITA leverages a CLIP-based destylization loss, which decouples and disrupts the robust style representation of the image. This disruption hinders style extraction during stylized image generation, thereby impairing the overall stylization process. Importantly, SITA eliminates the need for a surrogate diffusion model, leading to significantly reduced computational overhead. The method’s robust style feature disruption ensures high transferability across diverse models. Moreover, SITA introduces perturbations by embedding noise within the imperceptible structural details of the image. This approach effectively protects against style extraction without compromising the visual quality of the artwork. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SITA offers superior protection for artworks against unauthorized use in stylized generation. It significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability, computational efficiency, and noise imperceptibility. Code is available at https://github.com/A-raniy-day/SITA.},

A POR scheme with public verifiability further enhances usability by allowing users to delegate the auditing task to a third party, making it highly desirable for a wide range of applications. However, most existing publicly verifiable POR schemes derive their security from the computational hardness of discrete logarithm or factoring, making them vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although it is possible to construct quantum-resistant POR schemes with public verifiability upon hash trees or general lattices, the resulting schemes often exhibit performance limitations when compared to existing constructions, thereby limiting their deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we address this gap by constructing a publicly verifiable POR scheme on structured lattices. We show that our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model under the Ring-LWE and Ring-SIS assumptions. We provide an implementation of our scheme and the experimental results show that its performance is comparable to certain well-known constructions based on traditional assumptions.},

However, while the vulnerabilities of fixed-scale SR have been assessed, the robustness of continuous representation-based arbitrary-scale SR against adversarial attacks remains an area warranting further exploration. The elaborately designed adversarial attacks for fixed-scale SR are scale-dependent, which will cause time-consuming and memory-consuming problems when applied to arbitrary-scale SR. To address this concern, we propose a simple yet effective “scale-invariant” SR adversarial attack method with good transferability, termed SIAGT. Specifically, we propose to construct resource-saving attacks by exploiting finite discrete points of continuous representation. In addition, we formulate a coordinate-dependent loss to enhance the cross-model transferability of the attack. The attack can significantly deteriorate the SR images while introducing imperceptible distortion to the targeted low-resolution (LR) images. Experiments carried out on three popular LIIF-based SR approaches and four classical SR datasets show remarkable attack performance and transferability of SIAGT.},

To conduct a membership inference attack on a target model, an adversary has to train a set of shadow models and conduct a statistical test to determine the membership status of the particular input object. Usually, shadow models are trained without taking into account the target model; we argue that utilizing the predictions of the target model can guide the training process of the shadow model. To improve the efficiency of shadow model-based membership inference attacks, we propose GLiRA, a knowledge distillation-guided approach to membership inference attacks. We observe that the knowledge distillation significantly improves the efficiency of a likelihood ratio membership inference attack when the architecture of the target model is both known and unknown to an attacker. We evaluate the proposed method across multiple image classification datasets and model architectures and demonstrate that knowledge distillation-guided likelihood ratio attack outperforms the current state-of-the-art membership inference attacks in the majority of experimental settings.},

  abstract     = {As a new paradigm of distributed learning, Federated Learning (FL) has been applied in industrial fields, such as intelligent retail, finance and autonomous driving. However, several schemes that aim to attack robust aggregation rules and reducing the model accuracy have been proposed recently. These schemes do not maintain the sign statistics of gradients unchanged during attacks. Therefore, the sign statistics-based scheme SignGuard can resist most existing attacks. To defeat SignGuard and most existing cosine or distance-based aggregation schemes, we propose an enhanced model poisoning attack, ScaleSign. Specifically, ScaleSign uses a scaling attack and a sign modification component to obtain malicious gradients with higher cosine similarity and modify the sign statistics of malicious gradients, respectively. In addition, these two components have the least impact on the magnitudes of gradients. Then, we propose MSGuard, a Multi-Strategy Byzantine-robust scheme based on cosine mechanisms, symbol statistics, and spectral methods. Formal analysis proves that malicious gradients generated by ScaleSign have a closer cosine similarity than honest gradients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ScaleSign can attack most of the existing Byzantine-robust rules, especially achieving a success rate of up to 98.23% for attacks on SignGuard. MSGuard can defend against most existing attacks including ScaleSign. Specifically, in the face of ScaleSign attack, the accuracy of MSGuard improves by up to 41.78% compared to SignGuard.},

Current effort is mainly devoted to the investigation of detecting and mitigating DLAAs, while, for a holistic cyber-resiliency-enhancement process, the last but not least cyber recovery from DLAAs (CRDA) has not been paid enough attention yet. Considering the interconnection among electricity, transportation, and cyber networks, this paper presents the first exploration of the CRDA, where two essential sub-tasks are formulated: i) Optimal design of repair crew routes to remove installed malware and ii) Robust adjustment of system operation to eliminate the mitigation costs with stability guarantee. Towards this end, linear stability constraints are established by utilising a sensitivity-based eigenvalue estimation method, where the eigenvalue sensitivity information is appropriately ordered and strategically selected to guarantee the estimation accuracy. Moreover, to assure the CRDA solution’s robustness to the adversary’s follow-up movement, the worst-case attack strategies in all attack scenarios during the recovery process are integrated. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem is subsequently developed for the CRDA with the primary objective to restore the secure but cost-inefficient mitigation operation mode to the cost-efficient one and secondarily to repair compromised IoT home appliances. Case studies are performed in IEEE power system cases to validate the eigenvalue estimation’s accuracy, the CRDA solution’s effectiveness and robustness, as well as the proposed CRDA’s extensibility.},

It has several valuable applications, for instance, wireless sensor networks. Identity-based chameleon hash (IB-CH), as an alternative building block to construct OO-IBS, has been explored in numerous literatures. Nevertheless, there still exist two major issues. 1) Nearly all of the previous IB-CH schemes with weak collision-resistance (W-CollRes) are with random oracles, which may lead to security risks in practicality. The only IB-CH scheme in the standard model suffers from the large size of public parameters and inefficient setup process. 2) The only IB-CH scheme without key exposure also relies on random oracles. In this paper, we propose two novel IB-CH schemes in the standard model. The first scheme is adaptive identity, W-CollRes secure and efficient, significantly reducing the computation costs of all algorithms and the size of public parameters compared with the existing scheme in the standard model. The second scheme is the first IB-CH achieving key exposure freeness without random oracles. Both theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the good performance of our proposed schemes. Furthermore, we apply our schemes to optimizing the existing generic OO-IBS construction. The optimized generic constructions reduce computational overhead by 50.0% in the online phase and enable the hash value/signature tuple generated in the offline phase to be reusable, respectively.},

In this trend, providing Private Sample Alignment (PSA) among multi-clients becomes naturally necessary for preventing unauthorized sample access and client privacy exposure. However, exiting PSA protocols mainly focus on two-party scenarios and cannot be directly adapted to the multi-client delegated computing scenarios required for vertical federated learning. Besides, these studies fail to address the need for protocol robustness in practical federated Learning network environments. Therefore, we aim to design an efficient and reliable PSA protocol in multi-client vertical federated learning. In this work, we present the first practical PSA protocol for vertical federated learning, allowing multi-clients to efficiently identify common samples without revealing additional information. Toward this direction, our PSA protocol first explores the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem to create a lightweight delegated Private Set Intersection (PSI) scheme, enabling efficient sample intersection among multiple clients. To achieve the reliability of the PSA protocol, we devise a multi-client vector aggregation algorithm that securely delegates the server to calculate the sample intersection. Building on this foundation, we develop an efficient Threshold-based Private Sample Alignment (T-PSA) protocol that allows multiple clients to determine the intersection of their input samples only if the intersection size surpasses a specific threshold. We implement a prototype and conduct a thorough security analysis. Comprehensive evaluation results confirm the efficiency and practicality of our design.},

In this paper, we present an initial attempt to provide a multi-speaker anonymization benchmark by defining the task and evaluation protocol, proposing benchmarking solutions, and discussing the privacy leakage of overlapping conversations. The proposed benchmark solutions are based on a cascaded system that integrates spectral-clustering-based speaker diarization and disentanglement-based speaker anonymization using a selection-based anonymizer. To improve utility, the benchmark solutions are further enhanced by two conversation-level speaker vector anonymization methods. The first method minimizes the differential similarity across speaker pairs in the original and anonymized conversations, which maintains original speaker relationships in the anonymized version. The other minimizes the aggregated similarity across anonymized speakers, which achieves better differentiation between speakers. Experiments conducted on both non-overlap simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-speaker anonymization system with the proposed speaker anonymizers. Additionally, we analyzed overlapping speech regarding privacy leakage and provided potential solutions (Code and audio samples are available at https://github.com/xiaoxiaomiao323/MSA), evaluation datasets can be download from https://zenodo.org/records/14249171},

  abstract     = {With the increasing popularity of autonomous driving systems (ADS) in autonomous vehicles (AV), in recent years, there have been many attacks targeting AVs and ADSs. Meanwhile, recent studies have attempted to improve the safety and security of AVs from different perspectives, and they mainly focus on the spoofing attacks against the sensors and the injection attacks against the vehicle chassis and actuators. However, direct attacks on ADSs (i.e., communication hijacking and malicious codes) remain inadequately addressed, and even worse, such attacks can cause AVs to make unsafe driving decisions rapidly. In this paper, we introduce DSAD, a driving state-aware anomaly detection framework designed to enhance AV safety and security by identifying ADS attacks, such as communication hijacking and malicious codes, through chassis states. First, DSAD models ADS operations (i.e., driving states) as a two-layer state machine, utilizing real-time chassis data to infer driving states and detect anomalies in ADS outputs. This reduces false positives and negatives by aligning detection with the diverse operational modes of AVs. To achieve this, we develop a prototype system, DSAD, incorporating a Detection Policy Update mechanism that dynamically adjusts detection policies based on the vehicle’s driving states, such as lane changing and obstacle avoidance. Second, DSAD considers both collision avoidance and control stability, addressing potential conflicts through hard and soft requirements. Furthermore, DSAD integrates a fault handling module compatible with existing autonomous driving fault handling mechanisms, ensuring timely response to detected anomalies. We develop a prototype anomaly detection system called DSAD and deploy it on four ADSs. We evaluate DSAD using various attack scenarios, and the results show that DSAD can identify over 90% of attacks on ADSs.},

  abstract     = {Adversarial training has achieved remarkable advancements in defending against adversarial attacks. Among them, fast adversarial training (FAT) is gaining attention for its ability to achieve competitive robustness with fewer computing resources. Existing FAT methods typically employ a uniform strategy that optimizes all training data equally without considering the influence of different examples, which leads to an imbalanced optimization. However, this imbalance remains unexplored in the field of FAT. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of the imbalance issue in FAT and observe an obvious class disparity regarding their performances. This disparity could be embodied from a perspective of alignment between clean and robust accuracy. Based on the analysis, we mainly attribute the observed misalignment and disparity to the imbalanced optimization in FAT, which motivates us to optimize different training data adaptively to enhance robustness. Specifically, we take disparity and misalignment into consideration. First, we introduce self-knowledge guided regularization, which assigns differentiated regularization weights to each class based on its training state, alleviating class disparity. Additionally, we propose self-knowledge guided label relaxation, which adjusts label relaxation according to the training accuracy, alleviating the misalignment and improving robustness. By combining these methods, we formulate the Self-Knowledge Guided FAT (SKG-FAT), leveraging naturally generated knowledge during training to enhance the adversarial robustness without compromising training efficiency. Extensive experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate that the SKG-FAT improves the robustness and preserves competitive clean accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. Code and checkpoints are available at SFG-FAT Code Implementation.},

  abstract     = {Is it secure to measure the reliability of local models by similarity in federated learning (FL)? This paper delves into an unexplored security threat concerning applying similarity metrics, such as the $L_{2}$ norm, Euclidean distance, and cosine similarity, in protecting FL. We first uncover the deficiencies of similarity metrics that high-dimensional local models, including benign and poisoned models, may be evaluated to have the same similarity while being significantly different in the parameter values. We then leverage this finding to devise a novel untargeted model poisoning attack, Faker, which launches the attack by simultaneously maximizing the evaluated similarity of the poisoned local model and the difference in the parameter values. Experimental results based on seven datasets and eight defenses show that Faker outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark attacks by 1.1-9.0X in reducing accuracy and 1.2-8.0X in saving time cost, which even holds for the case of a single malicious client with limited knowledge about the FL system. Moreover, Faker can degrade the performance of the global model by attacking only once. We also preliminarily explore extending Faker to other attacks, such as backdoor attacks and Sybil attacks. Lastly, we provide a model evaluation strategy, called the similarity of partial parameters (SPP), to defend against Faker. Given that numerous mechanisms in FL utilize similarity metrics to assess local models, this work suggests that we should be vigilant regarding the potential risks of using these metrics. The code will be released soon.},

A critical aspect of these examples is their transferability, allowing them to deceive unseen models in closed-box scenarios. Despite the widespread exploration of defense methods, including those on transferability, they show limitations: inefficient deployment, ineffective defense, and degraded performance on clean images. In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way. We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data $\boldsymbol {x}$ as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data $\boldsymbol {x}+\boldsymbol {\tau }$ . Importantly, the trigger $\boldsymbol {\tau }$ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as models with trigger activation. We are surprised to find that these models exhibit certain robustness against TAEs. Through the consideration of first-order gradients, we provide a theoretical analysis of this robustness. Moreover, through the joint optimization of the learnable trigger and the model, we achieve improved robustness to transferable attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse datasets, evaluating a variety of attacking methods, underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.},

However, extensive research has shown that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can lead them to confidently output incorrect results with high confidence scores. Existing adversarial attack methods often focus solely on temporal characteristics of signals while neglecting frequency domain information, resulting in adversarial examples with poor transferability and inadequate performance in the closed-box scenario. An adversarial attack method based on frequency domain feature enhanced and integral gradient (FEIG) for AMC task is proposed in this paper. The approach utilizes techniques such as translation interpolation and Inverse Fast Fourier Transform to enhance the frequency domain information of original examples, thereby constructing enhanced baseline examples. Subsequently, these generated enhanced baseline examples are used as new inputs for gradient integration to obtain adversarial examples. Compared to traditional methods, the generated adversarial examples exhibit stronger transferability. Furthermore, in order to improve the defense performance of the model, an enhanced hybrid adversarial training (EH-AT) framework is proposed in this paper. The original clean example and the adversarial example generated by the proposed attack method are trained with joint loss constraints, which greatly enhances the robustness of the model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FEIG attack method and the EH-AT framework.},

In this paper, we propose a trust-cooperative virtualized network function (VNF) model based on coalition formation for SFC provisioning. The proposed model records coalition formation information as transactions in the blockchain to protect the VNF information from being tampered with by attackers. Coalition formation for SFC provisioning consists of two steps: VNF node identity verification and the decision to join the coalition. To address the issue of unreliability in SFC deployment due to attacks, we propose a cooperative SFC provisioning algorithm based on security-aware coalition formation to identify trustworthy VNFs for SFC. Moreover, to handle the instability of SFC provisioning caused by DDoS attacks, we present an SFC reprovisioning algorithm based on the stochastic evolutionary coalition game with reward machines (SECGRM) under the constraint of VNF service times. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms effectively combat malicious attacks and significantly reduce cooperative SFC provisioning latency compared with existing leading approaches.},

Specifically, during the sensor deployment phase, we employ quality-guaranteed Monte Carlo propagation simulations coupled with a greedy strategy to achieve maximum coverage with minimal sensors. In the source detection phase, for the structurally incomplete network snapshots, we first attempt edge reconnection from the sensor with the earliest timestamp, followed by posterior maximization Bayesian estimation for source identification. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SDSA and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. The code has been made publicly available at https://github.com/cheng-le/SDSA.},

  abstract     = {The reentrancy vulnerability is one of the most notorious vulnerabilities of smart contracts. It enables attackers to hijack the control flow of a smart contract by invoking a function as the entry point and then re-invoking a function as the reentry point before the execution of the entry point ends. Although several approaches have been proposed to detect this vulnerability, they still face two main limitations. Firstly, existing approaches oversimplify the rules for identifying entry and reentry points, and many even neglect reentry point identification during vulnerability detection. Secondly, most existing approaches overlook the flow of state variables that are not promptly updated, a critical aspect of the reentrancy vulnerability. To address the limitations mentioned above, this article proposes a novel static analysis framework for reentry vulnerability detection. We formulate the reentrancy vulnerability detection as entry and reentry point identification with the state variable flow tracking. Based on the insight that most smart contracts are implemented following various technical standards, we utilize static analysis with standard-based rules to identify potential entry and reentry points. This is achieved by detecting the presence of hijackable and exploitable operations inside the smart contract. Meanwhile, we also conduct state variable flow tracking by the static taint analysis. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we construct three different datasets. Then We compare our approach with eight state-of-the-art smart contract vulnerability detectors, and our tool outperforms these baselines in detecting more vulnerable samples with fewer false positive samples. Meanwhile, our approach achieves a relatively shorter detection time with better detection results, striking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.},

To restrict user access from untrusted devices, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy has been proposed to authenticate users and devices simultaneously. However, when integrating BYOD policy into MEC authentication to improve security, issues of efficient binding and user-device conditional anonymity have not been well supported. To address these issues, we propose Bring Your Device Group (BYDG) policy by constructing efficient and privacy-preserving user-device authentication. Our core idea is to use key sequences generated by PUFs-based key derivation functions (KDFs) to not only construct efficient binding relationships, but also achieve conditional anonymity for device groups. Specifically, a flexible and secure binding method is first developed by leveraging Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to bind user with device groups. Each device’s CRT modulus is derived from the key sequence to construct many-to-many user-device binding relationships, which are managed in the form of on-chain Pedersen Commitment. Moreover, we design an identity anonymizing and tracing method for device groups. The key sequence is regarded as traceable device pseudo-identities, and then inserted into the cuckoo filter to reduce the on-chain storage overhead and mitigate malicious login attempts with low costs. Based on above two methods, the combination of Pedersen Commitment and Zero-Knowledge Proof of Knowledge is used to achieve user-device authentication with conditional anonymity. The security analysis was presented to demonstrate important security properties. A proof-of-concept prototype was implemented to conduct performance evaluation and comparative analysis.},

Therefore, it is significant to develop effective and efficient methods to detect malware. Towards this, most state-of-the-art methods are focused on learning-based method. In order to adapt to the characteristics of sample scarcity and dynamic evolution of malware detection tasks, few-shot class incremental learning has been proposed as an efficient pairwise solution. Nevertheless, they still face two major challenges: 1) Catastrophic Forgetting: the erosion of existing knowledge by newly acquired knowledge during incremental learning. 2) Decision boundary confusion: after continuous multiple incremental sessions, the discriminative ability of the classification model is weakened. To address the above challenges, we propose a new Malware detection framework based on Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning, MalFSCIL, which utilizes a decoupled training strategy combined with a variational autocoder to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and designs a dynamic boundary delineation method based on class prototyping to achieve accurate delineation of incremental decision boundaries.

A part of applications require labeled PSI in the unbalanced setting, where a server holds a label for each item in a set that is much larger than the set held by a client, and the client obtains the intersection and the corresponding labels. In this paper, we present a new concretely efficient labeled PSI protocol in the unbalanced setting, without using computation-heavy homomorphic encryption. Our protocol is based on Distributed Point Function (DPF) with hardware acceleration from fixed-key AES-NI, and has communication complexity linear in the size of a small set of the client and sublinear in the size of a large set of the server. Our protocol exploits two Oblivious Pesudorandom Function (OPRF) protocols, based on Diffle-Hellman PRFs or block ciphers, to achieve a trade-off between computation and communication. Our implementation demonstrates that our protocol outperforms the previous labeled and unbalanced PSI protocols. In particular, for two sets with respective $2^{24}$ and 1 items, where each item has a 32-byte label, our protocol takes 1.19 seconds for an end-to-end performance, resulting in $26 \times $ improvement compared to the state-of-the-art protocol by Cong et al.
