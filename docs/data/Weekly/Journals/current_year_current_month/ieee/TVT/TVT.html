  abstract     = {Traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes for multi-user visible light communication (MuVLC) are designed with multiple light sources, rendering them inapplicable to MuVLC with single light source. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative relay-aided PLS scheme based on cooperative jamming for MuVLC with single light source. First, we randomly select parts of relays for cooperative jamming, modeling their locations as a Poisson point process (PPP). Then, a jamming signal introduced through these selected relays significantly decreases the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio of the randomly located eavesdroppers, thereby increasing the security capacity. By modeling the eavesdropper locations as another independent PPP, we analyze the security performance by deriving closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function of security capacity, security outage probability, its lower and upper bounds, and ergodic security capacity. These theoretical expressions are verified via Monte Carlo simulations. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves high-level communication security. Furthermore, increasing relay density, decreasing eavesdropper density, reducing target security capacity, or lowering relay plane height can effectively reduce security outage probability, offering valuable insights for designing secure MuVLC with single light source.},

  abstract     = {In the blockchain-aided mobile edge intelligence (B-MEI) network, base stations (BSs) each with an edge server not only execute tasks offloaded from users but also serve as blockchain nodes to ensure trustworthy data management of task execution in a decentralized manner. A challenging issue of B-MEI is that, both task execution and blockchain consensus demand significant computing resources. Insufficient resource allocation inevitably leads to resource wastage and even degrades system performance, especially in scenarios where task arrivals and wireless channels are dynamically changing. Driven by this issue, we first formulate the dynamic allocation of computing resources as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to maximize the average transaction throughput of the B-MEI system. In particular, we find that, due to the time-consuming nature of blockchain consensus, the MDP rewards stemmed from the block generation is typically delayed and sparse. To address this issue, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm, named Stable Hindsight Credit Assignment (SHCA), to effectively learn the stable credit assignment for sparse rewards across intermediate actions to optimize policy decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the average transaction throughput by 78% compared with the baseline algorithm.},

We fomulate a secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem which is addressed by jointly optimizing the BS transmit beamforming and the ARIS reflection coefficient matrix. We first decompose the SEE into a linear function exploiting a quadratic transform. The uncertainty of the channels related to the Eve is approximated by using the S-Procedure.

This paper investigates cooperative downlink (DL) transmission from multiple LEO satellites by using distributed beamforming, considering the inevitable delay and Doppler compensation errors that impact coherent processing. Firstly, we establish the DL transmission signal model for multiple LEO satellites with delay and Doppler compensation errors. On this basis, we design the transmitters and receivers to maximize the average signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. Then, we analyze the DL transmission performance via deriving lower bounds and closed-form expressions for both the user rate and the average rate gain of cooperative transmission compared to single LEO satellite transmission. We prove that as the number of receiving antennas at the UT increases, the impact of imperfect compensation on the user rate decreases, and the average rate gain improves. In addition, we prove that the UT can achieve the optimal average rate gain when its array response vectors corresponding to different LEO satellites are orthogonal. Simulations are performed and compared to the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the performance gains brought by distributed beamforming and validating our analysis.},

  abstract     = {Providing service quality guarantee is essential for mobile communication systems to ensure satisfactory user experience. Recently, clustered cell-free networking has been proposed to avoid the cell-edge problem in current cellular networks and uniformize the rate performance of users. Under the practical consideration of providing rate guarantee for each single user and reducing the system complexity as much as possible, this paper investigates the clustered cell-free networking problem with the objective of maximizing the number of subnetworks under the individual rate constraints and the balance constraints of subnetworks. Such an optimization problem is NP-hard to solve with the key challenge arising from the interdependence between the number of balance constraints and the optimization objective, i.e., the solution space varies with the objective function. To address this challenge, we convert the balance constraints into a single constraint, based on which the problem is solved via relaxation and a balanced and individual-rate-guaranteed (BIRG) clustered cell-free networking algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BIRG algorithm can provide rate guarantee for each user as well as produce balanced subnetworks, and outperform the state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) relies on high-resolution direction of arrival (DOA) estimates to achieve excellent performance. Expanding antenna element spacing is a common strategy to improve DOA resolution. However, excessively large spacing can cause signals from different directions to become indistinguishable, leading to DOA ambiguity. Traditional methods typically address DOA ambiguity through antenna array relocation or the use of multiple arrays. In multipath-based SLAM, however, the movement of the mobile agent naturally facilitates the movement of the receiver's array, allowing the use of high-resolution yet ambiguous DOA estimates. In this paper, we propose a splitting state transition model to handle DOA ambiguity and a novel amplitude measurement model to handle the high nonlinearity it introduces. Integrating these models within an existing Bayesian framework, we develop a message passing algorithm. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method improves positioning and mapping performance, while exhibiting enhanced robustness against divergence.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed aerialvehicles(UAVs) possess the potential to effectively locate missing individuals in distress scenarios by leveraging their wireless communication and flight capabilities. In the multilateration method using wireless signals, the localization accuracy increases as the number of measurements increases. However, since UAVs have limited battery capacity, it becomes imperative to optimize the UAV's trajectory within a given search region. In this paper, we propose a circular trajectory for energy-limited UAV and provide an analysis on energy consumption and localization accuracy of the circular trajectory. Based on our analysis, optimized circular trajectory can be derived in closed-form according to the search region. The proposed method not only can achieve higher localization accuracy and energy efficiency, but also allows easier rescue planning in advance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior localization accuracy compared to the conventional waypoint-based method, particularly when the energy capacity is limited.},

We consider that the proactive warden introduces additional interference channels, which affects the minimum error detection probability (DEP) at the warden. The DEP is derived and is influenced by the transmit power and interference power. Additionally, we propose an optimization framework to maximize the covert rate of the system while considering the constraints of transmitting power and covertness.

In this paper, we consider the AIRS-PIRS jointly aided wireless point-to-point communication system with two different deployment schemes in three-dimensional (3D) space. To balance the trade-off between the square-order beamforming gain of PIRS and the unique power amplification gain of AIRS, we optimize the elements allocation and beamforming design of the two IRSs under various practical constraints from a rate-maximization perspective. Moreover, we derive a series of element-related closed-form analytical expressions and compare the performance of the two schemes. Our analysis shows that in both schemes, PIRS should be allocated more elements than AIRS, and the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases asymptotically with the cube of the number of reflecting elements, when the distance between AIRS and PIRS is sufficiently large. Last, simulation results validate our analysis and indicate that both schemes can achieve superior rate performance over various benchmarks.},

We first derive the minimum detection error probability at a warden, based on which we optimize the phase switching ratio between the two phases to maximize the effective transmission rate subject to a covertness constraint. Interestingly, our analysis indicates that the achievable communication covertness does not depend on the transmit power of Alice, which remains the same across the two phases for simplifying system implementation. Our examinations also show that a shorter duration should be allocated to energy harvesting for maximizing the covert communication performance when the capability of the RIS increases, e.g., the element number or discrete phase shift level increases.},

Accordingly, an adaptive transmit antenna selection (ATAS) scheme is introduced, where the transmit antennas with channel gain exceeding a predefined threshold can be employed. We conduct SRT analysis by deriving the expressions of the outage probability (OP) and intercept probability (IP) for our ATAS scheme and propose the sum of OP and IP optimization of ATAS (SOIO-ATAS) algorithm to realize the balance and trade-off between security and reliability. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the advantage of proposed ATAS scheme over the benchmarks in terms of SRT performance.

Our objective is to maximize SEE by optimizing the HBF, while satisfying the constraints of radar sensing mutual information (SMI), communication rate requirements, transmit power budget, and the hardware limitations of analog beamformers. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop an effective algorithm based on the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework combining the Dinkelbach, minorization-maximization (MM), successive convex approximation (SCA), and element-wise optimization methods.

First, we transform the subcarrier allocation problem of discrete variables into the convex optimization problem of continuous variables. First, we transform the subcarrier allocation problem of discrete variables into the convex optimization problem of continuous variables. Then, we use multiple quadratic transformations and the Lagrange multiplier method to transform the non-convex subproblem of optimizing precoding vectors into a convex problem, while the task offloading subproblem is a convex problem.

  abstract     = {The non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are recognized as a key component to provide cost-effective and high-capacity ubiquitous connectivity in the future wireless communications. To improve the spectral efficiency in NTNs, rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, the major issue of the considered system is to overcome security hurdles. In this paper, a robust secure precoding transmission scheme based on RSMA is proposed, which is the first time being used for high-altitude platform (HAP)-assisted satellite NTNs. The system features a low-Earth orbit satellite that serves multiple ground user equipments (GUEs) using a rate-splitting strategy, while a decode-and-forward HAP relay assists the satellite in establishing communication links with the GUEs. Assuming imperfect channel state information, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum secrecy rate (SSR) of GUEs. The problem jointly optimizes the precoding vectors for both the satellite and the HAP relay, subject to constraints on their maximum transmit powers and the achievable secrecy rates for each GUE. Subsequently, leveraging successive convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation, we present an approach to transform the non-convex constraints into convex ones, enabling the precoding vectors to be obtained through an iterative procedure. Simulation results show that the RSMA can achieve SSR of up to 3.25 bps/Hz and 3.75 bps/Hz compared to non-orthogonal multiple access and time division multiple access, respectively.},

However, most of the existing resource optimization approaches focused on perfect channel state information and ideal hardware conditions, so that the received signals may be distorted by channel uncertainties (e.g., channel estimation errors) and hardware impairments (HWIs) (e.g., distortion noises). To this end, we proposed a more realistic robust secure structure for a RIS-aided BackCom system with the consideration of channel uncertainties, HWIs, and one eavesdropper. Then, we formulate an EE-based maximization resource allocation problem by optimizing the transmit power of base station, the artificial noise power, the RIS's phase shift matrix, and the time slots. To tackle this non-convex problem, an iteration-based robust resource allocation algorithm is proposed by employing the worst-case approach, the variable substitution approach, and the alternating optimization approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has 14.84% increase in the EE and 8.78% reduction in outage probability compared to the other algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a novel wireless power transfer (WPT) system is established with cooperative zero-energy double-RIS, where the internal reflection link between RISs and the nonlinear energy harvesting model are jointly considered. Aimed at minimizing the transmit power, the active beamforming at the access point (AP) and the reflection coefficients at cooperative double-RIS are optimized jointly. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, an efficient algorithm that is based on alternating optimization (AO) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithm is designed. Simulation results are provided to highlight the superiority of our proposed solution by reducing at least 20.37% of the transmit power when compared to other benchmark schemes. Moreover, the impact of the AP's antenna number and the total number of RIS elements on minimizing the power is demonstrated.},

  abstract     = {This article investigates the performance of a two-hop network in which a source and energy harvesting (EH) relay has multi-rate selection capability and communicates with the destination at different rates. In particular, with fixed and dynamic power-splitting relaying (PSR) protocols, we analyze the system performance of a decode-and-forward (DF) EH relay network using a throughput metric with rate selection capability. It shows that employing a novel multi-rate scheme improves the throughput drastically over a single rate. Furthermore, we consider joint optimization of the PSR parameter denoted by $\rho$ and rate selection quality-of-service (RQ) parameter denoted by $\delta$, which determines the number of transmission rates in the feasible transmission range. In the case of statistical channel state information (CSI) availability, the joint optimization of PSR and RQ parameters is achieved through the 2D golden section search (2D-GSS) method. Closed-form expressions for the optimal $\rho$ and $\delta$ are obtained in case of instantaneous CSI availability. The numerical results demonstrate that the joint parameter optimization with instantaneous CSI provides better performance, and the obtained insights are crucial to improve quality-of-service in energy-constrained wireless networks.},

To address this challenge, we propose a novel UAV-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted approach, where the RIS is mounted on the UAV for enhancing/suppressing its reflected signal towards the L/U to facilitate/prevent its detection of the UAV. Furthermore, the UAV target can also adjust its flight route to move closer to/away from the L/U to improve/decrease the sensing performance. Due to the mobility of both the shipborne radars and UAVs, the Doppler shift effects of the RIS-ship channel need to be considered. In such a setup, the maximization of the received power at the L is formulated into an optimization problem while suppressing the received power at the U below a certain threshold by jointly designing the reflecting phase shifts of RIS and the 3D flight trajectory of UAV. The non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems and solved via an iterative algorithm.

Traditional RIS deployments often suffer from complex channel estimation, particularly with a large number of RIS elements, while TR typically requires a rich multipath environment with more paths than users. To address these challenges, the proposed RIS-TRMA leverages the concept of RIS phase shifter-based virtual multipath (VMP) channels. The VMP is utilized to enhance the TR effect where the number of multipath (i.e. the number of RIS elements) exceeds the number of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) users. The performance of the proposed RIS-TRMA is analyzed in terms of capacity, outage probability (OP), spectral efficiency (SE), and complexity compared to RIS-NOMA.},

  abstract     = {Recent studies have focused on leveraging large-scale artificial intelligence (LAI) models to improve semantic representation and compression capabilities. However, the substantial computational demands of LAI models pose significant challenges for real-time communication scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes utilizing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to extract and condense knowledge from LAI models, effectively reducing model complexity and computation latency. Nevertheless, the inherent complexity of LAI models leads to prolonged inference times during distillation, while their lack of channel awareness compromises the distillation performance. These limitations make standard KD methods unsuitable for task-oriented semantic communication scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a fast distillation method featuring a pre-stored compression mechanism that eliminates the need for repetitive inference, significantly improving efficiency. Furthermore, a channel adaptive module is incorporated to dynamically adjust the transmitted semantic information based on varying channel conditions, enhancing communication reliability and adaptability. In addition, an information bottleneck-based loss function is derived to guide the fast distillation process. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme outperform baselines in term of task accuracy, model size, computation latency, and training data requirements.},

However, strong cross-link interference (CLI) may be caused by different transmission directions between adjacent cells in D-TDD systems, thus degrading the performance. Most existing CLI mitigation schemes require sharing certain information among base stations (BSs) via backhaul links. This strategy is usually expensive and suffers high latency. Alternatively, we propose a pilot information sharing scheme based on over-the-air forwarding of the downlink pilot of the interfering BS to the interfered BS via a wireless terminal, along with a dedicated CLI channel estimation method. Simulation results demonstrate that thanks to the proposed pilot information sharing scheme the classic interference rejection combining (IRC) receiver achieves a signal detection performance highly comparable to that of the IRC detector with perfect pilot information, necessitating no information sharing among BSs via backhaul links. Furthermore, the proposed CLI channel estimation scheme reduces the impact of errors introduced by pilot forwarding, thereby improving the performance of both CLI channel estimation and signal detection.},

Observing the inherent disparities among users under NOMA transmission, this paper first excavates the closed-form trade-offs between achievable sum-rate and the MUD load corresponding to the UAV-user matchings, which leads to a sum-rate maximization problem under payload constraints on processing complexity. To address the non-trivial integer matching, this paper develops a quadratic transformation to the original problem, and proves it an equivalent conversion through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The problem is further simplified into a series of subproblems employing successive lower bound approximation which is proved to obtain polynomial-time complexity with good convergence. Numerical results show remarkable complexity reduction compared with centralized processing, as well as more than 10% sum-rate gain compared with other allocation methods.},

Also, UAM aircraft needs to regularly transmit status and environmental conditions to the base stations (BS) to maintain updated information in the system. Hence, the age of information (AoI) can be used as a status measurement indicator to evaluate the degree to which the current status information of UAM aircraft is outdated. Optimizing each UAM aircraft's flight trajectory for both power efficiency and safety, while also minimizing the AoI for timely data transmission forms a computationally challenging NP-hard problem.

Simulation results demonstrate that our method produce a power efficiency improvement of 8.8% compared to the PPO method and 13.8% compare to the detour method.

  abstract     = {In this letter, we propose an effective near-field channel parameter estimation and localization algorithm for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems. Exploiting the structural relation between the parameters and near-field codebook matrices, the proposed algorithm first implements the preliminary extraction of near-field channel parameters. Subsequently, the obtained parameters, including angles, distances and propagation gains, are further optimized by the iterative refinement. Localization of user and scattering points in near-field region can be achieved utilizing the obtained high-precision parameters. In addition, we provide the derivation process of Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) and use the CRB as a performance benchmark. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm can realize accurate parameter estimation and localization compared to the existing algorithms. The influence of the sampling numbers on the estimation performance is also investigated. Simulation results reveal that even in the case of small sampling numbers, the proposed algorithm still has excellent performance.},

However, their inherent limitations in bandwidth, computational capacity, and energy resources restrict their ability to meet the demands of computation-intensive applications. To overcome these challenges, an air-ground collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) network with enhanced resources is employed to improve Quality of Service (QoS). This network can provide support for a wide range of real-time applications where the computed results are critical. We adopt Age of Processing (AoP) as a metric to measure the freshness of processed results. This study investigates AoP-aware task offloading and resource allocation in a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system, optimizing the trade-off between user-experienced AoP and UAV energy consumption through joint design of user-UAV association, resource allocation, offloading ratios, and transmit power. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we employ a cooperative Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) approach, utilizing a sequential policy update strategy within a centralized training, decentralized execution framework to mitigate inefficiencies from overlapping UAV coverage.

To mitigate accident and congestion risks, integrating advanced vehicular and communication technologies has facilitated the development of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). These networks enable vehicles to share real-time safety alerts with other vehicles and traffic authorities. However, open wireless links in VANETs are susceptible to security threats, making the authentication and integrity of transmitted safety alerts essential. Yan et al. addressed these needs with a hierarchical authentication scheme (IEEE Trans. on Veh. Tech., vol. 73, no. 1, 1253–1262, 2023). Unfortunately, the devised study identifies vulnerabilities in Yan et al.’s design, specifically concerning forgery and anonymity exposure attacks. In response, an improved, secure hierarchical authentication scheme is proposed. Through both formal and informal security analyses, it is demonstrated to be resilient against various practical attacks. A thorough performance evaluation further supports the design's practical suitability for deployment within VANET infrastructure, offering enhanced security for safer transportation networks.},

As a core component of vehicular metaverses, Vehicle Twins (VTs) are digital twins that cover the entire life cycle of vehicles, providing immersive virtual services for Vehicular Metaverse Users (VMUs). Vehicles with limited resources offload the computationally intensive tasks of constructing and updating VTs to edge servers and migrate VTs between these servers, ensuring seamless and immersive experiences for VMUs. However, the high mobility of vehicles, uneven deployment of edge servers, and potential security threats pose challenges to achieving efficient and reliable VT migrations. To address these issues, we propose a secure and reliable VT migration framework in vehicular metaverses. Specifically, we design a two-layer trust evaluation model to comprehensively evaluate the reputation value of edge servers in the network communication and interaction layers. Then, we model the VT migration problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and design a hybrid-Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning to generate optimal migration decisions by taking hybrid actions (i.e., continuous actions and discrete actions). Numerical results demonstrate that the hybrid-GDM algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, showing strong adaptability in various settings and highlighting the potential of the hybrid-GDM algorithm for addressing various optimization issues in vehicular metaverses.},

Based on a novel constructed second-order nonlinear UAV-UGV swarm in space, the leader's dynamics are presumed to be linear in relation to its state variables, with the coefficient matrices remaining unknown to all followers. Meanwhile, considering that the UAV-UGV swarm is susceptible to the propagation of incorrect neighbors' information and false input signals (called Byzantine attacks), which is effectively reinterpreted as the management of unknown variables within the control inputs, an optimal control method under the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is investigated to against the aggressive Byzantine attacks. Furthermore, the neural network (NN) is employed to approximate the Byzantine attacks and unknown terms arising from the leader's dynamics and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, and the actor and critic adaptive laws are designed in actor-critic-identifier architecture. Subsequently, an optimal tracking control scheme is proposed to ensure fully distributed collaborative tracking of the UAV-UGV formation under Byzantine attacks.

Meanwhile, the microservice architecture provides a lightweight and flexible approach for network function deployment in satellite edge computing networks by splitting complex applications into multiple microservices. In satellite edge computing networks, a brand new problem is how to deploy various types of microservices with service function chain (SFC) constraints onto appropriate satellites to efficiently utilize limited on-board resources and reduce the service latency. In this paper, a distributed microservice deployment strategy in satellite edge computing networks is proposed by taking into account time-varying satellite network topology and diverse satellite resources. Specifically, we formulate the deployment problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to minimize the load imbalance as well as the service latency. A distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (DMARL) scheme is proposed for learning a dynamic deployment strategy. Furthermore, to accommodate more microservices in SFC, a novel attention-based actor-critic strategy is designed to significantly accelerate the convergence of network training. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DMARL scheme can achieve a superior performance.},

  abstract     = {The heterogeneous vehicular networks (HVNs) integrate various radio access technologies to enhance user capacity, coverage, and quality of experience. However, the rapid topology changes in HVNs make it challenging for traditional encryption methods that rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to store, manage, and distribute keys. Physical layer security (PLS) technology emerges as a powerful complementary solution due to its capabilities in key generation and distribution without relying on TTPs. Therefore, we derive two PLS metrics for HVNs, connection outage probability (COP) and secrecy outage probability (SOP). Based on these metrics, we propose an adaptive network selection method which enhances PLS by identifying and selecting the network that is optimal secure and reliable. Specifically, to characterize the irregularity and randomness of HVNs, Poisson point processes and Poisson line processes are adopted to build a spatial model for HVNs. Then, we derive closed-form expressions for COP and SOP in HVNs, which characterize the connectivity stability and security of networks. Furthermore, we apply fuzzy logic to filter available networks, aiming at reducing computational latency. Analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method are utilized to quantitatively analyze the diverse requirements of in-vehicle services and network metrics. Finally, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution is used to accurately select the optimal network from the filtered candidates, enhancing the stability and security of vehicle communication in HVNs. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the PLS of HVNs, achieving a maximum of roughly 22.29% improvement in SOP and an average increase of 29.58% in COP performance compared to conventional methods.},

VSN security profiling helps in comprehending and ranking VSN security risks according to a range of criteria. The existing approaches to VSN security profiling and risk quantification have notable limitations. Firstly, they often overlook the intensity of interactions between VSN devices. Secondly, these methods require re-evaluation of security scores and the likelihood of attacks whenever VSN configurations change. Additionally, most current risk quantification methods cannot concurrently assess risks across multiple networks, further limiting their utility. Given these challenges, this work focuses on VSN security profiling quantitatively based on users accounts because various types of accounts are used for security control mechanisms. To address these issues, we first propose Distributed Accounts Association Algorithms (D-AAA) for matching service accounts with malicious accounts based on Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) metric, and apply accounts matching results to sort service accounts by vulnerability and compute the average risk for multiple service VSN networks. To verify the proposed D-AAA, the performance of the proposed D-AAA is evaluated through numerical experiments, including an assessment of computational complexities, association correctness, and risk evaluations. Additionally, the D-AAA are compared with other graph matching methods in terms of association correctness and runtime with real VSN datasets.},

To avoid the degradation of DNN inference performance due to the cold start during the vehicle's service node switching, we propose three different service placement solutions, including processing locally, directly selecting one RSU as server node for collaborative offloading, and selecting one RSU as relay to maintain the connection with original server node. We model the RSU network as an undirected weighted graph and formulate an optimization problem to minimize the DNN inference latency by jointly optimizing the DNN service placement and DNN model partitioning. To solve this problem, we propose a Graph Neural Network Reinforcement learning-based service Placement and model Partitioning algorithm (GRPP). Initially, we extract the feature embedding of RSU nodes and obtain the DNN service placement solution based on Graph Neural Network (GNN). Furthermore, we design a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to generate the DNN model partitioning point. Specifically, the parameters of GNN and MLP are learned through an actor-critic based reinforcement learning structure. Finally, we generate the simulation model via traffic simulator Simulation for Urban MObility (SUMO) and give a comprehensive performance evaluation. Simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme can decrease the DNN inference latency by up to 64.51% compared with the benchmark.},

However, implementing FL in vehicular edge computing (VEC) presents various challenges, such as dropout effect, straggler effect and inefficient communication. Moreover, the dynamic and volatile nature of vehicles in VEC-enabled mobile volatile federated edge learning (VFEL) systems exacerbates these challenges. In this paper, we focus on the volatility in mobile VFEL systems, modeling the dropout problem with vehicles' local computation and communication volatility rates. We formulate the objective to optimize system reliability and learning cost, converting it into a Markov decision process considering environmental dynamics. To achieve the optimal vehicle selection and resource allocation scheme, we propose a reliability-aware twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (RA-TD3) scheme by combining the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm and convex optimization.

  abstract     = {With the continuous development of communication industry, the demand for spectrum resources is gradually increasing. Simultaneously, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively studied as a means to assist with traffic offloading by establishing wireless links between base stations (BSs) and UAVs. However, the current spectrum resources are limited and far from optimal utilization. In response to this situation, cognitive radio (CR) technology and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technologies have been proposed to enhance the efficient utilization of spectrum resources. In this paper, we address the challenge of using CR technology to assist UAVs in traffic offloading within specific areas. At each instance, the UAV must consider the allocation of time for data collection, traffic transmission, and UAV charging. Given the dynamic nature of spectrum resources, UAVs must make adaptive decisions based on the current conditions. Finally, we model the aforementioned issues as a quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) system to expedite the training process. In particular, we design a quantum soft actor-critic algorithm employing a variable quantum circuit (VQC) and encode the experience data into a quantum summation tree while transforming it into a quantum priority experience replay buffer. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the scalability and coverage of long range (LoRa) mesh networks deployed for monitoring linear infrastructure, such as railways and pipelines. Although the monitored infrastructure is linear, the network topology is a mesh. The study addresses the challenges posed by the scalability of such networks, considering constraints imposed by duty cycle regulations in license-free frequency bands, particularly within the European Union where a 1% duty cycle limitation exists. A deployment strategy is proposed to optimize the placement of LoRa mesh nodes along linear infrastructure. A comprehensive analysis of scalability and coverage yields their bounds, along with the condition necessary to achieve the upper bounds. To enhance scalability and coverage, a novel routing algorithm is proposed considering the number of hops and the received signal strength indicator. Additionally, a LoRa mesh simulator, LoRaMeshSim, is developed to validate the system analysis and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed routing algorithm. The findings provide valuable insights into the practical deployment of LoRa mesh networks for monitoring linear infrastructure.},

  abstract     = {In the contemporary landscape of vehicular networks, characterized by disruptive innovations such as autonomous driving, real-time traffic monitoring, and integrated infotainment services, there is a greater need for substantial computational power and precise operations. To cope with such demand, mobile edge computing (MEC) emerges as a pivotal mechanism that can boost the capacities of vehicular networks, leveraging edge servers, offering ultralow latency, and providing support for operations requiring near real-time access to rapidly growing and varying data. In this paper, we exploit deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to minimize the overall service delay of the vehicle in a vehicular network using MEC. We propose a dual-stage DRL-assisted resource optimization strategy; firstly, the strategy optimizes the transmit power of the vehicle using the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm after the vehicle initiates computational offloading, which contributes to minimizing the propagation delay. Secondly, once the data are transferred to the roadside unit (RSU), the strategy uses the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm to allocate an optimal number of processing cores for computational tasks, thus minimizing the computational delay. Additionally, we present the energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of the vehicle to examine the trade-off between the EE and SE. We compare the performance of the proposed strategy against the benchmark schemes, including always offload, never offload, random offload, and deep neural network (DNN)–based cooperative offloading schemes. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation strategy outperforms the benchmark schemes and improves the system performance by reducing the overall service delay.},

However, most existing works fail to account for the spatial-temporal properties of trajectory simultaneously and rely on biased real-world or synthetic datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised method, Dynamic Network Representation learning (DNR), that leverages the advances in the network field and adapts them to transportation. DNR constructs a dynamic network from the perspective of vehicle social networks using the idea of the k-nearest neighbors. A dynamic walk algorithm is proposed to sample nodes and context over time, focusing on topology changes. DNR embeds the network using Skip-Gram network representation and incremental learning to obtain two trajectory embeddings for two anomaly types. Our experiments on four real-world datasets and eight generative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DNR over other methods and reveal its rationality to detect deviations from typical trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Future vehicular edge computing (VEC) networks are projected to generate massive amounts of computation tasks which exhibit dynamic spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Vehicular users will greatly benefit if the VEC network provides the following information a priori: a) estimates of the delays along the paths and b) amounts of network resources that will be assigned. Existing works did not provide such prior information and only dealt with real-time computation offloading. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed computation offloading strategy in which the vehicular users independently make proactive service reservations across the road side units (RSUs) along their paths. Such reservations are based on the computation offloading delays reported by the RSUs. These delays depend on the optimal network resources assigned by the RSUs to the vehicular users over different reservation slots. In order to determine the optimal assignment of network resources, we propose a new multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) problem where the RSUs act as agents. The objective of the MADRL problem is to maximize the mean number of offloaded tasks. This objective is found as the outcome of the proactive service reservation problem solved by each vehicular user when it is injected into the VEC network. The MADRL problem is approximated using a centralized-critic-distributed-actors model. The proactive service reservation introduces time coupling in the calculation of the rewards, therefore a novel training algorithm is proposed for solving the MADRL problem. Compared to some benchmark real-time computation offloading schemes, the proposed work benefited the vehicular users significantly by providing prior estimates of the delays along their paths. Specifically, the percentage of offloaded tasks achieving the highest utility was $14-20\,\%$ higher, b) the computation offloading delays experienced by the vehicular users along the path were the lowest, and c) the utilization of network resources was lowest compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract     = {Parked-assisted vehicular edge computing (PVEC) fully leverages communication and computing resources of parking vehicles, thereby significantly alleviating the pressure on edge servers. However, resource sharing and trading for vehicular task offloading in the PVEC environment usually occur between untrustworthy entities, which compromises the security of data sharing and transactions by vehicles and edge devices. To address these concerns, blockchain is introduced to provide a secure and trustworthy environment for offloading and transactions in PVEC. Nevertheless, due to the mobility of the vehicles, the processes of computing offloading and blockchain transactions are interrupted, which greatly reduces the reliability of the blockchain in edge computing process. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based PVEC (BPVEC) offloading framework to enhance the security and reliability of the task offloading and transaction. Specifically, a consensus node selection algorithm based on the connected dominating set (CDS) is designed to improve the Hotstuff consensus according to parking duration, computing capability and communication quality, which enhances blockchain reliability in computing offloading and transactions. Meanwhile, a Stackelberg game model, establishing the roadside units (RSUs) and parking vehicles (PVs) as leaders and the requesting vehicles (RVs) as follower, is utilized to optimize the offloading strategy and pricing. Subsequently, a BPVEC offloading strategy algorithm with gradient descent method is designed to maximize system revenue. Simulation results show that the proposed BPVEC offloading scheme is secure and reliable while ensuring maximum benefits.},

As a solution, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) extends computing resources to the edge of the network to reduce processing delays and improve user experience. However, in dynamically changing edge computing environments, effective decision making on whether to offload tasks to edge servers remains a core challenge. For this purpose, we propose MRLATO, an adaptive task offloading mechanism based on Meta Reinforcement Learning (MRL), which exploits a large amount of a priori knowledge of different tasks to achieve fast adaptation. The task offloading process is modelled as multiple Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and solved using a Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) neural network integrating multi-head attention and recursive task sequencing. It is shown by the experimental results that the proposed method has the lowest latency in all experimental settings and the convergence efficiency is improved by 14.06% compared to the traditional Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. This research fully demonstrates the significant benefits of the deep integration of MRL with the edge computing domain, providing new optimisation ideas for task offloading decisions.},

But research on performance bounds for compressive parameter estimation in CS radar systems is insufficient. This paper proposes the global bounds for compressive time delay estimation in CS radar, utilizing Shannon information theory. Specifically, we define the indicators of the time delay entropy error (TDEE) and time delay information (TDI) to evaluate the compressive time delay estimation performance. The theoretically derived TDEE and TDI provide the global lower and upper bounds for the estimation performance, respectively. Moreover, we deduce the asymptotic lower bound for TDEE and the asymptotic upper bound for TDI. The asymptotic lower bound and the derived Cramér-Rao bound are identical. The theoretical analyses show that the asymptotic lower bound is inversely proportional to the square of the compression ratio (CR), while the asymptotic upper bound is directly proportional to the logarithm of CR, reflecting the trade-off between compression level and estimation performance. Particularly, the TDEE and TDI do not depend on CR in low SNR. Simulation results illustrate the obvious advantages of TDEE over the Cramér-Rao bound on evaluating and predicting the time delay estimation performance for CS radar.},

Nevertheless, traditional public key encryption schemes hinder the sharing of encrypted data. Based on the premise of ensuring the confidentiality of encrypted information, in order to facilitate efficient data sharing, conduct data searches across extensive cloud-based datasets, and authorize access under specified conditions, we introduce Fine-Grained Access Control with Privacy-Preserving Data Retrieval (FGAC-PPDR) for the Internet of Vehicles. This scheme offers a secure, flexible, and privacy-centric approach to data sharing for groups of vehicles in the IoV. Our proposed scheme enables encrypted data to be retrieved at the group level by the cloud server, and prevents vehicles outside the group from performing equality tests on the ciphertext. Furthermore, the data owner can create an authorization token with defined conditions to specify how the data is shared. During the process of data search and sharing, intensive computing tasks are undertaken by cloud servers with abundant computational resources. We also demonstrate that our scheme is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA). Finally, we provide security and performance analyses that verify the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposal.},

A joint optimization problem of the service association, offloading power control, task partitions, CP allocation, and UAV trajectory design is formulated to minimize the long-term average delay of UEs. We use the Lyapunov technique to tackle the long-term energy constraint, forming a tractable optimization problem, which is modeled as a Markov decision process to balance the UAV's deficit queue stability and the UE's task completion delay. A hybrid soft actor-critic based deep reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to optimize the joint design by sampling the hybrid action from the Gumbel and Gaussian distributions.

In addition, considering that communication attacks will inevitably cause damage to the cooperation-antagonism network, as well as the impact of multiplicative faults on control inputs, it is crucial to design a control protocol that does not rely on global topology and contains dynamic gain. Thus, based on gauge transformation and adaptive mechanism, a fully distributed secure fault-tolerant formation splitting control protocol is designed. Considering that the energy of attackers is usually limited, based on a slowly switching mechanism, the sufficient conditions to ensure the implementation of secure fault-tolerant formation splitting under different degrees of communication attacks are provided. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation.},

  abstract     = {After the natural disasters, establishing a reliable and resilient emergency communication network is crucial, particularly when conventional infrastructure, such as base stations fail. Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) that leverage multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer a superior alternative to single UAVs by enabling dynamic, cooperative communication (CC) that extends operational range and enhances mission capabilities in disaster zones. Cooperative transmission improves communication reliability and data rates while reducing delays by mitigating wireless channel impairments due to mobility in FANETs. Selecting the optimal relay is crucial in cooperative communication, as it can significantly enhance both communication reliability and overall system efficiency. The primary contribution of this work is the development of a cooperative MAC protocol with an optimal relay selection algorithm tailored for FANETs in disaster scenarios. This algorithm, incorporating a utility backoff process, is built on a realistic network model that accounts for SNR, distance, and mobility. The random-access approach was adopted due to the limitations of IEEE 802.11 standards in supporting cooperative communication. Consequently, new control packets were developed, and existing control formats were revised to enable effective cooperation. To evaluate the proposed protocol, an analytical Markov Chain model was developed and validated through simulation. Performance-influencing parameters were considered, and relationships between various parameters and performance metrics were analyzed, including different fading channels, bit error rates and system outage probability. The numerical results show that the protocol significantly enhances performance by increasing throughput, enhancing communication reliability through reduced packet dropping rates, and decreasing transmission delays.},

  abstract     = {Augmented reality (AR) enhances human perception by overlaying digital information in the real environment and can be applied to various fields such as education, healthcare, and industry. To relieve the computing pressure of resource-limited AR devices, edge assisted AR has attracted significant attention in recent years. It enables AR devices to offload the computation-intensive environment analysis tasks to the edge server and to download the point-based 3D virtual objects for rendering. Although this method can effectively reduce the processing latency, it may introduce a long transmission latency. To address this issue, this work proposes a semantic communication empowered edge assisted AR to reduce the quality of experience (QoE)-aware latency. To this end, the AR devices first utilize an image encoder to extract semantic features of source images. Due to the importance difference of extracted features and limited communication resources, the feature selection and bandwidth allocation are explored to improve transmission efficiency. In addition, when the edge server completes the generation of point-based 3D virtual objects, it employs a transformer-based encoder to mask a proportion of points and learn a high-level representation of unmasked points. In this way, low-complexity semantic information of 3D objects is sent to the AR devices, which can reduce the transmission overhead of 3D objects. Moreover, the mask ratio of the point encoder is further optimized to balance the reconstructed quality and transmission latency of 3D objects. Therefore, this work aims to minimize the overall QoE-aware latency of edge assisted AR by jointly optimizing the semantic feature selection, mask ratio, and bandwidth allocation. A convex-based improved Harris Hawks optimization algorithm is designed to solve the formulated problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our semantic communication empowered edge assisted AR can effectively reduce the overall latency and outperform the other baselines.},

Traditional single-satellite positioning relies on the accumulative measurement over a segment of the trajectory, resulting in a long response time. In this paper, we propose a novel single-satellite positioning scheme, achieving instant positioning through the joint use of time-frequency Doppler analysis of signals and communication beam switching. First, through wide beam reception, range and velocity information are extracted using interpolation enhanced parameter estimation to determine candidate coordinates. To eliminate ambiguity in this process, further disambiguation is achieved through the high directivity of the narrow beam. The proposed scheme is proved to reach the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) while achieving real-time positioning with the central limit theorem (CLT). Simulation results indicate that at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 17 dB, the probability of positioning error being lower than 50 meters can reach 97.5%, demonstrating performance comparable to existing schemes.},

A comprehensive analysis of the phase errors arising from these imperfections is conducted, leading to the development of a robust analytical model that quantitatively incorporates these errors into the assessment of received power evaluations. Subsequently, we propose a methodology to selectively exclude RIS elements that are prone to errors, thereby improving the phase alignment of the received signal and enhancing overall system efficiency. While this strategy leads to a marginal decrease in received power, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed to optimize the RIS configuration, maintaining the desired power levels and ensuring signal integrity. The research also delves into the complexities introduced by shadowing effects combined with phase errors. To address these compounded challenges, a decision-making framework utilizing targeted BO is introduced to dynamically optimize RIS configurations, thereby enhancing system robustness and performance under adverse operational conditions. Numerical simulations validate the framework's efficacy in adaptively managing RIS elements, ensuring robust signal integrity and improved reception despite variations stemming from environmental and hardware factors.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the sum rate maximization problem in dense small cell (DSC) networks, where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) serve single-antenna users over a shared frequency band using noncoherent joint transmission (JT). While noncoherent JT enhances capacity by enabling users to receive signals from multiple coordinated SBSs, its practical deployment is hindered by the nonconvex and NP-hard nature of the optimization problem, along with the high-dimensional continuous optimization variables. Existing optimization-based approaches, despite achieving near-optimal performance, require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, making them impractical for DSC networks. To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem. The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions. By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate. In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.},

In this work, we study a multi-STAR-IRS-assisted downlink multi-cell communication system in which STAR-IRSs are strategically deployed within cells to assist transmission from base stations (BSs) to user equipments (UEs). We aim to maximize energy efficiency by designing robust beamforming for active beamforming matrices at all BSs, passive reflection beamforming, and transmission beamforming matrices at all STAR-IRSs in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Due to the non-convexity of the original optimization problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is developed. Initially, the optimization problem is modeled as a multi-agent Markov decision problem. Next, to reduce interaction among cells, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-enhanced partially distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Therein, the agents alternatively learn robust policies for beamforming optimization against channel errors, where the robust training strategy is applied for training networks to narrow the mismatch between the perfect and imperfect CSI. Additionally, GNNs are incorporated to facilitate effective collaboration within cell agents. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its superior system energy efficiency performance compared to benchmarks.

By integrating communication and computation through a deep over-the-air computation (AirComp) encoder, SC-DAC is able to utilize the superposition of multiple access channels, facilitating multi-user information fusion during transmission and eliminating the need for multi-user detection at the receiver. Further, to achieve the optimal task results, the semantic encoders, decoders, and AirComp encoder are jointly optimized, where stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and deep double-Q network (DDQN) are employed to optimize the encoder/decoder parameters. The simulation results demonstrate that as the number of users increased, the performance of the system remains relatively stable and shows potential in resource utilization. What's more, when applied to the AI-based tasks such as multi-user multi-modal action recognition and semantic segmentation, SC-DAC enhances the accuracy of action recognition by 26% compared with traditional methods and by about 30%-50% compared with other multi-user semantic communication methods under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while it enhances the accuracy of semantic segmentation by 0.22 to 0.32 compared to other methods.},

However, as the frequency increases, phase noise between transceiver channels becomes more pronounced, significantly limiting the performance of THz communication systems. This paper presents a novel galaxy quadrature amplitude modulation (GQAM) design to mitigate the impact of phase noise for phase noise dominated THz communication. By adjusting the distribution of constellation points on the two-arm spiral, adaptive modulation can be achieved under different levels of phase noise. Furthermore, we designed a demodulation scheme that takes into account the impact of phase noise and developed a neighboring constellation points search algorithm to simplify the demodulation process for higher-order constellations. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed constellation can effectively overcome the impact of phase noise in various noise environments, and it outperforms other constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and spiral quadrature amplitude modulation (SQAM).},

To address this problem, we propose a joint spatial-correlation metric to assess end-to-end link characteristics, applicable for various channel reconstruction techniques, including both the classic PFS and non-Kronecker structured PFS (NKSPFS) methods. Additionally, to efficiently update time-variant probe weights and bypass time-consuming optimization in dynamic channel emulations, we propose a fast weighting method based on a closed-form solution for unknown weights, specifically tailored for the NKSPFS method. The proposed metric and probe weighting strategy are validated through simulations. The results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance the accuracy of link emulation and reduce the computational complexity for reconstructing massive MIMO channels over mmWave frequency bands.},

  abstract     = {The proliferation of vehicular networks paves the way to the future intelligent transportation system. In this paper, we propose a novel non-stationary vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wideband channel model with the aid of environment construction including in-lane cars' mobility and roadside obstacles, which can emulate the dynamic evolutionary V2V environments. Regarding the in-lane cars, they are abstracted into clusters and their mobility behaviors including acceleration/deceleration car-following and lane-changing motions, are modeled based on the Krauss model and Bézier curve, respectively. Besides, the blockage of line-of-sight (LoS) links by other cars is computed by the knife-edge diffraction theory. In terms of the roadside static obstacle clusters, their spatial positions are characterized by the Poisson point process (PPP) located within the maximal radio coverage, defined by the ellipsoid region restricted by the maximal propagation delay. The roadside cluster generation/recombination process is affected by transceivers' relative speed difference and distance-related link probability. On this basis, the dynamic evolutionary non-stationary V2V channel impulse response (CIR) is obtained and the corresponding power density profiles in the space-time-frequency domains are realized by using the signal reconstructing theory. In the simulation section, the impacts of some key parameters, like vehicular speeds and obstacle intensity factor, on the channel characteristics are sufficiently explored. Furthermore, we verify our proposal based on actual measured data from the aspects of delay spread. Our proposal provides some assistance and insights into the optimization of vehicular communication systems.},

  abstract     = {This work proposes a novel low-profile circularly polarized spring-shapedquadrifilar helical antenna (QHA) integrated on the car roof as a satellite navigation antenna to meet the practical needs of compact vehicles. The designed antenna consists of four helical radiating arms and a feed network. The antenna unit achieves low-profile characteristics mainly by folding and bending the radiating arms. Compared with the traditional QHA, the profile of the proposed antenna is reduced by 84.4%, with a height of only 13.4 mm (0.07λ). The designed feed network provides the QHA with equal amplitude and sequential 90° phase difference in the desired operating frequency band. The antenna prototype is realized by using 3D dielectric printing and post-metallization technology. The measured results show that the proposed QHA works in 1.558-1.644 GHz, fully covering the B1 band of the BeiDou satellite navigation. Typically, at 1.575 GHz, the antenna's RHCP 3-dB beamwidth is 122°, with a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) beamwidth of 144°, providing a wide signal coverage range in the upper hemisphere. The proposed spring-shaped QHA exhibits good circularly polarized radiation performance and has the advantages of low cost and low profile, which is a promising candidate to ease the antenna integration into a compact satellite navigation platform of vehicles.},

  abstract     = {The transceiver operations in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain in Zak-OTFS modulation, including DD domain filtering at the transmitter and receiver, involve twisted convolution operation. The twisted convolution operations give rise to multiple integrals in the end-to-end DD domain input-output (I/O) relation. The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and algorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive discrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse shaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three types of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx filter (referred to as ‘identical filtering’), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the Tx filter (referred to as ‘matched filtering’), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched to both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as ‘channel matched filtering’). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical filtering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in closed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate closed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived closed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for different Tx/Rx filter configurations. Our results using Vehicular-A (Veh-A) channel model with fractional DDs show that, while matched filtering achieves slightly better or almost same performance as identical filtering, channel matched filtering achieves the best performance among the three.},

  abstract     = {Nullifying/suppressing the jamming signals can be problematic when the correlation between transmitted jamming signals is deliberately varied over time, making the nullspace estimation of the jamming channel much more challenging. This is because the time-varying correlation between transmitted jamming signals causes an impact on the nullspace estimation similar to that caused by a time-varying jamming channel. Most existing interference nullification solutions only consider unchanged correlations or heuristically adapt to the time-varying correlation by continuously monitoring the residual jamming signals before updating the estimated (nullifying) beam-forming matrix for the data transmission phase. In this paper, we systematically formulate the optimization problem of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Then, to deal with the uncertainty and incomplete information caused by the jammers that deliberately vary their jamming strategy, we reformulate the problem using a partially observable semi-Markov decision process (POSMDP). We then design a deep dueling Q-learning-based framework to optimally tune the duration of the nullspace estimation and data transmission phases. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed techniques effectively deal with time-varying correlated jamming signals.},

  abstract     = {To cope with the challenges of traditional mobile edge computing (MEC), such as inflexibility and limited coverage, autonomousaerial vehicle (AAV)-MEC has been proposed as an important paradigm. However, the AAV-MEC systems are still facing the severe channel fading and obstacle blocking, which are fortunately expected to be solved by the emerging intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technique. In this paper, we propose an IRS-assisted AAV-MEC framework, where a AAV employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to offload partial computation tasks to multiple ground MEC servers connecting to access points (APs) with the assistance of IRS. The problem of maximizing computational capacity of the network is proposed by jointly optimizing the phase shift of IRS, transmit power and computation resource allocation of AAV, NOMA decoding order, and AAV trajectory. Due to the complex non-convexity of the problem, we decompose the original problem into three sub-problems based on the alternating optimization (AO) structure. To be specific, we first derive the IRS reflection phase shift by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) methods. Then, we obtain the computation and communication resource allocation by using the CCCP method. Finally, we determine the optimal AAV trajectory and decoding order by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach and the penalty-based method. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed for the AAV-MEC-NOMA framework. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The proposed algorithm is efficient and superior to other benchmark schemes in terms of increasing computational capacity; 2) The application of IRS significantly enhances the computation capability of the network; 3) The NOMA scheme outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.},

Firstly, the Cramer-Rao Bounds (CRB) for estimating the 2D-DOA and polarized parameters are derived, which provides design guideline for array geometry. As suggested by the CRB, a sparse planar EMVS array is a more appealing choice compared to the popular coprime EMVS array. Thereafter, a Parallel Factor (PARAFAC)-based weighted phase fitting algorithm is presented, designed to fully explore the aperture of the conformal array as well as capitalize on the tensorial structure inherent in array data. The proposed PARAFAC algorithm not only provides a closed-form solution for conformal arrays but also exhibits superior accuracy in 2D-DOA estimation compared to existing approaches.

  abstract     = {Industrial control scenarios impose strict requirements on wireless communication networks, especially deterministic delay. Due to limited communication resources and time-varying wireless channels, transmission delay varies randomly, resulting in high jitter. To ensure deterministic delay, we model the jitter as the variance of transmission delay and formulate delay variance minimization problems by jointly optimizing transmission power and blocklength in the finite blocklength regime. The challenge of this research is that the delay variance formula couples multiple time slots together. Two typical communication scenarios, namely, the transmit power-limited case and the transmit energy-limited case, are considered. In the power-limited scenario, we consider the maximum transmit power constraint and propose a variance recursive formula-based scheme to decouple the variance minimization problem. As for the second case, an average energy constraint is additionally considered, and a Lyapunov-based scheme is proposed. We further propose low-complexity iterative algorithms to address the above non-convex problems. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed schemes over the state-of-the-art ones in terms of reducing jitter. Furthermore, we reveal the trade-off between the average delay and delay variance, highlighting the necessity for tailored system design and reasonable resource allocation.},

  abstract     = {Uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) mainly relies on unlicensed frequency bands for communication, and its development is facing the challenge of a shortage of spectrum resources. By integrating cognitive radio (CR) technology into the UAV-assisted IIoT, unlicensed UAV users can dynamically and opportunistically access the spectrum of the primary users to transmit data. Due to the limited access time, an inevitable trade-off exists between the sensing time and achievable throughput. In UAV scenarios, spectrum sensing mainly focuses on energy detection, which has poor real-time performance and cannot meet the low latency requirements of IIoT. Therefore, we propose a distributed fast spectrum sensing method to effectively balance sensing time and throughput. In the considering cognitive UAV network (CUAVN), monitoring UAVs (MUAVs) serve as sensing nodes, responsible for collecting industrial data and opportunistically utilizing the idle spectrum resources of the terrestrial network to transmit the data to the receiving UAV (RUAV). We define a distributed sensing sphere, where the central MUAV performs grouped sequential detection, leveraging the spatial similarity of sensing results among MUAVs within the same sensing sphere to shorten the sensing time. Based on the proposed distributed fast spectrum sensing method, the formula for sensing time is derived and used to calculate the throughput. Our goal is to maximize the throughput of CUAVN by jointly optimizing the false alarm probability, MUAVs' transmit power, and RUAV's location. Simulation results show that compared with the classical sequential detection-based and energy detection-based spectrum sensing methods, the average sensing time of the proposed method is reduced by 78.53% and 88.96%, and the throughput is increased by 19.4% and 34.3%, respectively.},

However, conventional IRS channel estimations suffer from the high complexity of IRS-related channels, increasing the estimation cost due to serial processing. In this paper, we propose a novel estimation method that leverages frequency shifts to improve channel estimation efficiency, which exploits the unique characteristics of IRS-related channels, utilizing multiple reflected signals as references. We also investigate the impact of individual channels' statistical properties and the reference signal's length on channel estimation performance.

Based on these, we design a corresponding beamforming scheme at IRS to improve the achievable data transmission rate.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we investigate a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in which the dual-functional base station (BS) communicates with a multi-antenna user and detects a non-cooperative target simultaneously by transmitting joint signals containing communication information and dedicated sensing waveform. Our objective is to maximize the achievable ergodic rate within the constraints of transmit power and sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) by jointly designing the transmit covariance matrices at the BS and the transmission and reflection phase shift matrices for the STAR-RIS based on only statistical channel state information (CSI). Firstly, we prove that the dedicated sensing waveforms do not provide any additional gains from the SCNR perspective and derive the asymptotic sensing SCNR and the asymptotic achievable ergodic rate in large-system regime, based on which the optimization problem is reconstructed. Subsequently, the closed-form optimal covariance matrix for the communication signal is derived by using the modified water-filling algorithm, and the transmission and reflection phase shift matrices for the STAR-RIS are obtained through the projected gradient ascent algorithm. Finally, an alternating optimization framework is proposed to obtain the covariance matrix for the communication signal and the transmission and reflection phase shift matrices for the STAR-RIS. Numerical results are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate the performance trade-off between the achievable ergodic rate and the sensing SCNR.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel semi-supervised vectored delay-sequency selective mapping (SS-VDS-SLM) technique designed to address the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction challenge in orthogonal time sequency multiplexing (OTSM) systems. The proposed method leverages in-phase-quadrature delay-sequency symbol vectors and integrates a hybrid agglomerative hierarchical clustering with a weighted K-nearest neighbour algorithm to effectively reduce transmission computational complexity (CC) and transmission latency (TL) and enhance spectral efficiency (SE), while simultaneously mitigating out-of-band emissions (OOB). The approach ensures that the bit error rate (BER) and error vector magnitude (EVM) performance are preserved within the 3GPP doubly dispersive high-mobility delay Doppler multipath channels. Benchmark comparisons against ten contemporary PAPR reduction schemes in both OTSM, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and both of their variants including the base orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), demonstrate the superior performance of the SS-VDS-SLM technique in OTSM. Further, the proposed method offers a more effective trade-off among the PAPR, OOB, CC, TL, SE, BER, and EVM performance metrics compared to the ten considered contemporary schemes. Thus, the proposed SS-VDS-SLM technique provides a more efficient and scalable solution for reducing PAPR in high-mobility speeds of 500 km/h and 1000 km/h in real-time OTSM system applications.},

  abstract     = {Radio transmissions in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have gained significant interest for applications demanding precise device localization and trajectory estimation. This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.},

Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks are utilized to predict the nonlinear flight trajectory during high-speed flight. Moreover, we employ the generative diffusion model (GDM) to jointly optimize the beam width and signal strength, thereby reducing the number of beam switches. In addition, we design an adaptive beam reconstruction (ABR) mechanism to mitigate communication interruptions caused by prediction errors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PPBT-AR reduces the number of beam switches by 66.6% and 76.9% in low-speed and high-speed scenarios compared to the traditional phased array beam tracking algorithm, respectively.},

To cope with this challenge, we propose a deep learning based joint learned iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm with partial weight-coupling (Joint LISTA-CP) to accurately recover the channel. Specifically, by studying the characteristics of the near-field wideband channel, we employ a frequency-dependent polar domain dictionary to ensure that the sparse polar domain channel vectors across different subcarriers share a common sparse support. Then, we transform the near-field wideband channel estimation problem into a multiple measurement vector recovery problem. Utilizing the common sparsity structure of different subcarriers, we design the Joint LISTA-CP network that integrates multiple sub-networks. The proposed network employs a multidimensional shrinkage thresholding operator to guarantee the common sparse property of different subcarrier channels. In addition, we rigorously demonstrate that the Joint LISTA-CP network achieves lower recovery error. Simulation results show that the Joint LISTA-CP method enhances the estimation accuracy of the near-field wideband channels.},

Traditional methodologies relying on secrecy rate metrics prove impractical when faced with unknown eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). To tackle this issue, the concept of secrecy outage probability is introduced within IRS-assisted PLS. This paper formulates the total RF power minimization problem of multiple users in the uplink channel, considering scenarios where the eavesdropper's CSI is unknown. An alternating optimization scheme is proposed to address the problem via alternately optimizing the RF power of individual users, receiving beamforming vectors, and phase shift matrix, minimizing the total RF power while ensuring compliance with secrecy outage probability constraints. Innovative methodologies, such as manifold optimization, dynamic weighted quadratic transformation, and deep learning, are proposed to approximate optimal solutions and reduce complexity in phase shift optimization. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme markedly decreases RF power, with the DL-based approach demonstrating satisfactory performance while substantially reducing time complexity.},

  abstract     = {Recently, many sparse array configurations have been designed for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation of noncircular sources due to their capability of constructing high-performance difference-sum coarray. Nested array, coprime array, along with their improved structures are the most commonly used array configurations. Nested arrays could provide $O(R^{2})$ degrees of freedom (DOFs) with only $R$ sensors, but suffer from severe mutual coupling effect owing to closely arranged elements. Coprime arrays generally offer a lower number of DOFs than nested arrays, but are more robust to mutual coupling effect due to sparser array structure. Unfortunately, existing sparse arrays cannot possess the benefits of nested arrays and coprime arrays at the same time within the framework of difference-sum coarray. To compensate for the above shortcoming, we first analyze the nesting property for difference coarray, and generalize the nesting property to difference-sum coarray, allowing nearly half of the sensors to be removed from dense subarray. Then, a new nested configuration called thinned coprime nested array (TCNA) is proposed, whose dense subarray is a coprime structure that satisfies the aforementioned nesting property. TCNA can generate a comparable number of DOFs to nested arrays due to the nesting property between two subarrays. Meanwhile, the mutual coupling effect is greatly reduced since its dense subarray is replaced with a coprime structure, which limits the number of sensor pairs with small spacing. Therefore, TCNA is able to combine the advantages of both nested array and coprime array. Finally, simulations verify the superiority of TCNA with respect to DOF ratio, coupling leakage, and DOA estimation accuracy.},

However, existing covert communication approaches approximate communication channel models by Line-of-Sight (LoS) links, which is insufficient due to neglecting the impact of multipath effects and applying inaccurate performance assessments. To better adapt to real-world communication channel conditions, we propose a novel covert communication model assisted by Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAV) equipped with Multi-Functional Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (MF-RIS), named UMCCM. Specifically, based on a mixed link of LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), UMCCM leverages MF-RIS as a flexible relay to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and effective throughput. We first derive the mixed channel model expression. Then, we transform covert constraints from incomplete gamma functions to those linked with relative entropy and accordingly optimize the UAV transmission power and block length. Finally, the optimal flying position of the UAV is obtained by analyzing the functional properties of SNR and effective throughput under these refined constraints. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed UMCCM for enhancing SNR and effective throughput over the existing works.},

In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) unfolding network for superior and efficient DoA estimation. Specifically, the SBL framework is unfolded into a series of cascaded SBL layers, each corresponding to a hyperparameter update. Within each SBL layer, we introduce a Convolution-Transformer based source power estimation network (CTsNet) to better capture angular sparsity and generate more efficient update rule for the signal hyperparameter. Simultaneously, a convolution-based noise variance estimation network (CnNet) is proposed for accurate noise variance estimation, which controls the sharpness of the peak spectrum and affects the iterations of the signal hyperparameter. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method not only performs better than existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy and angular resolution, but also exhibits lower computational complexity compared with other SBL-based algorithms.},

In this paper, we formulate a novel beam management problem including beam footprint design, beam scheduling, and spectrum assignment. Considering the tight coupling among them, we first develop a fast beam footprint design method for earth-fixed cells, which adapts to dynamic satellite attitudes. Then, with the reformulation of objective and constraints, the primal problem is transformed into a beam scheduling and spectrum assignment problem with much smaller solution space, and an optimum algorithm is designed by combining branch-and-bound and interior point methods. Towards practical application, a more scalable graph-based heuristic algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the developed beam footprint design method can significantly reduce inter-beam interference and improve network throughput, and the proposed heuristic algorithm achieves comparable throughput but reduces execution time by two orders of magnitude compared with the optimum one. Moreover, in scenarios with 120 cells, our proposal increases network throughput by over 60$\%$ compared to the baseline based on integer recovery.},

  abstract     = {As the fundamental premise of anti-interference communication, wireless interference identification (WII) has garnered extensive research and yielded substantial results, especially for deep learning (DL)-enabled WII. However, existing studies are conducted typically under the closed-set assumption. This aspect poses a challenge in identifying the unknown interference signals under the open-set assumption. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a multi-task learning-enabled WII (MTL-WII) algorithm in antagonistic environments. Firstly, we generate the semantic feature space of known classes, calculating the semantic center vectors of each known class through multi-task learning. Secondly, we obtain the semantic feature space of the test set incorporating interference signals of known and unknown classes through the established mapping relationships. Subsequently, the signal's semantic feature vectors are classified using clustering methods to determine their category attribution. To reduce computational complexity, this paper further proposes a binarized MTL-WII algorithm (BMTL-WII). By binarizing the semantic spatial generative network in MTL-WII, both the weights and activations of the semantic spatial generative network replace the 32-bit floating-point numbers with 1-bit fixed-point numbers. Experimental results show that the MTL-WII model achieves an average identification accuracy of 95.4%, with an 89.3% accuracy for unknown interference signals. Compared to the MTL-WII algorithm, the BMTL-WII algorithm reduces the number of floating-point operations by 64.2%, and the amount of memory access is reduced by 88%, at the cost of identification accuracy decrease by only 1.8% of the binarized part of the network structure.},

  abstract     = {Effective beamforming is crucial in ultra-dense device-to-device (D2D) mmWave networks to reduce interference and optimize communication. However, current methods often struggle to balance high data rates with minimal signaling overhead, especially with imperfect channel state information (CSI). This paper introduces a machine learning-assisted beamforming design tailored for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), combining an efficient Low-Rank Adaptation Blocked LSTM Transformer with Message Passing Graph Neural Network that is called as LoRA_BLT-MPGNN. The LoRA_BLT component provides a key advantage by efficiently capturing both temporal and spatial patterns through fixed-weight updates during training and low-rank approximation for fine-tuning, significantly reducing computational complexity without sacrificing accuracy. Using historical channel data, the method implicitly captures channel characteristics and directly predicts the beamforming matrix for the subsequent time slot, minimizing signaling overhead while maximizing the achievable sum rate. Our research and simulation results show that the proposed predictive beamforming design maintains robust sensing performance and achieves a sum rate closely approaching the upper bound achievable with perfect CSI. Additionally, the incorporation of MPGNNs enables efficient modeling and learning of complex inter-node relationships, making the approach adaptable to networks of varying sizes and densities. Simulations further demonstrate that the LoRA_BLT-MPGNN model can be generalized across different network densities and coverage areas, reducing computational complexity by approximately $32\times$ in terms of Tensor Floating Point Operations (TFLOPs) compared to conventional methods while maintaining high performance.},

  abstract     = {In New Radio Unlicensed (NR-U) networks, spectrum resources are shared to ensure quality of service. However, the proliferation of wireless devices and the near-full allocation of sub-6 GHz frequency bands have imposed significant challenges on spectrum access conflicts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution to address the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) issues for cognitive users in heterogeneous spectrum environments. However, existing RL algorithms typically require a large number of iterations to achieve convergence, causing spectrum resource wastage before being converged. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a fast-convergence, induced dynamic spectrum access method based on an accelerated Q-Learning model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This approach aims to ensure convergence while simultaneously reduce the number of required iterations. Firstly, an online learning model, built on LSTM, is employed to predict the probability of spectrum state by exploiting the temporal patterns inherent in spectrum usage. Then, the prediction outcomes are subsequently used as induction factors for the spectrum access process. Finally, the induction factors are integrated with a Q-Learning model to construct a novel joint Q-value strategy matrix. After fewer iterations of spectrum access, an optimal access strategy is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster convergence rate than existing Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms, and reduces the number of iterations by 50% and 80%, respectively. Additionally, compared to the general Q-Learning algorithm, the proposed method demonstrates higher stability in terms of available network capacity.},

  abstract     = {AI integrated Communication is envisaged as one of the novel usage scenarios in IMT-2030, which calls for embedding AI into network edge to offer ubiquitous intelligent services. Meanwhile, federated learning (FL) is an appealing technology for edge intelligence due to its advantages on distributed training and privacy preserving. However, FL suffers from several limitations when being executed in wireless networks, such as high communication overhead, low deployment flexibility, and the lack of analytical performance characterization. To overcome such challenges, we propose a multi-autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-enabled over-the-air federated learning system, where devices sense data samples for local training, and exchange model-updates with AAVs employing analog transmission scheme. Under this scheme, we first conduct convergence analysis to characterize the influence of sensing sample size, downlink broadcasting distortions, and uplink aggregation errors on the FL performance with a closed-form expression. Subsequently, a joint sensing, communication, and computation (JSCC) design problem is established to boost the FL performance among different AAVs, under the constraints of training completion time and network resource budget. We then tackle the origin intractable problem by alternatively optimizing downlink power control, uplink transceiver design, AAV deployment, and sensing batch size. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our JSCC design compared to conventional approaches, and the effectiveness of adaptively allocating network resources across different FL rounds in suppressing the model updating errors.},

This system simultaneously detects and tracks target when transmitting communication information to downlink users. However, in the presence of hostile eavesdropping devices, the communication transmission security of ISAC system cannot be guaranteed. We have considered two common deployment scenarios: deployment of eavesdropper within the main lobe (DEML) and deployment of eavesdropper within the side lobes (DESL). In DEML scenario, the sensing target is considered as eavesdropper, we introduce cooperative jamming (CJ) device to disrupt the eavesdropper and ensure the transmission security. Through a combination of traversal search and a series of semidefinite relaxation methods, we optimize the covariance matrices of the transmission signal and CJ signal, ensuring both sensing and communication performance requirements while enhancing the overall system secrecy rate. In DESL scenario, we mainly focus on the situation where the eavesdropper is located on the transmission channel between the ISAC system and the user, the intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) is proposed to enhance the ISAC system communication security. We employ a combined approach of alternating optimization and fractional programming to jointly solve for the covariance matrix of the transmission signal and the reflection phase shift matrix, optimizing the system's secrecy rate. The numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms under both deployment scenarios and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods. The results demonstrate that the designs of both CJ and IRS under the two deployment scenarios significantly enhance the system's secure communication rate, and the IRS scheme can provide higher performance gains, which is attributed to the IRS's rational utilization of energy losses in other directions.},

  abstract     = {Due to the high maneuverability and low observability of small autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs), monostatic radar is not robust for AAV probing in practice due to its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain and low accuracy. In this case, AAV probing using netted radar has become a trend that has the advantages of increasing detection probability and tracking accuracy. However, in the traditional multistatic radar tracking algorithm, the signal processing of each station is performed independently in the data domain, and the measurement and tracking are separated, resulting in low tracking accuracy and poor SNR robustness. In this regard, a signal domain integrated accurate measurement and tracking method for a wideband netted radar is proposed. To address the issue of wideband information utilization, the algorithm constructs the motion dynamic model of netted radar space-time coupling for motion initialization. It introduces the reference signal without information loss and jointly estimates the range and azimuth errors based on a Bayesian posterior model in the signal domain. The framework of integrated accurate measurement and tracking is constructed in the signal domain to realize the information transfer and sharing of measurement and tracking, thereby improving the utilization of target information. Based on the consideration of netted radar, we derive the signal-domain collaborative tracking filter to fuse and filter the multi-source information, realizing high-precision and robust tracking. Simulated and real-measured experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional monostatic/multistatic tracking method regarding tracking accuracy and robustness to noise.},

  abstract     = {Point cloud registration plays a pivotal role in LiDAR-based vehicle localization, as its robustness and accuracy directly affect map quality and localization precision. The 3D Normal Distributions Transform (3D-NDT) is a competitive algorithm that performs well in noisy and dynamic environments. However, its effectiveness is limited by local feature blurring caused by voxelization. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved 3D-NDT registration method that incorporates normal vector segmentation and refined voxelization techniques to improve registration accuracy and matching range. The process begins with plane point cloud clustering for initial voxel partitioning, followed by subdivision to ensure uniform voxel cell sizes, enabling appropriate weighting in the objective function. A dual-stage voxel division strategy is employed to first broaden the matching scope and then refine the registration precision. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the median translation error by 50% (from 1.0 × 10−3 m to 0.5 × 10−3 m) and the median rotation error by 50% (from 0.01° to 0.005°), compared to the original 3D-NDT. Additionally, it significantly improves robustness and accuracy, doubling the effective translation range (from 1.2 m to 2.4 m) and increasing the rotation range by 25.6% (from 39° to 49°).},

In this scenario, battery management systems (BMS) become crucial in EVs to ensure battery safety, reliability, and efficiency. Recently, data-driven estimation techniques have been proposed to estimate battery-related metrics, such as remaining capacity or aging condition. These techniques emerged as an answer to batteries' intrinsic variability, but they rely primarily on full charge/discharge cycles, overlooking the nuances of partial charging, which is prevalent in real-world usage. This paper presents a novel BMS architecture for EVs, leveraging digital twin technology and data-driven modeling to address these challenges. The proposed dynamic dual-model approach seamlessly integrates real-time monitoring with cloud-based analytics to continuously evaluate and predict battery capacity degradation. Key innovations include sophisticated feature engineering and segmentation strategies, which enable precise state of health (SoH) estimation across a wide range of driving conditions. Additionally, the architecture incorporates a dynamically retraining State of Charge/Energy (SoC/SoE) model that adapts to battery aging, thereby maintaining high accuracy throughout the battery's life cycle.

  abstract     = {As the standard communication protocol for vehicular networks, the Controller Area Network (CAN) plays a crucial role in coordinating interactions among Electronic Control Units (ECUs). However, intruders can launch malicious attacks on the CAN due to the lack of security mechanisms. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as a defense component, are deployed to monitor the CAN and detect suspicious behavior resulting from an attack. Existing IDSs have high false alarms in complex attacks due to limited feature modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose a multi-knowledge fusion-based anomaly detection system, called MKF-ADS. Specifically, the method designs a prediction-based framework that integrates a spatial-temporal correlation module with an attention mechanism (STcAM) and a patch-based sparse transformer (PatchST) module. The fine-pruned STcAM applies one-dimensional convolution (Conv1D) to extract spatial features and subsequently employs the Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) to capture temporal features, with an attention mechanism that focuses on important time steps. Meanwhile, the PatchST captures contextual features from independent univariate time series. Finally, the proposed model uses STcAM as a student model to learn intrinsic knowledge and cross-imitate PatchST's competencies through knowledge distillation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MKF-ADS is lightweight and effectively performs anomaly prediction and detection across six attack scenarios. Compared to the baseline, the proposed method is more robust, achieving a high F1-score while maintaining controllable false alarms.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating incoming signals' direction of arrival (DoA) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems when the number of reflectors exceeds that of the sensors. Existing methods, such as co-prime and nested arrays, address this limitation by increasing the degree of freedom (DoF) using expanded antenna array geometries. However, these methods introduce practical challenges, including increased array size and added system complexity and cost due to the additional receiver (Rx) front-end modules and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) units required for each antenna element. The proposed method overcomes these limitations and enables the detection of more targets than sensors without necessitating hardware modifications by using a standard uniform linear array (ULA) and enhancing the DoF entirely at the signal processing stage. The proposed method integrates the capabilities of the 2D multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm with the 2D forward-backward spatial smoothing (FBSS) technique to surpass the theoretical limit of the minimum angular resolution. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive simulations and real-world measurements. Comparative evaluations against popular DoA estimation techniques further underscore its practical advantages and robustness.},

Specifically, a novel recursive nonlinear discrete-time sliding surface is developed by utilizing the fast terminal sliding surfaces and principles of high-order sliding mode (HOSM). Compared with previous methods, the proposed hierarchical two-layer discrete-time sliding surface has the capability to suppress the chattering and reduce the tracking error. Then, in order to further improve the system convergence dynamics, the improved exponential reaching law and disturbance estimator are also employed. Rigorous theoretical analysis proves that the quasi-sliding mode (QSM) exists and the tracking error is reduced.

To meet the requirements of eMBB and URLLC, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is integrated with network slicing to create multiple logical slices while sharing the same physical resources. NOMA technology enables massive connectivity by allowing multiple users to transmit simultaneously over the same time-frequency resources. To ensure E2E latency, the deterministic network calculus theory is exploited to investigate the maximum delay boundary of V2X communication. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures ultra-low latency in an Urban Macro city scenario, even in the presence of multiple user interference, while meeting eMBB bandwidth requirements.},

  abstract     = {Cross-Eye Jamming (CEJ), a coherent electronic attack technique, is designed to disrupt the tracking systems of monopulse radars via angular glint phenomena induced by two or more coherent jamming sources, thereby impairing the radar's ability to track real targets. This paper proposes a computationally efficient Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL)-based algorithm to counteract the coherent CEJ signals for collocated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems with arbitrary subarray configurations. First, the intrinsic capability of SBL to resolve coherent signal sources is exploited to distinguish CEJ signals. Second, two strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency: A sparse uniform linear array fitting (SULAF) technique is employed to approximate a virtual uniform linear array steering vector within the mainlobe region of arbitrary subarrays, leading to a linear SBL (LSBL) method that reduces the dimensionality of the input data and constructs a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz (TBT) covariance matrix. By leveraging the structural properties of the TBT matrix, a Gohberg-Semencul (GS)-type factorization technique is integrated to accelerate the LSBL algorithm, termed GS-LSBL, which eliminate the need for large-scale covariance matrix inversion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed GS-LSBL algorithm effectively identifies coherent CEJ signals while significantly reducing computational complexity. Moreover, the algorithm adapts to arbitrary subarray configurations.},

Using the estimation results of the filters for extended systems, a distributed consistency control protocol is designed for the intelligent connected vehicle platoon system, which calculates the gain coefficient of each intelligent connected vehicle to achieve consistency control through system dimension extension and linear matrix inequalities. In addition, drawing on the framework of the dedicated observer scheme, a sensor fault detection and isolation method was designed for the intelligent connected vehicle platoon system based on the zero-trust architecture.

This paper presents a Data-Efficient Iterative Learning-based (DEIL) method for integrated speed planning and control, specifically designed for heavy-duty vehicle platoons. The proposed approach formulates the problem as a finite-horizon constrained optimization, that incorporates both a terminal energy cost and a time-domain-guided terminal safe constraint set. Unlike conventional optimization methods that rely on a one-time pre-planned reference speed, the DEIL leverages historical vehicle states and energy consumption data from previous iterations to approximate the terminal cost and constraint set, enabling closed-loop, data-efficient iterative learning. The approximated terminal energy cost decreases monotonically and converges, facilitating the derivation of an energy-optimal control strategy within a limited number of iterations. Moreover, the method integrates trajectory planning and tracking control without requiring predefined reference profiles. To improve computational efficiency, a dynamic programming (DP) strategy is employed to generate the initial feasible trajectory. Comparative analysis validates the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing energy-optimal trajectories and control strategies for heavy vehicle platooning.},

This paper proposes a smart HSR strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), referred to as DRL-S-HSR, designed to improve traffic efficiency in freeway merging areas within a connected environment. We propose the relevant assumptions and specific implementation rules for scenarios involving hard shoulder running in merging areas, along with the lane-changing motivations and safety conditions for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) when temporarily using the hard shoulder. Furthermore, we also propose a vehicle collision avoidance method in merging areas based on the ECR-DQN algorithm, to avoid conflicts between vehicles on the hard shoulder and those on the on-ramp. A three-lane freeway in China is used as a case study. The study analyzes the overall traffic impact in terms of travel time, congestion patterns, carbon emissions, and driving comfort. Two key traffic conditions are also tested, including different CAV penetration rates and ramp inflows. The results show that the DRL-S-HSR strategy significantly alleviates traffic congestion on the freeway mainline under medium to high-density traffic flow conditions. In terms of carbon emissions, exhaust emissions throughout the entire traffic scenario are greatly reduced. Additionally, this strategy improves the driving comfort of merging areas. Overall, the proposed strategy demonstrates significant control effect and good applicability when the CAV penetration rate is between 10% and 20%, and the ramp inflow is less than 600 veh/h, providing a reference for future traffic management measures.},

In this paper, we investigate the secrecy capacity of the V2V-VLC system based on an empirical model of the multiple-lane V2V-VLC configuration. The study considers the variations in the received optical power at positions that emulate the trajectories of vehicles obtained from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) initiative of the Federal Highway Administration in the USA. In addition, we investigate the secrecy pressure that forecasts the probability of the eavesdropper (Eve) presence at certain positions around the legitimate receiver (Bob). Closed-form expressions of the lower and upper bounds on the secrecy capacity and secrecy pressure are derived and evaluated based on the measurements. The results confirm the inherent security characteristics of dynamic V2V-VLC systems using headlights as transmitters because the channel conditions between the transmitter (Alice) and Bob which differs from the conditions between Alice and Eve. The position-dependent channel conditions result in varying secrecy capacities across different lanes and relative positions of Bob and Eve to Alice.

  abstract     = {3D object detection play a pivotal role in various applications, such as autonomous driving and environmental perception. However, the challenging task of detecting targets (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) in 3D point clouds obtained from LiDAR sensors is hindered by two primary factors. Firstly, point clouds are non-Euclidean data and lack rigid data properties. Secondly, these point clouds are sparse and deficient in semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for 3D object detection. The proposed approach involves two stages. Specifically, we first present an innovative fusion technique that combines images and point clouds using transformers. This technique enhances the integration of semantic and geometric features while accurately mapping points to pixels without relying on camera extrinsic parameters. Additionally, a multi-level graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture is further introduced for object detection. This architecture effectively handles the non-Euclidean characteristics of point clouds while achieving precise object identification within them. A comprehensive series of experiments on the KITTl and nuScenes datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

First, fuzzy logic systems are used to approximate unknown nonlinear dynamics. Then, using an artificial potential field method, potential function with continuous partial derivative is designed and integrated into a resilient distributed formation estimator. A novel collision avoidance resilient distributed formation estimator is proposed to ensure the existence of the first-order derivative of estimator states and achieve collision-free between USVs. Meanwhile, a simple prescribed performance function is designed to ensure transient and steady-state formation performances of underactuated USVs. Subsequently, combining dynamic surface control and adaptive technology, an adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm is proposed to deal with intermittent actuator faults. It is shown that the designed controller can steer formation tracking errors into a residual set of predefined accuracy within a preassigned settling time while avoiding collision between USVs, and ensure all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a simulation example confirms the effectiveness of the presented theory and approach.},

However, achieving robust tracking with this minimal configuration is highly challenging, as the follower's camera often fails to detect the leader due to two key issues that are often overlooked in existing research. First, the limited field-of-view (FOV) of the camera frequently allows the leader to move out of sight. Second, visual detection faults—including obstacle occlusion, lighting variations, depth image failures, and false detections caused by similar objects—complicate reliable tracking. To address these challenges, we propose a novel visual formation tracking scheme. Our approach allows the follower robot to maintain continuous tracking of the leader within its constrained FOV in the absence of visual faults, even without access to the leader's depth or velocity. When visual faults occur, the system swiftly diagnoses the fault type and resumes tracking accordingly. Our method leverages formation kinematics to enhance efficiency and reduce computation while requiring only an onboard camera, and its effectiveness is validated through simulations and real-world experiments.},

It is worth noting that each car-following model possesses its own strengths and weaknesses depending on specific driving scenarios. Therefore, we propose EnsembleFollower, a closed-loop hierarchical planning framework for achieving human-like autonomous car-following. The EnsembleFollower framework involves a high-level Reinforcement Learning-based agent responsible for judiciously managing multiple low-level models (such as Intelligent Driver Model and Gipps model) according to the current state, either by selecting an appropriate car-following model to perform an action or by allocating different weights across all primitive models. Moreover, we propose a jerk-constrained kinematic model for more convincing microscopic traffic simulations. We evaluate the proposed method based on real-world driving data from the HighD dataset. The experimental results illustrate that EnsembleFollower yields an improved accuracy of human-like behavior and achieves effectiveness in combining hybrid models, demonstrating that our proposed framework can handle diverse driving conditions by leveraging the strengths of various car-following models.},

  abstract     = {In the field of robot navigation, grid-based maps are primarily leveraged in systems operating in complex terrain. However, the efficiency of the path search module in these maps is generally low due to the numerous conditions, e.g., climbing and tilting angles, that need to be checked among grids, hindering the real-time performance and stability. In addition, the discontinuity of grid-based maps also impedes the implementation of the path optimization module, significantly reducing the quality of the optimized path. Although the curved surface can be used to relieve the aforementioned two issues, the actual terrain surface is variable and cannot be represented by a binary function. Furthermore, the presence of vertical obstacles can intensify these challenges. To this end, we propose a stable robot navigation system in complex terrain on a hybrid map (HMRNS-CT). A hybrid map, incorporating a grid map, is utilized to extract vertical obstacles through variance analysis. And an adaptive curved surface quadtree map is further employed to fit the rest area. Therefore, in the path search module, the climbing and tilting angle can be checked once only on the fitted curved surface. And a proposed path optimization algorithm can also be adopted to further improve the smoothness and reduce the height change of the path by minimizing a cost function rather than finding the shortest path. A series of simulations and experiments in real-world environments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of HMRNS-CT.},

Traditional methods rely on either standalone Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs), often suffering from limited coverage, intermittent connectivity, and inefficient energy management. Recent works have explored UAV-UGV collaboration to enhance surveillance and communication; however, they lack dynamic communication optimization and energy-efficient coordination. To address these gaps, we propose a novel cooperative framework integrating UAVs equipped with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and UGVs for real-time monitoring. Unlike prior approaches, our system optimizes UAV flight paths and recharging schedules using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) while refining UGV patrol routes with a Genetic Algorithm (GA), ensuring adaptive and continuous surveillance. Additionally, we employ Differential Evolution (DE) for RIS configuration, enhancing data transmission and mitigating urban signal degradation. UAVs further support UGVs by wirelessly recharging them via energy beamforming, reducing dependency on fixed charging stations. By leveraging AI-driven coordination, RIS-assisted communication, and real-time energy optimization, our framework ensures seamless data transmission, reduces latency, and maximizes energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves communication reliability, monitoring coverage, and energy consumption compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for next-generation urban monitoring.},

Building upon the Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT) idea, this work proposes an improved FRIT method and deploys it in autopilots of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). By introducing a novel data-driven cost based on mixed sensitivity design, the proposed FRIT method can handle multivariable loops with possible couplings among the various loops, which is a key aspect of autopilot architectures. The proposed FRIT does not require any a priori knowledge about the vehicle dynamics: it suffices to collect data during vehicle operation and exploit the available knowledge of autopilot control loops to perform a one-shot experiment to tune the control gains. Notably, our tests show that, even in the case that the control parameters are obtained using data collected in nominal operation, the corresponding controllers perform good also in non-nominal uncertain scenarios involving load changes or wind disturbances. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach is further validated via comparisons with standard FRIT methods and with a set of state-of-the-art control parameter tuning methods.},

  abstract     = {Accurate and efficient trajectory prediction of surrounding vehicles is critical for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving systems. Relying solely on historical trajectory information is insufficient to accurately predict, especially in complex traffic scenarios with interwoven roads. Therefore, predicting future trajectories requires consideration not only of the historical trajectories of vehicles but also of the interaction among various entities of the environmental context. However, existing prediction methods suffer from expensive rendering costs and entity information loss, unnecessary complexity and redundant computation, and all-to-all interaction modeling and high computational costs, facing the challenge of the trade-off of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose the SGC-Informer-based deep learning framework for fast and accurate trajectory prediction, called FESIG. Specifically, a comprehensive explicit entity vectorized representation is constructed based on Feature Engineering for the agent's trajectories and High-Definition (HD) map information, avoiding expensive rendering costs and entity information loss. Then, to mitigate excess complexity, we introduce the Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) network to effectively extract the local feature of each entity, which can remove the nonlinear transformation of the information propagation. Additionally, the Informer mechanism is employed to automatically sort and select the entities in the scenario, and then capture the complex interactions between the target vehicle and these entities that significantly impact it, thereby reducing computation costs. Experiments performed on the Argoverse forecasting dataset illustrate that the FESIG achieves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the vehicle trajectory prediction task compared with the existing methods.},

As a burgeoning area of research, the scalability and optimization of consensus mechanisms for these networks are critical.

In response, we introduce a two-tiered consensus framework that refines PBFT for the specific context of vehicular networks. By organizing nodes into clusters based on geographic proximity, our approach reduces messaging complexity from $O(n^{2})$ to $O(n^{1.5})$, significantly improving scalability. The framework distinguishes between local and global state transitions, adding two phases to the PBFT protocol to manage these efficiently. This tailored consensus process aligns with the localized communication patterns of vehicular networks, enhancing both efficiency and scalability. The framework addresses the critical challenges of traditional BFT algorithms in vehicular networks, offering a solution that is both scalable and resilient. It is a step toward enabling vehicular networks to fulfil their potential as a reliable component of modern distributed systems.},

  abstract     = {The trajectory prediction information of human-driven vehicles (HDVs) is imperative for the platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic flow. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of HDVs, prediction errors are inevitable and time-varying, which results in inefficient control actions and even safety issues. To address the problem, we propose a virtual leader-follower platooning strategy to deal with time-varying prediction uncertainties. The controlled platoon tracks the efficient trajectory planned by the virtual leader to avoid unnecessary control inputs and improve speed smoothness. The challenges mainly lie in the modeling of time-varying prediction uncertainties and the design of control strategy for the virtual leader. First, a second-order moment based ambiguity set is employed to describe the distributional uncertainties of trajectory prediction, with parameters identified and updated by the Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) to adapt to the time-varying environments. Further, a distributionally robust model predictive control (DR-MPC) method for the virtual leader is designed, where conditional value-at-risk constraint is adopted to achieve flexible tracking. By exploiting constraint tightening technology, the efficient solution of the DR-MPC problem is obtained.

  abstract     = {As an effective solution to address road congestion and improve traffic efficiency, vehicle platooning has received a lot of attention in recent years. However, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication latency can largely impact on the performance of vehicle platooning, which has not been well investigated. Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), as one of the promising technologies for 6G, holds great potential for application in vehicle platooning to reduce the communication latency and thereby enhance platoon control performance. Motivated by the above considerations, platoon control and communication latency are jointly considered in this paper. We first introduce the communication latency into the vehicle dynamics model, and then derive a distributed model predictive control (DMPC)-based platoon control model. To reduce the communication latency, uplink RSMA is introduced for inter-platoon V2V communication. Since the latency minimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly, we first employ a bisection method to give a latency upper bound and transform the initial problem into a non-convex feasibility problems in each iteration. Subsequently, through theoretical derivation, the bandwidth allocation factor is expressed in terms of transmission power, which reduces the number of optimization variables and transforms the problem into a convex problem. Then we can obtain the optimal solution by solving a convex problem in each iteration. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA significantly outperforms traditional frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and can significantly reduce communication latency, enhance platoon control safety, improve driving comfort, and lower the performance requirement on vehicle maximum torque.},

  abstract     = {Cooperative path planning is gaining its importance due to the increasing demand on using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for complex missions. This work addresses the problem by introducing a new algorithm named MultiRRT that extends the rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) to generate paths for a group of UAVs to reach multiple goal locations at the same time. We first derive the dynamics constraint of the UAV and include it in the problem formulation. MultiRRT is then developed, taking into account the cooperative requirements and safe constraints during its path-searching process. The algorithm features two new mechanisms, node reduction and Bezier interpolation, to ensure the feasibility and optimality of the paths generated. Importantly, the interpolated paths are proven to meet the safety and dynamics constraints imposed by obstacles and the UAVs. A number of simulations, comparisons, and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results show that MultiRRT can generate collision-free paths for multiple UAVs to reach their goals with better scores in path length and smoothness metrics than state-of-the-art RRT variants including Theta-RRT, FN-RRT, RRT*, and RRT*-Smart. The generated paths are also tested in practical flights with real UAVs to evaluate their validity for cooperative tasks.},

  abstract     = {The combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) is widely applied for many ground transportation applications thanks to its accurate and continuous navigation service. However, with the advent of the multipath effect and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals caused by obstacles in urban environments, the quality of raw GNSS measurements is heavily degraded, leading to unexpected integration solutions. For this, an improved voting-based robust estimator (VBRE) algorithm assisted by the INS-derived measurement redundancy, is proposed for reasonable evaluation of satellite observation information, ensuring reliable integrated GNSS/INS solutions. The introduction of the generalized observation model allows the direct involvement of the short-term accurate INS-derived resolution in monitoring faulty GNSS measurements. Inspired by the voting theory, a residual-based collective decision framework is developed, where a group of INS-associated voters evaluates traversally each satellite observation candidate by the distance measure calculation and the agreement indicator mapping. Based on this, to determine the final GNSS measurement contribution, the detailed voter implementation is formulated with key steps including rejecting abnormal indicators, median voting, and multiple voting cycles. The above behaviors facilitate the rationality and fairness of each GNSS measurement weight allocation for integrated navigation. The proposed algorithm has been validated on two challenging open-source vehicular integration datasets in hybrid urban areas of Tokyo, Japan. The resultant 3D accuracy regarding position and velocity of Dataset I is around 60% higher than that of the Kalman filter and outperforms other existing methods. Similar performances are also achieved on more challenging Dataset II, with improvement reaching 80%.Meanwhile, this proposed algorithm presents remarkable flexibility against the various abrupt GNSS faults caused by different harsh urban areas.},

Then, a novel distributed data-driven CHV platoon coordination control method is designed using a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The convergence speed and accuracy of the control algorithm are enhanced by approximating and predicting the time-varying parameter pseudo gradient (PG) that characterizes the input-output relationship estimation. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm ensures individual vehicles' internal stability and the platoon system's string stability when subjected to DoS attacks. Finally, a group of virtual simulation control experiments compares the tracking control effects of the CHV platoon under different algorithms in the presence of the same DoS attack, verifying the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed DDDSC control method.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the vulnerabilities of vehicular networks from an attacker's perspective is crucial for identifying stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks and developing robust defense methods. This paper investigates stealthy FDI attacks in multi-channel vehicular communication systems. We construct a multi-source state estimation system using a sequential Kalman filter to integrate and estimate redundant state information transmitted by preceding vehicles across multiple channels. To enhance the system's resilience against FDI attacks, we incorporate a Sage-Husa adaptive filter and a chi-squared detector, which dynamically estimate and detect channel noise based on estimation errors. Within this framework, we utilize real-time state information and channel transmission residual to determine the probability of an attack window occurring. The attack process is divided into three phases, during which critical noise disturbances are introduced to create attack windows, allowing the attack to progressively align with the target state. Based on this analysis, we develop an optimization model for attack generation with complete channel information (AG-with-CCI) to facilitate a white-box attack. Additionally, acknowledging that attackers may not have access to real-time information from all channels, we analyze the iterative equations of state estimation errors and residuals to establish the conditions under which stealthy FDI attacks can be successfully executed, enabling the attack generation with attacked channel information (AG-with-ACI) to achieve a gray-box attack. Numerical simulations demonstrate that both attack methods can evade current detection mechanisms and achieve their intended objectives.},

  abstract     = {Camera sensors are widely used to perceive traffic environments, understand traffic condition, and help avoid accidents. Since most sensors are limited by line-of-sight, the perception data from vehicles can be uploaded and shared through the edge server. To reduce bandwidth, storage and processing cost, we propose an edge-assisted camera selection system that selects only necessary camera images for sharing. The selection process is based on camera metadata which describes each cameras' coverage in terms of locations, orientations, and fields of view. Different from existing work, our metadata-based approach can detect and locate occlusions by leveraging depth sensors, and then precisely and quickly calculate the actual camera coverage and identify the coverage overlap. Based on camera metadata, we study a camera selection problem that aims to select a limited number cameras to maximize total coverage, and solve it with an efficient algorithm. To further reduce bandwidth consumption, we first introduce similarity-based redundancy suppression and sector-based selection techniques. We then propose a Redundancy-Aware Sector Selection algorithm, which incorporates image redundancy into the sector selection process to improve bandwidth efficiency. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our algorithms can effectively maximize coverage with bandwidth constraint.},

  abstract     = {With the development of intelligent vehicles, the importance of imitating, learning, and optimizing human driving strategies is increasingly recognized. Offline reinforcement learning offers a promising approach, capable of directly extracting driving strategies from diverse real-world datasets, particularly in critical vehicle safety systems, where it provides advantages in interpretability and transferability. We propose a personalized car-following strategy framework based on a one-dimensional convolutional variational autoencoder (conVAE) and mildly conservative Q-learning (MCQ). The conVAE extracts subtle feature differences among drivers, classifying their driving styles as the foundation for strategy imitation. Additionally, an uncertainty prediction model for the preceding vehicle's behavior is established. By integrating the conVAE model, a personalized reward function is designed, accounting for both safety and comfort and considering the long-term impact of the preceding vehicle's behavior to imitate human-like driving strategies. Finally, the MCQ method optimizes the personalized conVAE strategy, allowing for appropriate exploration beyond the dataset, improving model generalization, and surpassing human performance. Tests on the HighD dataset demonstrate the proposed strategy's superiority in imitating human driver behavior in gap selection, speed variation, and acceleration adjustments. Validation on real-world datasets further confirms its generalization ability and performance, comparable to or better than human drivers.},

Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of map-free multi-agent trajectory prediction and proposes a Query-based Spatial and Temporal Interaction (QSTI) model. QSTI initially encodes the historical information of agents as queries. To make the model aware of both spatial and temporal information, spatial queries are learned by our proposed progressive cross-attention encoder, and temporal queries are learned by our proposed flatten self-attention encoder. Spatial queries and temporal queries are then fed into a graph convolution network and transformer network to learn the spatial-temporal interactions among agents, obtaining the interacted queries to perform multi-agent trajectory prediction. Experiments on the Argoverse 1, Argoverse 2, highD and rounD datasets show that QSTI achieves the highest performance compared to SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) map-free methods, and even outperforms some map-based methods on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmark datasets. In addition, our model also exhibits a faster inference speed than many models.},

Based on sliding mode theory, a solution to heterogeneous FTC problems with asymmetric velocity constraints only using the relative position and orientation of leader (tracking target) is given, without requiring the leader's linear and angular velocities. It is noteworthy that by collaborative selection of parameters in control protocols proposed in this paper, the upper and lower bounds of the linear and angular velocities associated with fixed-wing UAVs and nonholonomic UGVs can be made nearly identical to those of the leader. Consequently, the feasibility set of leader's motion can be greatly expanded. Unlike existing linearization methods related to heterogeneous formation, the solution proposed in this paper does not suffer from singularity issues. The closed-loop stability of fixed-wing UAVs and nonholonomic UGVs under the proposed control protocols is proven by Lyapunov theory.

However, there exists little research on RIS channel measurements, which are important for the communication system design. In this paper, channel measurements are carried out in anechoic chamber, outdoor, and indoor environments. For anechoic chamber measurements, the insertion loss, EM response reciprocity, and received power are analyzed. It is found that RIS can fulfill EM response reciprocity. It is also found that the performance of RIS beamforming in the coplane configuration is better than that in the non-coplane configuration. In outdoor measurements, the cumulative distribution functions of large-scale parameters (LSPs) are obtained to explore the relationship between LSPs and heights. Results show that the RIS-user equipment channel is more sensitive to the height variation than the base station-RIS channel. For indoor measurements, the angular power spectral density, spatial cross-correlation function, and channel capacity are investigated. It is found that RIS with near-field coding and a larger size can bring a higher gain than RIS with far-field coding and a smaller size. The normalized power and code differences between near-field and far-field coding are defined to verify the RIS Rayleigh distance. It can be found that the value of the theoretical RIS Rayleigh distance is almost the same as the distance where the defined normalized differences become zero.},
