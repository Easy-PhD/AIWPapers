  abstract     = {Cardiac muscle contraction is driven by the cross-bridge cycle, where myosin heads generate force by cyclically attaching to and pulling on actin filaments using energy from ATP. Modeling this process is central to understanding cardiac sarcomere mechanics. In this study, we developed supervised machine learning (ML) models using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to simulate cross-bridge cycling and muscle behavior under isosarcometric, isometric, and isotonic conditions. Trained on synthetic data, the ANN captured nonlinear dependencies among calcium concentration, stiffness, sarcomere length, temperature, and force output. Error analysis through histograms and unity-line scatterplots validated prediction accuracy and identified underfitting and overfitting patterns. Comparisons across ANN architectures showed how hidden layer complexity affects model generalization. The present deep learning models accurately reproduced key physiological behaviors, including steady-state force–Ca 2+ relations, sarcomere length changes, and force–velocity relations, and matched theoretical results. This work demonstrates the potential of ML tools to enhance cardiac muscle modeling and exploit existing experimental datasets for improved prediction of cardiac muscle diseases.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) possess size/shape/surface-tunable optical and electronic properties, making them promising building blocks for optoelectronic applications. However, the fluorescence intermittency, also known as “blinking,” observed in individual QDs is a pervasive phenomenon. The dark state (trion state) in blinking experiences non-radiative recombination processes, such as trap-mediated recombination and Auger–Meitner recombination, which significantly diminish the quantum efficiency of the QDs. Despite efforts to mitigate blinking phenomena through chemical engineering of QDs structures and their environments, blinking continues to impede the application of single QDs, particularly in single photon sources. This study demonstrates that Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from green QDs (donor) to individual red QDs (acceptor) can effectively suppress fluorescence intermittency. The findings indicate that FRET facilitates the removal of excess charges from the charged state (dark state, trion state), allowing the QDs to transition from the lower quantum yield trion state to the higher quantum yield single-exciton state (bright state). Our research confirms that FRET can inhibit fluorescence intermittency by deactivating the charged state.},

In this study, we examine a two-mode cavity optomechanical system ( ⁠ J a ̂ † a ̂ † b + J a ̂ a ̂ b ̂ † ⁠ ) and a two-photon parametric drive ε p ( a ̂ † a ̂ † + a ̂ a ̂ ) ⁠ . When the detunings significantly exceed the dissipation rates of the cavity ( ⁠ | Δ a | , | Δ b | ≫ κ ⁠ ), the optimal condition for PB becomes independent of the coupling strength. This implies that photon antibunching effects can occur in both strong and weak regimes ( ⁠ J > κ and J < κ ⁠ ), even when J ∼ κ ⁠ , and we could achieve PB solely through the adjustment of detunings. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to the conversion between single photon and three photons ( ⁠ J a ̂ † 3 b + J a ̂ 3 b ̂ † ⁠ ) with a three-photon parametric drive ε p ( a ̂ † 3 + a ̂ 3 ) and arrive at nearly identical conclusions.

Here, we present the development of a high-frequency balanced photodetector with near-unity quantum efficiency, realized with off-the-shelf components. The detector operates in balanced mode up to approximately 500 MHz, above which the differential frequency response limits its performance. To obtain high sensitivity above 500 MHz, the detector can be efficiently used in an unbalanced homodyne detection scheme. We employ our detector in this unbalanced mode to measure a squeezing comb up to 6.4 GHz, achieving a squeezing level of up to 10.7 dB. By sharing our experience, specifically in identifying the unequal frequency response as a limiting factor, we aim to enable and advance further developments in the field.},

  abstract     = {AgBiS 2 , a typical I–V–VI 2 compound, has attracted widespread attention in the thermoelectric community due to its inherently ultra-low-thermal conductivity. However, its practical applications are limited by inferior electrical transport properties. Herein, we systematically investigate the origin of its low lattice thermal conductivity and propose effective strategies to enhance its thermoelectric performance. Theoretical calculations reveal that the intrinsic ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity of AgBiS 2 arises from multiple phonon transport features, including low-lying optical branches, rattler-like local vibration, and low phonon group velocity. Combining theoretical and experimental analyses, it is found that cation disorder suppresses cation doping effects, whereas anion doping, especially with Cl doping, is more effective in optimizing electrical performance. Furthermore, introducing additional Cu, unaffected by cation disorder, not only generates extra electrons to optimize electrical transport but also reduces thermal conductivity. Notably, Cu-doped sample achieves a significantly improved power factor of ∼3.64 μ W cm −1 K −2 at 823 K, with a maximum ZT of ∼0.53, a ∼22% enhancement compared to the pristine AgBiS 2 . This study not only uncovers the ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity mechanisms but also validates synergistic strategies to optimize thermoelectric properties, positioning AgBiS 2 -based materials as promising candidates for thermoelectrics.},

By adjusting the phase relationship between the pistons from leading to lagging, the prototype overcomes the limitation of compressor performance imposed by temperature, enabling a heating supply temperature exceeding 200 °C. Meanwhile, benefiting from the inherent configuration of the double-acting design, the four-cylinder arrangement further enhances the system's power density, thereby improving its suitability for industrial heating applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a substantial temperature lift from 25 to 166 °C, and within a temperature difference of 74 °C (from 45 to 119 °C), it attains a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of 1.68. When the ambient temperature rises to 67 °C, the system delivers a heating supply temperature of 214 °C, with the corresponding COP and relative Carnot efficiency reaching 1.5% and 45.2%, respectively. These findings verify the potential of this system for high-temperature heat pump applications and highlight its advantages under extreme operating conditions. This work thus provides a solution for industrial high-temperature heat pumps, offering unique benefits in achieving large temperature lifts and high-temperature heating.},

The optimal concentration of Hf doping atoms was obtained by controlling the power of dual targets InZnO and HfO 2 and comparing their performances with those of HfInZnO TFTs that were fabricated from a single target, thus achieving high-performance and highly stable HfInZnO TFTs. After optimization, high-performance HfInZnO (P IZO 70W-P HfO2 50W) TFTs with μ FE value of 26.1 cm 2 /V s, SS value of 0.251 V/dec., and V th value of 0.7 V were obtained. The results of experimental characterization indicate that co-sputtering with Hf doping reduced the oxygen vacancies, surface defects, and other trap densities of the device. Moreover, the co-sputtering prepared HfInZnO TFT exhibited the highest stability for small V th shifts of 0.8 (−0.9) and 1.2 (−1.6) V under the gate bias and light illumination stress tests. Furthermore, low-frequency noise measurements demonstrated that the optimal Hf doping concentration in the HfInZnO films was controlled by the dual-target co-sputtering method, resulting in a lower number of oxygen vacancies and a lower interface trap density of the devices, thus enhancing the stability of HfInZnO TFTs.

  abstract     = {The performance of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) has advanced rapidly; however, the development of suitable hole transport layers (HTLs) for PeLEDs remains a critical challenge. This study introduces a multifunctional HTL of poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,4′-(N-(4-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy]phenyl)diphenylamine))] (TFTEG), which features a backbone similar to that of the commercial hole transport material poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-alt-(4,4′-(N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)diphenylamine))] (TFB), while its side chain is modified to include multiple ether groups. Theoretical calculations and experimental characterizations demonstrate that TFTEG not only significantly enhances hole injection but also effectively passivates uncoordinated Pb 2+ defects at the buried interface through Lewis acid–base interactions. This substantially improves the photoluminescence and electroluminescence (EL) quantum yields of perovskite quantum dots (QDs). Pure-red quantum-dot PeLEDs that employ TFTEG as the HTL achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 9.67%, which signifies a substantial enhancement over the 4.56% efficiency observed in control devices utilizing the commercial TFB HTL. Furthermore, TFTEG contributes to a reduced turn-on voltage, enhanced brightness (1741 vs 888 cd m −2 ), and a stable EL spectrum peaking at 650 nm.

  abstract     = {Integrating sensing and neuromorphic functions within a single low-power platform remains a key challenge in optoelectronic device design. We report a dual-modal perovskite photodetector by incorporating YbCl 3 as a dopant, which simultaneously achieves neuromorphic behavior and conventional optoelectronic properties. Systematic characterizations of doping manipulation reveal that 0.5% YbCl 3 can optimally modulate film crystallinity, enhance carrier transport, and tune charge dynamics. Notably, the 0.5% doped device exhibited distinct wavelength-dependent photoresponse, and hallmarks of depression-like neuromorphic behavior are were observed under pulsed 905 nm light excitation. This behavior is clearly supported by negative photoconductivity, gradual baseline modulation, and a prolonged post-illumination tail. However, these adaptive current dynamics are absent under 635 nm light illumination; the device instead demonstrated enhanced photoresponse, with responsivity increasing from 0.45 to 0.73 A/W and detectivity from 1.4 × 10 12 to 5.1 × 10 12 Jones. This spectral contrast originates from the wavelength-dependent activation of Yb 3+ -related trap states, confirmed by photoluminance measurements. These findings position YbCl 3 doping as a versatile strategy for advancing perovskite photodetectors toward dual-modal photodetection, with ongoing studies exploring broader applicability.},

  abstract     = {Topological quantum materials featuring multifold band crossings have opened unprecedented pathways in the exploration of exotic matter phases. These multifold crossings with three-, six-, and eightfold degeneracies hold exceptional significance, as they are ruled out in high-energy frameworks by Poincaré symmetry, making their realization in solids highly nontrivial. Notably, the coexistence of higher-fold fermionic (eightfold) and bosonic (sixfold) degeneracies in a single material is scarcely observed in literature. In this regard, we conducted a detailed investigation into the symmetry-protected topological characteristics of experimentally synthesized A15-type M 3 Sn (M = V, Nb) compounds using first-principles calculations. Our scrutiny unveils sixfold degeneracies in M 3 Sn compounds, which corresponds to the maximum allowed in bosonic systems along with threefold nodal points, while an eightfold and fourfold fermionic degeneracy are identified in V 3 Sn compound at the R- high-symmetry point protected by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. The phonon and electronic surface states calculated from a tight-binding model further validate the multifold degeneracies and also represent complementary Dirac surface states at the Γ -point. The phononic Weyl nodal line along the Γ – R path exhibits nontrivial topology with ±π Berry phase. The synthesized compounds have been confirmed to theoretically exhibit both dynamic and thermal stabilities. Our findings offer a promising platform to explore exotic excitations within a single material, paving the way for deeper insights into complex quasiparticle behavior in these potential superconductors.},

By combining spectral heat current decomposition and spectral energy density analysis, we identify high-frequency optical phonons within 10–15 THz as the dominant heat carriers across interfaces—a selectivity arising from interfacial hydrogen termination that strengthens the coupling of these modes. Their lifetimes and coupling strengths are highly sensitive to structural configuration and mechanical modulation. Our results reveal that parallel stacking, increased pressure, and stronger interlayer coupling significantly enhance thermal conductivity by stabilizing optical modes and suppressing phonon scattering. In contrast, increasing the twist angle introduces structural incommensurability, which reduces phonon lifetimes and leads to substantial suppression of thermal transport. These findings underscore the pivotal role of optical phonons in governing interfacial thermal transport as well as establish an optimal strategy for engineering thermal conductivity in 2D vdW materials.},

We show that Be 1− x Mg x O alloys maintain structural stability in the wurtzite phase up to x = 0.83 and exhibit an ultrawide bandgap over 6.2 eV across all compositions, which provides high intrinsic breakdown fields (12–71 MV/cm).

Our results show that the incorporation of CeO 2 into BaTiO 3 matrix induces chemical and structural heterogeneity, which effectively suppresses hysteresis, achieving a large energy storage density U e of ∼37.6 J/cm 3 and a high efficiency η of ∼80% for 0.7BT-0.3C films grown on Nb-SrTiO 3 (001) substrates.

  abstract     = {Among magnetic thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), L 1 0 -ordered FePt has attracted significant attention because of its exceptionally strong PMA. However, the microscopic origin of its strong PMA has not been elucidated experimentally. We have investigated the contribution of the Fe 3 d electrons to its magnetic anisotropy energy by angle-dependent x-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe L 2 , 3 edge. By this technique, one can deduce the magnetic dipole moment m T ⁠ , which represents the anisotropic spatial distribution of spin-polarized electrons, and the orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) of Fe 3 d electrons. Detected finite m T indicates that the spin-polarized Fe 3 d electrons are distributed preferentially in the out-of-plane direction of the films. This m T of Fe overwhelms the positive contribution of OMA to PMA and reduces the PMA of L 1 0 -ordered FePt thin films, consistent with a previous first-principles calculation. The present result implies that a large positive contribution of the non-magnetic element Pt rather than Fe governs the PMA of L 1 0 -ordered FePt thin films.},

Recently, fully compensated ferrimagnet of 2D zero-net-magnetization magnets has already attracted attention, as it can exhibit global spin-splitting, magneto-optical response, and the anomalous Hall effect [Liu et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 , 116703 (2025)]. Therefore, it is very important to provide experimentally feasible strategies and materials to achieve fully compensated ferrimagnets. Here, we use the experimentally synthesized A-type PT -antiferromagnet [the joint symmetry ( PT ) of space inversion symmetry ( P ) and time-reversal symmetry ( T )] MnSe as the parent material to induce fully compensated ferrimagnetism through an out-of-plane electric field. This electric field can remove the P symmetry of the lattice, thereby breaking the PT symmetry and inducing spin-splitting. When considering spin–orbital coupling, MnSe with an out-of-plane magnetization can achieve the anomalous valley Hall effect. In addition, we also discuss inducing fully compensated ferromagnetism via Se vacancies and Janus engineering. Our works can promote the further development of 2D fully compensated ferrimagnets both theoretically and experimentally.},

Despite its known effects, the role of 4f-electron lanthanide oxides in influencing interfacial phenomena has remained largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate the potential of f-electron lanthanide oxides, particularly at the Pt/DyO x interface, to enhance SOT. The gradient oxidation structure of the 4f-electron rare-earth oxide DyO x was confirmed through ultra-high-precision line scanning electron energy loss spectroscopy. By employing spin–torque ferromagnetic resonance, we achieve an extraordinary SOT efficiency of ξ FMR = 0.758 in the Pt/DyO x heterojunction, exceeding that of pure Pt by more than a factor of ten. This enhancement reduces the critical current density required for magnetization switching to 2.25–3.48 × 10 6 A·cm −2 , which is only 15% of the current density needed for pure Pt. Beyond improving SOT efficiency, the integration of 4f rare-earth oxides at the interface provides an advanced technical pathway for developing CMOS-compatible and energy-efficient spintronic technologies.},

  abstract     = {Nanoelectromechanical systems based on (Al,Ga)As/GaAs heterostructures with a two-dimensional electron gas can rely on both piezoelectric and electrostatic driving and detection. While this multifunctionality may be beneficial, disentanglement of these two physical mechanisms is important. In a multi-mode nanoelectromechanical system, we experimentally discern the electrostatic and piezoelectric effects in various configurations. A well-controlled system relying entirely on the electrostatic effect is demonstrated, where a field-effect transistor reads out the oscillations of its cantilevered side gate. We show that, apart from the two mentioned mechanisms, an additional time-delayed driving force arises due to the generation of bulk acoustic waves in the entire chip.},

An expression is obtained for the SAW gain G as a function of the frequency and intensity of microwaves, the electron drift velocity, and the parameters of the considered graphene/piezoelectric substrate hybrid structure. Our calculations show that in the presence of microwave radiation incident normally on the graphene layer and polarized along the direction of SAW propagation, the SAW gain G , measured in units of dB/cm, can be several times greater than in the presence of only an applied dc electric field causing electron drift. The results obtained indicate an effective way to improve the performance of ultra-compact graphene-based SAW amplifiers.},

  abstract     = {Group II–VI semiconductors, renowned for their direct band gaps, high carrier mobilities, and mature synthesis, are essential in optoelectronic applications. While scaling down to the two-dimensional (2D) limit could unlock enhanced and distinct functionalities, realizing stable intrinsic 2D phases remains challenging due to their nonlayered bulk structures, strong interlayer covalency, and high ionicity. Here, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that II–VI compounds adopt stable 2D configurations distinct from both graphene-like sheets and bulk fragments. The most stable phases identified include tetragonal–triangle, double-layer honeycomb, planar honeycomb, and a non-conventional bilayer. Despite being isoelectronic, these compounds exhibit markedly different energetic landscapes. We propose that this diversity originates from a dual competing mechanism: the geometric stability imparted by favorable building blocks vs the long-range Coulomb interactions. Several predicted structures exhibit excellent electronic properties, with computed mobilities exceeding 29 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 in CdS, highlighting their potential for nanoelectronic applications. Our findings provide both a structural design rule and a set of experimentally accessible targets, offering a pathway toward integrating II–VI semiconductors into the 2D material landscape.},

  abstract     = {Oxygen vacancies (V O ) are intrinsic defects in β -Ga 2 O 3 that significantly impact its device performance. These vacancies can donate electrons to the conduction band, leading to unintentional n-type conductivity in as-grown β -Ga 2 O 3 . In addition, V O associated localized states can act as electron traps, scatter free carriers, and consequently degrade carrier mobility and overall device performance. Therefore, removing V O is crucial for improving material properties, promoting the development of p-type β -Ga 2 O 3 and optimizing device performance. Currently, traditional methods for V O treatment, such as oxygen plasma treatment and thermal annealing, are effective but have high energy consumption, which is detrimental to carbon neutrality goals. This study presents a method for enhancing the removal of V O via hydrogen doping. β -Ga 2 O 3 thin films were grown under low-oxygen conditions using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition, followed by hydrogen pre-annealing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence characterizations of films treated under different annealing conditions confirmed the effectiveness of hydrogen doping in promoting V O elimination. Furthermore, ultraviolet photodetectors were fabricated using these films, and the analysis of their dark-state decay times provided additional evidence for reduced V O concentrations. Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory using a revised PBE functional and the climbing image nudged elastic band method reveal that hydrogen incorporation induces charge redistribution, facilitating VO migration, thus enhancing defect control.},

In this work, the surface and bulk states in CsPbBr 3 single crystals were investigated by polarization-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. Onefold anisotropy of SHG intensity indicates that the polycrystalline Cs 4 PbBr 6 and CsPb 2 Br 5 phases dominate the surface, which exhibits C s symmetry. Moreover, an unpolarized and strong luminescence was observed induced by two-photon absorption, which displays a twofold symmetry. Br vacancies within the bulk were identified as the radiative recombination centers according to their energy level position.

Notably, piezoresponse force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy characterizations demonstrate stabilized polarization with a low decay exponent of 0.014.

However, challenges including imbalanced charge injection and defect-related nonradiative recombination at the interface, particularly at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface, hinder the development of efficient PeLEDs. This investigation systematically evaluates the effect of various dipolar molecules on the HTL/perovskite interface, aiming to enhance the efficiency of blue PeLEDs. The results indicate that the hole injection barrier of devices modified with diethyl difluoromethanephosphonate (DFMP) was significantly reduced due to the high polarity of DFMP, which maintains a balanced hole–electron mobility. Furthermore, the electron-rich P=O bond in DFMP effectively coordinates with the unsaturated Pb 2+ at the buried interface to passivate defects that contribute to radiative recombination. As a result, the DFMP-modified PeLEDs achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 9.8% at 480 nm and a prolonged operational lifetime. The study paves the way for interfacial molecular buffer layers to interface modulation in quasi-2D PeLEDs.},

  abstract     = {The use of periodic materials for wave control and signal processing has been a focus of intensive research over the past two decades and continues to garner significant attention. Common signal processing mechanisms like switches and rectifiers often depend on magnetic fields and/or logic gates for their activation. We propose a metamaterial that enables the control of mechanical waves—surface acoustic waves—through an ON–OFF mechanism that switches the propagation of the waves through a tunable platform of elastic beams. In the OFF configuration, the beams remain in their undeformed state and resonate at a specific frequency range, creating a bandgap that stops wave propagation. Conversely, in the ON configuration, the beams undergo buckling, redistributing the vibration energy across multiple modes and eliminating the bandgap, thus allowing wave propagation. Analytical and numerical findings demonstrate the significant potential of this mechanism for controlling wave propagation in nonlinear periodic materials.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals metal–semiconductor junctions (MSJs) with low-resistance contacts have great potential for designing high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, due to the quantum confinement effect, 2D metals exhibit layer-dependent conductivity that inevitably influences the contact properties of 2D MSJs, the underlying mechanism behind this effect is unclear. Herein, taking multilayer graphene and MoS 2 as examples, we systematically studied the effect of 2D metal layer number on the MSJs by non-equilibrium Green's function and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods. Compared with the trilayer-graphene/MoS 2 (Gr/MoS 2 ) MSJ (5.0 × 10 4 KΩ µm), the contact resistance of the monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ (7.6 × 10 3 KΩ µm) is reduced by one order of magnitude. Under a 0.6 V bias voltage, the reduced contact resistance results in the current increasing from 0.1 to 60 nA. The superior transport performance of monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ derives from the reduction in the Schottky barrier of the MSJ as the number of graphene layers decreases, whereas the tunneling barrier remains nearly constant. Meanwhile, monolayer-Gr/MoS 2 MSJ exhibits high photogenerated carrier gain, which is attributed to the ultrafast transfer (388 fs) of photogenerated electrons and long carrier lifetime (71 ns), resulting in superior optoelectronic performance. Our study presents a layer-number engineering strategy for optimizing contact properties in 2D MSJs.},

  abstract     = {Silicon crystallizes in the diamond structure with two atoms per unit cell and supports three optical phonon modes. However, due to the centrosymmetric nature of the lattice, these modes do not induce a net dipole moment and are therefore inactive in infrared absorption. Even in polar semiconductors, where optical phonons can be IR-active, conventional techniques such as infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy are restricted to probing phonons at the Brillouin zone center (Γ-point). In this work, we demonstrate that time- and spectrally resolved pump–probe ellipsometry enables access to the coherent response of electron–phonon coupled states involving both valence and conduction bands. Following two-photon absorption induced by the femtosecond pump pulse, the electronic excitation relaxes and drives the generation of coherent longitudinal optical phonons along the X-direction of the Brillouin zone, followed by optical transitions of entangled electron–phonon states along the Λ-direction. This process results in a transient, strongly correlated electron–phonon state that persists for up to ≈ 300 fs. Within this coherent time window, the silicon crystal exhibits optical resonances at electronic transition energies modulated by quantized phonon contributions. Finally, we detect further sidebands in the ellipsometric spectrum, which are 81 meV apart and assign these to two-phonon-assisted electronic transitions.},

A reconfigurable grating unit based on a Bragg-grating-assisted Mach–Zehnder interferometer (GAMZI) is proposed as a versatile building block for programmable photonics. By integrating identical Bragg gratings into both arms of a thermo-optically tunable MZI, the device enables dynamic spectral reshaping—achieving bandwidth-tunable bandpass filters, phase-shifted gratings, and broadband filters with precise control over extinction ratios and bandwidths. The GAMZI architecture uniquely suppresses back-reflections while maintaining high port scalability, overcoming key limitations of conventional grating designs. Furthermore, a double-triangle recurrent network array using cascaded GAMZI units is demonstrated, enabling advanced functionalities such as ring-grating resonators, sampled gratings, and on-chip coarse wavelength division multiplexing.

  abstract     = {Biosensing plays a crucial role in precision biomarker detection, enabling real-time monitoring and physiological health analysis, particularly in early diagnosis. Traditional biosensing techniques, such as electrochemical, fluorescence, and colorimetric methods, have shown remarkable performance. However, their reliability is often susceptible to nonspecific interference, may produce false-positive results, and is typically limited to the detection of known targets, restricting their applicability in addressing ambiguous or unknown biological problems. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) offers a powerful alternative, combining ultra-high sensitivity and molecular specificity. By supporting both label-free and label-based strategies, SERS broadens the detection scope, making it a promising platform for next-generation biosensing. In this Perspective, we aim at specific problems, introduce why SERS can do biosensing, how to advance SERS-based biosensing, and what SERS can do for early diagnosis. Finally, we discuss strategies to bridge the gap between laboratory research and clinical applications, emphasizing the important role of standardization and artificial intelligence in driving the practical transformation of SERS-based biosensing. Through these advancements, we aim to address existing limitations and further propel the evolution of SERS in biosensing and early diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.},

To bridge this gap, we theoretically model and experimentally measure topologically protected disclination states in C 4 , C 5 , and C 7 -symmetric thermal crystalline lattices composed of aluminum disks. The temperature evolution is tied to an effective Hamiltonian hosting topological disclination modes, which have a diffusion rate that is robust against defects. Our findings extend topological disclination phases and the physics of fractional charges from Hermitian to anti-Hermitian systems, opening new avenues for future research in thermal information processing and temperature management processes that are robust against disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) has recently celebrated 30 years of existence when counting from the original patent of 1994. In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.},

Here, inter-dots/molecular excitonic and intra-dots/molecular electron-vibration couplings are employed to potentially explore the mechanism of aggregation-caused quenching and AIE of CQDs. In addition, the CQDs with AIE feature are classified into two categories, the CQDs possessing intrinsic AIE properties (AIE-CQDs) and the exogenous CQDs (endowed-AIE-CQDs). The detailed research progress on both types is also summarized. Furthermore, the documented applications of AIE-CQDs and endowed-AIE-CQDs in biomedical imaging, chemical analysis, and solid-state lighting are summarized based on their enhanced fluorescence and redshifted emission wavelengths upon aggregation.},

Although significant advances in optical microscopy have realized super-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratios, and high-speed imaging, these methods frequently require high-intensity illumination, potentially inducing photodamage and photobleaching in biological samples. Quantum-twinned photons, characterized by their unique properties of quantum entanglement, quantum correlation, and quantum interference at the single photon level, present transformative solutions to these limitations. Several imaging modalities have been developed that utilize quantum-twinned photons, encompassing quantum correlation imaging, quantum entanglement imaging, and quantum interference imaging. These techniques exhibit quantum-enhanced imaging capabilities that markedly outperform classical methods, with diverse applications in cellular, tissue, and organism imaging. Centered on this theme, here we present a comprehensive review of quantum biological imaging leveraging the three pivotal quantum properties of quantum-twinned photons.

Although they are currently playing crucial roles in applications such as mobile communication, space-to-ground communication, and the Internet of Thing, there are significantly stringent and challenging requirements demanded for their rapid and successful applications. Compared with conventionally adopted low-temperature co-fired ceramics, integrated passive device filters, and dielectric filters, acoustic wave filters have been regarded as the competitive choice, mainly attributed to their wide bandwidth, small size, and low insertion loss. This paper reviews the advances and outlines future perspectives of high frequency acoustic wave devices for RF communication, focusing on several critical issues including bandwidth, roll-off, frequency, power-handling, insertion loss, out-of-band rejection, tunability, and size/package. It is focused mainly on the extreme performance breakthroughs of RF acoustic wave filter, e.g., how to achieve acoustic devices with operating frequency above 8 GHz, bandwidth around 1 GHz, and quality factor exceeding 2000. Various principles, strategies, and technologies for achieving the superior performance of super-high frequency RF filters are discussed, e.g., applying advanced materials such as scandium-doped AlN or single crystals of AlN and LiNbO 3 , creating new topology structures such as hybrid filters, and generating new types of vibration modes of acoustic waves.},

A key hallmark is the strengthening of attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature, a feature often attributed to entropy changes from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here we present an alternative framework based on surface phase behavior, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated effective potential between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water (mW) model, the Simple Point Charge Extended water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model which incorporates a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and proximity to vapor–liquid coexistence. The model reproduces the effective potential across diverse solute sizes, degrees of hydrophobicity, and thermodynamic states. Our simulations recover the inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity, showing it arises generically from rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell.},

The device exhibits excellent memristive performance, with a high switching ratio (∼10 5 ), stable endurance (>10 4 cycles), and rapid switching speeds (turn-on/turn-off times of ∼23/21 µ s). Symmetric threshold voltages (±2 V) and low resistance variability highlight its reliability. Integrated into an oscillatory neuron circuit (R–C configuration), the memristor emulates spiking dynamics, demonstrating tunable frequency and energy efficiency (∼832 nJ/spike). Furthermore, the circuit successfully replicates biological motion detection and sound localization by processing spatiotemporal input differences, mimicking direction-selective ganglion cells and medial superior olive neurons. These results validate the memristor’s potential for bio-inspired sensory systems, offering a scalable, energy-efficient platform for neuromorphic computing and artificial perception.},

The model is applied in the context of all-optical resonant magnetization switching in two-dimensional magnetic materials, particularly reproducing the experimental findings for reverse magnetization by all-optical means for a monolayer CrI 3 .

  abstract     = {Understanding and predicting hydrogen adsorption energy is key to designing effective electrocatalysts. In this study, we develop a physically interpretable descriptor within a framework that decomposes atomic hydrogen adsorption energy into intuitive contributions, applied to 22 group IV and III–V 2D honeycomb materials. The density functional theory (DFT) calculated adsorption energy is decomposed into two components: bond energy, approximated by the integrated crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP), and the energy cost of forming the additional bond, termed distortion energy E d . This decomposition facilitates analysis of adsorption trends beyond treating adsorption energy as a single quantity. We find that ICOHP correlates strongly with the adsorption site electronegativity ( R 2 = 0.86), improving to R 2 = 0.91 when electronegativity differences and structural parameters are included. E d shows moderate correlation with the unrelaxed vacancy energy E vac ( R 2 = 0.60) and can be accurately modeled ( R 2 = 0.92) using similar dependences on electronegativity and structural parameters. Notably, E vac can be expressed in terms of the sum of electronegativities, enabling a DFT-free formulation. Combining both components into an E ads descriptor, we achieve an R 2 score of 0.82 across both group IV and III–V systems. Further analysis reveals that increasing the adsorption site electronegativity weakens adsorption unless the lattice constant is sufficiently large. In addition, we identify a linear relationship between ICOHP and the zero-point energy change, allowing the descriptor to be extended to the free energy of hydrogen adsorption, a key indicator of hydrogen evolution reaction activity.},

In this study, we systematically investigate FeN 4 , CoN 4 , and NiN 4 active sites coordinated with a broad range of axial ligands to elucidate how ligand environments influence reaction energetics across different metal centers. Free energy analyses reveal that axial ligands can substantially modify key steps in the ORR pathway, including *OOH formation and *OH desorption, with distinct effects observed for each metal. FeN 4 exhibits tunable activity and selectivity depending on the ligand, balancing between 4 e − and 2 e − pathways. CoN 4 shows a pronounced preference toward the 2 e − pathway under specific ligand environments, highlighting its potential for selective H 2 O 2 production. In contrast, NiN 4 displays generally high energy barriers and limited ORR activity across all axial ligands. These results establish a comparative framework for understanding how axial ligand coordination governs ORR performance and provide guidance for the rational design of M–N–C SACs with tailored activity and selectivity.},

In this study, we aim to provide insight into which FH order to choose, in what temperature range the FH corrections are reliable, and whether they can be applied outside of equilibrium. We study argon, neon, hydrogen, and helium using accurate ab initio interaction potentials combined with FH corrections up to 14th order. By comparing to full quantum mechanical calculations, we find that the second virial coefficient is predicted within 2% with first-order FH corrections at temperatures above ≈ 10 K for argon and neon, and within 10% above 23 K for hydrogen. At cryogenic temperatures, first-order FH corrections offer a significant improvement compared to classical interaction potentials. Increasing to second-order FH corrections yields a small improvement in the case of neon and helium, while higher-order corrections give systematically less accurate predictions. At sufficiently low temperatures, the accuracy of the FH corrections deteriorates rapidly due to the increasingly relevant impact of the discretization of energy states when the thermal energy is small compared to the energy gaps between bound dimer states. By comparing to full quantum mechanical calculations, we show that FH corrections decrease the accuracy in the prediction of transport properties at infinite dilution. This shows that the qualitative picture of “quantum swelling” only applies when considering a large number of particles and not for binary collision dynamics.},

In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion–convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.},

  abstract     = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and storage using ionic liquids (ILs) is a promising research area within the broader issue of greenhouse-gas emissions and climate change. Here, we conducted a systematic molecular dynamics study to identify structural features that optimize CO 2 solubility in ILs. A total of 24 ILs, based on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium cations with varying alkyl chain lengths and paired with six different anions, were examined. Simulations were performed at 300 K and 1 atm, across 0%, 10%, and 30% CO 2 mole fractions. The void probability distribution functions revealed remarkable morphological similarities among the systems, with a strong correlation between the anion molar volume and the total number of voids in the liquid. The void network topology showed that spherical anions such as [BF 4 ] − and [PF 6 ] − promote narrow-channel connectivity, while bulkier anions significantly modify the interstitial network connecting the voids. Radial distribution functions highlighted that CO 2 is preferentially located near polar domains, particularly around anions, with minimal disruption to the overall packing. These localized perturbations in the IL structure were more pronounced for smaller anions, which are more tightly coordinated with the cations. Interaction energy analysis revealed that extending the cation alkyl chains does not enhance CO 2 solubility in molar terms, as the gas interacts mainly with polar regions. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of dispersion interactions in CO 2 uptake and suggest that ILs incorporating soft, bulky anions may be promising candidates for carbon capture, offering a balance between increased free volume near the polar domains and manageable viscosity.},

There still exist controversies over the lowest energy structure of OgF 4 . In this work, the CCSD(T) method with spin–orbit coupling (SOC) is employed for determining geometries, harmonic frequencies, and dissociation energies of these heavy and superheavy rare gas fluorides. Our results show that the lowest-energy structure for XF 2 is D ∞h and that for XF 4 is D 4h . In addition, a T d structure emerges for OgF 4 with SOC, lying about 2 kcal/mol above the D 4h structure. Moreover, a C 2v structure appears in scalar-relativistic calculations for XF 2 and XeF 4 ; however, the C 2v structure for OgF 2 vanishes when SOC is included. SOC increases both bond lengths and dissociation energies of these molecules and is essential for describing properties of RnF n and OgF n accurately. Furthermore, an atom-in-molecule (AIM) analysis program is developed to analyze electron densities of these systems with SOC. AIM and Mulliken population analyses reveal that the X–F bond exhibits a mixed ionic-covalent character. SOC diminishes the covalent character in these molecules, particularly for RnF n and OgF n , and relatively larger covalent character is observed in XF 4 than that in XF 2 .},

The rate coefficients at relatively low temperatures (<4000 K) are obtained by integrating the derived cross section model, and an accurate prediction of the vibrationally relaxation time of N 2 is achieved by solving the corresponding master equations. It is found that the rate coefficient from the first vibrational excited state to the ground state can be accurately fitted by a second-order Arrhenius formula, and below 2000 K, the vibrational relaxation times calculated by the two-state method are consistent with those of the full vibrational ladder method (Landau–Teller formula and the e-folding method).

  abstract     = {Microwave and millimeter-wave rotational spectra of 46 thiophene isotopologues are used to determine a new semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structure for thiophene. The large dataset of isotopologues—roughly twice as large as any dataset used for a semi-experimental equilibrium structure determination for a molecule of this size—and the broad frequency coverage enable a detailed investigation concerning previously reported discrepancies between the structural parameters of the r e SE and r e structures of thiophene. The observation of rotational spectra for 23 new thiophene- d x isotopologues, many with additional 34 S or 13 C substitution at natural abundance, is made possible by the high sensitivity of the PARIS FTMW spectrometer in the microwave frequency region. Frequency coverage for thiophene and single heavy-atom isotopologues in the millimeter-wave region has been expanded to include the range of 82–750 GHz. Bond distances and bond angles of the new highly precise and accurate r e SE structure are determined with precisions of ≤0.0002 Å and ≤0.02°, respectively. This study provides strong evidence that the discrepancies can be addressed only by improvements to the theoretical r e structure and that the precision and accuracy of the semi-experimental equilibrium ( r e SE ) structural parameters are approaching the limit of structure determination.},

Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior, and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ( F = 0.5), Poissonian ( F = 1), and super-Poissonian ( F > 1) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ( F ≫ 1) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.},

Numerical experiments show that for a system of 1600 interacting identical bosons in a harmonic trap, using a single GPU and a single CPU, it only takes two hours to achieve satisfactory simulation accuracy. With the increase in the number of identical particles, the advantage of GPU acceleration over CPU becomes more obvious, making it possible to simulate tens of thousands of identical particles from first principles using a single GPU. Our study shows that GPU acceleration can lay a solid foundation for the wide application of PIMD simulations for large-scale identical particle quantum systems with more than 10 000 particles in the presence of two-body interaction. Numerical experiments show that a 24 GB GPU can simulate up to 20 000 identical particles from first principles, and the GPU acceleration leads to a roughly linear relationship between the computation time and the number of identical particles. In addition, we have also successfully implemented simulations for fictitious identical particle thermodynamics using GPU to overcome the fermion sign problem, which makes it promising to efficiently and accurately simulate tens of thousands of fermions based on GPU when the recently proposed ξ -extrapolation method holds.},

While prior studies predominantly focus on end-to-end looping, interior loop formation is more relevant in vivo . Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the kinetics of interior loop formation in confined flexible polymers with specific internal segments having attractive interactions, focusing on the effect of tail length ( l t ) and spatial confinement. The probability distribution function of the distance between attractive beads forming the interior loop, P ( r a ), and the corresponding free energy profile, F ( r a ), exhibit a bimodal structure due to the coexistence of two distinct conformational states: a compact folded state and an unlooped relaxed configuration. We observe a non-monotonic dependence of the looping probability ( P l ) and looping time ( T l ) on l t under strong confinement. We identify the optimal combination of the cavity size and the tail length that leads to maximizing the looping time T l and minimizing the looping probability P l . In addition, the interior loop dynamics for distinct loop lengths ( l l ) of a fixed polymer chain ( L ) showcase that T l changes rapidly with the addition of the first few monomers and then plateaus as the tail grows, which is exactly verified with analytical results. The observed coexistence of looped and extended states is a hallmark of intermediate ɛ , disappearing for weak or strong attractions, highlighting the tunability of looping dynamics via interaction strength.},

A classic example is the spatial patterning of Min proteins in bacteria, where pole-to-pole oscillations of these patterns guide symmetric cell division. To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the formation and transition of spatial patterns in the Min protein system, we applied nonequilibrium landscape–flux theory combined with the mode expansion method. By quantifying and visualizing the potential landscape in mode space, we identified distinct stable spatial patterns as potential wells, providing a global perspective on the system’s stability. Moreover, we revealed that nonequilibrium flux acts as the driving force for spatial pattern switching with increasing cell length or molecular detachment rates. Peaks in the average flux and entropy production rate near phase boundaries highlight significant changes in dynamical nature and thermodynamic cost during critical transitions, offering deeper insights into the physical mechanisms underlying spatial pattern transitions. These findings not only underscore how spatial landscape topography and flux dynamics collectively govern the formation, stability, and switching of protein patterns but also establish a powerful framework for linking nonequilibrium physical mechanisms to biological functions. Furthermore, this framework holds potential applications, such as the detection of early warning signals for cell division.},

Understanding and actively controlling the packing of these PGNPs is of significant fundamental interest for the interfacial behavior of nanoparticles and of interest in soft matter physics. Here, we investigate the packing of Janus-like homopolymer-grafted nanoparticles at fluid–fluid interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling methods. For bare nanoparticles at interfaces, where enthalpic interactions dominate, interface-mediated attractions drive nanoparticle aggregation. This results in locally ordered hexagonal clusters with high average order parameters. As the packing fraction increases, the system evolves from small, locally hexagonal aggregates to a globally ordered hexagonal phase (path I). This pathway contrasts sharply with the behavior of purely repulsive particles in two dimensions, which undergo an entropy-driven, sharp disorder-to-order transition (path II). For Janus-like PGNPs at interfaces, the packing behavior is governed by the competition between two factors: (i) interface-mediated attractive interactions (enthalpic contribution) and (ii) steric repulsion between grafted polymer chains (entropic contribution). Increasing either grafting density or grafted chain lengths enhances the entropic contribution and repulsive interactions, causing a shift in the dominant packing mechanism from enthalpy-driven (path I) to entropy-driven (path II). This competition induces a transition between ordering pathways. Notably, at a chain length of N = 15 and grafting number Z = 8, the entropic effects completely suppress hexagonal ordering. We attribute this suppression to the significant interface deformation by the PGNPs, which maximizes the system’s entropy by disrupting the close-packing structure. Our study provides novel insights into the interfacial packing of PGNPs and reveals how competition between enthalpy and entropy drives transitions between distinct ordering pathways.},

The fluid–wall molecular interactions, coupled with concentration gradients, generate flows in the potential regions where the interactions are effective, thereby driving global flows in the bulk. Fluid velocities in narrow potential regions obtained from simulations are quantitatively compared with predictions from continuum theory that accounts for density and viscosity variations. While continuum theory adequately predicts enhanced flow velocities throughout the channel, it does not fully capture flow behaviors in regions of very low fluid density near the wall, revealing its limitations. Friction between the fluid and the wall can be controlled by temperature. As temperature decreases, friction is reduced, which makes the wall surface more slippery. In addition, Poiseuille flows driven by gravity are simulated using microscopic dynamics incorporating fluid–wall molecular interactions. Fluid velocity slips near the wall, and corresponding enhancements in flow velocities throughout the channel are quantitatively analyzed by comparing simulation results with theoretical predictions that account for viscosity variations in the potential region.},

Sulfur-containing LC dimers, with enhanced molecular flexibility and reduced bond angles, offer promising opportunities for functional N TB materials but remain limited by thermal instability and poorly characterized physical parameters. Herein, we comprehensively investigate a series of thioether-linked symmetric LC dimers (CBSnSCB, n = 3, 5, 7) and their mixtures, revealing how molecular architecture governs phase transition behavior. Judicious blending of multiple homologs significantly suppresses crystallization and extends the supercooled N TB phase stability to room temperature while preserving the phase sequence. Dielectric and elastic analyses demonstrate positive dielectric anisotropy and exceptionally low bend elastic constants, attributed to sulfur-mediated molecular flexibility, which can be further modified by incorporating conventional LCs. Leveraging these unique properties, electrically tunable oblique helicoidal cholesteric superstructures with continuously modulated photonic bandgaps across the entire visible spectrum are constructed. This study establishes a structure–property–function relationship in sulfur-containing LC dimers and offers a versatile platform for engineering stable, functional soft matter systems and adaptive photonic applications.},

  abstract     = {Hydrodynamics provides a continuum-level description of fluid motion, but its applicability at the nanoscale becomes uncertain due to the emerging importance of molecular-level effects such as spatial heterogeneity. Hydrodynamic boundary conditions that incorporate molecular details allow us to partition the system into a near-wall region and a bulk fluid region. We identify a hydrodynamic wall located inside the fluid that determines where slip begins. By extending the hydrodynamic wall with the slip length, the position of the extrapolated wall is established. This offers a unified description of both slip and stagnant flow behaviors, with wall hydrophobicity characterized by the relative location of the extrapolated wall with respect to the physical wall. Employing this concept in analyses of equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) and non-equilibrium MD simulations of Couette and Poiseuille flows, our results demonstrate consistency between equilibrium and non-equilibrium approaches across different flow types and confinement levels. This demonstrates the robust nature of linear response theory. We then explore the effects of fluid-wall and bulk fluid interactions on the hydrodynamic properties. These findings enhance the effectiveness of molecular-based simulations for investigating complex confined systems in nanofluidics, biology, and colloidal science, offering a complementary molecular-scale perspective to traditional continuum approaches.},

  abstract     = {A phosphorus-doped graphitic carbon nitride (PCN)/MoS 2 quantum dots (QDs) heterostructure was synthesized via an evaporation-induced self-assembly process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and work function analysis revealed strong interfacial electronic interactions. Density functional theory calculations indicated that interfacial charge migration was dominated by a diffusion-driven mechanism. Incorporation of MoS 2 QDs modulated the electronic structure of PCN, significantly enhancing O 2 adsorption and promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species ( 1 O 2 and ·O 2 – ) under simulated solar irradiation. These electronic modifications improved the photocatalytic response, as demonstrated by the enhanced degradation of Rhodamine B and tetracycline (TC), with pollutant removal efficiencies of 99.5% and 90.0%, respectively, substantially exceeding those of pristine PCN. Application to real printing and dyeing wastewater demonstrated the material’s practical potential, with the degradation products of TC exhibiting substantially reduced biotoxicity to aquatic organisms. This study provides mechanistic insights into charge transport and interfacial oxygen activation in g-C 3 N 4 -based heterostructures, offering a rational strategy for the design of advanced photocatalysts for solar-driven environmental remediation.},

  abstract     = {Alloyed Ag–In–Zn–S colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as bright fluorophores with properties compatible with various applications. Although the synthetic procedures are well developed and allow achieving near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields, further development of these nanostructures is hindered by poor understanding of the light emission mechanism. In this work, we employ a tool of single particle spectroscopy—studies of spectral diffusion—to elucidate the nature of the luminescent excited state. By analyzing temporal fluctuations and correlations of the photoluminescence intensity, peak position, and linewidth, we show that this state comprises an electron delocalized over the QD volume and a hole localized at a midgap trap state. We thus challenge the view prevailing in the literature that the photoluminescence in alloyed Ag–In–Zn–S QDs occurs via a donor–acceptor pair recombination mechanism. Furthermore, our single dot measurements reveal various contributions to the photoluminescence line broadening.},

  abstract     = {Perfluoroalkylalkanes form nanostructured Langmuir films comprising discrete surface aggregates or hemimicelles. The aggregates are formed by a large number of molecules (∼2000–3000), are highly monodisperse and round-shaped, and display a characteristic pit in their center. In this study, the influence of the hydrogenated and the perfluorinated chain lengths on the size of the hemimicelles was probed by a systematic atomistic molecular dynamics simulation study and further rationalized in terms of a model that describes the internal structure of the hemimicelles. The model, while set on geometrical considerations, was developed using quantitative information obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations performed using an atomistic force field that includes detailed electrostatic and dispersive intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. These interactions are therefore intrinsically incorporated in the model, which is consequently designated geometrical + electrostatic (G+E model). Eleven PFAA molecules (F8Hm: F8H14, F8H16, F8H18, F8H20; FnH16: F6H16, F8H16, F10H16, F12H16; F10Hm: F10H14, F10H18, F10H20) and the corresponding hemimicelles were studied, covering a representative range of molecular structures. The results of both the molecular dynamics simulations and the new model reproduce the available experimental data within the respective uncertainties. The results provide a rational basis for a complete understanding of the self-assembly process of PFAA molecules into discrete hemimicelles, well-founded in physical principles and molecular properties.},

  abstract     = {Ice nucleation is one of the most unique and widespread phase transitions on Earth. Due to the relatively low phase transition energy barrier to overcome and the ubiquitous existence of foreign substrates, ice nucleation primarily occurs heterogeneously in nature. Despite extensive studies, our understanding of the molecular-scale heterogeneous nucleation process under the influence of silver iodide (AgI) substrate interactions, one of the most efficient ice nucleating agents, remains limited. Using a deep neural network potential, we perform molecular dynamics simulations with ab initio accuracy to investigate the heterogeneous nucleation of ice on AgI. By analyzing the free energy surface of water molecules at the AgI–water interface, we systematically elucidate the mechanism behind the formation of an ice-like hexagonal layer on AgI. The reconstruction of the metastable, disordered hydrogen bond network into this ice-like hexagonal layer facilitates ice nucleation and contributes to the asynchronous crystallization manner. Furthermore, we find that the influence of the AgI substrate propagates through the highly dynamical and collaborative hydrogen bond network, leading to a pre-ordered region at the ice–water interface that reduces the ice growth rate to approximately one-third compared to ice homogeneous nucleation conditions. These findings provide new insights into the early stages of ice heterogeneous nucleation on the AgI surface and expand our understanding of the role substrates play in this process.},

While γ lv and γ sl are explicitly evaluated far from the contact lines between the liquid, vapor, and solid regions, γ sv is deduced. Following a thermodynamic approach based on the description of the free energy, the line tension is determined from the three surface tensions, the pressures of the liquid and vapor phases, and the derivative of the free energy with respect to the length supporting the contact line. This analysis shows that the line tension cannot be reduced solely to the excess energy associated with line contact deformations. By relating the thermodynamic variables to the total stress along the x -direction, the mechanical and thermodynamic approaches are found to be consistent. We show that the line tension of confined water is negative and that neither temperature nor the degree of confinement affects its sign, which is consistent with other published results obtained using different methods. The main advantage of this approach lies in the ability to determine the three surface tensions and the line tension from a single atomistic simulation.},

Our results show an increase in the electrical conductivity under confinement, with a further enhancement in the case of a positive charge on graphene. The presence of surface charges also determines the direction of electro-osmotic flow and of the diffusio-osmotic electrical current in the nanofluidic systems. Structural analysis reveals that in the case of positively charged graphene sheets, chloride ions accumulate at the surface. This promotes a spatial separation of anions and cations, thereby reducing their correlations and leading to an increased electrical conductivity in this system. We show how accounting for electronic structure by means of ab initio molecular dynamics is essential in the calculation of the transport properties. While quantitative results can be obtained for the diagonal terms of the Onsager transport matrix, only a qualitative impact can be gauged for the off-diagonal terms due to limitations in sampling. Nevertheless, our results reveal that surface charges significantly alter ionic conductivity and determine the direction of the electro-osmotic flow and of the diffusio-osmotic current, thereby advancing the understanding of transport at the nanoscale.},

  abstract     = {Surface hydrogen, especially hydrides (H − ), can serve as key active species in heterogeneous catalysis, yet the fundamental understanding of their nature and reactivity remains elusive. In this study, we systematically investigate the physico-chemical properties and hydrogenation reactivities of different hydrogen species at metal-doped CeO 2 (111) surfaces through density functional theory calculations. The results reveal that the properties of the hydride directly interacting with the doped metal (H M ) are strongly correlated with the metal’s valence orbitals and exhibit periodic trends regarding the structures, stabilities, and ionicities, which in turn govern their catalytic behaviors. In particular, the H M species generated by s / p -valence dopants are strongly ionic and possess high-energy and weakly metal-coupled frontier orbitals that readily involve in C 2 H 2 hydrogenation. In contrast, the H M species formed by d -valence dopants are generally less ionic, with the reactivity dominated by low-energy and strongly metal-coupled σ -bonding orbitals and thus exhibiting substantially reduced hydrogenation activity. By clarifying how the electronic character of dopants can dictate the frontier orbitals of active hydrides, our work provides effective strategies for controlling hydrogenation kinetics and selectivity through dopant engineering, thereby helping the design of advanced hydrogenation catalysts.},

  abstract     = {We investigated the molecular dynamics of the prototypical deep eutectic solvent (DES) ethaline. We disentangled the different motions of its two constituents, namely choline chloride and ethylene glycol, on a spatiotemporal range that extends from sub-nanometer to micrometer distances and from picoseconds to milliseconds. This was achieved by a combination of pulsed-field-gradient NMR, time-of-flight, and backscattering quasielastic neutron scattering experiments with isotopically labeled samples. On the micrometer scale, we observe that the translational motions of the two DES constituents obey classical hydrodynamics, with distinct diffusivities that reflect their different hydrodynamic radii. This is no longer valid at the nanometer scale, where the two DES components present similar short-ranged diffusivities, indicating a significant effect of their supramolecular association. The sub-nanometer scale motions include jumps that precede Fickian diffusion and localized dynamics that precede the breaking of the transient cage formed by neighboring molecules. Therein, the spatial amplitude of the localized motions mirrors their different molecular sizes and chemical structures, while their respective correlation times contrast with observations made for other choline-based DESs such as glyceline. This result underlines the importance of more subtle effects, such as the different H-bond propensities of the polyol donor, and demonstrates the difficulty in anticipating the nanoscale dynamic behavior of DESs from knowledge of their macroscopic properties.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the role that structure plays in the dynamical arrest observed in glassy systems remains an open challenge. Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) strategies have emerged as an important tool for probing this structure–dynamics relationship, particularly for predicting heterogeneous glassy dynamics from local structure. A recent advancement is the introduction of the cage state , a structural quantity that captures the average positions of particles while rearrangements are forbidden. During the caging regime, linear models trained on the cage state have been shown to outperform more complex ML methods trained on initial configurations only. In this paper, we explore the properties associated with the cage state in more detail to better understand why it serves as such an effective predictor for the dynamics. In particular, we examine how the cage state in a binary hard-sphere mixture is influenced by both packing fraction and boundary conditions. Our results reveal that, as the system approaches the glassy regime, the cage state becomes increasingly influenced by long-range structural effects. This influence is evident both in its predictive power for particle dynamics and in the internal structure of the cage state, suggesting that the CS might be associated with some form of an amorphous growing structural length scale.},

Coexistence curves for the nitrobenzene + n -hexane, + n -decane, and + n -tetradecane systems were measured using a synthetic method approach. Critical compositions Z C for these systems were determined from 90° light scattering data using three different choices of experimental composition coordinate. For each system, the Z C values became independent of composition choice when the nonanalytic complete scaling coefficients D 2 , found from fitting the coexistence curves, were incorporated into the analyses of the light scattering data through a transformation of the experimental composition coordinate. In addition, divergent wetting layer formation at the liquid/vapor interface on the nitrobenzene-rich side of the coexistence curve was observed in all three systems. After making the complete scaling correction to the composition coordinate, the growth behaviors of the wetting layers were identical to each other and to those seen in other systems. Values of the critical mole fraction x C , the critical temperature T C , and the complete scaling field mixing coefficient a 1 for the three systems are reported and compared with the literature.},

  abstract     = {Nuclear quantum effects significantly affect the properties of liquid water, in particular due to the quantum delocalization of protons, and differences between normal water (H 2 O) and heavy water (D 2 O) are detectable in experiments and simulations. In addition to H/D substitution, oxygen isotope substitution ( 16 O/ 18 O) can be used in experiments to extract partial structure factors and to obtain structural insights. That raises the question of whether the structures of normal water and 18 O-substituted water are indeed identical, as such approaches would assume. We perform converged path integral simulations with CCSD(T) accuracy of liquid H 2 nat O and H 2 18 O, made possible by intertwining accurate machine-learned high dimensional neural network potential methodology with efficient near-linear scaling coupled cluster theory, and quantify structural differences under ambient conditions. We find statistically significant changes in the water structure upon oxygen isotope substitution—thus being manifestations of nuclear quantum effects. They lead to enhanced radial oxygen–oxygen correlations in the first shell of H 2 18 O of up to 0.5% compared to normal water, followed by less pronounced changes that extend even to the second and third shells. Interestingly, we also discover that the quantum delocalization of the hydrogen atoms is approximately 0.1% smaller in H 2 18 O than in H 2 nat O due to oxygen isotope effects, that linear hydrogen bond configurations are favored in H 2 18 O relative to H 2 nat O, and that hydrogen atoms in H 2 18 O are displaced slightly more toward hydrogen bond acceptors.},

Based on up to 170 ns MLP-based multiTPU-OPES simulations, we obtain the phase diagram across a wide temperature range (250–700 K) and pressure range (10.5–14.0 GPa). It suggests a CO 2 -I/III coexistence line peaks at ∼12.3 GPa, 525 K, with a negative slope at higher temperatures, closely matching experimental I/III and I/VII transition pressures. Trajectory analysis revealed a concerted CO 2 -I/III transition mechanism driven by molecular rotation, lattice deformation, and non-monotonic volume changes (expansion followed by contraction). We propose a new Cmca space group structure for the true CO 2 -III phase, characterized by molecules tilted relative to the ac plane and lattice parameters a > b . It differs from the reported CO 2 -III structure determined by powder x-ray diffraction but closely resembles the CO 2 -VII crystal, where CO 2 molecules are aligned parallel to the ac plane. This proposed tilted Cmca structure coexists with CO 2 -VII at high temperatures. We conject that CO 2 -III and CO 2 -VII belong to the same phase, with the discrepancies in their experimental Raman spectra primarily caused by slight structural changes due to the thermal effect.

  abstract     = {Non-hydrogen bonding van der Waals liquids with dipole–dipole interactions are typically viewed as non-associative and not considered able to sustain large supramolecular structures. Combining broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) and rheology, we demonstrate the supramolecular formation in a group of non-hydrogen bonding van der Waals liquids, i.e., 1-bromo-2-ethylhexane, 1-chloro-2-ethylhexane, and 1-bromo-3,7-dimethyloctane. BDS shows an emergence of a Debye-like process slower than their structural relaxation, which follows super-Arrhenius temperature dependence. Meanwhile, rheological measurements reveal a noticeable dynamical separation between the terminal relaxation and the structural rearrangements. Interestingly, the rheological terminal time agrees remarkably well with the dielectric Debye-like relaxation time, pointing to a strong coupling between the terminal flow and the supramolecular dynamics of these van der Waals liquids. These results highlight a key role of intermolecular dipole–dipole interaction in the supramolecular structure formation and the slow dynamics of van der Waals liquids.},

  abstract     = {We employ the ΔSCF framework to build and optimize, via the Maximum Overlap Method (MOM), non-Aufbau Hartree–Fock determinants for molecular systems containing atoms with open p -shells. We use these determinants in the coupled-cluster (CC) Ansatz to calculate interaction energies at pre-bonding distances and to study bond formation pathways for the ground and excited states of the molecules. We propose that the MOM-CC combination presents a straightforward and general way to study interatomic forces between open-shell atoms with arbitrarily populated orbitals. As a practical application of the MOM combined with CC with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples, we demonstrate that fixed multipole Coulomb interactions between open p -shell atoms play an important role at pre-bonding distances and can lead to an overall repulsive interaction between two neutral atoms. Using three diatomic molecules, B 2 , Al 2 , and AlB, as examples, we illustrate how the mutual orientation of atomic p -orbitals at large separations determines the type of the established chemical bond. Implementation of the proposed method for atoms with other configurations of unfilled shells is straightforward. We also demonstrate that a previously proposed classical small dielectric spheres model, which has been shown to be highly accurate for interactions between closed-shell atoms, remains more accurate than density-functional theory calculations also for atoms with open shells. This suggests that rigorous classical electrostatics is capable of capturing a significant part of electron correlation and polarization effects and potentially can be used for accurate yet low-cost calculations of pre-bonding interactions between larger molecules, for which high-level quantum chemical methods would be computationally impractical.},

Thermochemical and kinetic properties of formation processes, suitable for the gas phase atmospheric and astrophysical environments, are determined. Among 13 formation processes, three bi-radical addition reactions were found as the most likely, for which the temperature-dependent rate coefficients are provided. The search of conformers at the CCSD(T)-F12 level of theory leads to two stable structures Ap (C s ) and Sp (C 1 ), which depend strongly on the correlation energy. The stability of Ap-MEK is noticeable, whereas Sp can transform into Ap by vibrational excitations at very low temperatures since conformers are separated by low energy barriers. Three internal rotations, the torsion of ethyl group (α), and the torsions of the two methyl groups (θ ac and θ et ) interconvert 27 minima of the potential energy surface. In both conformers, V 3 ac <<< V 3 et . To explore the far infrared region and to map the low torsional energy levels and splittings, a variational procedure of reduced dimensionality is employed. The ground vibrational state splits into nine components distributed in two groups at 0.0 cm −1 (A 1 and E 2 ) and 0.289 cm −1 (E 1 , E 3 , and E 4 ). Accurate rotational parameters are provided.},

The Am and Cm systems were too multideterminantal to be amenable to the present treatment. Spin–orbit effects have been included variationally using relativistic 4-component CCSD(T) throughout, and both 6d and 7p electron attachments have been investigated. The small effects due to quantum electrodynamics have also been included in all cases at the Dirac–Hartree–Fock level of theory. In a few cases (Ac, Th, Pu, No, and Lr), it was possible to include contributions from correlation beyond the CCSD(T) level of theory up to CCSDT(Q). The latter was particularly important for the 6d electron affinities of both Ac and Th. For the early actinides Ac through Np, stable anions are predicted for both 6d and 7p electron attachments, but except for the Th atom, the largest EAs occur when the additional electron is attached to the 7p orbital. The Pu atom is predicted to only slightly bind an electron with an EA of just 0.63 kcal/mol, while Bk–No are predicted to not bind an electron within the accuracy of the present calculations. In the two cases where accurate experimental values exist, Th and U, the agreement with the present results are within 0.1 and 0.3 kcal/mol, respectively, although the CCSD(T) level of theory is not sufficient to unambiguously determine the ground state of U − .},

The role of the rotational excitation of H 2 was investigated in measurements with normal and para-enriched H 2 . From the dependence of the measured three-body reaction rate coefficients on the character of the third body and on the H 2 nuclear spin state, we found that rotationally excited (normal) H 2 is less efficient in stabilizing the ( H 5 + ) * intermediate complex than both He and ground-state (para) H 2 .

The intrinsic lack of spatial inversion symmetry and time-reversal symmetry in the TiSeCl structure allows for spontaneous valley polarization, making it highly advantageous for practical valley manipulation since its intrinsic valley polarization values can reach 95 meV. The strong spin–orbit coupling effects in the TiSeCl monolayer result in distinct Berry curvatures and opposing signals in the +K and −K valleys, leading to an anomalous valley Hall effect. Furthermore, under a 1.25% tensile strain, the TiSeCl monolayer undergoes band inversion, leading to a topological phase transition from the ferromagnetic valley state to the semivalley metal state and subsequently to a valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall phase. This study expands our understanding of valley properties in two-dimensional materials and provides theoretical guidance for valley manipulation in valley electronics.},

In addition to the usual collisional widths and shifts, we provide the complex optical frequency of the velocity-changing collisions. We also study the speed dependence of the line shape parameters and investigate their double power law temperature representation.

Excitation in all cases results in prompt C–Cl bond fission, on timescales shorter than the parent rotational period. Most of the excess energy is partitioned into product kinetic energy, E T , but the deduced Cl/Cl* branching ratios and favored CH 3 product vibrational motions are excitation wavelength/excited state dependent. So, too, are the fragment recoil anisotropies which, even within one CH 3 ( v ) + Cl/Cl* product channel, are found to be sensitive functions of E T . The trends observed at longer λ reflect the wavelength dependent partial cross sections for excitation to the 3 Q 1 , 3 Q 0 , and 1 Q 1 components of the A band continuum, but full interpretation of the present data demands a much more detailed, quantum state resolved picture of the non-adiabatic population transfer probabilities between these dissociative parent states and, at higher excitation energies, the Jahn–Teller induced distortions within the photoexcited Rydberg states and their non-adiabatic couplings with the continuum states. Additional CH 3 + and Cl + signals evident in the images at lower E T are attributed to, respectively, two pump photon induced dissociative ionizations and one probe photon induced photodissociation of CH 2 Cl products formed via a competing primary C–H bond fission process.},

The key advance is a detailed description of electronic–vibrational transitions incorporating symmetry-breaking charge transfer. Analysis of the results reveals the excited-state structural changes in the molecule caused by symmetry breaking, which manifest themselves in increasing the Huang–Rhys factors by up to a factor of 2.9. This unexpected outcome challenges the generally accepted view that normal vibrations are not significantly affected by charge transfer. Comparison of the simulated and experimental steady-state spectra demonstrates the high accuracy of the method. The model parameters are estimated using an algorithm that imitates swarm intelligence. The approach is based on a theory that addresses the interaction of the electronic subsystem of the molecule with both the intramolecular degrees of freedom and solvent polarization, which leads to an adiabatic excited-state free energy curve. The adiabatic effects on the steady-state spectra are discussed.},

While previous studies have characterized how such errors affect mean-squared displacement (MSD) analysis, practical guidelines for minimizing them during data acquisition and correcting them during analysis are still lacking. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and simulations to evaluate how exposure time and sampling rate influence the accuracy of MSD-based inference under fractional Brownian motion (FBM), a canonical model of anomalous diffusion. We demonstrate that decoupling exposure and sampling times enables escape from the error-prone regime, thus improving inference accuracy, and that incorporating an offset in nonlinear MSD fitting substantially improves the estimation of the anomalous diffusion exponent. We validate this framework using trajectories of cytoplasmic particles in Escherichia coli , recovering consistent diffusion parameters across multiple datasets. We further prove that the framework extends beyond FBM to general cases of subdiffusion, thereby offering practical strategies to improve both experimental design and data analysis in single-particle tracking of live or synthetic systems.},

Most existing THz-CD studies have relied on transmission amplitude differences, which are susceptible to severe signal attenuation and spectral distortion in lossy or strongly absorbing media. In this work, we present an alternative approach that retrieves helicity-dependent absorption coefficients from the complex transmission function, obtained through polarization-resolved THz time-domain spectroscopy. By analyzing the difference between the extracted absorption spectra for right and left circularly polarized THz waves, we obtain an absorption-resolved CD signal that reflects the intrinsic chiroptical asymmetry of the sample. We validate this method using two representative chiral molecules, glucose and tartaric acid, whose enantiomers exhibit bisignate CD spectral features centered at 1.45 and 1.1 THz, respectively, corresponding to their molecular resonances. These spectral signatures, which are obscured in transmission-based CD measurements, become distinctly observable through our absorption-based analysis. This label-free and quantitative approach provides a robust platform for chiral sensing and is applicable to pharmaceutical analysis, biochemical diagnostics, and molecular spectroscopy.},

Crucially, the local detailed balance condition, which constrains reaction kinetics to thermodynamics, remains satisfied throughout the coarse-graining procedures. It applies to the effective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary vibronic transitions. We then demonstrate that autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets operate via the same fundamental mechanism as chemically driven ones. Because the local detailed balance remains satisfied, autonomous photo-driven molecular ratchets, similar to chemically driven ones, operate exclusively through an information ratchet mechanism. This reveals that their design and optimization should prioritize molecular properties governing the information ratchet mechanism, rather than those influencing energetic bias.},

  abstract     = {In experimental systems, colloidal particles are virtually always at least somewhat polydisperse, which can have profound effects on their ability to crystallize. Unfortunately, accurately predicting the effects of polydispersity on phase behavior using computer simulations remains a challenging task. As a result, our understanding of the equilibrium phase behavior of even the simplest colloidal model system, hard spheres, remains limited. Here, we present a new approach to map out the freezing line of polydisperse systems that draws on direct-coexistence simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble. We use this new method to map out the conditions where a hard-sphere fluid with a Gaussian size distribution becomes metastable with respect to partial crystallization into a face-centered-cubic crystal. Consistent with past predictions, we find that as the polydispersity of the fluid increases, the coexisting crystal becomes increasingly size-selective, exhibiting a lower polydispersity and larger mean particle size than the fluid phase. Finally, we exploit our direct-coexistence simulations to examine the characteristics of the fluid–crystal interface, including surface stress and interfacial absorption.},

For this, they employed an expression for the corresponding effective potential in terms of the wavefunction of the system. In this paper, we explore the possibility of solving the LPS equation in conjunction with approximate wavefunction. For this, we first perform the variational derivation of the equation and use this to set up a self-consistent cycle to get the ground state properties of two-electron systems using the modified form of the Le Sech wavefunction. Furthermore, using the observation that even the approximate wavefunctions give the accurate effective potential for the LPS equation, we show that accurate densities are obtained through using the LPS equation with these wavefunctions. We demonstrate our method by performing calculations for closed-shell atoms.},

  abstract     = {Water is a unique solvent with many remarkable properties. An example is its exceptionally high heat capacity, which plays an important role in storing and transporting thermal energy, with implications for many processes from regulating the body temperature of living organisms to moderating our climate at the global scale. To elucidate the microscopic origin of the heat capacity of water from first principles, highly accurate computer simulations are required. Apart from a reliable description of the atomic interactions, the presence of light hydrogen atoms necessitates the explicit consideration of nuclear quantum effects through path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations. The high computational costs of PIMD simulations, which are even further increased by the need for an extensive statistical sampling of energy fluctuations to determine the heat capacity, can be strongly reduced by replacing first principles calculations with machine learning potentials to represent the atomic interactions. In this study, we use high-dimensional neural network potentials constructed from density functional theory calculations employing the RPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 functionals. To further enhance the computational performance, we introduce a highly efficient PIMD algorithm that computes in parallel not only the energies and forces but also the coordinate and thermostat time evolutions. Using this approach, we are able to determine converged data for the heat capacity from a 4 ns simulation employing 128 beads. In particular, for the revPBE0-D3 functional, we find excellent agreement with experiment, providing evidence that our approach represents a promising framework for the quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water and aqueous solutions.},

  abstract     = {Electronic spectra, including absorption spectra, provide crucial insight into the electronic properties of molecular systems. Single-point excited-state calculations using quantum chemical (QC) methods, such as time-dependent density functional theory, can predict peak positions and their intensities of the spectra; however, these methods are inherently incapable of capturing spectral broadening effects. Herein, we present a comprehensive assessment of an approach based on time correlation functions (TCFs) that enables the computational prediction of spectra, including broadening effects, by integrating QC calculations with classical molecular dynamics simulations. We systematically compared the absorption spectral shapes calculated using five levels of TCF-based spectral formulas, including the second-order cumulant approach, which are hierarchically related through successive approximations. To evaluate the applicability of the TCF-based approach, we selected two small organic pigment molecules, 3,4,5,6-tetrachlorofluorescein (FLU) and crystal violet (CST), as test cases. By assessing the impact of different approximations on the predicted spectral shapes, we found that for FLU, all approximation levels yielded comparable results, whereas for CST, certain approximations led to significant deviations. These discrepancies may be caused by rapid fluctuations of transition dipole moments in CST, which has a flexible molecular skeleton, in contrast to FLU, which has a relatively rigid structure. In addition, using Kubo’s stochastic theory allowed us to investigate the relationship between the timescale of molecular fluctuations and spectral broadening. Our analysis confirms that molecular rigidity plays a critical role in determining the accuracy of spectral shape predictions.},

These relationships are used to propose a new approach to calculating activation parameters within the framework of fluctuation theory for dynamics. This method enables more rapid convergence of activation energies and their temperature derivatives, as illustrated for water self-diffusion in both neat water and aqueous TMAO solutions.

Herein, we implement the semiclassical nuclear–electronic orbital time-dependent configuration interaction (NEO-TDCI) approach, which treats electrons and specified nuclei on the same quantum mechanical level, while treating the cavity mode classically. This ab initio dynamics approach can describe both the electronic strong coupling and the vibrational strong coupling regimes at the same level of theory without invoking the Born–Oppenheimer separation between the quantum nuclei and the electrons. This approach is used to simulate resonant and off-resonant vibronic strong coupling, where the cavity mode couples to one or many vibronic transitions associated with joint electronic–nuclear excitations within a vibronic progression. In this case, the cavity mode couples to nuclear motions even for cavity frequencies typically associated with electronic strong coupling. This approach is also used to illustrate that coupling a molecule to a cavity mode can alter hydrogen tunneling dynamics. The semiclassical NEO-TDCI approach provides the foundation for investigating how polaritons may be able to influence chemical reactions involving tunneling and nonadiabatic effects.},

This holds for naïve, projected, self-consistent, and state-transfer parameterizations of the LR operators. With a focus on the state-transfer parameterization, this problem is shown to also hold for more complicated systems and is also present when the LR is truncated to singles and doubles. This problem can be alleviated by performing a ground-state constrained trace optimization of the Hessian matrix before performing the LR calculation. It is finally shown that spectra can be further improved for small LR expansions by targeting only a few states in the constrained trace optimization using constrained state-averaged UCC.},

BE collision integrals for different relaxation channels can be systematically computed using the Kadanoff–Baym–Keldysh formalism (also called NEGF) utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) simulation output. However, accurate description of phonon-mediated relaxation in a general class of (nano)materials that includes exciton effects is still an outstanding problem. The approach proposed here is based on the observation that the non-adiabatic couplings of the DFT-based non-adiabatic molecular dynamics play the role of a time-dependent external potential coupled to the electrons. This allows application of the Keldysh approach resulting in the exciton–phonon BE collision integral, which incorporates exciton wave functions and energies obtained from the Bethe–Salpeter equation. As an application, we augment BE with radiative recombination and photon-mediated exciton–exciton transition terms and then use it to calculate photoluminescence spectrum for several 1.5 nm semiconductor chalcogenide nanocrystals, such as Cd 37 Pb 31 Se 68 , Cd 31 Pb 37 Se 68 , which are Janus-type, and for Pb 68 Se 68 .},

This is especially true in chemistry, where ML is used to fit chemical properties or desirable attributes to the local structure of molecules and materials. In the pursuit of greater accuracy, it is relatively simple to increase the size or complexity of such models, although this often requires simultaneously seeking larger datasets in order to both fit and interpret the larger number of parameters. However, it is equally important to assess the quality and relative importance of the data and how these factors impact the training process. We, therefore, investigate the impact of using different loss functions for training neural network potentials (NNPs), as the loss function defines the error and parameter gradients used to train the NNP. In particular, we test the mean-squared error and Huber loss functions and, using insight from these functions, derive a new loss function based on the Asinh function, which yields significant improvement in the accuracy and generality of NNPs. We show that by discounting/minimizing errors and anomalies in the optimization process, both the Huber and Asinh loss functions improve the training of NNPs, leading to a final potential with a greater effective dimensionality.},

  abstract     = {Leveraging matrix sparsity has proven to be a fruitful strategy for accelerating quantum chemical calculations. Here, we present the hierarchical SOS-MP2 algorithm, which uses hierarchical matrix ( ⁠ H 2 ⁠ ) compression of the electron repulsion integral (ERI) tensor to reduce both time and space complexity. This approach is based on the atomic orbital Laplace transform MP2 calculations, leveraging the data-sparsity of the ERI tensor and the element-wise sparsity of the energy-weighted density matrices. The H 2 representation approximates the ERI tensor in a block low-rank form, taking advantage of the inherent low-rank nature of the repulsion integrals between distant sets of atoms. The resulting algorithm enables the calculation of the Coulomb-like term of the MP2 energy with a theoretical time complexity of O ( N 2 ⁡ log ⁡ N ) and a space complexity of O ( N 2 ⁡ log ⁡ N ) ⁠ , where N denotes the number of basis functions. Numerical tests show asymptotic time and space complexities better than O ( N 2 ) for both linear alkanes and three-dimensional water clusters.},

  abstract     = {Covalent bonding and noncovalent interactions are fundamental concepts in chemistry, biology, and related fields, yet the energetic factors driving bond formation and bond rotation remain a subject of ongoing debate in the literature because different theoretical frameworks might provide different insights. In this study, we examine the energetics of bond formation and bond rotation with both density functional theory and valence bond theory. Our analysis spans a wide range of systems, including 40 diatomic molecules; six energy profiles for Ar 2 , H 2 , F 2 , NaF, (H 2 O) 2 , and Na 2 molecules; and six rotational barriers for CH 3 CH 3 , CH 3 NH 2 , CH 3 OH, H 2 O 2 , NH 2 NH 2 , and NH 2 OH. We find that (i) electrostatic energy is the dominant contributor in most cases; (ii) within the electrostatic terms, nuclear–electron attraction is often, but not always, the leading contributor; (iii) during bond formation, different interactions dominate at different stages; and (iv) in multi-electron systems, steric effects consistently contribute positively to the total energy decrease due to the spatial constraints imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle. These findings are consistently supported by both theories. Overall, this work should help bridge a critical knowledge gap by providing a unified perspective on the energetics of fundamental bonding processes.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the relationship between microscopic structure and macroscopic thermodynamic properties is a central challenge in the study of complex fluids. The Kirkwood–Buff (KB) theory offers an elegant and powerful framework for bridging this gap by relating integrals over pair correlation functions to measurable thermodynamic quantities. In multicomponent systems, KB integrals connect directly to derivatives of thermodynamic potentials, including chemical potentials derivatives, partial molar volumes, and isothermal compressibility. While several computational methods exist to estimate KB integrals from molecular simulations, their application often demands careful treatment of finite-size effects and explicit extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit. Recently, alternative strategies based on the analysis of partial structure factors in reciprocal space have been proposed. Unlike real-space approaches, reciprocal-space methods avoid the additional truncation artifacts associated with direct integration or fluctuations in subensemble. They evaluate density fluctuations across the entire simulation box, fully accounting for periodic boundary conditions rather than relying on subdomains. As a result, these methods offer a compelling alternative, providing enhanced numerical stability for estimating KB integrals in complex mixtures. In this work, we extend, compare and validate these methods using binary and quaternary Lennard-Jones mixtures, as well as realistic molecular systems such as hexane–ethanol, water–urea, and aqueous NaCl mixtures. Our results provide practical guidelines for computing KB integrals and associated thermodynamic properties from canonical ensemble simulations, including recommendations on reciprocal-space extrapolation, uncertainty estimation, and linear algebra formulations of thermodynamic derivatives.},

At low temperatures, the decoherence of an electronic molecular spin can be driven by its interaction with either other electron spins or nuclear spins. Many experimental techniques have been used to prolong the coherence time of molecular qubits, but these efforts have been hampered by the uncertainty about which of the two mechanisms is effectively limiting coherence in different experimental conditions. Here, we use the cluster-correlation expansion to simulate the decoherence of two prototypical molecular qubits and quantitatively demonstrate that nuclear spins become the leading source of decoherence only when the electron spin concentration is below ∼1 mM. Moreover, we show that deuterated samples, much easier to achieve than fully spin-free environments, could achieve record coherence times of ∼0.1 ms for an electron spin concentration of ∼0.1 mM. Alternatively, hydrogen-rich molecular crystals with electron spin concentrations below 1 mM can still achieve coherence times of 10 ms through dynamical decoupling, showing that the potential of molecular spins for quantum technologies is still untapped.},

Anionic uracil–glycine complexes were used to model the RNA–protein interactions. The resonance positions and widths of these complexes were simulated using the equation of motion coupled cluster method coupled with resonance via the Padé approach. Our results show that in the transient negative ion (TNI, i.e., the anion radical of glycine:uracil complex), glycine stabilizes nucleobase-centered resonances through hydrogen bonding, thereby increasing the lifetime of TNI. Simultaneously, a glycine-centered resonance demonstrates the ability of amino acids to capture the electron density and divert it away from the uracil nucleobase. At the micro-solvation level, this modeling indicates that amino acids would have more influence on nucleobase-centered resonances in the TNI than that displayed by the corresponding aqueous environment.},

  abstract     = {Do enzymes always follow a single linear path of catalytic steps? Or is the catalytic process more like a maze of forest trails? Enzyme mechanisms are typically presented as a linear (or circular) sequence of chemical steps, and most mechanistic studies aim to identify “the” correct catalytic pathway. Alternative proposals are often pitted against one another and sometimes fiercely debated. In this paper, we consider the possibility that the reaction mechanism space accessible to enzyme active sites is more diverse than commonly recognized. This mechanistic space can be conveniently represented as a graph, where nodes correspond to active-site configurations (reactants, intermediates, or products) and edges denote catalytic steps transforming one configuration into another. We show that it is possible to generate alternative mechanism proposals, which take into account the 3D coordinates of the active site and known catalytic rules, for more than half of a test set of 25 enzymes. These findings hint at a previously unexplored facet of enzyme catalysis and underscore the need for the systematic exploration of the complete reactional space in computational studies of enzyme mechanisms.},

This work presents a detailed analysis of the discretization structure of the TTM, clarifying the origin of the initial-time correction and establishing a consistent relationship between the TTM discrete-time memory kernel K N and the continuous-time NZ-QME kernel K ( N Δ t ) ⁠ . This relationship is validated numerically using the spin-boson model, demonstrating convergence of reconstructed memory kernels and accurate dynamical evolution as Δ t → 0. While the TTM provides a consistent discretization, we note that alternative schemes are also viable, such as the midpoint derivative/midpoint integral scheme proposed in Makri’s work. The relative performance of various schemes for either computing accurate K ( N Δ t ) from exact dynamics or obtaining accurate dynamics from exact K ( N Δ t ) warrants further investigation.},

  abstract     = {Effective single-particle theories, such as Hartree–Fock, density functional theory, and tight-binding, are limited by the computational cost of the self-consistent field (SCF) procedure, which typically scales cubically with the system size. This makes large-scale applications impractical without specialized algorithms and hardware. Here, we present the submatrix and graphical processing unit (GPU)-accelerated software implementation of the PTB tight-binding potential, realized in the open-source ptb codebase [M. Mueller, A. Katbashev, and S. Ehlert (2025). “grimme-lab/ptb: v3.8.1,” Zenodo. https://zenodo.org/records/17015872 ]. We first benchmark a traditional diagonalization-based SCF solver against density-matrix-based purification approaches, systematically varying both system size and computer hardware. Our findings show that the usage of GPUs permits shifting the boundaries to much larger systems than previously thought feasible, achieving an overall 10–15-fold performance speedup. Second, we introduce the implementation of a decomposition-type submatrix method, specifically designed for efficient operation on mid- to large-sized systems, to address the computational overhead associated with full-system diagonalization. We demonstrate that, from a certain dimension ( ⁠ ≈ 1 0 4 basis functions) on, our submatrix method reduces the overall computational cost while maintaining acceptable numerical accuracy. Our study demonstrates the significance of the interplay between modern hardware, algorithmic considerations, and novel tight-binding methods, paving the way for further development in this direction.},

The method is based on using the harmonic approximation for the fast intramolecular degrees of freedom. While conceptually primitive, the resulting CG model turned out to be surprisingly accurate for selected water and ammonia clusters. However, as originally formulated, a single evaluation of the CG potential turned out to be much more expensive than the evaluation of the AA potential, since the former required a subspace minimization followed by a subspace normal mode calculation. In this communication, we formulate the approach more broadly, making it applicable, e.g., to coarse-graining a large protein. We also introduce key algorithmic improvements, reducing the cost of the subspace minimization and normal mode calculation. Combined with the fact that the CG simulation requires roughly an order of magnitude fewer Monte Carlo steps to reach similar statistical accuracy for selected observables compared to the AA model, the overall computational cost becomes comparable. These improvements are demonstrated on a water cluster.},

While extensive research has been conducted on electrolyte behavior at electrode interfaces, the electrolyte/separator interface and the transport properties through it remain relatively unexplored. Yet, optimizing the transport mechanism could improve power density and reduce overheating. Lithium ions diffuse through the pore space in the separator, where an extensive interfacial surface area is in contact with the electrolyte. Experimental studies suggest that separator–electrolyte interactions may impact the surface chemistry and microscopic behavior of transport processes, but atomic-level insights are still lacking. This study uses classical molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the behavior of 1.2M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate at the interface with a polyethylene substrate, a commonly used separator material. Our simulations reveal how the solvation structure and diffusive mechanisms change within thin interfacial films as a function of the distance from the polyethylene substrate.

  abstract     = {The availability of high-fidelity catalysis data is essential for training machine learning models to advance catalyst discovery. Furthermore, the sharing of data is crucial to ensure the comparability of scientific results. In electrocatalysis, where complex experimental conditions and measurement uncertainties pose unique challenges, structured data collection and sharing are critical to improving reproducibility and enabling robust model development. Addressing these challenges requires standardized approaches to data collection, metadata inclusion, and accessibility. To support this effort, we have developed an extensive data infrastructure that curates and organizes multimodal data from electrocatalysis experiments, making them openly available through the catalysis-hub.org platform. Our datasets, comprising 241 experimental entries, provide detailed information on reaction conditions, material properties, and performance metrics, ensuring transparency and interoperability. By structuring electrocatalysis data in web-based as well as machine-readable formats, we aim to bridge the gap between experimental and computational research, allowing for improved benchmarking and predictive modeling. This work highlights the importance of well-structured, accessible data in overcoming reproducibility challenges and advancing machine learning applications in catalysis. The framework we present lays the foundation for future data-driven research in electrocatalysis and offers a scalable model for other experimental disciplines.},

  abstract     = {Actinidofullerenes constitute a family of fullerenes that exhibit different metal–cage interactions, electronic structures, and properties compared to lanthanidofullerenes. In this study, we investigate the reactivity of mono-uranofullerene U@ C 2v (9)-C 82 under the Bingel–Hirsch reaction and observe significantly higher regioselectivity, along with other differences in the reaction products, compared to La@ C 2v (9)-C 82 . Two products are obtained: a cycloadduct, which is the most abundant and has been characterized by x-ray crystallography, and a minor regioisomer that is most likely a single-bond product. Density functional theory calculations can explain the experimental structure and the formation of the two products and indicate that uranium is formally U(III) in both of them. The most abundant cycloadduct is formed under kinetic control, as found for other Bingel–Hirsch adducts, whereas the single-bond product is formed after oxidation of the anionic intermediate of the conventional Bingel–Hirsch reaction. This work is a new example of the unique reactivity and chemical properties of actinidofullerenes, which arise from their distinctive actinide–fullerene interactions.},

  abstract     = {Thermal equilibrium properties are usually obtained from the imaginary-time path integral representation of the Boltzmann operator in combination with Monte Carlo integration methods. In some situations (identical fermions or frustrated Hamiltonians), the Boltzmann matrix leads to terms of alternating sign, which leads to a sign problem that severely impacts convergence. In this paper, we develop a robust and efficient quadrature-based method suitable for computing the Boltzmann matrix for discrete systems coupled to common or local harmonic baths. By expressing the discretized path integral with the influence functional in terms of a sum of matrix products, we develop a small matrix path integral (SMatPI) decomposition that allows iterative propagation in imaginary time while circumventing the storage of tensors employed in earlier work. The method is illustrated with several examples that involve two- and three-level systems coupled to common or local baths. We show that cyclic tight-binding Hamiltonians with positive coupling parameters give rise to Boltzmann matrix elements with alternating signs, presenting a severe sign problem to Monte Carlo approaches, while the SMatPI algorithm is stable and efficient.},

A broad region of the parameter space has been investigated, accompanied by a detailed analysis of the convergence behavior of the mDA method. In addition, we have compared our mD2 results to those from two widely adopted, numerically “exact” techniques: the methods of hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) and the quasi-adiabatic path integral (QUAPI). It is found that the mDA approach in combination with thermal field dynamics yields numerically accurate, convergent results in nearly all regions of the parameter space examined, including those that pose serious challenges for QUAPI and HEOM. Our results reveal that mDA offers a highly adaptable framework capable of capturing long-time dynamics, even in challenging regimes where other methods face limitations. These findings underscore the potential of mDA as a versatile tool for exploring quantum thermodynamics, energy transfer processes, and non-equilibrium quantum systems.},

In this work, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic disorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled microcavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation propagation and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy and its probability distribution, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using parameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that exciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons, particularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective light–matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of these results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak resonance scattering. The magnitude of the effects examined in this work supports the conclusion that most of the reported polaritonic slowdown arises from dynamical (phonon-assisted) disorder, with static energetic disorder contributing only secondarily.},

  abstract     = {Raman spectroscopy is a powerful experimental technique for characterizing molecules and materials that is used in many laboratories. First-principles theoretical calculations of Raman spectra are important because they elucidate the microscopic effects underlying Raman activity in these systems. These calculations are often performed using the canonical harmonic approximation, which cannot capture certain thermal changes in the Raman response. Anharmonic vibrational effects were recently found to play crucial roles in several materials, which motivates theoretical treatments of the Raman effect beyond harmonic phonons. While Raman spectroscopy from molecular dynamics (MD-Raman) is a well-established approach that includes anharmonic vibrations and further relevant thermal effects, MD-Raman computations were long considered to be computationally too expensive for practical materials computations. In this perspective article, we highlight that recent advances in the context of machine learning have now dramatically accelerated the involved computational tasks without sacrificing accuracy or predictive power. These recent developments highlight the increasing importance of MD-Raman and related methods as versatile tools for theoretical prediction and characterization of molecules and materials.},

An important example of such landscape describes superposition of M plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature μ . Our main efforts are directed toward analyzing the landscape features in the limit N → ∞ , M → ∞ keeping α = M / N finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with N of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimization functional and analyze conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of μ and α : replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.},

Firstly, a stochastic representation of the solution is derived by the stochastic differential equation associated with a subordinated Brownian motion and a birth-death process, in which the drift term is the solution of the INSE on R d ( d ≥ 2 ) ⁠ . Regarding the existence of the birth-death semigroup in ℓ p ( π ) ( p ≥ 2), equipped with a positive weight measure π , it is proved via a perturbation theorem without requiring the boundedness of the birth and death rates. Then, relying on the regularity estimates of the solution for INSE and the properties of the birth-death semigroup, we prove that the stochastic representation is a unique local strong solution in ℓ p ′ ( π ) × L p ( R d ) ( p ′ ≥ 2 , p > d ) via spatial regularity analyses of the random flow. The Picard iteration is used to prove that it is both unique local mild and weak solution in ℓ 2 ( π ) × L 2 ( R d ) ⁠ .},

  abstract     = {Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor M to generate an MPU of size N , namely, Tr ( E M N ) = Tr ( E T N ) = 1 ⁠ , where E M and E T denote the transfer matrices of M and T = MM † , respectively, with M † being the Hermitian adjoint of M with respect to the physical indices. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.},

  abstract     = {This paper is concerned with the averaging principle for the multi-scale fractional stochastic nonautonomous FitzHugh–Nagumo system on the whole Euclid space, where the drift term is a nonlinear function that has an arbitrary polynomial growth rate in its last argument, and the diffusion term is a family of globally Lipschitz continuous functions. Taking the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions as a state space, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of a periodic evolution system of measures for the fast equation when the slow component of the solution is fixed, and then establish the exponential ergodicity for the stochastic systems under certain conditions. By using the time discretization and variational methods, we finally show the strong rate of convergence for the slow component of the solution operator. The results of this paper are also valid when the fractional Laplace operator (−Δ) s with s ∈ (0, 1) becomes the standard Laplace operator −Δ.},

First, we provide a classification of general Benjamin-Ono type systems that admit solutions related to the Calogero-Moser system, including the perturbed Benjamin-Ono equation. Second, we demonstrate that this equation possesses a Lax pair. Third, we show that the equation can be transformed into a linear form through an appropriate change of the dependent variable. Finally, we derive both non-periodic and periodic solutions under suitable initial conditions.},

Firstly, the unique existence of subsonic and supersonic solutions of the damped radial isentropic Euler flow in a two-dimensional expansion and contraction nozzle are established. Then take the radial subsonic solution in a expansion nozzle as the background solution, the structural stability problem of the background solution under small perturbations of the inlet Bernoulli function, inlet velocity ratio, and outlet density is transformed into the unique existence problem of the solution to the boundary value problem of a nonlinear hyperbolic-elliptic coupled system. After performing a Lagrange transformation on the decoupled system, we transform it into a fixed boundary problem, linearize it, and construct a suitable iteration set and a iteration scheme. Finally the existence of a unique fixed point can be proved, which yields the structural stability of the background solution.},

We first prove the existence and uniqueness of pullback attractors for such equations. Second, we show that the existence and uniqueness of a family of invariant Borel probability measures supported on the pullback attractors. Third, we study the upper semicontinuity of pullback attractors as the delay time approaches to zero. Finally, we investigate the convergence of invariant measures as the delay time tends to zero. In this paper, we need to overcome two difficulties. On the one hand, due to the lack of higher regularity of solutions, we prove the asymptotic compactness of solutions using the spectrum decomposition method. On the other hand, we introduce an invertible function to solve the effect of the variable delay, and then establish the convergence of solutions for the delay system to the non-delay one.},

We establish the existence and uniqueness of three-dimensional smooth subsonic flows to the steady Zeldovich–von Neumann–Döring combustion equations by prescribing the Bernoulli’s quantity, the entropy, the fraction of unburned gas and the tangential velocity at the entrance and the pressure at the exit. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear boundary value problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system. The main difficulty is that all the physical quantities are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. One of the key points in the analysis is to utilize the deformation-curl decomposition to deal with the hyperbolic and elliptic modes. Another one is to solve the deformation-curl system for the velocity field with mixed boundary conditions.},
