Localized properties, including polarization, lattice parameter, and chemical composition, are parameterized from atomic-scale imaging, and their causal relationships are reconstructed using a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model. This approach is further extended to explore the spatial variability of the causal coupling using the sliding window transform method, which revealed that new causal relationships emerged at both the expected locations, such as domain walls and interfaces, and at additional regions forming clusters in the vicinity of the walls or spatially distributed features. While the exact physical origins of these relationships are unclear, they likely represent nanophase-separated regions in the morphotropic phase boundaries. Overall, we posit that an in-depth understanding of complex disordered materials away from thermodynamic equilibrium necessitates understanding not only the generative processes that can lead to observed microscopic states but also the causal links between multiple interacting subsystems.},

  abstract     = {Predicting the behavior of a fluid as it flows through porous media is critical for electrochemical devices and other scientific, industrial, and environmental applications. The main challenge lies in accurately capturing the complex, multi-scale fluid flow behavior through irregular porous microstructures, all while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a multi-fidelity surrogate model that predicts the high-fidelity flow field state variables in explicit porous media microstructures with minimal computational cost. Our approach begins by collecting both low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulation data to train the surrogate model. The former low-fidelity data are obtained from numerical simulations of fluid flowing through macro-scale structures having homogenized effective material properties. On the other hand, the latter high-fidelity data include geometric details of the dehomogenized explicit porous media microstructure. This technique combines the detailed accuracy of high-fidelity data with the computational efficiency of low-fidelity data, thus enhancing the model performance. In addition, we integrate physics-informed neural networks into the surrogate modeling process, embedding physical laws derived from the Navier–Stokes equations that govern fluid flow. This multi-scale, multi-fidelity approach offers a precise and cost-effective solution for predicting the fluid flow velocity and pressure fields in the porous media. For relevant porous media fluid flow applications, we show a ∼ 1 0 3 × faster solution in terms of increased computational speed for a given model with reasonable representative accuracy of the solution, within a range of ∼5%–20% for velocity and ≤10% for pressure fields.},

However, studying these transitions typically requires large supercells to minimize constraints on atomic movements, significantly increasing computational time and cost. In this study, we developed a machine learning potential by fine-tuning the MACE-MP-0 model with a customized BTO database. The fine-tuned MACE model demonstrated high accuracy in reproducing the structural and dynamic characteristics of BTO systems. Notably, the model effectively represented changes in lattice constants and polarization during phase transitions (rhombohedral → orthorhombic → tetragonal → cubic). Furthermore, we employed the fine-tuned MACE model to investigate the melting point of BTO and subsequently generated liquid-phase and amorphous structures via thermal annealing, providing valuable insights into the high-temperature behavior of BTO.},

To improve crystal quality, the multi-point seed technique and the flux film coated technique have been developed, enabling the growth of low-dislocation GaN wafers via the Na-flux method. However, the coalescence boundary (CB) region, formed by the fusion of multiple growth fronts, exhibits complex structural variations that remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we investigate the CB region of FFC-GaN using synchrotron-based nanobeam x-ray diffraction (nanoXRD). To analyze the high-dimensional diffraction data without prior labeling, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with agglomerative clustering. This approach identifies six crystallographically distinct clusters that align well with growth sectors inferred from cathodoluminescence imaging. By further applying the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, we enhance the pixel-level interpretation of structural evolution during different growth stages of CB. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the combination of UMAP, clustering, and statistical testing enables direct, label-free crystallographic analysis of crystal growth sectors. This framework is believed to be generalizable to other high-dimensional experimental datasets, opening new avenues for uncovering hidden structural features in complex material systems.},

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization (BO) has become an indispensable tool for autonomous decision-making across diverse applications from autonomous vehicle control to accelerated drug and materials discovery. With the growing interest in self-driving laboratories, BO of chemical systems is crucial for machine learning guided experimental planning. Typically, BO employs a regression surrogate model to predict the distribution of unseen parts of the search space. However, for the selection of molecules, picking the top candidates with respect to a distribution, the relative ordering of their properties may be more important than their exact values. In this paper, we introduce rank-based Bayesian optimization (RBO), which utilizes a ranking model as the surrogate. We present a comprehensive investigation of RBO’s optimization performance compared to conventional BO on various chemical datasets. Our results demonstrate similar or improved optimization performance using ranking models, particularly for datasets with rough structure–property landscapes and activity cliffs. Furthermore, we observe a high correlation between the surrogate ranking ability and BO performance, and this ability is maintained even at early iterations of BO optimization when using ranking surrogate models. We conclude that RBO is an effective alternative to regression-based BO, especially for optimizing novel chemical compounds.},

We first generate a scattering dataset by carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of the polydisperse hard spheres modeled by the truncated-shifted Lennard-Jones model, then analyze the scattering function dataset using singular value decomposition to confirm the feasibility of dimensional compression. Then, we split the dataset into training and testing sets and train our neural network on the training set only. Our generator model produces a scattering function with significantly higher accuracy compared to the traditional Percus–Yevick approximation and β correction, and the inferrer model can extract the volume fraction and polydispersity with much higher accuracy than traditional model functions.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of artificial-intelligence driven autonomous experiments demands physics-based modeling and decision-making processes, not only to improve the accuracy of the experimental trajectory but also to increase trust by allowing transparent human-machine collaboration. High-quality structural characterization techniques (e.g., x ray, neutron, or static light scattering) are a particularly relevant example of this need: they provide invaluable information but are challenging to analyze without expert oversight. Here, we introduce AutoSAS, a novel framework for human-aside-the-loop automated data classification. AutoSAS leverages human-defined candidate models, high-throughput combinatorial fitting, and information-theoretic model selection to generate both classification results and quantitative structural descriptors. We implement AutoSAS in an open-source package designed for use with the Autonomous Formulation Laboratory for x-ray and neutron scattering-based optimization of multi-component liquid formulations. In a first application, we leveraged a set of expert defined candidate models to classify, refine the structure, and track transformations in a model injectable drug carrier system. We evaluated four model selection methods and benchmarked them against an optimized machine learning classifier, and the best approach was one that balanced quality of the fit and complexity of the model. AutoSAS not only corroborated the critical micelle concentration boundary identified in previous experiments but also discovered a second structural transition boundary not identified by the previous methods. These results demonstrate the potential of AutoSAS to enhance autonomous experimental workflows by providing robust, interpretable model selection, paving the way for more reliable and insightful structural characterization in complex formulations.},

An example of this is the design of photonic metasurfaces by using their photoluminescent spectrum as the input data to predict their topology. One fundamental challenge of these systems is their ability to represent nonlinear relationships between sets of data that have different dimensionalities. Existing design methods often implement a conditional generative adversarial network in order to solve this problem, but in many cases, the solution is unable to generate structures that provide multiple peaks when validated. It is demonstrated that in response to the target spectrum, the bidirectional adversarial autoencoder is able to generate structures that provide multiple peaks on several occasions. As a result, the proposed model represents an important advance toward the generation of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces that can be used in advanced metasurface design.},

As a model system, we used the periodic precipitation of copper(II) hydroxide and targeted the synthesis of “Liesegang” precipitation bands with a well-defined spacing. Our workflow involved conducting high-throughput synthesis experiments, mapping the spatial distribution of the products as a function of initial reactant concentrations, and scalarizing the emerging patterns using empirical scaling laws. Subsequently, machine learning models were deployed to process the scalarized descriptors and inform the next round of experimental conditions in order to converge toward a target precipitation pattern, without human input. We anticipate that these results open pathways for autonomous materials synthesis via reaction–diffusion coupling to create complex products with user-defined chemistry, morphology, and spatial distribution within a reaction medium.},

We demonstrate that the new ML model accurately reproduces the energy bands and wavefunctions of structures outside the training set, closely matching first-principle calculations. This accuracy is achieved with significantly lower computational costs due to the elimination of self-consistency iterations and the reduced size of the plane-wave basis set.

  abstract     = {Significant advancements in machine learning have accelerated and improved structure–property predictions for materials discovery. However, data are often scarce due to large parameter spaces consisting of chemistry, structure, synthesis, and processing variables. At small data limits, theory can be leveraged to inform machine learning (ML) models with domain knowledge and improve generalization. Here, we determine how the accuracy of first-principles calculations affects theory-informed ML predictions of the experimental solvation free energy Δ G solv e x p in both “small” (10 1 –10 2 ) and “large” (10 3 –10 4 ) data size limits. We compare several existing theory-informed techniques to a baseline (no theory) model: feature-informed, difference, and ratio. At small data limits, all theory-informed models exhibit lower RMSE, reducing training data size by more than 65% compared to the baseline model. With larger training set sizes and as theory prediction accuracy declines, the difference and ratio models exhibit larger errors than the baseline model, indicating negative transfer occurs. No negative transfer is observed in the feature-informed model; however, the model is unable to extrapolate outside of the known Δ G solv e x p distribution, whereas the difference and ratio models exhibit lower extrapolation error. Finally, we employ each model in an active learning algorithm and compare two exploration acquisition functions: maximum difference and maximum variance. Sampling with the maximum difference policy reduces RMSE and variance of the feature-informed model faster than maximum variance early in the exploration campaign, as it identifies label bounds in fewer iterations. Our findings highlight the balance between leveraging theory and relying on data-driven models in high-throughput materials discovery.},

  abstract     = {We analyzed the application of quantum machine learning in histopathological cancer detection under adversarial attacks, demonstrating its potential to enhance diagnostic performance in adverse circumstances. Adversarial attacks are one of the major concerns in any image classification machine learning model and are responsible for perturbing the original input images, which, therefore, results in misclassification. To encounter this problem, we first developed the hybrid quantum transfer learning model by incorporating multiple transfer learning architectures such as ResNet-18, VGG-16, Inception-v3, and AlexNet with variational quantum circuits for histopathological cancer detection. Second, we introduced white-box adversarial attacks using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and DeepFool and projected gradient descent (PGD) methods in this model and evaluated each model’s performance against these adversarial attacks. We analyzed that the Hybrid Classical Quantum Deep Learning model (HCQ-DL) with ResNet-18 provides 78.05% accuracy compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 50.84% for FGSM attacks. Similarly, for DeepFool attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 performs 52.12% accurately compared to the Classical ResNet-18 model with the highest accuracy of 37.87% and for PGD attacks, HCQ-DL with ResNet-18 has 52.94% performance accuracy compared to the Classical Inception-V3 model with the highest accuracy of 32.05%. As a result, we observed that HCQ-DL models are more resilient to these adversarial attacks compared to classical deep learning models and show potential to achieve greater robustness when combined with additional defense techniques.},

  abstract     = {Metallic thin films offer a platform to experimentally study the dynamics of microstructural evolution, but the required transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-based imaging generates complex images that are challenging to segment and quantify. This work provides a comparative analysis of a new YOLOv8 model and an established U-Net model for bright-field TEM images of polycrystals, employing a framework leveraging physical observables to evaluate performance against two hand-traced benchmark datasets. This methodology obviates the comparison of large, diversely structured, and manually labeled datasets that are required to assess performance on a per-image/per-pixel basis. It is found that the YOLOv8 model, adapted for real-time instance segmentation, has up to 43× faster inferencing (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090) compared to U-Net and reconstructs hand-traced grain size distributions (GSDs) with excellent fidelity, finding mean diameter within 3% for grains near an optimal magnification; for grains that deviate from the optimal pixel-diameter, the size of small- (large)-diameter grains is systematically over- (under)-estimated. This is partially mitigated by including scale-aware augmentations during training. Moreover, when the bias is corrected post-inference by a rigid shift in distribution, the YOLOv8 model reproduces ground truth GSDs with exceptional fidelity, with statistical tests indicating <5% probability that the distributions are distinct. Based on ground truth data, calibration curves pertaining to this shift can be constructed for a given model. This issue is not present in the U-Net model’s results, indicating that for quantitative measurements where the true size of objects is of interest, special procedures must be implemented for YOLO-based models.},

  abstract     = {Materials informatics (MI), emerging from the fusion of materials science and data science, has the potential to greatly accelerate material development and discovery. Although MI relies on data from both computational and experimental studies, their integration remains challenging. In our previous study, we addressed this challenge by training a machine learning model on experimental data and applying it to compositional entries in a computational database, thereby creating a unified dataset. In this study, we use these integrated datasets to construct material maps that visualize the relationships between material properties and structural features. The goal is to provide experimental researchers with a practical tool for exploring structurally similar compounds and thus their associated routes. We generate the materials map using the MatDeepLearn (MDL) framework, which represents crystal structures as graphs and employs deep learning for property prediction. Statistical analyses reveal that the MDL equipped with a message passing neural network (MPNN) architecture efficiently captures features related to the structural complexity of materials. Interestingly, this representational advantage does not always lead to higher accuracy in property prediction. We attribute this finding to the strong learning capacity of MPNN, which contributes primarily to the organization of data points within the materials map rather than to incremental gains in predictive precision.},

This approach benefits from robust pretrained features, which improve convergence and generalization even with large training datasets. By fine-tuning pretrained deep learning architectures—including VisionTransformer, ResNet152, and VGG19—we accurately predict eigenfrequencies, dilution coefficients, and buckling behaviors. Using a large dataset of 170 000 samples generated with COMSOL Multiphysics, our models capture complex physical phenomena, delivering performance comparable to traditional finite element methods but at significantly reduced computational cost. Specifically, eigenfrequency predictions across 15 eigenmodes consistently achieve low relative errors (1%–3%) with minimal variance. Dilution coefficient predictions remain accurate for lower eigenmodes, maintaining relative errors below 10% for the four lowest modes using static pruning thresholds. However, for higher modes, accuracy deteriorates—potentially due to the increased complexity and localized nature of higher-order mode shapes. In addition, our models exhibit robust performance in classifying membrane buckling behaviors in a binary setting, achieving over 95% accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Artificial neural networks (NNs) can be implemented using chemical reaction networks (CRNs), where the concentrations of species act as inputs and outputs. In such biochemical computing, noise-robust computing is crucial due to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise present in chemical reactions. Previously suggested CRNs for feed-forward networks often utilized the rectified linear unit or discrete activation functions. However, one concern in this case is the discontinuities of the derivatives of those non-smooth functions, which can cause significant noise disruption during backpropagation. In this study, we propose CRNs that perform both feed-forward and training processes using smooth activation functions to avoid discontinuities in the backpropagation. All reactions occur in a single pot, and the reactions for training are bimolecular. Our case studies on the XOR, Iris, MNIST datasets, and a non-linear regression model demonstrate that computation via the CRN (i) maintains accuracy despite noise in the reaction rates and the concentration of species and (ii) is insensitive to the choice of the running time and the magnitude of the noise in comparison to NNs with a non-smooth activation function. This work presents a noise-robust NN and backpropagation implemented by CRNs, paving the way for more stable and efficient biochemical computing systems.},

  abstract     = {Imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), are used to understand the morphology and microstructure of material systems. However, large datasets are needed to relate the microstructure and composition of the material system to overall behavior. Depending on the complexity and cost of the material system and imaging techniques, accurate datasets are difficult to obtain. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) can provide a framework to understand the relation between the morphology and microstructural behavior of material systems. Deep convolution GANs (DC-GANs) can be trained from experimentally characterized datasets to predict the morphology of various material systems. Hence, in this investigation, a limited dataset of 48 SEM images for PDMS with various weight fractions of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was obtained and used to train a DC-GAN. Iterative image augmentation techniques were then used to accurately extend the limited dataset. SEM micrographs of CNT-PDMS were then generated from the trained DC-GAN to predict the morphology and microstructure for different magnifications and weight fractions of CNTs. Error analysis approaches based on generator and discriminator losses were used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the trained sets. This proposed approach provides a verifiable framework for training experimentally obtained SEM microstructural datasets of any dimension that can be trained to understand the behavior of CNT-polymer systems and to augment experimental imaging predictions.},

Greater efficiency in software design to lower costs is of clear benefit to AI customers. It is also, however, critical to acknowledge the urgent need to sustain the otherwise continuous growth of compute power needed for AI systems and to reduce the energy consumption of AI systems, both of which are generally growing exponentially. Hardware has a critical role to play here. Thus, in addition to software progress, fundamental innovations across the hardware stack—from functional materials and novel devices to efficient system architectures and new computing paradigms—are pressing needs. Considering the ongoing climate crisis, we argue for the urgent need for accelerated and connected government- and industry-funded research and development in the hardware domain.

  abstract     = {The aerodynamic stability of large-scale birds, attributed to their covert feathers, has long fascinated biologists and bio-inspired design communities. However, existing theories cannot accurately describe the biological physics of coverts. Here, we propose a theory, based on their biological constraints, by defining covert behavior in terms of two modes: Mode Attach and Mode Deform. To validate the theory and to provide a greater understanding of the physics involved, we conduct a series of wind tunnel experiments using coverts on a man-made wing. Both the biological and physical aspects of this theory are well validated. The results show that in Mode Attach, the covert wake coincides with the wing-bound vortices, whereas in Mode Deform, it detaches from the wing wake vortices. The root constraint level affects the process of transitioning from Mode Attach to Mode Deform. Coverts positioned closer to the wing's leading edge result in smaller coherent turbulence structure scales exhibited in the wake region and higher shedding stability of the wake vortices. Furthermore, compared to those in the clean wing case, the nonlinear vortex packets attached to the wing's suction surface are modulated into self-sustaining attached vortices at multiple scales. Additional anechoic tunnel tests also demonstrated that this theory and definition provide a platform for studying both the aerodynamics and the aeroacoustics of coverts.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, I-V-VI 2 compounds have attracted significant scholarly attention due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. However, almost no n -type counterpart with a similar rock salt structure has been identified within the I-V-VI 2 family. It is worth noting that AgBiSe 2 synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state method stands out as one of the rare n -type semiconductors. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of AgBiSe 2 was significantly improved by partial substitution of Ag + upon Mn 3+ ions. Electrical conductivity ( σ ) of Ag 1− x Mn x BiSe 2 ( x = 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.045, 0.06) compounds increases from ∼39 S cm −1 ( x = 0, at 727 K) to ∼166 S cm −1 ( x = 0.06, at 733 K), while the total thermal conductivity ( κ t ) reduces from ∼0.44 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0 at 727 K to respective ∼0.38 and ∼0.36 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0.03 and 0.015, at 733 K. Accordingly, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT ( ZT max ) value of ∼0.80 is achieved at 733 K for both x = 0.03 and 0.015 samples, representing a substantial improvement by 74% in comparison with the pristine AgBiSe 2 ( ∼ 0.46 at 727 K).

Through systematic investigation, the combination of electrospun PI nanofiber membranes with microstructured PA fabrics maximizes the effective contact area and charge-transfer pathways. The results showed that the PI nanofiber/PA fabric pairing yields an open-circuit voltage of 76 V and a short-circuit current of 5.9 µA under a 20 N load at 3 Hz. The optimized device powered 56 light-emitting diodes and charged commercial capacitors with high efficiency. Additionally, an intelligent security system based on TENG technology was developed, underscoring its versatility for self-powered electronics and energy storage.

  abstract     = {Three kinds of alkaline-metal iodide salts (CsI, LiI, and KI) are blended in the carbon paste, which is then used to coat the carbon-electrode (CE) on perovskite (PVSK) layer, then the resultant CE based perovskite solar cells are treated in a damp chamber with relative humidity of 85%. It is observed that the salt treatment could raise the power conversion efficiency of the devices, and CsI treatment comes out with the fastest rising rate. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies observe that CsI treatment triggers secondary growth of PVSK, as well as the doping behavior at the A site of PVSK. Transient photovoltaic/photocurrent decay curve recording and Mott–Schottky study on the devices show that CsI treatment comes out with the longest lifetime of charge carriers, the shortest charge-extraction time, and the highest built-in potential. Accordingly, CsI blending upgrades the power conversion efficiency from 17.22% to 19.16% (on average, optimized to 19.89%), leading to an increment of 11%, compared to that of 7%,1% and 2% for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. Moisture stability is estimated. CsI blending comes out with a T 80 lifetime (time for efficiency dropping to 80% of the initial value) of ∼209 h, compared to that of ∼180h, ∼67h, and ∼90h for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. The observation is ascribed to the improved crystallization, and molar Gibbs free energy of hydration (Δ hyd G * ) for these alkaline-metal ions. Cs + owns the lowest Δ hyd G * , thus enhancing the hydrophobicity of the CE. Besides, Li + owns the highest Δ hyd G * , thus triggering the “slow-release effect” on H 2 O molecules from open air.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) necessitates maintenance-free, high-efficiency power sources. Organic solar cells (OSCs), offering superior spectral alignment with indoor lighting, are promising candidates for indoor energy harvesting. Here, we develop a fused carbazole-based polymer acceptor (designated as PCzT) with a tailored optical bandgap, rigid planar backbone, and enhanced electron-transporting properties. As a result, devices incorporating this acceptor achieve a power conversion efficiency of 8.15% under AM1.5G illumination and 11.63% under 3000 K, 1000 lux indoor lighting—outperforming state-of-the-art polymer acceptors in indoor applications. Crucially, we correlate nanoscale morphology (e.g., phase purity and domain size) with device performance, revealing that optimized interfacial packing enhances charge extraction and suppresses recombination. These findings provide a direct guideline for designing stable, high-performance polymer acceptors toward efficient indoor OSCs.},

  abstract     = {The building-up process of power conversion in carbon-electrode-based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is monitored by prolonging the annealing period of the lead halide perovskite (PVSK) precursor in the mesoporous skeleton in open air. It is observed that power conversion occurs only after 20 min of annealing, though severe hysteresis is seen due to the existence of an intermediate phase. Meanwhile, the heterojunction structure evolves obviously in the device, from that formed between the electron transport layer (ETL) and PVSK precursor, to that formed between ETL and PVSK crystallites. As annealing time increases to 120 min, the intermediate phase is reduced, and the buried interface of PVSK is strengthened, leading to accelerated charge-extraction and retarded charge-recombination, as well as an upgraded built-in potential ( V bi ). Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) improves from 10.47% to 12.42%, with the hysteresis index sharply dropping from 19.19% to 1.06%. Increasing the carbon-electrode thickness and prolonging the annealing time could further improve the crystallization quality of PVSK, thus elevating the PCE up to 15.26%, as well as the T80 lifetime of ∼390 h for unsealed devices, during the quasi-maximum power point tracking test in open air.},

The largest degradation was observed after a 10 15 e/cm 2 radiation. Moreover, comparative studies indicated that increasing L and reducing t ox can further enhance the radiation tolerance, reducing the threshold voltage shift and subthreshold swing enlargement to −0.29 V and 2.1 mV/dec, respectively.

However, traditional growth of AlScN typically requires substrates such as sapphire, GaN, or SiC, which have complex fabrication processes and hinder their integration and application with mainstream complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Here, we demonstrated ferroelectric Al 0.8 Sc 0.2 N grown on CMOS-compatible tungsten metal and further exhibited its memristor characteristics suitable for artificial electronic synapses. This memristor features a programmable multi-level configuration, excellent retention (>10 4 s) and nanosecond (∼36 ns) ultrafast opening speed, which can enable high-speed and multi-level storage and computation. In addition, biological synaptic plasticity, including spike timing dependent plasticity and the human brain's learning, forgetting, and relearning behavior, was simulated by electrical pulse modulation. Finally, we built an artificial neural network to recognize handwritten digits in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, achieving 93.9% recognition accuracy. This study provides a feasible approach for integrating group III-nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric materials with mature CMOS technology and paves the way for the application of AlScN ferroelectric memristors in the next generation of artificial electronic synapse devices.},

In this work, we develop a multi-physical field microscopic imaging system, which is capable of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution characterization in an individual GaN Micro LED. By integrating fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and time-correlated single-photon counting, our system enables real-time tracking of the evolution of defects under coupled optical, electrical, and thermal fields. Equipped with this system, we systematically analyze the spatial distribution and depth of defects introduced by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Two distinct regions are observed: a narrow fluorescence lifetime decrease zone (∼2 μ m) near the chip edges and a broader fluorescence intensity decrease zone (∼5 μ m). To explain this, we propose a physical model that describes the interplay between defect-induced non-radiative recombination and carrier diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wet etching effectively mitigates these ICP-induced damages, leading to enhanced brightness across a wide range of Micro LED sizes. Notably, this passivation process enables a 3 μ m size blue Micro LED chip to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.6% with a current density of 33.7 A/cm 2 . These findings provide insights into the localized impact of plasma etching and highlight the potential of wet etching for enhanced performance in Micro LED.},

Although various encapsulated CNTs have been synthesized, modulation of their thermal transport properties remains largely uninvestigated, primarily due to the experimental challenges at the nanoscale. In addition, such modulation has not yet been archived in macroscopic CNT assemblies, such as fibers or films. In this study, we propose a direct encapsulation of inorganic clusters into highly aligned CNT microfibers and demonstrate the modulation of the electrical conductivity ( σ ) and thermal conductivity ( κ ) through the incorporation of Mo 4 S 4 nanoclusters. Commercially available CNT microfibers were used as the host material, and the encapsulation was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As a result, both κ and σ were reduced by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to pristine microfibers at room temperature. This modulation contributes to an improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit. The methodology indicates the potential of nanomaterial encapsulation for tuning the thermal transport properties of CNT-based bulk materials, offering a promising strategy for advanced thermal engineering applications.},

The results show that the SEB threshold voltage decreases with increasing LET, indicating a strong dependence on energy deposition. In addition, reverse bias is identified as a critical triggering condition for SEB, which occurs only when the applied voltage is high enough to initiate thermal runaway and cause irreversible damage. To further elucidate the failure mechanism, Kr ions were selected for detailed investigation. technology computer-aided design simulations combined with scanning electron microscopy-based failure analysis revealed that transient current surges can rapidly elevate the local temperature. Once the temperature reaches the melting point of Ga 2 O 3 material, SEB is triggered by irreversible thermal failure. Moreover, the failure sites were primarily located at the edge of the Schottky junction, indicating structural vulnerability in this region.

Using the unique low-temperature electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials, we fabricated a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that exhibits significantly reduced currents under cryogenic conditions. These carbon-based FETs were implemented to construct a carbon nanotube analog operating amplifier (CNT-OPA). Comprehensive experimental characterization across a wide temperature range (293–10 K) revealed that the CNT-OPA's quiescent power consumption decreases at cryogenic temperatures without any degradation in the gain performance. These results demonstrate the strong potential of carbon-based analog amplifiers for cryogenic electronic applications, particularly in superconducting quantum computing systems and space electronics where conventional silicon-based devices face fundamental limitations.},

Under tensile strain, the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the Au/MoS 2 interface decreases and the interfacial binding energy increases, leading to a reduced van der Waals gap and enhanced electron tunneling probability. In contrast, compressive strain has the opposite effect, i.e., compressive strain increases the SBH and weakens the interface interaction. The SBH reduction under tensile strain gives rise to enhanced electron transfer from Au to MoS 2 , resulting in charge redistribution that effectively dopes MoS 2 with electrons and shifts its Fermi level closer to the conduction band minimum. The tunability of SBH and tunneling barriers via strain highlights a viable strategy for optimizing metal–2D semiconductor contacts in nanoelectronics applications.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics devices. However, the intrinsically low carrier mobility severely limits device performance. In this work, we have systematically investigated the carrier transport in 2D hexangular InN based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport theory. The room-temperature carrier mobility is evaluated over a wide range of carrier concentration (n 2D ), with the free-carrier screening effect incorporated via the 2D homogeneous electron gas model. The high intrinsic electron mobility of InN is verified. At low n 2D , the electron mobility remains nearly a constant of 790 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , whereas a peak value of 1150 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is observed at high n 2D . Our mode-by-mode analysis of the scattering events demonstrates that the long-range electron–phonon couplings govern the electron transport. The high electron mobility is attributed to the exceptionally small effective masses in combination with the significant suppression of LO-phonon scattering. Furthermore, we show that applying biaxial tensile strain can significantly enhance the electron transport. At low n 2D = 1 × 10 10 cm −2 , 3% tensile strain makes the mobility increase by 186%. The further analysis has demonstrated that the mobility enhancement results from the increased band velocity and the reduced scattering rates. Our work not only sheds light on the carrier transport in 2D InN but also underscores its great promise for high-performance electronic devices. Moreover, the provided estimation of the gauge factor highlights the potential for strain-sensing applications.},

  abstract     = {Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) has garnered significant attention among 2D materials, demonstrating great potential for electronics and optoelectronics. Although numerous growth techniques have been explored, a definitive solution for large-area film fabrication remains elusive. Moreover, comparing thin films obtained through different techniques is not straightforward. Particularly, analyzing grain size across samples is challenging, making it difficult to clearly correlate growth conditions with the resulting crystal structure. In this Letter, we developed an approach based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology measurements to analyze nanograins in large-area thin films obtained through relevant growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and sputter deposition followed by pulsed laser annealing. To address the challenges in comparing thin films grown by different methods, we propose a robust approach based on statistical grain analysis. By combining well-established investigation tools, such as AFM, with advanced watershed-segmentation algorithms, we demonstrate a reliable method for identifying grains and grain boundaries. This approach allows for a robust and quantitative comparison of film morphology across different growth conditions, providing a crucial benchmark for evaluating and differentiating various growth methods.},

  abstract     = {The metallization of hexagonal boron nitride ( h -BN) monolayer with a wide bandgap is crucial for unlocking its potential in various fields. Although carrier doping is the most straightforward way for achieving metallization, and it can be realized by interlayer charge transfer in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure constructed with another two-dimensional material, current attempts such as graphene/ h- BN and α -In 2 Se 3 /h-BN vdW heterostructures fail in the h- BN metallization. In this work, a vdW heterostructure of graphene/ α -In 2 Se 3 / h − BN is proposed. Interestingly, with the negative (positive) charge side of α -In 2 Se 3 interfacing with h -BN (graphene), the polarization field of α -In 2 Se 3 pushes the valence band of h -BN to higher energy and the Dirac point of graphene to lower energy so that charge transfer mediated by α -In 2 Se 3 from h -BN to graphene becomes possible, driving h -BN to be metallic. In contrast, with the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization of α -In 2 Se 3 , no charge transfer from or to h -BN is allowed, and h -BN recovers its insulating feature. The nonvolatile resistance switching of h -BN by the graphene/In 2 Se 3 / h -BN vdW heterostructure will promote its practical applications, such as memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving both high electrocaloric effect and broad working temperature span in ferroelectric materials is crucial for practical cooling applications, yet it remains a big challenge. In the present work, a large electrocaloric temperature change ( ΔT ) over a wide temperature range is obtained through disorder modulation of perovskite titanates, specifically by introducing an electric field-sensitive Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT) into Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO 3 (BST). Ceramic samples in the BST-100xBNT (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.28) solid solution system show typical characteristics of relaxor ferroelectrics with a high density of polar nano-regions due to short-range ordering of A-site cations. As the concentration of BNT (x) increases, the freezing temperature ( T f ) decreases and the Burns temperature ( T B ) increases, suggesting the extension of the temperature range of the relaxor in the ergodic state. Moreover, the field-induced polarization was found to increase along with x. The observed structurally induced changes in the relaxor behavior are proposed to contribute to the optimal electrocaloric performance of the BST-28BNT ceramic, with a maximum ΔT of 0.91 °C and a maximum working temperature span of 24.4 °C under an applied electric field of 5 kV/mm. The concept of the A-site disorder modulation provides an innovative strategy to develop high-performance electrocaloric materials from lead-free relaxor ceramics.},

However, the fundamental trade-offs between thickness scaling, endurance, and retention remain unresolved. Here, we systematically investigate W/ Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 /TiN capacitors with ferroelectric layer thicknesses from 5 to 10 nm, revealing a critical thickness-dependent performance crossover. While 6 and 8 nm films achieve optimal ferroelectric properties ( ⁠ 2 P r up to 41 μ C / cm 2 ⁠ ) and good endurance, they suffer from accelerated retention loss, suggesting that prominent (002) texture may enhance charge injection and time-dependent imprint. In contrast, a 5 nm film demonstrates a superior endurance–retention compromise. We attribute this to its significantly lower remanent polarization, which likely stems from a distinct nanocrystalline/amorphous microstructure, suppressing imprint development. Through quantitative imprint analysis, we establish that wake-up cycling simultaneously improves polarization while degrading retention—a fundamental constraint arising from the coupling between spontaneous polarization and charge injection dynamics. These findings reveal thickness-dependent design rules for achieving reliable scaled ferroelectric memories.},

However, solid-phase synthesis often yields secondary silicide phases that degrade performance. Here, we investigate the influence of substrate properties using two silicon-on-insulator architectures: one with a polycrystalline HfO 2 buried layer (group A) and the other with amorphous SiO 2 (group B). Both systems exhibit superconductivity consistent with V 3 Si formation, yet structural analysis reveals mixed-phase films in both cases. Crucially, only group A maintains an atomically sharp and chemically stable interface, a prerequisite for phase purity. Prolonged annealing in group A reduces the unwanted V 5 Si 3 phase but also leads to the emergence of Si-rich VSi 2 , likely due to localized substrate degradation. Preliminary atomic-resolution imaging suggests that HfO 2 crystallinity may promote local phase-selective nucleation. These findings highlight the importance of substrate design in promoting phase control and maintaining interfacial integrity in superconducting silicides.},

We investigate the spin transport in TBZGNRs by employing the non-equilibrium Green's functions method and reveal that the electric current is nonreciprocal and spin-polarized in non- PT symmetric TBZGNRs. Moreover, in PT symmetric TBZGNRs, the spin degenerate can be lifted by applying bias voltage. It shows unique nonreciprocal spin transport with opposite spin-polarization under positive and negative bias voltages.

However, here, we report the observation of asynchrony among sublattices by using typical CoGd ferrimagnets, where the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices fail to remain synchronized during high-speed precession. By employing magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that the asynchrony occurs when the resonance frequency exceeds a critical value corresponding to the delay time ( τ d ) between the two sublattices under microwave excitations. The determined τ d is about 60 ps in CoGd, varies slightly with temperature and composition, but decreases sharply near magnetization and angular momentum compensation. These results demonstrate the speed limit of device performance relying on the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices as a matter of fundamental principle, and also indicate that the antiferromagnetic attributes during high-speed operations cannot be described as statically coupled sublattices.},

  abstract     = {The encirclement of exceptional points (EPs) in parametric space has been realized in optical waveguides, microwave cavities, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and so on. However, it often suffers from complex gain–loss manipulation. An acoustic platform to realize the evolution encircling the EP is highly desirable. In this work, an unclosed evolution protocol is proposed, which consists of parallel coupling and buffering branches and evolves through five distinct stages. Buffering the variation of Hamiltonian, inducing the transition to a low energy state, the evolution with favorable adiabaticity guarantees the EP encircling no longer depends on the precise loss manipulation. A non-Hermitian acoustic waveguide coupler (AWC), which is composed of combined cavities and air slit arrays, is presented to realize the encirclement. Experimental results of chiral phase conversion in a 0.5 m long AWC, spanning a broad bandwidth from 9.5 to 17.5 kHz, confirm the simplicity and effectiveness of state evolution encircling the EP. This work paves the way for AWC as a platform for non-Hermitian topological physics and facilitates the practical deployment of acoustic devices.},

Following rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550 °C for 30 s, all dielectrics are confirmed to exhibit the orthorhombic (111) phase by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Electrical measurements reveal that the SL5 structure achieves an outstanding reduction in leakage current, decreasing from 0.936 A cm −2 (HZO) to 0.004 A cm −2 at 3 V, and exhibits the highest remanent polarization (2P r = 29.3 μ C cm −2 ), compared to 27.3 μ C cm −2 (HZO), 22.4 μ C cm −2 (SL10), and 17 μ C cm −2 (SL15). Moreover, the SL5 capacitor demonstrates excellent reliability, maintaining robust endurance up to 1 × 10 11 cycles at room temperature and 1 × 10 10 cycles at 150 °C without degradation and stable retention over 1 × 10 4 s. Importantly, interface state analysis reveals that after annealing, SL5 maintains the lowest and most stable interface trap density within the energy range of 0.25–0.45 eV. The trap state density (6.39 × 10 12 –7.11 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 ) is significantly lower than that of HZO in the same energy range. These results highlight the advantages of superlattice-engineered ferroelectric gate dielectrics for achieving high-quality interfaces, low leakage current, and stable ferroelectric performance, providing a promising route toward high-performance, enhancement-mode β−Ga 2 O 3 MOSFET devices for next-generation power electronics.},

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap beta-phase gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) power devices hold great promise in space applications; however, their intrinsic vulnerability to heavy ion irradiation, particularly defect behavior and catastrophic burnout mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. By performing bias voltage-dependent multiple rounds of statistical experiments with 1.35 GeV high-energy Ta ion irradiation, this work identifies electron and hole traps before burnout in NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs), among which the introduced hole trap H2 ( E V + 0.6 eV, 2.9 × 10 13 cm −3 ) is revealed to dominate the irrecoverable leakage degradation associated with device damage by deteriorating the junction barrier. This trap in Ga 2 O 3 is attributed to the electron energy loss along the ion incidence trajectory based on the “thermal spike” physics theory, possibly resulting in a localized amorphous latent track. Beyond device damage, the catastrophic burnout in irradiated HJD is identified in two distinct regions: Region I (p-NiO/n − -Ga 2 O 3 ) dominated by trap-assisted electric field breakdown, and Region II (n − -Ga 2 O 3 /n + -Ga 2 O 3 ) characterized by thermally driven damage from charge accumulation. Additionally, thermal effects also impact the active area of Region I along the carrier dissipation pathway. These findings provide insight into the damage and failure physics of β -Ga 2 O 3 devices under heavy-ion strikes and inform strategies for improved irradiation hardness.},

In this study, we demonstrate the BPV effects of GaAs wafers oriented along the [001], [−111], and [−110] directions, in addition to those of epitaxial GaAs/Al 0.2 Ga 0.8 As core–shell nanowires (NWs) grown along the [111] direction. Local photoexcitation and the excitation-power dependence indicate that the observed photocurrent originates from the shift current mechanism. Remarkably, the grown NWs, even with sub-micron active volumes, could generate short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltage of several mA/cm 2 and several hundreds of mV, respectively, under white light illumination. These findings expand the range of BPV materials and offer orientation‐engineering strategies for use in developing interface‐free photovoltaic devices.},

Concurrently, magnetization evolves from localized superexchange interactions to conduction-mediated RKKY coupling beyond a critical defect density.

The development of two-dimensional (2D) MFE configurations could further enhance this technology, facilitating the advancement of next-generation microcontroller units. However, most reported 2D multiferroics rely on spatially separated ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers, which introduce interfacial complexities and limit device scalability. Here, we design a van der Waals multiferroic tunneling junction using antiferromagnetic VSe 2 as a unified magnetic and ferroelectric layer, with 2D metallic TaS 2 and Au (intercalated by monolayer graphene, Gr) serving as the right and left electrodes, respectively. Through ab initio quantum transport simulations, we systematically investigate its electronic transport properties. Our results reveal that the device exhibits four switchable ferroelectric conductance states, which can be modulated via interlayer sliding. When the magnetization alignment of trilayer VSe 2 is additionally controlled, the number of distinguishable conductance states increases to 12. The conductance difference is quantified by tunneling magnetoresistance and tunneling electroresistance, which can maximally increase to 8000% and 4000%, respectively, under optimized bias voltages. Our research expands the application of 2D antiferromagnetic materials and provides a viable strategy for designing high-performance, multi-state memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen passivation has been established as an effective method to decrease the interface state density (D it ) for silicon carbide (SiC) devices. However, the effect of nitrogen passivation on the carrier capture cross section distributions of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects is still unclear, which is another critical factor governing the interface recombination characteristics and device performances of SiC power devices. In this work, the local band bending is regulated in deep level transient spectroscopy characterizations to modulate the carrier capture and emission behaviors of interface defects in localized energy levels. Therefore, the distribution of carrier capture cross section is determined as a function of the interface state density. Surprisingly, it is found that nitrogen passivation leads to an increase in the capture cross sections of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects, especially for deeper interface states within the bandgap. Based on those findings, the mechanisms of the temperature dependence of leakage current characteristics are explored, where the leakage currents first decrease with rising temperature, reaching a minimum at 250 K, and subsequently increase further with elevated temperature. An interfacial defect-assisted Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism is proposed to explain the temperature dependence of leakage currents, which is suggested to originate from the synergistic interplay between the energy-level dependent capture cross section and interface state densities.},

While in the classical physical paradigm, the causal relationships are deduced based on physical principles or via experiment, the rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of material structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here, we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By applying ChatGPT to domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining the obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for directed acyclic graphs that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO 3 . This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.},

Metal thiophosphates (MTPs), with their layered structures and tunable electronic properties, are of particular interest. However, the link between crystal symmetry, stacking order, and anisotropic optical behavior remains inadequately understood in MTPs. Herein, we synthesized high-quality, large-sized monoclinic phase of SnP 2 S 6 single crystals via the chemical vapor transport method. Structural analysis revealed that the monoclinic phase is featured by a unique bilayer stacking configuration with a 180° in-plane rotation of adjacent metal sites. This stacking arrangement disrupts the threefold rotational symmetry of the monolayer, resulting in in-plane structural anisotropy as revealed by polarized Raman spectroscopy and consequently optical birefringence. To showcase its application potential, photodetectors based on monoclinic SnP 2 S 6 were fabricated, exhibiting exceptional polarization-sensitive performance under 405 nm excitation. This work highlights the importance of interlayer stacking patterns on the structural and optical properties of van der Waals MTPs, delivering a unique strategy for property tailoring.},

Because the temperature field is primarily governed by the geometry of the conductive tracks, not the overall heater size, the same fabrication step can yield regions with different thermal outputs by adjusting local pattern dimensions such as linewidth and length. This ability to spatially program heating behavior within a thin, flexible film, where heat distribution can be reconfigured simply by changing the biasing direction, highlights its potential for applications in reconfigurable soft robotics, on-skin thermal therapy, and adaptive microfluidic control.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying energy dissipation in dissipative periodic discrete metamaterials remains a challenge, as traditional interpretations of metadamping, based on summing modal damping ratios, do not consistently reflect actual time-domain energy loss in multi-modal systems. The study addresses this critical gap by introducing a framework grounded in a consistent definition of the unit cell for discrete dissipative systems. A single-term exponential energy decay coefficient, obtained through least squares minimization of the transient response, is proposed as a robust descriptor of system-level dissipation. The coefficient approximately captures energy decay behavior in both phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, offering a more physically meaningful measure than conventional damping metrics. The proposed meta-dissipation framework establishes a critical link between dispersion-based analysis and transient energy dissipation, enabling more effective design and optimization of metamaterials for vibration attenuation across a wide range of engineering applications.},

Balancing the advantages of high capillary force of the V-shape and low viscous resistance of the U-shape, long-distance wicking velocity of gradient designs efficiently improved over 40% than conventional V-shape designs. Leveraging the enhanced mechanism, segmental structures with maximized long-distance wicking velocity were further developed, reaching a 100% enhancement.

While traditional PO methods struggle to accurately model edge diffraction effects in orbital angular momentum (OAM)-carrying beams, especially for complex targets, we address this limitation by integrating the equivalent edge current (EEC) theory into the conventional PO framework. By decomposing the Bessel vortex wave into a spectrum of plane wave components, we independently compute the PO and EEC scattering contributions for each spectral element. The coherent superposition of these contributions yields the total scattered field, significantly improving modeling accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate a 20%–30% enhancement in radar cross section prediction accuracy over the standard PO method. The proposed hybrid PO and EEC algorithm offers a computationally efficient solution for vortex EM scattering analysis, with direct applications in OAM-based radar systems, computational imaging, and next-generation communications.},

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides unique capabilities to address these challenges by simultaneously resolving the positions of anions and cations, chemical variations, and structural transformations. Recent advances—including in situ heating, electron beam-induced switching, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and differential phase contrast imaging—have revealed critical insights into phase transitions, potential switching pathways, and oxygen vacancy behavior. However, experimental barriers such as TEM sample-preparation-induced artifacts, high coercive fields, and imaging constraints persist, especially for polycrystalline films.

A focused laser beam dislodges particles from a reservoir, guiding them into the trap via radiation pressure, electrostatic forces, and background air collisions. By optimizing key parameters, we achieve 95 − 6 + 2 % loading efficiency and near-linear control over the number of trapped particles. Our scalable and reproducible approach enables precise particle manipulation, bridging atomic physics techniques with applications in quantum technology, nano-mechanics, and sensing.

Here, we demonstrate the p-type nature of mohite Cu 2 SnS 3 using experimental techniques as well as density functional theory calculations. The experimental results have shown that Ga substitution at the Sn site remarkably enhances the hole concentration and electrical conductivity, reduces the bandgap, and decreases the thermal conductivity, resulting in increased figure of merit. First principle calculations have indicated that Ga substitution changes the electronic structure of Cu 2 SnS 3 , primarily due to the reduction in lattice volume and interatomic bond distances. Notably, the appearance of DOS states near the Fermi level has been significantly increased, driven by enhanced hybridization among Cu 3d, Ga 4p, Sn 5p, and S 3p orbitals, which has led to increased electrical conductivity of Cu 2 Sn 0.80 Ga 0.20 S 3 to 79 S/cm. Moreover, the substitution of Ga in Cu 2 SnS 3 modifies the electronic structure of Cu 2 SnS 3 substantially, especially the density of states near fermi level is increased, which leads to high carrier concentration of 9.38 × 10 20 cm −3 , power factor of 329 μ W/mK 2 , and lattice thermal conductivity of 0.50 W/mK, thus high zT of 0.4 is realized in Cu 2 Sn 0.70 Ga 0.20 S 3 .},

In particular, eco-friendly flexible supercapacitors (Eco-FSCs) are essential for advancing technologies within the Technology with Sustainability (TWS) framework. In this work, a one-step, binder-free, direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering technique was employed for the reactive fabrication of vertically aligned vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) nanorods at room temperature (RT) over a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) substrate. The symmetric two-electrode mode electrochemical characterization in 1M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte revealed a specific capacitance of 160 F/g, a power density of 2 kW/kg, and an energy density of 3.6 Wh/kg. It demonstrated 100% capacitance retention for 2000 charging-discharging cycles, excellent mechanical flexibility, and rapid disposability. For the real-time application, four devices connected in series powered the different colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for over 60 s. Therefore, this work presents a facile strategy for fabricating eco-friendly FSCs with superior storage performance. The fabricated materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).},

  abstract     = {Sodium-ion layered transition metal oxides (Na x [TM 1 , TM 2 ]O 2 , where TM denotes transition metals) serve as potential cathodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity and operating voltage. Nonetheless, the ordering of Na + /vacancy and the cationic arrangement of TM 1 /TM 2 adversely affect their structural stability and Na + diffusion kinetics. Herein, an F − doping method on a typical P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 (NNMO) layered oxide is presented to disrupt the above-mentioned ordering. First, the redox center is altered by the introduction of F − , resulting in the reduction of Mn 4+ and the redistribution of Ni/Mn ions. The TM 1 /TM 2 cationic ordering and Na + /vacancy ordering are disrupted, hence improving ion transport efficiency. Second, as the amount of F − introduced rises, the interlayer gap of the alkali metal layer is extended, which is helpful for the insertion and extraction of Na + . Third, the associated strong TM–F bonds could considerably boost the stability of the NNMO. Hence, the optimized sample P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 1.73 F 0.07 gives an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 85% after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C and 2.0–4.0 V. This study paves the way for constructing P2-type layered oxides with high capacity and long cycle life through a F − doping technique.},

  abstract     = {The development of cost-effective and efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for advancing sustainable hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Herein, an innovative synthesis technique has been developed to fabricate leaf-like ZIF-L architectures on vertically aligned MIL-53 nanoarrays. This approach integrates in situ -grown MIL-53(Fe) nanosheets with sulfur-modified ZIF-L (S-ZIF-L), synergistically enhancing interfacial charge transfer dynamics while optimizing active site accessibility. The S-ZIF-L@MIL-53/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER performance in an alkaline medium, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 336 mV at 500 mA cm −2 . Remarkably, it exhibits robust stability for 300 h at 350 mA cm −2 . In situ characterization reveals the coexistence of adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen-mediated mechanisms, which collectively govern intermediate adsorption energetics and reaction kinetics. The sulfur-doping-induced morphological modulation and oxygen vacancy enrichment further contribute to enhanced electronic conductivity and catalytic activity. This work establishes a high-performance electrocatalytic platform through metal–organic framework heterojunction engineering and defect control, providing fundamental insights into interfacial charge transfer processes for sustainable energy technologies.},

However, the controllable synthesis of large-scale SnSe 2 nanostructures remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present an innovative growth strategy utilizing an FTO substrate as an in situ Sn source, enabling controlled synthesis of large-area (4 cm × 4 cm) SnSe 2 nanosheet arrays. One-dimensional (1D) Te/two-dimensional (2D) SnSe 2 vertical mixed-dimensional heterostructures were further fabricated. The Te/SnSe 2 vertical heterostructures demonstrate significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction performance compared to individual Te and SnSe 2 nanostructures, achieving an overpotential of 0.73 V at 10 mA/cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 110.05 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The first-principles calculation results reveal that interfacial charge redistribution at the heterojunction substantially lowers the water dissociation energy barrier while optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy. This growth strategy establishes a viable pathway for fabricating large-area 1D/2D vertical heterojunctions, and the combined experimental and theoretical findings advance our fundamental understanding of their hydrogen evolution reaction mechanisms.},

Through mass ratio optimization (0.5:1–3:1), the 2:1 Gly–PVA film achieves a piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) of 5.2 pC/N and generates 6 V output at 25 N impact with pressure sensitivity of 0.232 V/N while maintaining >92.3% voltage retention after 1000 compression cycles.

The devices were stressed with reverse voltages up to 3 kV in increasing steps of 250 V, followed by an evaluation of the on-state characteristics after each step-stress. The step-stress testing revealed an increase in on-state resistance of <3% when stressed up to 2.25 kV but degrades to 13% when stressed at 3 kV, recovering fully after 3 h rest time. The degradation in on-state characteristics (current collapse) under high reverse bias stress is attributed to the negative charge trapping near the bottom corner of the fins, which reduces the net conductive area of the fins. The current degradation could be replicated through drift-diffusion simulations, with trapped charge density of ∼3 × 10 12 cm −2 required to match 13% degradation observed experimentally.

Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi 2 X 4 could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.},

  abstract     = {To elucidate the origin of ferroelectric properties and underlying mechanisms in experimentally discovered two-dimensional (2D) vermiculite, we performed first-principles calculations on structures with varying Al 3+ doping concentrations in the Mg–O octahedra. Our results reveal that intrinsic ferroelectricity stems from Al 3+ induced proton symmetry breaking. Ferroelectricity emerges with doping along the x -direction, while doping along the y -direction produces antiferroelectricity. This direction dependence arises because the ferroelectric phase along y experiences stronger short-range ionic repulsion, forcing adjacent dipoles into antiparallel alignment to minimize close ionic contacts. Furthermore, the 2D vermiculite exhibits both in-plane and out-of-plane polarization, with components of 1.47, 1.37, and 0.63 e Å/proton and 0.18, 0.17, and 0.12 e Å/proton, respectively. The formation of a local dioctahedral configuration effectively reduces the ferroelectric switching barrier. Additionally, we designed 1D and 3D-P vermiculite structures to preserve semiconductor properties while mitigating the depolarization effect inherent in the antiferroelectric configuration. Compared to traditional perovskite materials, vermiculite demonstrates superior ferroelectricity and greater robustness during switching. These attributes position 2D vermiculite as a promising candidate for developing low-cost, high-performance room-temperature ferroelectric materials.},

Using density functional theory and spin wave theory, we investigate the effect of strain on the magnetic ordering and low-energy magnetic excitation in perovskite SeCoO 3 . Under biaxial strain and a -axis uniaxial strain, the system undergoes a phase transition from the original G-type antiferromagnetic to C-type antiferromagnetic order due to a significant reduction in the out-of-plane bond angles. Simultaneously, marked changes also occur in both the spectral weight distribution of low-energy spin wave modes and the in-plane longitudinal thermal conductivity. Although uniaxial strain along b -axis does not induce a magnetic phase transition, the in-plane thermal conductivity is nonetheless enhanced under tensile strain.},

  abstract     = {Magnetization switching is fundamental to the functional properties and technological applications of ferromagnetic materials. Currently, three mechanisms of magnetization switching have been identified through theoretical and experimental studies: domain wall motion, coherent rotation, and magnetization curling. Here, we report a different mechanism of magnetization switching characterized by uniform and continuous transformation of a single ferromagnetic microdomain into alternating nanodomains of two magnetization vectors with different directions. Such a “magnetization spinodal” mechanism occurs at the ferromagnetic morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of the Tb 1− x Dy x Fe 2 system when the magnetization vector of the microdomain is located within the region on the free energy curve with respect to the magnetization direction where the second derivative becomes negative, which is similar to the compositional spinodal mechanism in diffusional phase transformations. Further calculations show that magnetization spinodal mechanism enables easier magnetization rotation as compared to coherent magnetization rotation and contributes to large magnetostriction at MPB. This finding could advance the theory of magnetization switching and phase transitions. It could also shed light on the design of ferromagnetic devices.},

This Letter presents a detailed investigation of the Gilbert damping and Faraday rotation of Bi/In-doped Tm 3 Fe 5 O 12 (Bi/In:TmIG) films on SGGG (111) substrates. An increase in indium doping concentration caused the saturation magnetization to rise, and the coercive force decreased along the in-plane magnetization direction. This was accompanied by concurrent variations in the Faraday rotation angle and temperature coefficient. The Gilbert damping factor and ferromagnetic resonance linewidth of the BiTmIn 0.5 IG sample dropped to 7.51 × 10 −3 and 16 Oe at 3 GHz, respectively. In 3+ doping affects the crystal structure and magnetic properties of Bi-doped TmIG, in addition to the coupling interactions between Fe 3+ ions at the a- and d-sites, respectively.

A high-quality yttrium iron garnet film was structured via precise laser ablation to form an integrated resonator system incorporating magnonic-crystal sections. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy alongside micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert framework, we demonstrate that the resonator element induces Fabry–Pérot-like interference, leading to multi-mode spin-wave propagation and selective energy transfer between the magnonic-crystalline and waveguiding regions. The resonator enables selective excitation of transverse modes, leading to distinct directional coupling regimes: at specific frequencies, spin waves propagate preferentially into either the MC or waveguide sections. Simulations reveal mode interference and bandgap effects, aligning with experimental observations. Resonant modes within the system enable distinct coupling regimes: at specific frequencies, spin waves are directionally routed into either the waveguide or MC section, governed by transverse mode formation and Bragg scattering effects. In this case, the modes of directional coupling of the spin waves are associated with the intersection of the dispersion characteristics of the forward and backward waves for the first and third modes. These findings highlight the potential of resonator-coupled magnonic systems for reconfigurable signal processing, enabling applications such as frequency-division multiplexing, logic gates, and adaptive magnonic circuits with ultra-low-power consumption.},

Furthermore, micromagnetic simulations firmly confirm that the magnetic property regulation by electric fields in nanocluster-assembled magnetoelectric heterostructures is via strain-mediated magnetic domain evolution.

Our findings demonstrate that the CoFe–O interface configuration is the most stable and shows a considerable interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of 0.69 mJ/m 2 , with its origin elucidated through layer- and orbital-resolved analysis. More intriguingly, the CFCA/MgO/CFCA MTJ exhibits a large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 1.3 × 10 7 %, resulting from the interfacial spin filtering. Additionally, we reveal that the TMR of CoFe/MgO/CFCA MTJ is only 1.56 × 10 3 % due to mismatched wave function distribution between the left and right electrodes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the PMA and TMR, indicating that CFCA is a promising SGS material for spintronic applications.},

These devices leverage the wave-like nature of magnons to transmit and process information with low energy consumption. However, a major contemporary challenge lies in managing the reflections between cascaded magnonic devices during the design of two-dimensional integrated magnonic circuits. To address this issue, a magnonic directional coupler with non-reciprocal behavior has been developed using interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (iDMI). This design has been validated through micromagnetic simulations. The iDMI induces an asymmetric dispersion curve in the coupled waveguide, resulting in non-reciprocal coupling strength in the spin waves transmitted in the positive and negative directions. The non-reciprocal directional coupler effectively suppresses reflections along the original propagation path, functioning similarly to a circulator to isolate connected magnonic devices. This advancement represents a significant step forward in the development of robust and scalable spin-wave computing systems.},

The magnetic damping of the epitaxial FeV film is revealed to be anisotropic in the FeV/Al bilayer without any spin sink, which is confirmed by the spin-pumping effect in the FeV/Pt bilayers with spin sink. The spin transport between the FeV layer with anisotropic magnetic damping and the Pt layer is anisotropic, which demonstrates by the measurement of the anisotropic SOT efficiency. The anisotropic magnetic damping and SOT can be attributed to the variation of the spin–orbit coupling in different crystallographic directions of the FeV film.

In this work, we fabricate freestanding MoS 2 /NiFe heterostructures with intrinsically high spin mixing conductance surpassing conventional ferromagnetic systems by two orders of magnitude. Owing to the high tunability of the band structure in MoS 2 with strain and charge doping, a 135% enhancement in the spin mixing conductance of MoS 2 /NiFe heterostructures has been achieved using PMN-PT ferroelectric single-crystal substrates.

For in-plane thermal conductivity measurements, we utilize time-domain thermoreflectance, in both concentric and beam-offset configurations, and the time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect. Our results show that the WF law overpredicts the thermal conductivity by at least ∼10% in all films, thus demonstrating modest deviations in predicted thermal conductivity when applying the WF law to dilute AlCu films. Using infrared variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, we demonstrate increased electron scattering rates in the thinnest film ( ⁠ h ≈ 24 nm), indicating electron-boundary scattering drives the reduction in in-plane thermal conductivity.

Here, based on the calculation of the piezoelectric properties of ten types of 2D Janus materials, we identify the sole material Y 2 Se 2 IF, where the contribution of internal-strain piezoelectricity plays a dominant role. We further conduct a lattice dynamics analysis of its piezoelectric properties and find that the A1(6) (9.313 THz) mode contributes 73% of the internal-strain piezoelectric component e 31 i ⁠ , resulting from the large mode polarity and large phonon–strain coupling. The electronic structure indicates that this significant mode contribution comes from high bond ionicity, large electronegativity differences, and the effective regulation of bond length by modal factors. We further analyze the evolution of the piezoelectric components, phonon mode contributions, atomic contributions, mode polarity, and phonon–strain coupling of the piezoelectricity of the Y 2 Se 2 IF under biaxial strain. The results show that strain leads to an enhancement of phonon–strain coupling, resulting in a significant fluctuation in the piezoelectric contribution of the A1(6) mode.

  abstract     = {Nitrogen exhibits a rich and complex pressure–temperature ( P – T ) phase diagram. However, the low-temperature and ultrahigh-pressure phase spaces ( T < 300 K and 60 GPa < P < 180 GPa) remain largely unexplored, resulting in high-pressure phase boundaries in this region not yet being determined, and the Clapeyron slope remaining unknown. Here, we investigated the phase evolution of solid nitrogen at low temperatures (87–300 K) and high pressures (0–175 GPa) along two different thermodynamic pathways: the isothermal compression and the isobaric cooling. When we compress nitrogen above 130 GPa, below 150 K, we find an extended solid (named μ- N 2 ) that exhibits Raman vibron fluctuations, which may be related to exciton–vibron coupling or electron–vibron coupling. Three missing low-temperature and high-pressure phase transition boundaries ( ζ – κ , κ – μ , μ – η ) have been identified by using a self-designed isothermal compression Raman spectroscopy. We also find that the dissociation of nitrogen significantly alters the Clapeyron slope in the phase diagram.},

  abstract     = {Metamaterials can be engineered with tunable bandgaps to adapt to dynamic and complex environments, particularly for controlling elastic waves and vibration. However, achieving wide-range, seamless, reversible, in situ, and robust tunability remains challenging and often impractical due to limitations in bandgap mechanisms and design principles. Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by three to seven times (e.g., shifting from 250–430 to 1400–2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.},

In this work, we study the common organic light-emitting diode material tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III), Ir(ppy) 3 , and show that the yield of free charge carriers from photogenerated excitons is strongly dependent on the electric field in the semiconductor. We simultaneously measure the hole mobility in this material.

Using near-forward Raman scattering, the PP of the cubic Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ≤ 0.09) semiconductor alloy could be measured. While the PP-coupling hardly develops in pure ZnTe, minor Mg-alloying suffices to stabilize a long-lifetime PP strongly bound to the lattice, i.e., with a pronounced phonon character, and yet a fast one originating from the highly dispersive photon-like bottleneck of the PP-dispersion. By combining the advantages of a phonon and a photon, the long-lifetime PP generated by minor Mg-alloying of ZnTe marks an improvement over the PP of pristine ZnTe, which, from the Raman cross section calculation, can only achieve a balanced compromise between the two kinds of advantages, intensity and speed. The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ≤ 0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro- and microstructure using x-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the native phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ∼ 0), considering various Mg isotopes.},

A significant increase in the forward gate current was observed with increasing irradiation dose. To analyze the gate leakage mechanisms before and after irradiation, temperature-dependent current–voltage ( I G – V G ) measurements and capacitance deep-level transient spectroscopy were performed. The results indicate that under reverse gate bias, the leakage mechanism consistently remains trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) both before and after irradiation. However, under forward gate bias, the dominant conduction mechanism shifts from Poole–Frenkel emission to TAT as a result of the introduction of hole traps with an energy level of E V + 0.93 eV.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient halide perovskites (HPs) is critical for advancing optoelectronic device performance. Herein, we systematically investigate the excited-state dynamics of three crystalline systems with distinct symmetries using time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. Compared to the tetragonal phase P4 mm with higher symmetry, the orthorhombic phase Fmmm significantly alters the spin polarization at the conduction band minimum, leading to the classification of two exciton types: charge-transfer excitons and Frenkel excitons. The two exciton types exhibit distinct temporal responses under photoexcitation. To ensure the generality of our findings, we employed a comprehensive set of crystalline models for MAPbI 3 , including Fmmm, Im3, Pm 3 ¯ m, Pnma, I4/mcm, P4 mm, and P4/mbm symmetries, which were optimized and subjected to ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. Incorporating spin–orbit coupling effects to approximate realistic scenarios, the NAMD simulations reveal that the electron–hole recombination in the tetragonal P4 mm phase with a narrow bandgap occurs within approximately 78.63 fs, whereas the orthorhombic Fmmm phase exhibits an extended carrier lifetime of ∼93 fs due to the spatial separation of charge density between electrons and holes. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to modulate the excited-state dynamics in metal HPs through tailored structural ordering, offering critical insights for designing high-performance perovskite materials tailored for optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {The aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) nanoarray is becoming increasingly significant as a photocathode configuration for use in electronic devices and ultraviolet sensors. Traditional photocathode design techniques rely on physical models that utilize empirical data and trial-and-error methods, making it difficult to optimize all parameters simultaneously. This research explores how machine learning (ML) can expedite the photocathode design process by creating a comprehensive database derived from a full-parameter photoemission model. This database includes various characteristic parameters (such as structural, material, and system parameters) alongside target parameters like photocurrent. We compare the effectiveness of several ML algorithms (including linear regression, random forest, support vector machine, and bi-layer/tri-layer fully connected neural network) using the data generated from the physical model. The findings indicate that ML can significantly enhance the design workflow for nanoarray photocathodes and assess the significance of each parameter. The neural network effectively maintains an error rate in performance predictions of around 4.7% while achieving a prediction speed of 13 000 observations per second. Optimal ranges for several parameters were identified, including nanowire diameter (243–347 nm), nanoarray height (278–412 nm), incident light angle (40–60°), Al component (0.3–0.5), and surface emission rate (10 3 –10 5 cm/s).

Here, we demonstrate an energy-efficient exciton–trion switching strategy through integration of monolayer WSe 2 with gold micropillar arrays. Micropillars with radii down to 1 µm induce strong localized strain in WSe 2 , significantly enhancing modulation efficiency and reducing the required gating voltage to as low as 0.6 V—approximately an order of magnitude lower than previously reported values. Periodic gating enables robust, reversible switching between neutral and trion exciton, supporting logic-like functionalities including binary encoding and signal inversion. Combined experiments and simulations reveal that this enhanced tunability arises from the synergistic interplay between strain localization and plasmonic field enhancement at the micropillar apex. These results establish an integrable, low-power approach for electrically programmable excitonic states, advancing integrated excitonic circuits based on two-dimensional semiconductors.},

  abstract     = {Observation of hidden phases provides unique opportunities in revealing phase transition mechanisms. LaCoO 3 thin film is a rare perovskite-oxide ferromagnetic insulator. LaCoO 3 is paramagnetic in bulk, while the epitaxially strained films become ferromagnetic, whereas the origin of the emergent ferromagnetic order remains controversial. Here, we report the observation of an unexpected ferromagnetic order in freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes, even though the strain has completely released in the membranes. Atomic-resolution microscopy revealed that the freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes have maintained a large Co–O–Co bond angle after releasing from the substrates, giving rise to a hidden ferromagnetic phase as supported by density-functional theory calculations. Moreover, the magnetic state of the freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes is controllable by wrinkle formation via transferring the membranes to wafers with distinct surface roughness. Our work proposes an alternative pathway for the creation of hidden phases in correlated oxides and demonstrates that strain is not a prerequisite of emergent ferromagnetism in LaCoO 3 films.},

  abstract     = {Strain governs not only the mechanical response of materials but also their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. For this reason, the measurement of the 3D strain field is crucial for a detailed understanding and for further development of material properties through strain engineering. However, measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction has remained a major challenge for (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In this article, we present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM. The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction. We test the method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrate its application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al 0.47 Ga 0.53 N layer.},

Through the Bi doping strategy, phase-pure β -In 2− x Bi x Se 3 (0 < x < 0.62) thin films with sole (0 0 1) crystal orientation can be prepared at a relatively low growth temperature of 420 K. The Bi doping concentration is up to around 30 at. % owing to the high similarity of In 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 lattice structures. At low doping concentrations (0.2–2 at. %), the β -In 2− x Bi x Se 3 films possess improved crystallinity and present good layer-by-layer epitaxial growth. However, higher doping levels (2–31 at. %) significantly degrade the film crystallinity due to the enhanced structure stress and distortion induced by the difference in ionic radii between In and Bi and the segregation of excess dopants. Devices are fabricated consisting of 0.2 at. % Bi doped In 2 Se 3 (In 1.996 Bi 0.004 Se 3 ) films on mica with layered semimetal Bi 4 Se 3 contacts. Such devices are sensitive to visible and near-infrared light illumination, exhibiting a fast response with a rise/decay time of 3.7/17.5 ms, decent responsivity and detectivity, and good repeatability and stability. In the visible region, the responsivity and detectivity can be up to 20 mA W −1 and 2.3 × 10 10 Jones, respectively.},

Placing the doped layer above the QDs layer does not affect the exciton dynamics. The experimental results are explained by an increase (decrease) in the charged vacancy formation rate in the cation sublattice, leading to either blurring or sharpening of the QD/matrix interface, depending on the increase in electron (hole) concentration at this heterointerface.

  abstract     = {The texture of superhydrophobic surfaces can reduce solid–liquid contact time by altering the droplet impact dynamics, which is widely used in applications such as self-cleaning and anti-icing. However, the influence of the roughness of superhydrophobic surfaces on the behavior of droplet impact has not been fully elucidated, which limits the engineering applications of such surfaces. In this study, superhydrophobic surfaces with different roughnesses were prepared, and the kinetic behavior of droplets impacting these surfaces for different Weber numbers ( We ) was systematically analyzed by combining high-speed photographic experiments and hydrodynamic simulations. The results show that the droplets become more thermodynamically unstable due to the significant tensile deformation developed at the droplet retraction stage with increasing We , and secondary droplet splashing occurs due to the Plateau–Rayleigh instability. Moreover, the critical We for a droplet transitioning from complete rebound to breakage splashing decreases monotonically with increasing surface roughness. The physical mechanism of the droplet splashing phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces facilitated by surface roughness is elucidated by modeling the quantitative relationship between the air spillage velocity and the initial impact velocity of the droplets, combined with the synergistic analyses of the contact force distributions, the internal velocity field, and the pressure field distributions during the retraction phase of the droplets. This study not only deepens our understanding of the complex physical processes underlying the impact of droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces but also provides a theoretical basis for self-cleaning and anti-icing applications.},

However, the limited average power of the modulation laser poses a bottleneck for increasing the repetition rate of these coherent radiation sources. To address this challenge, improving the efficiency of laser–electron interaction is essential. In this Letter, we propose an efficient scheme to enhance the laser–electron energy coupling by employing a perfect vortex laser beam within a helical undulator. The electron beam trajectory is highly consistent with the helical wavefront of the laser field, which improves the utilization efficiency of the optical electric field. Three-dimensional time-dependent simulation results indicate that the repetition rate can be improved by over two orders of magnitude over the conventional Gaussian laser beam at the same input power. We anticipate that the proposed scheme will pave the way for the development of high repetition rate coherent radiation sources.},

In contrast to the previous dual-comb spectroscopy demonstrations directly enabled by the single-wavelength dual-comb all-normal dispersion Yb-doped laser, this work demonstrates broadband spectral coverage expansion in a dual-wavelength dual-comb laser source through an external Yb-doped fiber amplifier and photonic crystal fiber, with little additional intensity and phase noise. To evaluate mutual coherence and verify the feasibility by utilizing broadening combs, we performed proof-of-concept dual-comb spectroscopy of the transmission measurements with a homemade Sagnac filter; the results showed very good agreement with those obtained using an optical spectrum analyzer. It is of great significance to use a periodic filter in the cavity and eventually measure the transmission curve of such a periodic filter.

At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01.

However, how to evaluate the effect of these passive cooling strategies on the solar cell performance was lacking, which is critical for the passive cooling design of solar cells. In this work, an electricity-thermal model was built to discuss the solar cell performance under different passive cooling conditions. Compared with the common solar cell with a glass cover, the sky radiative cooling by improving mid-infrared thermal emittance or above- λ g (effective cutoff wavelength) reflectance in the solar spectrum had a slight effect on the temperature drop or power improvement under natural convection. The core point was to ensure the near-perfect sub- λ g transmittance using anti-reflection coatings, which played the main role in the solar cell performance. A low cell temperature did not mean a high cell outpower under the selective spectral cover, and the sub- λ g transmittance could not be suppressed to improve heat dissipation performance. After introducing an evaporation cooling layer, the output power could be enhanced greatly, showing the wide adaptability to cool the solar cell with little effect on solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in sub- λ g spectra. These results could guide subsequent cooling structure design by integrating different cooling strategies to achieve a near-perfect passive cooling system.},

  abstract     = {Fe doping is widely known to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni-based electrocatalysts; however, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial, with interpretations focused on post-incorporation effects. Here, we uncover a previously overlooked pre-incorporation mechanism: Fe 3+ -mediated redox cycling in solution that directly generates high-valent Ni 3+ species, facilitating the formation of catalytically active Ni 2 O 3 H and nanostructures. Under hydrothermal conditions, spontaneous electron transfer occurs from Ni 2+ to Fe 3+ , yielding Ni 3+ , while simultaneous regeneration of Fe 2+ sustains a self-perpetuating redox cycle for continuous Ni 2+ oxidation. Remarkably, at ultra-low Fe 3+ concentrations, a hybrid morphology featuring both 2D and 1.5D structural characteristics emerges. Most Fe 3+ precipitates as colloidal Fe(OH) 3 without incorporation into the lattice, particularly near critical doping thresholds. The trace Fe-induced 2/1.5D nanostructures exhibit superior OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of merely 225 mV––comparable to that of heavily doped counterparts. Additionally, Fe doping synergistically activates both the lattice oxygen mechanism and the adsorbate evolution mechanism. These findings reveal a paradigm in Fe–Ni catalyst design, wherein controlled dopant-mediated redox chemistry and nanostructure play pivotal roles in optimizing electrocatalytic performance.},

  abstract     = {Air stability issues in layered oxides present significant challenges for sodium-ion batteries due to the high activity in humid air. The fundamental instability arises from inherently weak Na–O bonding, exacerbated by their wider interlayer spacing. Here, we propose that incorporating ions with high electronegativity can effectively modulate the Na + binding strength, thereby enhancing intrinsic air stability. As a case study, P'2-type Na 0.67 MnO 2 (NM), one of the promising cathodes that benefits from its cost-effectiveness and high specific capacity, was selected to verify the above-mentioned concept by introducing strongly electronegative Pb 4+ ions. To synergistically enhance structural stability, electrochemically inactive Mg 2+ ions were also incorporated, resulting in the P'2-type Na 0.67 Pb 0.04 Mg 0.08 Mn 0.88 O 2 (NMP4M8). As confirmed by x-ray diffraction, the reduced layer spacing in NMP4M8 effectively inhibits spontaneous Na + /H + exchange, resulting in excellent air stability. After 4-day air-exposure (20 °C, 50% RH), no significant hydrated phases were detected, whereas the unmodified NM exhibits clear structural degradation. After 7-day air-exposure, NMP4M8 achieved a capacity retention rate of 80.6% after 200 cycles, significantly higher than the 20.8% observed in aged NM. Density functional theory calculation revealed that Pb 4+ incorporation strengthened Na–O attraction, while Gibbs free energy analysis showed thermodynamically unfavorable degradation for NMP4M8. This co-doping strategy presents a promising pathway toward developing air-stable layered oxides.},

These fins are designed to actuate along the surface of interest, enabling space-efficient geometric transformations that influence both convective and conductive heat transfer mechanisms. To evaluate their effectiveness, both numerical and experimental analyses of the conductive and convective behavior of Kresling origami fins are conducted. Experimental measurements are performed in a controlled wind tunnel environment, while numerical results are obtained using a three-dimensional transient model based on the fundamental conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. The results indicate that the contracted Kresling fin achieves a 20% higher Nusselt number compared to the expanded configuration at low Reynolds numbers, along with improved temperature uniformity across the surface. These findings demonstrate the potential of Kresling origami as an efficient and reconfigurable thermal management solution, particularly for systems requiring adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior carrier transport is critical in thermoelectric (TE) materials. However, traditional strategies, such as doping and alloying, always generate a trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility caused by the complex scattering of carriers, limiting the carrier transport properties. Herein, we report a unique high-pressure strategy without introducing scattering centers to optimize carrier transport properties by taking Bi 2 S 3 as an example. The layered nature of Bi 2 S 3 offers a strong response of band structures to pressure. It was found that a unique electronic topological transition emerged under ∼4 GPa revealed by the in situ high-pressure Raman spectra, leading to simultaneous increases in carrier concentration and mobility. This enabled significant enhancement of carrier transport property to boost the electrical conductivity while maintaining a high Seebeck coefficient due to the accompanied large enhancement in the density of states, resulting in a notably improved power factor. Separately, the relatively low thermal conductivity remained due to the preserved layered structure characteristic. Consequently, a record-high figure of merit of 1.05 was achieved at 5 GPa and 744 K, which is higher than those reported state-of-the-art Bi 2 S 3 -based thermoelectrics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of pressure in optimizing carrier transport properties, providing profound insights of high pressure in designing high-performance thermoelectrics.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to traditional dielectric capacitors limited to electrical energy storage, this work proposes a magnetoelectric composite film enabling dual-field energy conversion and storage in both magnetic and electric fields. Such a dual-field synergistic energy storage capacitor overcomes the limitations of conventional single-field systems, where the energy storage density and efficiency are severely constrained by dielectric losses and the intrinsic trade-off in ferroelectric materials under pure electric fields. Utilizing a hybrid fabrication technique combining cluster beam deposition with chemical solution deposition, the Sr 2 Bi 4 Ti 5 O 18 /TbFe 2 cluster composite film capacitor was fabricated on a flexible Pt/Mica substrate. Under external magnetic fields, the TbFe 2 cluster layer generates a giant magnetostrictive strain, which subsequently induces an electrical polarization signal in the ferroelectric Sr 2 Bi 4 Ti 5 O 18 layer via the piezoelectric response, achieving dual-field energy conversion and storage. At a magnetic field of 1 T, the energy storage density and efficiency of the flexible film capacitor increase by 19.2% and 5.5%, respectively. This dual-field synergistic energy storage strategy provides a unique design paradigm for enabling the multifunctional and diversified applications of dielectric capacitors.},

Through XACT simulation experiments, multi-parameter such as bone density, content, elasticity, and viscosity can be characterized qualitatively by extracting XA signal intensity, spatial proportion, and XA displacement time from the reconstructed XACT images. Experimental results showed that this method can provide comprehensive multi-parameter information on skeletal tissue, demonstrating potential application value in the skeletal assessment of osteoporosis.},

The pulse data obtained were first denoised and corrected for baseline drift using a Butterworth filter. Subsequently, pulse waves were fitted using a double Gaussian function to extract cardiovascular physiological information, including the time interval between pulse wave peaks and first- or second-order derivative features. The fitting parameters and combinations were statistically analyzed according to the mechanism of pulse generation, and significant correlations were found between age and parameter H2, heart rate and parameter H1, and blood pressure and parameter W12 (the right half of the full width at half maximum of the main wave). It has been shown that the pulse wave contains much health information related to blood pressure, heart rate, and age. These parameters can be used as quantifiable health indicators with well-defined reference ranges.

Here, we demonstrate that memristors built on wide bandgap semiconductor aluminate nitride AlN possessed a representative prototypical digital memristive behavior through device structure optimization. The on/off ratio of the AlN memristors could be improved to 10 6 using one device cell, which consists of two memristors connected in parallel with a common bottom electrode. We identified space charge limited conduction in the low resistance state and Schottky emission in the high resistance state as the dominant conduction mechanisms. The AlN-based memristors could transform to volatile memory by reducing the interfacial barrier height. We further designed and fabricated a vertically integrated double barrier AlN memristor as a nonvolatile ReRAM on 2-in. sapphire and silicon wafers. These integrated double barrier AlN memristors possess high performance with an endurance of 10 4 , a retention of 10 5 s, and clear switching threshold voltages, indicating a promising nonvolatile memory.},

In this work, tunneling contact thin-film transistors (TC-TFTs) with a high-mobility indium tin oxide (InSnO) channel were fabricated, and the effect of oxygen partial pressure on their performance was systematically investigated. Compared to conventional InSnO transistors, InSnO TC-TFTs demonstrated a significant increase in intrinsic gain and a reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure during the sputtering of InSnO, the output current of the TC-TFTs was improved to a level comparable to that of conventional InSnO transistors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the output current's dependence on oxygen partial pressure is attributable to variations in Schottky barrier height, which are induced by changes in carrier concentration.

Here, we report the synthesis and EWA properties of HE few-layered ( Ti 1 / 5 V 1 / 5 Nb 1 / 5 Cr 1 / 5 Mo 1 / 5 ) 4 C 3 T x MXene (HE-F-MXene), which demonstrated an optimal effective absorption bandwidth of 3.36 GHz (12.8–16.16 GHz, thickness of 1.3 mm) and a minimum reflection loss ( ⁠ R L min ⁠ ) of − 48 dB (12.48 GHz, thickness of 1.5 mm). The improved EWA performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of optimized impedance matching, balanced conduction loss, enhanced multiple polarization losses, and more adequate multiple reflections and scattering, collectively enabled by the HE effect, low-dimensional architecture, and the high-conductivity framework inherited from the HE-MAX precursor. This work will provide an efficient strategy for improving the EWA performance of MXenes through HE and low-dimensional engineering.},

Using a graphene device with an inner contact geometry, conduction through the quantum Hall edge state was eliminated, enabling detection of the photovoltaic response of the bulk QHS. A photoresponse was detected under inter-Landau-level optical absorption of mid-infrared light. We found that the photovoltage in the inner contact device was generated only when graphene was in a QHS, where transport of the device is due to the bulk QHS. These results suggest an emergence of the photo-thermoelectric effect in the localized bulk QHS.},

In this study, we engineered a minimized topological electronic structure with controllable gaps in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , through a synergistic strategy combining bulk antimony (Sb) doping and surface potassium (K) modification. Systematic investigations were performed using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 80 K. Bulk Sb doping effectively induces the formation of topological surface state gaps, with their magnitude dramatically increasing from 10 meV in Mn(Bi 0.95 Sb 0.05 ) 2 Te 4 to 103 meV in Mn(Bi 0.76 Sb 0.24 ) 2 Te 4 , while simultaneously reducing carrier concentration and shifting the Dirac point toward the Fermi level. Subsequent K surface modification induces a non-monotonic Fermi level shift, accompanied by a distinctive “closure-reopening” evolution of the topological surface state gap. We attribute this phenomenon to the transition of surface termination types induced by low-dose K modification and surface potential reconstruction caused by high-dose K deposition. This synergistic doping strategy establishes an effective pathway to achieve the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.},

In this study, we introduce fluorination of C 3 N as an innovative strategy to create a monolayer that features a quasiflat band near the Fermi level. The absorption energy, molecular dynamics simulations, and calculations of mechanical constants indicate that it is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable. Additionally, the orbital-projected energy band structure analysis shows that the quasiflat band predominantly arises from the unfluorinated carbon atoms. Further calculations reveal that its quasiflat band is partially occupied when spin freedom is disregarded. According to the Stoner criterion, spin splitting and ferromagnetism would be induced if spin freedom is considered. Subsequent calculations indicate that the spin-up channel hosts a nontrivial second-order topological phase with spin-polarized corner states existing in the zero-dimensional nanodisk. It is suggested that the spin-polarized quasiflat band can be effectively preserved around the Fermi level when placed on the h-BN monolayer. Taking into account the experimentally synthesized C 3 N and experimentally achievable fluorination for 2D materials, our work introduces a material for investigating the fascinating properties of flat bands and spin-polarized second-order topological states.},

Prominently, symmetry-related mechanisms, such as the breaking of time-reversal symmetry in topological insulators, can lead to the emergence of bandgaps on small energy scales. It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet, established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.},

Throughput analysis of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and the possible magnetic configurations show that most of them look like 2D Ising ferromagnets, while Cr 3 TeF 7 is like an XY ferromagnet. Moreover, Cr 3 TeBr 7 is an ideal candidate to verify the Mermin–Wagner theorem due to its negligible MAE. More interestingly, three neighboring magnetic moments capped by a Te atom in Cr 3 TeCl 7 are ferromagnetically coupled with each other, and then these trimers will form an inverse in-plane triangular spin configuration at an angle of 120° with S eff = 9/2. For Cr 3 XY 7 , their flatbands show very weak dispersion, and the Dirac cones will open a gap due to the breaking anisotropy. However, van Hove singularities at M point still remain intact. In addition, Berry curvatures of single isolated Dirac bands show the opposite and identical symbols at K and K′ points for Cr 3 SCl 7 and Cr 3 XCl 7 (X = Se and Te), respectively, further indicating that they are very promising candidates for valleytronics.},

Improving their ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and photoelectric properties is essential for expanding their functional scope. In this work, we report the application of ultrathin self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for effective surface defect passivation in PZT film. By introducing [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) as a SAM on the surface of PZT films, both Pb 0 surface states and oxygen vacancy defects are efficiently passivated. As a result, the remanent polarization ( P r ) is enhanced from 26 to 31 μ C/cm 2 , while the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) increases significantly from 100–150 to 200–250 pm/V. Furthermore, the favorable energy level alignment between Me-4PACz and PZT contributes to improved polarization performance under illumination. These results underscore the potential of SAM-based strategies to enhance the functional performance of perovskite ferroelectric films and offer a promising route for integrating perovskite ferroelectric films into lightweight and portable electronic devices.},

A characteristic Δ T ∝ E 2 / 3 dependence of the caloric temperature change is found right at the phase transition, which rapidly evolves to a complex field dependence within less than 1 K above the phase transition. An analytical expression for this complex field dependence is derived from the Landau–Devonshire theory which accurately describes the observed Δ T ( E ) ⁠ . In the ferroelectric phase below the phase transition, a linear field dependence is observed. Bipolar electric driving fields lead to additional dips to negative values of the temperature change here, which can enhance the overall electrocaloric effect in this regime.},

  abstract     = {Local dipoles significantly influence the properties of paraelectric perovskites. Potassium tantalate niobate (KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 , abbreviated as KTN) is a perovskite with excellent electro-optic and piezoelectric properties. Manipulating dipoles via electric fields in paraelectric KTN demonstrates significant application potential. Therefore, such dipole dynamics under electric fields are essential to research. In this work, we investigated dipole reorientation under electric fields in paraelectric KTN crystals. We found that, under an electric field of 10 kV/cm, local polarization opposing the direction of the applied field still exists in the KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 ( T C = 13 °C) crystal. Additionally, a macroscopic piezoelectric coefficient of ∼40 pC/N was achieved in the paraelectric KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 crystal by applying a 12.5 kV/cm electric field for 24 h. This phenomenon is attributed to the maintainable field-induced reorientation state of the dipoles after the removal of the electric field. Furthermore, since complete dipole reorientation requires strong fields, in the case of a KTa 0.61 Nb 0.39 O 3 crystal with a T C (23 °C) approaching room temperature, a field-induced phase transition (at 2.1 kV/cm) occurs prior to the complete switching of dipoles in the paraelectric phase. This results in a multi-domain state in the recently phase-transformed crystal. Our findings help in understanding the performance exhibited under electric fields and can facilitate the optimization of paraelectric perovskites.},

The electron–phonon coupling constant is independent of the external magnetic field, while the spin–lattice dynamics are strongly influenced by the applied field. We demonstrate that the magnetic-field-induced modification of the spin–lattice interaction originates from a reduction in the magnetic entropy.

  abstract     = {Altermagnetism combines the advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, offering unique spin-splitting properties in antiferromagnetic materials. Currently, it is established that valley polarization in altermagnetism remains largely insensitive to spin–orbit coupling and spin. We select monolayer Cr 2 S 2 as a model altermagnetic system to investigate the mechanism through which an external field modulates valley polarization in altermagnetism. This effect arises from breaking the diagonal mirror symmetry M x y under uniaxial strain, which lifts the degeneracy of the X and Y valleys, inducing significant valley polarization. Crucially, biaxial strain preserves M x y symmetry and fails to induce polarization. Uniaxial strain simultaneously induces valley polarization and a nearly uniform Zeeman-like field in the reciprocal lattice space, reaching up to 118.39 T under 5% uniaxial strain. Moreover, the symmetry breaking in the monolayer Cr 2 S 2 leads to strong piezomagnetic effects, merging piezomagnetic and altermagnetic characteristics in two-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJs) are core components for spintronics-based probabilistic computing, offering promising routes toward energy-efficient unconventional computing. A synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer configuration has been proposed to enhance the robustness of these devices against external magnetic field disturbance. Here, we systematically investigate the stochastic properties of SAF-based s-MTJs, with a particular focus on their size dependence. We demonstrate that decreasing the junction size from approximately 100 nm to around 40 nm reduces the relaxation time. Importantly, smaller junctions show markedly enhanced robustness against external magnetic fields, achieving susceptibility values below 0.1 mT −1 for sizes under 80 nm. Furthermore, we observe that smaller junctions exhibit enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage, with sensitivity values of around 0.5 V −1 at device sizes of approximately 40 nm, which is 100 times lower than that of conventional s-MTJs. These quantitative results provide clear guidelines for designing robust and scalable s-MTJ devices, essential for advancing spintronic probabilistic computing toward practical implementation.},

Here, using first-principles calculations and spin dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the RuICl Janus structure exhibits a high Curie temperature (T c ) of 319 K, significant DMI, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and spontaneous polarization. Interestingly, as tensile strain is progressively applied, RuICl transforms from the initial PMA to in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which leads to the evolution of spin texture through a sequence of transitions, progressing from a single-domain state to stripe domains, followed by a mixed state of domain walls and skyrmions, and ultimately transitioning to in-plane stripe domains. Furthermore, the synergistic application of tensile strain and an external magnetic field effectively induces skyrmions states. Spin texture modulation strongly depends on the magnetic field orientation. In addition, tensile strain significantly modulates the vertical polarization in the Janus RuICl monolayer. Our findings highlight the potential of the RuICl monolayer as a promising candidate for spintronic devices based on topological spin textures.},

Such advancements can significantly enhance logical operation capabilities, functional diversity, signal processing prowess, stability, and integration density while reducing power consumption. However, it remains challenging. In this study, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the spin-FET based on the altermagnetic monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 with spin–layer coupling can achieve perfect and controllable spin filtering depending on the transport direction. Notably, at zero gate voltage, the spin-FET exhibits a remarkable 100% spin-filtering efficiency (SFE) for spin-up and spin-down electrons along the [100] and [010] transport directions, respectively. Interestingly, due to the spin–layer coupling inherent in the monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 , the application of gate voltage can effectively modulate the SFE and improve the current in the [110] transport direction. Specifically, a positive (or negative) gate voltage enhances the SFE to 100% of spin-down (or spin-up) currents.

Yet, they have suffered the long-standing issue of performance imbalance between n -type and p -type thermoelectric devices. In this work, we have explored a highly stable low-energy allotrope of those lead chalcogenides, namely rockseline phase. This phase is energetically close to the stable NaCl-type phase with a hull distance of only 50 meV/atom. It can be potentially realized by applying elevated pressure on an existing experimental phase. Compared with the NaCl-type structure containing solely octahedron units with an isotropic bonding network, the rockseline structure has alternatively stacked octahedron and triangular prism units, thus exhibiting the appealing feature of hierarchical bonds. This causes the lattice thermal conductivity in the rockseline structure being few times smaller than its NaCl-type counterpart, thanks to the softened phonon modes and concurrently enhanced anharmonicity. In addition, the rockseline structure favors superior electrical conductivity at n -type doping and an appealing valence band convergence feature, being beneficial for the pronounced Seebeck coefficient at p -type doping, causing balanced thermoelectric performances under different doping conditions. As an outstanding representative of the rockseline family, rockseline PbTe exhibits an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.8 W / ( m · K ) at room temperature and an excellent yet balanced figure of merit approaching 2 at both n -type and p -type doping and high temperatures.

The resulting films exhibit a remarkably narrow x-ray diffraction rocking curve (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 0.08°) while achieving atomically smooth surfaces (root mean square, RMS roughness = 1.51 nm). Key innovations include the complete suppression of interfacial transition layers through Sn-mediated nucleation and the realization of true layer-by-layer growth under optimized low-pressure conditions. This synergistic approach combines the inherent cost-effectiveness of Mist-CVD with enhanced crystallographic precision, establishing a viable pathway for industrial-scale production of ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based quantum well devices and polarization-engineered heterostructures.},

Two electron emission signals have been detected in DLTS spectra of all Al x Ga 1− x N samples and the activation energy for electron emission relative to the conduction band edge ( E C ) from the first level shifts from E C –0.25 to E C –0.34 eV and that for the second level shifts from E C –0.6 to E C –0.68 eV upon changes of x from 0 to 0.063.

These findings provide strong evidence that the E C –0.34 and E C –0.68 eV trap states in Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N are related to point defects in the Ga sub-lattice. Finally, a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defect levels in GaN and Al x Ga 1−x N using first-principles calculations suggests that the E C –(0.25–0.34) eV electron trap in Al x Ga 1− x N (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.063) is most likely related to carbon or molybdenum donor states, specifically, C Ga (0/+) or Mo Ga (0/+).},

  abstract     = {Lattice-matched aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) on gallium nitride (GaN) is an attractive material platform for high-power, high-speed GaN electronics. This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of lattice-matched single- and multichannel AlScN/GaN heterostructures. A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forms at the AlScN–GaN interface with a lattice-matched AlScN barrier as thin as 2.5 nm and increases with AlScN thickness, exceeding 2.5 × 10 13 /cm 2 for a 10 nm barrier. Stacking of lattice-matched AlScN/GaN multilayers produces parallel 2DEGs whose total density scales linearly with the number of AlScN/GaN periods, reaching 1 × 10 14 /cm 2 for five-period structures, with moderate average electron mobility of 583 cm 2 /V.s and sheet resistance of 106 Ω / □ at 300 K. Structural analyses reveal that coherently strained epilayers with sub-nm surface roughness were achieved. The electron mobility in the lattice-matched AlScN/GaN single- and multichannel heterostructures is limited by alloy disorder and interface roughness scattering. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements confirm the presence of multiple conducting 2D carrier sheets with less than 15% carrier freeze out, carrier mobility of 851 cm 2 /V.s, and sheet resistance of 78 Ω / □ at 10 K. Lattice-matched AlScN/GaN multichannel heterostructures can overcome the strain-induced limitations of Al(Ga)N/GaN to deliver GaN-based multilayer structures for RF, power, and photonic devices.},

  abstract     = {This work demonstrates an in situ etching technique for β-Ga 2 O 3 using solid-source metallic gallium (Ga) in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on ( ⁠ 2 ¯ 01) β-Ga 2 O 3 films and patterned (010) β-Ga 2 O 3 substrates as a function of temperature (1000–1100 °C), Ar carrier gas flow (80–400 sccm) and Ga source-to-substrate distance (1–5 cm). The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of ∼2.25 µm/h on (010) substrates at 1050 °C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding. Collectively, these findings establish LPCVD-based in situ etching as a scalable, damage-free, and orientation-selective technique for fabricating high-aspect-ratio β-Ga 2 O 3 3D structures in next-generation power devices.},

  abstract     = {Resistive random access memory (RRAM) is considered a highly promising alternative for brain-inspired computing and next-generation memory technologies. However, the conductance states relaxation effect substantially narrows the operational window, thereby exacerbating the occurrence of data storage errors. This study investigates the relaxation characteristics of the high-resistance state collected from a 2 Kb RRAM array which was fabricated in 28 nm commercial foundry. Three distinct drift behaviors of the RRAM resistance states were observed: (1) transient conductance drift, (2) stair-stepping conductance drift, and (3) reversible conductance drift. A programming strategy based on electron release was proposed to identify unstable devices efficiently. The amplitude and width modulation of the release pulse reveals that amplitude modulation has a more significant effect due to a certain barrier height for trapped electrons to be released. A physical model based on the trap-assisted tunneling mechanism is proposed to fit the cumulative distribution function of unstable bits under different pulse amplitudes and widths. Compared to existing long pulse and delay verify programming strategies, the release verify method significantly reduces the impact of RRAM relaxation while maintaining programming efficiency.},

In this work, the thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ l ⁠ ) of the BiOCl monolayer was studied using first-principles calculations and the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, in which four-phonon scattering processes are explicitly considered. Our results indicate that the predicted κ l is reduced from 7.1 to 5.2 W/(mK) after including four-phonon scattering (a 27% reduction). When introducing a tensile strain of 3%, the room temperature κ l can be further reduced by 77% as compared to that of the strain-free case. Such a huge reduction primarily arises from the flattening transverse acoustic branch and the densified low-frequency phonons in the strained BiOCl monolayer, which enables qualitative changes in the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering: from three-phonon scattering to four-phonon scattering. These findings provide deeper insights into the thermal transport behavior of the BiOCl monolayer and underscore the significant potential of strain engineering as a power tool to tailor high-order anharmonic effects for symmetry-breaking 2D materials.},

Two trap states were observed consistently and uniformly, with their trapping parameters quantified. Consistent with the high performance of these 1.55 μ m photodetectors, total trap concentrations were very low, in the order of 10 12 cm −3 . The activation energies of the two detected states were found to be E C - 0.21 eV and E C - 0.40 eV. The near mid-gap position of the E C - 0.40 eV state implies a role as an efficient recombination-generation center and could be an important lifetime-limiting defect for MBE-grown GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 . A comparison was made with an inferior performing GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodiode. DLTS measurements revealed the same defect states and spectra, implying that the sources of these defects are the same. However, trap concentrations were found to be substantially higher for the poorer-performing device. This correlation was further supported by comparing the minority carrier lifetimes of the two samples, measured using transient microwave reflectance (TMR). A significantly lower minority carrier lifetime was extracted for the lower performance device, consistent with higher trap concentrations. It was suggested that the near mid-gap trap detected at E C - 0.40 eV could be an important contributor to limiting the minority carrier lifetime within 1.55 μ m GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodetectors grown by MBE.},

Each layer in ZnSnN 2 \Ag is electronically homogeneous with the chemical reaction limited to the interface region.

An epitaxial growth of the MgO (111) thin film on SiC is demonstrated. We show that the interface is O-terminated by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The insulating characteristics are preserved in the vicinity of the interface according to electronic structure calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the valence band offset is approximately 1.6 eV. Electronic structure calculations for a realistic model constructed using the atomically resolved electron microscopy images show an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured valence band offsets, further confirming the validity of the developed atomic interface model. These findings pave the way for further advancements in MgO-based electronic devices, considering the ability to tailor the interface atomic structure, which could be employed to engineer the overall electronic properties at the interface, including the valence band offset.},

  abstract     = {Resistive switching, a behavior found in many oxide materials, has the potential to enable emerging computer hardware technologies and architectures. We present resistive switching devices fabricated from epitaxial brownmillerite SrFeO 2.5 films with two distinct film orientations, wherein facile oxygen ion diffusion planes are aligned parallel (in-plane) and perpendicular (out-of-plane) with the electrodes. SrFeO 2.5 films were grown on (001) oriented Nb:SrTiO 3 to enable high-quality interfaces and future integration with Si CMOS technologies. Post-growth vacuum annealing and growth pressure were used to control film orientations, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Films grown with diffusion planes oriented in-plane had oxygen-rich, perovskite-like nanodomains spread throughout the film, and fabricated devices exhibited worse switching consistency and more stochasticity. In contrast, films grown with diffusion planes oriented out-of-plane had a more uniform oxygen-rich perovskite interfacial layer above the bottom electrode, and devices built from this film orientation showed significant statistical improvements in switching voltages and cycling consistency.},

For samples without the AlN interlayer, the defects in the GaN channel layer near the heterointerface were induced by the strain from the Al 1−x Ga x N barrier depending on the AlN mol fraction. The density of strain-induced defects was markedly increased near the conduction band minimum to 1 × 10 18 cm −3 peaked at a depth of ∼10 nm from the heterointerface for the Al 0.24 Ga 0.76 N/GaN sample. The AlN interlayer was confirmed to suppress the formation of strain-induced defects. The carrier mobility evaluated by magneto transport measurements was also improved clearly in samples with the AlN layer because of the reduction in the density of strain-induced defects leading to remote 2DEG scattering. We have clarified the correlation between the density of strain-induced defects and the 2DEG mobility for a comprehensive understanding of the carrier transport in strained heterostructures.},

In our experiments, femtosecond second harmonic generation (SHG) signals were temporally broadened to the nanosecond scale through an absorption-and-remission process facilitated by a highly efficient quantum dot material positioned in front of a photomultiplier tube. This process yielded a 77% increase in SHG SI, along with improved image quality. Furthermore, the enhancement in both SI and SBR was consistently observed throughout the full imaging depth of three-dimensional collagen fiber samples. This method not only boosts signal strength and SBR simultaneously but also reduces the risk of photodamage and enables faster imaging. Owing to its simplicity, compatibility with other intensity-enhancing techniques, and ease of integration, the proposed time-stretching strategy holds significant potential for advancing both fundamental research and industrial applications in NLM.},

This is in contrast to conventional vertical-field optoelectronic tweezers (VOETs). The impedance mismatch effects that cause issues for VOETs are shown to be absent in LOETs as the medium impedance appears as an element parallel to the photoconductor impedance instead of being in series. Results from the model are found to be in good agreement with electric field results obtained from full-wave numerical solvers. Demonstrating that LOETs do not suffer from the same impedance constraints as VOETs enables a broader range of suspension media and applications to be explored.},

  abstract     = {Collimating high-current-density sheet electron beams using external magnetic fields presents significant challenges, particularly due to complications such as diocotron instability. To address these issues, we introduce a non-magnetic, plasma-assisted planar collimator in this Letter. In this study, a plasma-assisted planar collimator was developed, and its performance was analyzed by utilizing a pulsed electron beam source to propagate a transient sheet electron beam through it for 50 ns duration. A collimated beam of dimensions 7.1 mm × 0.75 mm was captured near the collimating region, exhibiting notable compression along the beam height compared to its width. This uneven compression highlights the need for a detailed understanding of particle dynamics within the collimator. However, experimental diagnostics using traditional probes inside a planar collimator are constrained due to spatial limitations. To overcome this, a 3D Particle-In-Cell simulation study was conducted using VSim Multiphysics to model the interaction of the electron beam with neutral gas, resulting in impact ionization within the collimator. The simulation results reveal the role of the temporal and spatial ionization profiles that drive beam compression and shaping. A good correlation of compression factor between experimental and simulated results was observed, with the simulated beam size measuring 6.75 mm × 0.65 mm. This work offers valuable insights into the design of collimators for high-current-density sheet electron beams, with applications in high-power, compact microwave and THz sources.},

As the detection is at optical frequencies, the environment is considered as a stray laser, which could be a decoy, a jamming field, a probe field from another ranging application, or a field used to mask the actual probe.

To address these challenges, this study introduces a straightforward and rapid approach involving the incorporation of an active metal, copper (Cu), into a conductive polymer matrix, poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor configuration (CP//AC). This strategy aims to broaden the potential window of individual cells within aqueous electrolytes, thereby enhancing energy density. The synthesized polymer composite (CP) features a layered nanoflake morphology that facilitates conduction pathways, substantially boosting electron transfer and ion mobility rates. Notably, the CP electrode (CP-2) achieves a specific capacity of 935 mAh g −1 at 3 A g −1 and demonstrates cycling stability with negligible capacity loss over 10 000 cycles at 20 A g −1 in a three-electrode system, corresponding to a maximum power density of 8249 W kg −1 and energy density of 189 Wh kg −1 . Upon fabrication of a flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor using CP-2//AC, an 80.3% capacity retention is observed after 1500 charge–discharge cycles at 15 A g −1 .

  abstract     = {O3-type layered oxides, as high-capacity cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), face practical limitations due to poor structural stability, high Na + diffusion barriers, and inadequate rate performance. This work proposes a Ca/Cu/Ti co-doping strategy and systematically regulates the crystal phase among 24 types of layered oxides, from P2-, mixed P2/O3- to O3-type phase, by precisely controlling the Na content and adjusting the transition metal layer microenvironment. The optimum O3-type Na 0.80 Ca 0.06 Ni 0.48 Mn 0.40 Cu 0.06 Ti 0.06 O 2 delivers a high initial capacity of 151.37 mAh g −1 at 1 C (120 mA g −1 ) with 102.56 mAh g −1 retained after 200 cycles, while maintaining 80.67% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that an optimal Ca/Cu/Ti doping improves the Na + diffusion kinetics, where Na vacancies activate Cu/Ni redox activity to sustain capacity under Na + -deficient conditions, and effectively suppresses Mn activity, thereby simultaneously enhancing the cycling stability of cathodes. This work provides a wide range of component-phase regulation, achieving highly stable Na-deficient O3-type layered oxides through a multi-cation trace doping strategy for SIBs.},

  abstract     = {Fluorite-structured antiferroelectric (AFE) dielectric capacitors have emerged as promising candidates in energy storage applications. The AFE behaviors of dielectrics generally stem from an electric field-induced phase transition. Thus, the initial phase composition in the AFE film plays an important role in determining the performance of energy storage. This work systematically investigates the impact of oxygen plasma pulse time (OPPT) on the AFE properties of atomic-layer-deposited ZrO 2 films. As the OPPT increases from 3 to 5 s, the as-deposited ZrO 2 film changes from an amorphous to polycrystalline state. The ratio of cubic/tetragonal phase (C/T) in the polycrystalline ZrO 2 film gradually rises with increasing the OPPT from 5 to 15 s, accompanied by a gradual decrease in defect oxygen. To improve the performance of the as-deposited ZrO 2 capacitors, post-annealing is performed at 450 °C for 30 min in the forming gas. It is found that the post-annealing increases the concentration of the T phase in the ZrO 2 films, which reduces gradually with prolonging the OPPT. For the amorphous as-deposited ZrO 2 film under an OPPT of 3 s, the post-annealing generates the largest maximum polarization ( P max ) and energy storage density, corresponding to 19.7 μ C/cm 2 and 34.7 J/cm 3 , respectively. The results indicate that the AFE properties of the ZrO 2 film are determined by the T phase content, which can be modulated by the oxygen plasma dosing duration and post-annealing. Our findings provide a different perspective for improving the energy storage performance of AFE capacitors.},

Current strategies, such as compositional engineering or additive passivation, partially mitigate these issues but often overlook critical factors like carrier extraction efficiency and interfacial energy-level alignment. Here, we introduce a PEDOT:PSS/NiO x bilayer hole transport layer (HTL) that optimizes energy-level alignment, achieving a threefold enhanced hole extraction rate ( k H = 1.17 × 10 8 s −1 ). Comprehensive microscopic analyses reveal that the optimized bilayer HTL effectively reduces localized charge accumulation, kinetically suppressing ion migration and phase separation. Consequently, the perovskite film retains compositional homogeneity under prolonged illumination, substantially enhancing both photovoltaic performance and operational stability.

However, obtaining excellent morphology of the active layer is an important challenge for achieving efficient all-PSCs. In this work, a ternary-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy is used to optimize the morphology of all-PSCs. The polymers PM6, PM1, and PY-IT are selected as host donor, guest donor, and acceptor to fabricate a series of LbL all-PSCs, respectively. The high compatibility between PM6 and PM1 promotes the formation of an alloy state within the active layer, which enhances molecular arrangement orderliness and crystallinity, and vertical structural phase distribution. The ternary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6:PM1/PY-IT exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.10% and better stability compared to the binary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6/PY-IT with a PCE of 16.96%. The optimized ternary LbL all-PSCs retain over 82% of their initial PCE after 790 h of storage in a glovebox. This research demonstrates that the effective combination of dual-donor ternary strategy and the LbL strategy provides a feasible route for achieving high-performance all-PSCs through regulating the morphology of the active layer.},

  abstract     = {Organic–silicon hybrid solar cells, as dopant-free heterojunction devices, hold significant potential for achieving high performance-to-cost ratios in photovoltaics. Critical to their advancement is the engineering of carrier-selective contacts that minimize interfacial losses. Here, we demonstrate a carbazole-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM), [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz), as an efficient electron-selective layer in [poly(3,4 ethylenedi oxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)]/Si solar cells. The Me-4PACz SAM introduces a directional dipole moment at the c-Si/Al interface, generating a built-in electric field that enhances electron extraction. This interface modification leads to a linear Ohmic contact, reducing the contact resistivity between n-Si and the metal electrode interface to 4.12 mΩ cm 2 . Consequently, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.75% with a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 651 mV and fill factor of 78.03%, representing a ∼14% relative PCE improvement over the control device (PCE = 14.75%).

  abstract     = {We report a method of engineering a reversible change in interlayer bonding between layers of exfoliated thin films of MoS 2 by means of hydrogen intercalation through forming gas annealing. Interlayer bonding strength is probed through the behavior of MoS 2 under process-induced strain engineering, where two-dimensional (2D) flakes are encapsulated with a deposited stressed thin film layer to transfer strain into the underlying 2D materials. It is shown that after forming gas annealing, the depth of the strain transferred into multilayer MoS 2 is enhanced as determined through layer-thickness-dependent Raman spectroscopic mapping. This change represents a transition from a 2D van der Waals-bonded material in the as-exfoliated samples to a more three-dimensional (3D)-bonded system in the annealed samples. We demonstrate the reversibility of this effect by means of vacuum annealing of previously forming gas annealed samples. The process of forming gas annealing itself also imparts strain into MoS 2 due to a combination of 2D-to-3D bonding transition with differential thermal mismatch between the MoS 2 and the substrate. These strains are shown to be retained after the vacuum annealing process, despite the transition back to 2D bonding. Since forming gas annealing is a common technical process in engineering 2D electronic devices, these results represent an important consideration in understanding non-intentionally applied strains due to changes in the mechanical properties of 2D materials.},

To overcome these challenges, we develop NanoGap, a piezoelectric-driven strain platform that achieves full compatibility with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques while enabling continuous strain in multilayer vdW crystals. Applying this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride flakes (20–50 nm thickness), we achieve 1.2% uniaxial tensile strain, as quantified through in situ atomic force microscopy measurements. Moreover, our strain-SPM integration reveals the direct correlation between progressive lattice deformation and phonon polariton dispersion alterations, as demonstrated through photo-induced force microscopy.

Systematic studies revealed an optimal relationship between EBI dose and MoS 2 layer thickness, with field-effect mobility ( μ EF ) as a key metric. Under an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and an irradiation dose of 600 µC/cm 2 , 7 nm thick MoS 2 FETs achieved a μ FE exceeding 150 cm 2 /V s, representing a tenfold improvement over untreated devices, while contact resistance decreased significantly to 1.4 kΩ µm, an order of magnitude reduction. The observed performance improvement is attributed to EBI-induced sulfur vacancies, which narrow the Schottky barrier width by approximately 45% and enhance electron injection efficiency.

However, due to the large thermal expansion coefficient difference between perovskite and inorganic substrate, such heterostructure faces the challenge of thermal stress induced mechanical instability. This problem will be extremely severe for the thick perovskite film for radiation detection because the thermal strain energy accumulates with film thickness. Here, first by theoretical analysis, we quantized the thermal stress instability and found that a temperature variation of only 20 °C around room temperature will suffice to delaminate a 100 µm thick perovskite film from the substrate, which prediction agrees with experiments. We then proposed to promote the heterostructure's mechanical stability by increasing the perovskite nucleation rate on inorganic substrate to enhance the interface adhesive energy. Based on a sacrificial seeding layer, we realized stable interface between the thick perovskite film and the typical inorganic substrate, including indium tin oxide, silicon, and gallium nitride that can withstand at least 100 cycles of temperature variation between 25 and 150 °C and then fabricated high performance radiation detectors based on such heterostructures.},

Time-resolved spectroscopic investigations indicate that Al 3+ induces intermolecular aggregation of gold nanoclusters, thereby promoting the radiative transition of the excited triplet state and enhancing the energy transfer efficiency to molecular oxygen. The strategy presented herein offers a convenient approach for developing high-performance metal nanocluster-based photosensitization systems.},

  abstract     = {Lead-free Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 perovskite memristors have emerged as promising candidates for nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing due to their environmental friendliness and stability. However, their practical applications are hindered by severe endurance degradation during repetitive resistive switching (RS) cycles, attributed to incomplete RESET of conductive filaments (CFs) at grain boundaries (GBs). Herein, we systematically investigate this degradation mechanism and propose two innovative strategies to enhance device endurance: (1) grain engineering via thermal annealing to reduce GB density and (2) GB passivation using polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives. By optimizing annealing temperatures (100–250 °C), Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 films exhibit progressively larger grain sizes (158.6–295.2 nm), which delays high resistance state degradation by minimizing CF nucleation sites. However, residual GBs still permit partial Ag accumulation. To address this, PEG incorporation chemically passivates GBs, effectively blocking ion migration and trapping. The optimized PEG-passivated Ag/Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 :PEG/ITO memristor achieves remarkable improvements: endurance is extended from 100 to 1000 cycles, and the switching window expands from 6 to 176 times. Furthermore, the optimized device demonstrates continuous conductance modulation for multilevel storage and synaptic function emulation, enabling a 784–100–10 fully connected neural network to achieve 92.2% recognition accuracy on the MNIST dataset after 100 training epochs. This study elucidates the GB-mediated degradation mechanism and demonstrates that combining grain size optimization with GB passivation provides a universal framework for high-performance RS devices in neuromorphic computing and nonvolatile memory.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) material-based devices hold significant promise for next-generation electronics, yet their performance is often compromised by interfacial defects, material degradation, and electrode incompatibility. In this work, we report a transistor featuring a MoS 2 /graphite heterojunction with a platinum (Pt) bottom source and a mechanically transferred graphite top drain electrode. This architecture preserves the structural integrity of MoS 2 while optimizing interfacial properties. The device, fabricated via pre-patterned Pt deposition and sequential dry transfer of MoS 2 and graphite, exhibits exceptional performance metrics: a rectification ratio exceeding 10 6 , an ideality factor of ∼1.47, and a switching ratio of about 6 × 10 6 at room temperature. Energy band analysis reveals that rectification originates from asymmetric Schottky barriers at the MoS 2 /electrode interfaces, where negative drain–source bias enables carrier conduction, while positive bias blocks current via channel depletion. We demonstrate that Pt electrodes outperform Ag counterparts due to strategically engineered potential barriers that suppress electron leakage. Dynamic rectification measurements confirm reliability under switching cycles, enabling dual-mode functionality as a reconfigurable AND logic gate and an optoelectronic ternary-state output unit. This work establishes a scalable framework for high-frequency, energy-efficient nanoelectronics, effectively bridging the gap between the theoretical promise of 2D materials and their multifunctional practical applications.},

Here, we investigate the utility of low-energy ion beam etching (IBE), a physical patterning technique, as an alternative to reactive ion etching for fabricating low-loss superconducting resonators. We use niobium (Nb) resonators as a test platform, leveraging their well-characterized performance metrics for benchmarking. To address IBE-induced surface redeposition, we introduce an in situ aluminum capping layer combined with targeted post-fabrication chemical treatment. This strategy yields resonators with internal quality factors as high as 6 × 10 5 in the single-photon regime at 50 mK. These results establish low-energy IBE as a promising patterning technique for superconducting devices, with the potential to accelerate development across chemically diverse and multilayered material platforms.},

Due to the small magnetic moment and delocalization feature of d 0 magnetism, the skyrmions exist under an out-of-plane magnetic field in the range of 1.0–5.0 T, persisting at temperatures up to 150 K. The bimerons are generated by applying an in-plane magnetic field. With increasing tensile strain, the density of both skyrmions and bimerons can be significantly increased in In 2 NO 2 . Moreover, by constructing the In 2 NO 2 /MoSe 2 heterostructure, the ferroelectric switching on and off skyrmion phase is utilized for encoding binary states “0” and “1.” These findings enrich the material family with d 0 topological magnetic states for developing topologically physical devices.},

Strong negative thermal expansion emerges along the c axis over magnetic ordering temperature range from 10 to 200 K, yet normal positive thermal expansion is observed within basal plane, thus yielding a volumetric low thermal expansion (α v = +2.9 × 10 −6 K −1 , 10–200 K). Moreover, a high magnetic field of 2 Tesla is found to suppress the interplanar spiral magnetic ordering but have weak impact on NTE. These findings imply magnetic disorder may be more essential than the change of magnetic texture for inducing a thermal expansion anomaly in such NTE systems.},

Mn 3 Ga possesses the highest Néel temperature among this family, providing huge potential for realistic spintronic device application. However, the small anomalous Hall conductivity of Mn 3 Ga makes it lack competitiveness. In this paper, c axis oriented Mn 3 Ga thin films with D0 19 hexagonal structure were prepared by optimizing the MgO(111) substrate temperature. Large anomalous Hall resistivity up to 1.53 μ Ω cm at 300 K is observed for (0002) oriented Mn 3 Ga film grown at 450 °C, corresponding to a Hall conductivity of about 30 Ω −1 cm −1 . Further analysis indicates that the skew-scattering mechanism, which is attributable to the presence of a small amount of the D0 22 -Mn 3 Ga phase, is the main source for the large Hall conductivity observed here. These results raise the intriguing prospect of Mn 3 Ga films as a key component in antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

While the threshold current scales linearly with magnetic damping at a fixed OOP field, a distinct non-monotonic behavior emerges with varying OOP field strength, giving rise to a tunable current–field minimum. This phenomenon is consistently observed across constriction widths ranging from 20 to 150 nm and is particularly pronounced in narrower constrictions. As the OOP angle decreases, the current–field minimum shifts toward lower field values, reflecting changes in spin-wave localization and spin-transfer torque efficiency. Analysis with an extended macrospin model reveals that the observed behavior results from transitions between distinct spin-wave localization regimes, each associated with varying degrees of radiation losses, driven by geometry-induced demagnetizing fields under different OOP field strengths. These findings provide key insight into the complex auto-oscillation dynamics of nano-constriction SHNOs and establish a strategic pathway to optimize current–field conditions, paving the way for energy-efficient and scalable SHNO networks in neuromorphic and unconventional computing applications.},

Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO 3 across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ∼ 10 20 cm −3 , the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report.

  abstract     = {Emission coherence is crucial for quantum photonic technologies like single-photon emitters. However, emission from most bulk semiconductors suffers from severely limited coherence times under non-resonant excitation, typically in the femtosecond to picosecond range. In this study, we investigate the temporal coherence properties of excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) using interferometric Fourier spectroscopy. We reveal a coherence time of approximately 24 ps and a homogeneous linewidth of 0.017 nm (55 μ eV) at 4.7 K under non-resonant two-photon excitation. We also analyze the impact of relaxation, scattering, and the experimental setup on the decrease in coherence time. The 1S orthoexciton shows robust photoluminescence intensity and negligible spectral diffusion over 120 min. These results suggest that Cu 2 O presents itself as an exceptional material for generating indistinguishable single photons, demonstrating considerable potential for advanced applications in quantum photonics.},

  abstract     = {Chemically robust III-nitrides (III-N) with bandgaps in the visible spectral range are critical for advancing emerging technologies such as solar-driven photocatalysis and optoelectronics. Conventional methods for bandgap reduction of GaN, such as increasing indium content in InGaN alloys, are limited by lattice mismatch strain-induced defects that compromise device performance. Incorporating small number of anions like arsenic (As) or antimony (Sb) offers an alternative through significant band bowing in GaN; however, achieving high visible emission efficiency remains challenging for in situ epitaxial incorporation due to thermodynamic barriers of limited solubility. This study demonstrates high-temperature (550 and 1000 °C) ion implantation as an effective strategy to tailor the spectral response of various GaN semiconductor structures into the visible range, achieving bright room-temperature photoluminescence at ∼485 and ∼550 nm for As- and Sb-related emissions, respectively. Notably, the implanted impurity concentration is only at the ∼1 × 10 19 cm −3 level and localized at a depth of ∼30 nm below the surface. Based on density functional theory calculations, the observed As-related emission arises from a combined effect of valence band edge shifting by As replacing N isoelectronically and an Arsenic interstitial (As i 3+ ) defect level formation. The Sb-related emission was attributed only to the substitutional Sb in N site (Sb N 0 ) related band energy shift, as previously reported for epitaxial incorporation. This work establishes high-temperature ion implantation as a viable technique to enable effective concurrent impurity activation and crystal damage repair, opening pathways for deep-level defect and bandgap engineering in GaN for energy conversion and photonic and quantum applications.},

To address this challenge, we employ swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation—516 MeV Xe ions—on Pt/SrTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 devices, introducing controlled ion track defects that guide filament formation. The irradiated memristors demonstrate remarkable performance improvements, achieving a lower SET voltage of 0.65 V (compared to 0.85 V for unirradiated devices), extended retention (>10 6 s vs <10 5 s), and superior stability (σ/μ = 0.06/0.06 vs 0.14/0.04). Moreover, these devices reliably emulate synaptic plasticity with minimal cycle-to-cycle variations (<7.2%), enabling high-fidelity neuromorphic applications. When deployed in simulated neural networks for handwritten digit recognition, the irradiated memristors attain a recognition accuracy of 91.6%, showcasing their robustness in real-time computing tasks.

Unlike conventional TMDs, Janus TMDs lack mirror symmetry and exhibit a built-in in-plane dipole due to their asymmetric atomic configuration. A larger electronegativity gradient across the Janus TMDs leads to enhanced charge redistribution at the vdWH interface and a stronger in-plane dipole, resulting in unusual Fermi-level pinning (FLP). The calculated pinning factors for 1T-TMDs/MoSTe and 1T-TMDs/WSTe vdWHs are particularly low, reflecting a strong FLP effect. Despite the wide variation in work functions among the 1T-TMDs, their Fermi levels are consistently pinned near the band edges of MoSTe and WSTe, enabling quasi-Ohmic or Ohmic p -type and n -type contacts. Furthermore, the vdWHs exhibit low tunneling-specific resistivity, confirming their potential for ultra-low contact resistance applications in next-generation single-layer transistors.},

Furthermore, h-MWA significantly enhanced device reliability under gate bias stress, mitigating time-dependent threshold voltage shifts (ΔV th ) and increasing charge trapping time (τ).

In the device aspect, the mesa termination and the partially suspended field plate, which can be formed simultaneously by adding Cl 2 during the inductively coupled plasma etching process to facilitate isotropic etching of β- Ga 2 O 3 , effectively mitigate the electric field crowding phenomenon at the device edge, thereby reducing the electric field peaks both in the epitaxial layer and dielectric layer and improving the breakdown voltage ( BV ).

The integration of the narrow-bandgap VO 2 film with the wide-bandgap SiC creates a Z-type heterojunction, which significantly enhances photocurrent due to the built-in electric field at the interface. Furthermore, a notable increase in photocurrent is achieved by the deposition of gold nanoparticles on the device's surface. This modification enhances the local electric field via the plasmonic effects, thereby further improving photocurrent. The synergistic effect of the plasmonic field enhancement effect and the built-in electric field of the heterojunction enhances the generation, separation, and transport efficiency of photogenerated carriers, ultimately resulting in a superior photocurrent response.

Unlike pure perovskites, the orthorhombic-to-cubic transition in mixed halide perovskites involves octahedral distortions and halogen migration. This ion migration facilitates a uniform halogen distribution within the structure, correcting the initially uneven arrangement. The dynamics of octahedral distortions are also examined, with accurate changes in Pb-X bond lengths and distortion angles identified throughout the transition. This cubic phase helps suppress ion migration, as supported by first-principles calculations.

Owing to the unique sp 2 /sp 3 hybrid structure of ND, the electron transfer at high temperature enhances the electron density on the ND surface, creating a reducing environment for the exsolution of Co NPs. The electrocatalyst exhibits significantly reduced overpotentials (265 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 327 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ), a small Tafel slope of 52.14 mV dec −1 , and good stability (88.9% of initial current density after a chronoamperometric durability test). This enhancement primarily results from the exsolution of Co NPs, which increases the number of active sites.

The ZrTe 3 interconnects fabricated with a conventional photolithography process show high contact resistance, low breakdown current density, and electromigration-dominated structural breakdown characteristics. By supplementing a reactive ion etching step to reduce contact resistance, the breakdown current density and structural characteristics change significantly. Further contact resistance reduction by adopting a transfer process promotes significantly increased breakdown current density and distinct thermal decomposition-dominated structural characteristics.

  abstract     = {Zoom lenses are essential for optical imaging applications. The development of metasurfaces offers an approach to overcoming the complexities and bulkiness of conventional zoom systems. Most current tunable zoom metalenses only adjust focus in axial or transverse directions and lack multi-dimensional light field adjustment capabilities. In this study, a dual-polarization responsive three-dimensional zoom metalens based on the Moiré lens effect was designed. The metalens can provide continuous three-dimensional control of the focal point by adjusting the rotation angles of the three metasurfaces, achieving micrometer-level positioning accuracy across the entire spatial range. Furthermore, the metalens exhibits phase modulation characteristics associated with chirality. Specifically, when the incident light is excited in different circular polarization states (right-handed and left-handed), it produces a focal field distribution that depends on the polarization state. This is important for acquiring multi-dimensional information and enhancing target features in complex scenes. The metalens achieves axial zoom ranges of 1–6.5× for right handed circularly polarized light and 1–5.7× for left-handed circularly polarized light, with lateral deflection angles of ±12.5° and ±15.4°, respectively. The focusing efficiencies reach 65.2% and 67.1% for right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. This dual-polarization three-dimensional zoom metalens shows great promise for machine vision, microscopic imaging, and dynamic three-dimensional tracking, advancing multifunctional integrated optical systems.},

  abstract     = {We study Fabry–Pérot bound states in the continuum (FP-BIC) in the GHz frequency range in a metal-walled rectangular waveguide with two ceramic disks placed inside it. The disks act as perfect reflectors at the resonance frequency, and the energy becomes perfectly trapped between the disks, forming an FP-BIC when the distance between them satisfies the Fabry–Pérot quantization condition. We investigate the system both theoretically and experimentally, revealing how the total and radiative quality ( Q ) factor depends on the inter-disk distance. We gain valuable insights into the Fano features observed in the transmission spectra using the quasi-normal mode technique and temporal coupled-mode theory. Notably, we find that as the system approaches the BICs, the Fano asymmetry parameters diverge, resulting in a Lorentzian peak in the transmission spectrum. The experimentally measured radiative Q factor is on the order of 10 5 ⁠ , while the total Q factor, limited by material losses, remains around 10 3 ⁠ . These results open up new possibilities for utilizing BICs in microwave technology, with the potential to significantly enhance the performance of microwave devices.},

Results showed a clear dependence on metal type, with charge polarity and magnitude following a descending trend from positive to negative: Pb > Al > Fe > Cu > Sn. The observed trends correspond strongly with the triboelectric series, indicating that triboelectric charging is the primary charge generation mechanism. Other factors, such as electrochemical reactions, thermoelectric effects, wettability, and pre-existing droplet charge, showed limited influence.

We also investigate the laser-induced damage characteristics of diamond and the system's operational stability. Owing to diamond's high laser-induced damage threshold and exceptional thermal stability, the SC exhibits significant potential for long-term stable operation at high pump energies. Furthermore, simulations effectively corroborate experimental observations, indicating that longer crystals and smaller pump numerical apertures facilitate broader SC generation. These results establish diamond as a promising nonlinear medium for SC generation, offering superior characteristics including an ultra-broadband spectrum (covering the entire visible range), excellent spectral reproducibility, and high-energy output.},

Introducing an extra algorithm to optical differentiation will further extend its functionality. Here, we integrate an omnidirectional subtracter with a multi-order optical differentiator via combining distinct spiral lens phases with deflection phases. With this design, zeroth-, first-, and second-order differentiations are spatially separated, and the local linear polarization always orients toward the normal of optical edges for linearly polarized incidence. Thereby, selective edge subtractions can be carried out through simply rotating a polarizer. The design is verified in a photopatterned liquid crystal, whose electro-optical tunability enables a broadband operation across the entire visible spectrum. Rotating a polarizer confirms omnidirectional edge extraction in first- and second-order differentiations while preserving the zeroth-order bright field imaging. The direction-selective defect suppression enhances applications like rainy-day autonomous driving and object recognition in directional noise.

Here, we investigate how defect positioning affects lasing performance in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) with three defect layers. Simulations reveal that synchronously displacing the first two defect layers toward the third layer significantly enhances the central defect mode's density of states (DOS), particularly in asymmetric configurations near the third defect layer. This asymmetry-induced DOS enhancement boosts dye emission efficiency. Experimentally, we use wedge-shaped LC films to continuously tune defect positions and observe that asymmetric structures near the third defect layer exhibit higher lasing intensity and a lower threshold. The threshold of the asymmetric structure could be reduced by a factor of 3.4 compared to the symmetric structure. Our findings provide a strategy for low-threshold CLC lasers by leveraging defect positioning.},

This technique overcomes challenges of other pixel shifting techniques, as the electrowetting prism is transmissive, can achieve high framerates, and has no mechanical moving parts. We apply electrowetting wobulation to an optical sectioning structured illumination microscope and demonstrate lateral shifting of a structured pattern while maintaining optical sectioning, which requires high quality images. We characterize the optical sectioning strength across multiple spatial frequencies, as well as demonstrate enhanced sectioning in an autofluorescent pollen grain, and find electrowetting wobulation is a promising technology to improve the resolution of conventional imaging systems.},

The memristor demonstrated a data retention time of 10 4 s and stable resistive switching behavior over 100 cycles under electrical pulses stimulation. Furthermore, it emulated a range of biologically relevant synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, spike-amplitude-dependent plasticity, spike-number-dependent plasticity, and spike-duration-dependent plasticity. Capitalizing on its nonlinear dynamics and short-term memory characteristics, the device was further integrated into a reservoir computing (RC) system. The RC system demonstrated strong recognition performance and robustness when tested with distorted digital image datasets.

  abstract     = {The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a quantum phenomenon arising from the breaking of chiral symmetry in relativistic Weyl fermions due to quantum fluctuations under parallel electric ( E ) and magnetic fields ( B ). Intuitively, Weyl fermions with opposite chirality, under the stimulus of parallel E and B , will have different chemical potentials that give rise to an extra current, whose role is like a chiral battery in solids. However, up until now, the experimental evidence for the chiral magnetic effect is the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance , rather than a chiral electric source. Here, different from previous reports, we observed a giant chiral magnetic effect evidenced by “negative” resistance and corresponding voltage–current curves located in the second-fourth quadrant in the type-II Weyl semimetal WP 2+δ . These phenomena occur under the following conditions: the misalignment angle between B and E is smaller than 20°, the temperature is below 40 K, the externally applied electrical current is less than 50 mA, and the magnetic field is larger than 3 T. Phenomenologically, based on the macroscopic Chern–Simons–Maxwell equation, this giant chiral magnetic effect observed in WP 2+δ is attributed to the chirality of Weyl fermions possessing a two-order longer coherent time than the Drude transport relaxation time. Our findings provide evidence of the giant chiral-magnetic/chiral-battery effect in Weyl semimetals.},

  abstract     = {The realization of multiple electronic states on ultrafast sub-picosecond timescales can be leveraged to develop energy-efficient terahertz (THz) photonic devices. Such explorations are pursued in the framework of femtosecond optical excitation with THz probes wherein either negative or positive photoconductivity manifests in metallic and insulating states, respectively. Co-existence of both states is highly desired but rarely observed. Here, a strategy is devised exploiting crystalline transport anisotropy and hetero-epitaxy in a multi-band nickelate to demonstrate switching of the positive to the negative sign of photoconductivity on a sub-picosecond timescale. This combines with a profound anisotropy of THz photoconductivity in unconventional (111) epitaxial films having preferential arrangement of oxygen vacancies along selective crystal axes—a framework that reversibly modulates the anisotropy of negative THz photoconductivity using oxygen content as a control parameter, and corroborated by theoretical calculations. Thus, ultrafast switching between negative, positive, and zero photoconductive states in timescales of a few picoseconds at room temperature, as demonstrated in this study, holds a remarkable prospect for creating multiple channels of information processing. A proof-of-concept experiment to utilize these photo-controlled states is proposed for a three-state THz communication system, which would transmit a larger volume of information vis-a-vis that of a binary communication system.},

  abstract     = {Organic terahertz (THz) crystals exhibit complex and often unpredictable relationships among their chemical structures, crystal structures, and physical properties. This complexity makes it highly challenging to optimize crystals for efficient THz generation. Here, we introduce a design strategy based on isomorphic ionic organic crystal families to develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that efficiently generate ultra-broadband THz waves extending up to 15 THz. Using three nonlinear optical cationic chromophores with different interionic assembly types, each combined with three molecular anions featuring different substituents (non-polar methyl or polar chloro and bromo groups), we investigated nine ionic crystals, including four reported here for the first time. The crystal members within each isomorphic crystal family show nearly identical crystal structures (i.e., isomorphic crystal structures), all of them achieving top-level macroscopic second-order optical nonlinearity and efficient ultrabroad THz wave generation capabilities. Remarkably, their physical (and terahertz) properties within each isomorphic crystal family differ dramatically according to a certain order of the introduced anions, and this ordering trend persists across all three isomorphic crystal families. These results provide a crucial advancement in the design and prediction of macroscopic properties in ionic organic THz and nonlinear optical crystals, marking an important step toward rational crystal design exhibiting enhanced physical properties.},

  abstract     = {Non-Fourier thermal transports have drawn significant attention for decades. Among them, the frequency-dependent thermal conductivity has been extensively explored by pump-probe techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance, which is employed to probe the spectra of phonon mean free paths. However, previous studies on silicon have not exhibited apparent frequency dependence despite its broad phonon distribution. Here, we report the frequency-dependent thermal transport in Al/Si with an atomically sharp interface, where the matched Debye temperatures preserve the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons in Si and contribute as additional non-equilibrium thermal resistance. The dependence vanishes in Al/SiO 2 /Si at room temperature, since the SiO 2 interlayer facilitates phonon scattering and destroys thermal non-equilibrium. At 80 K, frequency dependence reemerges in Al/SiO 2 /Si due to reduced interfacial phonon scattering, which is not sufficient to destroy the temperature difference between low- and high-energy phonons. The frequency dependence is weakened in the Al/Si sample at 500 K, originating from the enhanced phonon scattering rate in Si. Our findings highlight the significance of boundary conditions in frequency-dependent thermal conductivity.},

The soft magnetoelectric skin (SMES) has been proposed here for multidirectional tactile sensing by imitating the structure and tactile hyperacuity of human skin. The SMES integrates a force–magnetic coupling layer with an electromagnetic induction layer, enabling it to detect vertical forces at 25 points and tangential forces in 12 directions using only 4 coils, showing its tactile hyperacuity. Both experimental and simulation results demonstrate its stable, self-powered multidirectional sensing mechanism. Additionally, a customized machine learning model achieves 96.01% accuracy in detecting 37 force directions, even under varying compression conditions. Combined with a real-time sensing system, its application potential for robotic tactile sensing and human–computer interfaces has been highlighted, showcasing its application versatility.

By exploiting the different spectral response of these detectors, transmitted data of different wavelengths can be effectively distinguished, making them promising candidates for wavelength division multiplexing to enhance optical communication transmission rates. Herein, we present a facile dual-wavelength demultiplexing strategy based on ZnO/PbSe wide-/narrow-bandgap heterojunction to achieve ultraviolet (UV)-infrared (IR) broadband detection by utilizing the photosensitive/dielectric properties of ZnO along with unique band alignment. The detector demonstrates a continuous photocurrent response in the UV region, while producing transient pulsed photocurrent in the IR region. It is first time reporting response wavelength extension of transient photodetectors from near-infrared (NIR) to mid-infrared (MIR). Additionally, the response bandwidth reaches 2 kHz in the UV and 0.7 MHz in the IR bands. The UV/IR dual-wavelength optical communication tests show the coexistence of transient pulsed and continuous photocurrents. By incorporating different filter modules at the output terminals, the transmitted data at both wavelengths can be extracted simultaneously. This study offers a facile and practical approach for broadband photodetection and wavelength demultiplexing, while also providing a novel route for extending the application of wide-bandgap semiconductors to IR optoelectronic devices.},

This limitation hinders the application development of the self-powered optoelectronic synaptic devices in neuromorphic computing. In this work, a self-powered optoelectronic synaptic device based on the tin dioxide and cesium silver bismuth bromide heterojunction is developed. Through utilizing the ion migration and photo-generated carrier transport behaviors in the heterojunction, self-powered optically inhibitory and excitatory synaptic behaviors are successfully mimicked under ultraviolet (365 nm) monochromatic all-optical modulation. On this basis, a convolutional neural network has been constructed with the software-based means to recognize images (the absence of real hardware-level image processing) in fashion MNIST dataset and an accuracy of 84.48% is obtained in this network, indicating broad application prospects of the all-optical self-powered systems in the neuromorphic computing.},

The spin transport across the interfaces is affected not only by the Brillouin zone (BZ) filtering but also by the interfacial bonds. This work focuses on studying the 2H Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS 2 ) van der Waals layers as the tunnel barrier, and Cobalt (Co) as the electrode. The TMR varies with different adsorption interfaces, yet none have achieved the desired levels because the momentum-resolved transmissions of Co and MoS 2 in the folded horizontal BZ do not match well, resulting in inefficient spin filtering and thereby a low TMR. The effects of interfacial bonds on spin transport and magnetic anisotropy are studied. The orientations of bonds determine the anisotropy of the interfacial Co. Vertical bonds stabilize the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), while non-vertical bonds cause in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). The layers below exhibit PMA, so both types of MTJs overall support PMA, while the physisorbed MTJ is stronger. The positive relation between the transmission and the electron density near the Fermi level is weakened by the bonds, as the scattering centers hold back the spin injection. Our work further strengthens the importance of BZ filtering in governing TMR and the design principle of MTJ, as well as how bonds affect the overall device performance.},

Yet on-chip electronic detection and tuning of multimode resonances in these 2D VCT resonators have been challenging due to the ultrasmall vibration amplitudes and rich multimode dynamics at radio frequencies (RF). Here, we leverage the atomic-scale thickness, ultrahigh strain limit, as well as strain-engineering effects on band structure and carrier mobility of 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) sheets, and experimentally demonstrate multimode 2D MoS 2 VCT resonators. Using all-electronic signal transduction, we show single-, bi-, and tri-layer MoS 2 VCT resonators with up to the 14th resonance mode, thanks to the ultra-efficient electromechanical transduction enabled by internal multiphysics coupling. Measured gate dependency of multimode resonances exhibits frequency tuning ranges of Δ f / f 0 up to 326%. These 2D VCT resonators provide a unique platform for engineering on-chip integrated and ultra-scaled RF signal transduction, sensing, and analog computing elements with multimode and hyperspectral capabilities.},

This process does not require population inversion, unlike conventional photonic lasers. II-VI/III-V colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, known for their narrow emission linewidth and tunable emission wavelength, find broad applications in displays, LEDs, and detectors. However, achieving exciton-polariton lasing with these materials remains challenging. In this work, we investigate the exciton binding energy variations in CdSe colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) with different thicknesses and demonstrate the integration of CQWs in a face-down aligned configuration within a Fabry–Pérot cavity. This alignment enhances the exciton-photon coupling, leading to increased Rabi splitting energy and stronger coupling compared to randomly oriented CQWs, thereby facilitate exciton-polariton condensation. Due to the enhanced coupling with cavity fields and large exciton binding energy, we report the first observation of room-temperature exciton-polariton BEC and exciton-polariton lasing from CdSe CQWs. By systematically tuning the exciton-photon detuning, we achieve wavelength-tunable polariton lasing from 530 nm to 549 nm, including spectral regions without conventional optical gain, extending lasing beyond the intrinsic emission of 4 ML CQWs. These findings establish CdSe CQWs as effective platform for polariton-based optoelectronics.},

As such, the Maxwell-Garnett theory enables many practical applications in diverse realms, ranging from photonics, acoustics, mechanics, thermodynamics, to materials science. It has long been thought that the Maxwell-Garnett theory of light in impedance-mismatched periodic structures is valid only within the long-wavelength limit, necessitating either the temporal or spatial period of light to be much larger than that of structures. Here, we break this long-held belief by revealing an anomalous Maxwell-Garnett theory for impedance-mismatched photonic time crystals beyond this long-wavelength limit. The key to this anomaly lies in the Fabry–Pérot resonance. We discover that under the Fabry–Pérot resonance, the impedance-mismatched photonic time crystal could be essentially equivalent to a homogeneous temporal slab simultaneously at specific discrete wavelengths, despite the temporal period of these light being comparable to or even much smaller than that of photonic time crystals.},

Here, we circumvent this ambiguity through strategically designed aliovalent-alloying semiconductors (e.g., TiFe 0.5+ x Ni 0.5- x Sb, −0.25 ≤ x ≤ 0.25), where the compositional deviations from x = 0 amplify EPIs while weakening PDPS. Experimentally, we observed a pronounced EPI-driven κ L reduction of ∼50% at room temperature and ∼40% even at 1000 K as carrier concentration approaches 1 × 10 22 cm −3 . The carrier-induced phonon softening and the enhanced electron-phonon scattering rates collectively lead to this remarkable phonon transport attenuation. Our findings establish a quantitative framework for disentangling EPI effects on phonon transport in heavily doped semiconductors or metals, and provide insights into phonon engineering strategies for advanced thermal management materials design.},

Traditional LSFM utilizes Gaussian illumination with a limited system field of view (FOV) due to the short Rayleigh range. As one kind of the propagation-invariant light field, the Airy beam can inherently extend the FOV and enhance the axial resolution for microscopy. However, implementing an Airy-LSFM requires a complex illumination system. Here, we demonstrate that the Airy light-sheet is conveniently integrated into LSFM using a polarization-independent, Airy metasurface to achieve compact illumination, large system FOV, and high image quality. To verify the performance of the metasurface-based Airy LSFM (meta-Airy LSFM), ex vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) embryos was conducted. The Richardson–Lucy deconvolution technique was applied to further improve the image quality. The experimental results show that the axial and lateral resolution of the meta-Airy LSFM is 2.3 and 0.69 μ m, respectively, while the FOV is significantly improved tenfold, up to 200 μ m. The tightly packed integration of the Airy light-sheet metasurface in LSFM enables wide-ranging biological applications and has great potential to be easily adapted across various LSFM modalities.},

We now unveil a kinetically tuned, molecular-level mechanism that enables conductance modulation with near-ideal linearity across 16,500 analog states spanning four orders of magnitude. By orchestrating inherently nonlinear phenomena, such as nucleation, within finely controlled small-perturbation regimes, we realize what once seemed paradoxical: linearity emerging from nonlinearity. This advance offers a generalizable blueprint for instilling precise synaptic control into the very fabric of future neuromorphic materials.},

  abstract     = {Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halides have gained significant attention as downconversion phosphors in solid-state lighting and x-ray imaging due to their unique optical properties. However, achieving efficient luminescence under blue light excitation remains a significant challenge. Herein, we present a novel zero-dimensional hybrid copper iodide [Li(H 2 O)(Benzo-15-crown-5) 2 ] 2 Cu 4 I 6 (abbreviated as [LB] 2 Cu 4 I 6 ), as a highly efficient and blue-light-excitable emitter with potential in lighting and x-ray imaging applications. This compound exhibits an ultrabroad excitation band spanning from 250 to 500 nm, upon blue light, ultraviolet, or x-ray excitation, delivers strong broadband yellow emission centered at 541 nm with a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 92.1%. Benefiting from their strong photoexcitation under blue light, high PLQY, and good environmental stability, a high-performance white light-emitting diode was developed, achieving a commercial-level luminous efficiency of 101.6 lm W −1 , a high color rendering index of 87, and a record half-lifetime of 2352 h. Additionally, [LB] 2 Cu 4 I 6 demonstrates outstanding x-ray scintillation properties with a high light yield of 83 904 photons MeV −1 , a low detection limit of 72.3 nGy s −1 , and a competitive spatial resolution of 10.3 lp mm −1 for x-ray imaging.

However, their Curie temperatures remain far below room temperature and/or the ferroelectric polarization is nearly vanishing. Here, an inequivalent charge strategy is reported that simultaneously enhances the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic ordering in Bi 2 FeMnO 6 double perovskite thin films, effectively exploiting the tunability of chemical strain and valence. Abnormal lattice distortion and differential charge compensation ensure robust ferroelectricity (16.6–29.2 μ C/cm 2 ) and approximately sevenfold enhancement from 8.3 to 60 emu/cm 3 in ferromagnetism, with Curie temperatures of both ferroic orderings exceeding 800 K, which is the best high-temperature metrics for existing multiferroic systems. Since ferroelectricity originates from Bi ions and octahedral distortions, this effectively avoids small polarization and weak A–B site coupling. This mechanism is expected to reignite interest in type I multiferroics and prompt a reexamination of current schemes for overcoming the incompatibility of the multiple ferroic orderings. Our work provides an important technological path and experimental insight for the development of room-temperature multiferroics by leveraging the tunability of double perovskites.},

While manipulation techniques such as strain (via substrates), electric fields, and temperature are commonly employed, switching induced by charged defects between different polar topological structures remains a rarely observed phenomenon. In this study, we demonstrate that oxygen vacancies can effectively enable the switching between flux-closure and center-type topological structures in PbTiO 3 (PTO) nano-island arrays. Supported by evidence from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, and piezoresponse force microscopy, we demonstrate that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies favors the formation of center-type domains, while the topological structure transitions to the flux-closure configuration following elimination of oxygen vacancies via in situ annealing under various gas atmospheres. This deterministic switching between the two polar topological structures highlights the critical role of charged defects and opens new avenues for the manipulation of polar topological structures in future applications.},

  abstract     = {Heterojunctions are indispensable for fabricating high-performance organic photodetectors. However, traditional structures—such as planar heterojunctions (PHJs) and bulk heterojunctions (BHJs)—face significant challenges. PHJs often suffer from limited exciton dissociation in thick films, while BHJs experience considerable charge transport barriers. Although quasi-planar heterojunctions have been proposed to address these issues, controlling their nanoscale interface remains complex and material-dependent, limiting their applications. Herein, we introduce novel interpenetrated heterojunctions (IPHJs), formed by penetrating a secondary organic semiconductor layer into a porous bottom layer during annealing. This innovative structure is revealed to possess efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport. Remarkably, organic photodiodes (OPDs) featuring PM6:N2200 IPHJs demonstrate exceptional performance, achieving a responsivity (R) of 36.5 A/W, a specific detectivity (D * ) of 8.6 × 10 12 Jones, and a response time (τ) of 30 μ s, representing state-of-the-art performance for OPDs. Furthermore, extending the IPHJ concept to tri-layer interpenetrated heterojunctions (T-IPHJs) shows significant promise for organic phototransistor applications. The PM6:N2200 T-IPHJ devices exhibit a responsivity exceeding 44.7 A/W, a D * value reaching 5.23 × 10 14 Jones, and a τ of 70 ms. These results show the potential of IPHJs to advance the field of high-performance organic photodetectors and related devices.},

Due to its larger bandgap and higher optical damage threshold, LT can be employed for efficient nonlinear optical frequency conversion in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range. Here, we report on fabrication of monolithic, high-quality LT metasurfaces, composed of periodic arrays of LT truncated square pyramids, created by partially etching of a LT thin film layer using a focused ion beam milling process. These pyramidal structures introduce discrete translational symmetry, which allows for the folding of guided-mode dispersion into the first Brillouin zone, leading to the formation of guided mode resonances with Q-factors that can be easily controlled by the height of LT pyramids. The measurements show a Q-factor up to approximately 640 at 786 nm. By leveraging the strong field localization of these high-Q resonances, we demonstrate enhanced second-harmonic generation at 393 nm with an absolute conversion efficiency of 0.042%, establishing a new benchmark for the UV harmonic generation in dielectric metasurfaces. Moreover, our fabrication technique can be readily adapted to a wide range of other material platforms, opening new avenues for the development of high-quality UV metasurfaces and advanced nonlinear photonic meta-devices.},

However, the stochastic nature of resistive switching (RS) in memristors often leads to poor device stability and uniformity, hindering the scalability required for real-world applications. Here, we present a novel phase segregation strategy to achieve uniformly distributed self-assembled Ni nanofilaments within a BaTiO 3 matrix, enabling local deterministic redox reactions for RS, as confirmed by comprehensive structural, local, and macroscopic RS studies. This approach yields drastic enhancement in cyclic performance and device uniformity, with the average cyclic variances of Set voltage and low resistance state down to 1.4% and 9.6%, respectively. The devices also exhibit excellent endurance (10 9 cycles) and ultrafast programming speed (down to 100 ns) and achieve over 5-bit level long-term memory states. The enhanced cyclic stability and device uniformity translate to high training and learning accuracies (95%) in a three-level deep neural network, with 1-bit inputs. Our phase segregation strategy provides a generic pathway to overcome the long-standing challenge of device variability in neuromorphic computing.},

  abstract     = {Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the Indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage ( ⁠ V < ℏ ω / e = 2.0 V ⁠ ) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.},

While Ga 2 O 3 exhibits promising material characteristics for applications in harsh environments, its commercial viability remains under debate, particularly when compared to materials such as aluminum nitride (AlN) and diamond, which possess superior intrinsic properties. This perspective addresses the critical challenges that currently impede the widespread commercialization of Ga 2 O 3 -based devices. These challenges include a relatively immature technology base, the difficulty in achieving stable p-type conductivity, inherently low thermal conductivity, the presence of crystallographic defects (nano- and micro-voids), and elevated fabrication costs, all of which negatively impact device reliability and scalability. Mitigation strategies, such as heterojunction implementation, the development of thermal management solutions such as wafer bonding, and defect passivation approaches, are also under investigation. The near-term feasibility of commercially viable Ga 2 O 3 -based power electronic devices is a central focus of this discussion. The current status is that Ga 2 O 3 development is far advanced relative to either diamond or especially AlN power electronics but is hampered by lack of a broad base of substrate vendors and a compelling vision for device implementations that provide sufficient improvement over SiC power devices. There are strong geographic differences in device focus, with China prioritizing implementation in grid applications while the United States/Europe appear to consider Ga 2 O 3 devices more for defense and aerospace applications.},

Traditional approaches to catalyst development for H 2 production, such as electrochemical catalysis (EC), photoelectrochemical catalysis (PEC), and photocatalysis (PC), have predominantly relied on empirical, trial-and-error methods. While significant progress has been made, these methods are time-consuming, costly, and limited by the complexity of multicomponent catalysts and reaction systems. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have emerged as transformative tools for accelerating catalyst discovery and optimization. AI-driven approaches enable high-throughput screening of materials, prediction of catalyst performance, and real-time reaction mechanisms, offering a more efficient alternative to conventional experimentation. This review examines the current state of catalyst development for green H 2 production, highlighting the role of AI in optimizing hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). We explore advancements in electrochemical, photoelectrochemical, and photocatalytic systems, emphasizing the potential of AI to revolutionize the field.

  abstract     = {In this review, we provide a practical guide to superconducting quantum circuits protection from broadband electromagnetic and infrared radiation using cryogenic shielding and microwave line filtering. Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for 100+ qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits shielding from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation—multilayer shielding design, materials, fridge line filtration, cryogenic setup configurations, and shielding efficiency evaluation methods developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we provide recommendations for the design of an efficient and compact shielding system, as well as microwave filtering for large-scale superconducting quantum systems.},

This review examines recent developments in microstructured optical coatings designed based on geometric optics principles, highlighting their role in two key areas: energy harvesting and energy saving. In the first category, microstructured surfaces enhance photovoltaic performance through improved sunlight steering and capture. In the second category, they enable passive radiative cooling by efficiently emitting heat as thermal radiation while transmitting or reflecting solar radiation. Compared to nanostructured coatings, microstructured designs offer distinct advantages for large-area applications, including compatibility with scalable fabrication techniques and precise, angle-selective optical control. The review covers both horizontal (roof- or ground-mounted) and vertical (building-integrated) configurations, underscoring how each configuration demands specialized microstructural strategies to address different incident sunlight conditions and thermal management challenges. Through a detailed survey of state-of-the-art designs and materials, this review highlights the potential of microstructured optical coatings to advance sustainable energy technologies and gives insight into their role in mitigating global energy and climate crises.},

  abstract     = {In the evolving landscape of energy storage technologies, nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) batteries maintain significant market relevance despite the prominence of lithium-ion systems. The global Ni-MH market continues to grow steadily, reflecting their continued importance in applications demanding safety, environmental compatibility, and reliability. This review provides a critical analysis of electrochemical techniques used to investigate metal hydride electrodes for Ni-MH batteries. We examine the thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena of hydrogen storage in intermetallic compounds, focusing on the correlation between gas-phase hydrogen interactions and electrochemical processes. The review systematically analyzes various methods including cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, galvanostatic and potentiostatic intermittent titration techniques (GITT and PITT), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For each method, we discuss theoretical foundations, practical applications, and fundamental limitations when applied to metal hydride systems. Our analysis reveals significant challenges in the direct application of methodologies originally developed for liquid-phase electrochemical systems to solid-state metal hydride electrodes. This methodological transfer without appropriate modifications has resulted in inconsistent data interpretation and discrepancies in reported parameters, particularly for hydrogen diffusion coefficients determined by different techniques. We identify common methodological errors and provide guidelines for more accurate experimental design and data analysis. The critical examination presented in this review demonstrates the necessity for researchers to carefully consider the fundamental differences between liquid-phase and solid-state electrochemical processes when selecting and applying characterization methods. Given the continued importance of Ni-MH batteries in energy infrastructure, establishing reliable characterization protocols is important for advancing the fundamental understanding and technological development of metal hydride electrode materials.},

However, these materials struggle to simultaneously meet the technical requirements of high-capacity, rapid, and reversible hydrogen absorption and desorption under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In recent years, both theoretical predictions and experimental research have indicated that nontraditional hydrogen storage materials based on hybrid adsorption mechanisms (such as physical adsorption, chemical adsorption, Kubas-type interactions, static electric polarization, and weak chemical adsorption)—namely, MXene materials—are promising for rapid and high-capacity hydrogen storage under normal conditions. This review aims to focus on the intrinsic principles of the diverse hybrid mechanisms of MXene materials and recent research progress of MXene as a hydrogen carrier.

  abstract     = {The rise of high-performance functional devices has driven significant breakthroughs in various research fields, with ultrafast laser processing offering unprecedented opportunities for advanced device fabrication. This review summarizes recent progress and future prospects for ultrafast laser in fabricating functional optical, semiconductor, and sensor devices. Central to these advances is a deeper understanding of ultrafast laser–matter interaction physics, including nonlinear optical effects, multiphoton ionization, avalanche ionization, and laser-induced plasma dynamics. These phenomena govern carrier excitation, energy deposition, and subsequent structural modification. We further review how such interactions enable controlled refractive index changes, selective ablation, and nanoscale material structuring in photosensitive, dielectric, semiconductor, and metallic substrates. Key applications are then reviewed, including ultrafast laser fabrication of optical devices (e.g., optical waveguide devices, optical data storage elements, optical elements, and artificial compound eyes, integrated photonic devices), semiconductor devices (e.g., semiconductor light-emitting devices, photodiodes, solar cells, and photodetectors), and sensors (e.g., fiber optic sensors, flexible sensors, and biochemical sensors). Recent breakthroughs showcase ultrafast laser-induced precision in device miniaturization, improved optoelectronic characteristics, and integration of complex functions (e.g., topological photonic circuits fabricated via sub-100-nm laser writing, 5D optical data storage in glass with > 1 TB/cm 3 density, perovskite solar cells achieving 25.7% efficiency through laser-induced phase engineering, alongside plasmonic biosensors with 100× sensitivity enhancement, and stretchable graphene sensors for wearables). Finally, this review discusses core challenges, such as enhancing the scalability of ultrafast laser processes for industrial-scale production and optimizing laser-material interactions to improve device reliability and performance. Future efforts should address key challenges such as the limited scalability of ultrafast laser processing and the incomplete understanding of laser–matter interactions at ultrafast timescales. Integrating ultrafast lasers with AI-driven control, beam shaping, and advanced materials such as 2D heterostructures may enable smarter and more multifunctional device platforms. A unified theoretical framework is also needed to guide precise and efficient fabrication. These directions highlight critical opportunities for bridging current limitations and enabling transformative advances.

Electrokinetic multiphase hydrodynamics (EKmHD), dating back to the early 20th century, has regained prominence since the 2010s, supported by advanced methods spanning microfluidics, spectroscopy, molecular dynamics, phase-field-based modeling, coarse-grained analysis, and high-performance computing. After briefly sketching fundamental mechanisms, this review establishes a unified framework of experimental, theoretical, and numerical issues to consolidate the quantitative methodology of EKmHD, which is essential to uncover the underlying interfacial transport mechanisms.

  abstract     = {For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast-growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe the structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput. SPM inherently meets these criteria, offering a rich and diverse array of data from a single measurement. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.},

Despite their widespread adoption, LiBs face challenges like performance decrease, reduced lifespan, and safety risks, all closely tied to battery degradation. This review systematically examines the factors influencing LiB degradation, dividing them into intrinsic and extrinsic categories. Intrinsic factors include material chemistry, manufacturing inconsistencies, and design limitations, while extrinsic factors cover operational conditions such as temperature, charge–discharge rates, state of charge, and depth of discharge. The degradation factors influence the degradation mechanisms, and these correlations are discussed in detail. Additionally, this study highlights mitigation strategies and tradeoffs, including advanced electrode designs, surface modifications, and optimized battery management systems. By consolidating current research, this review provides insights into overcoming the challenges associated with LiB degradation, aiming to guide future developments in achieving safer, more durable, and efficient energy storage systems.},

  abstract     = {Bone, cartilage, and their composites in various joints are the most important components that form the skeletal structure and enable motion and movements of the body. Their disease and/or loss are most debilitating and afflict millions of Americans, reducing productivity and deteriorating quality of life. Due to limited treatments, scientists, engineers, and clinical doctors are investigating new tissue engineering solutions. In tissue engineering approaches, scaffolds are artificially designed temporary matrices that accommodate stem/progenitor cells and provide both physical and biological signals to guide cell differentiation and 3D tissue regeneration but eventually degrade and leave behind regenerated functional tissues or organs. Therefore, scaffolds often substantially benefit from mimicking certain features of the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) and designing certain engineered features to facilitate cell repopulation, mass transportation, and mechanical and biological cues for cells to regenerate tissue. This review article focuses on the design, synthesis, fabrication, and functionalization of nanofibrous materials to mimic the ECM, deliver biological signals, and integrate various engineering design features such as pore shape, size, connectivity, tissue architectures, and anatomic tissue/organ shapes to guide 3D tissue regeneration. In addition to biological and physical principles of scaffold design and fabrication, we also provide several examples of specific applications of these advanced nanofibrous scaffolds for bone, cartilage, and their associated composite tissue regeneration in osteochondral defects. We also discuss the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary nature of these research directions, the importance of collaborations across disciplines, and the perspectives of future developments in the field.},

  abstract     = {Polycrystalline germanium (Ge) thin films have reemerged as promising materials for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic devices because of their superior electrical and optical properties. However, challenges such as high defect densities, small grain sizes, and unstable n-type conduction have limited their practical application. In this paper, we review the progress in the solid-phase crystallization of Ge thin films on insulating substrates. We first discuss conventional processes with excessive nucleation that lead to poor crystallinity and electrical properties. We then introduce advanced solid-phase crystallization strategies, highlighting the critical role of controlling the amorphous deposition temperature to control atomic density, increase grain size, and reduce acceptor defects. Additionally, the incorporation of tin (Sn) has been shown to passivate grain boundaries, while the modulation of film thickness and the introduction of interfacial layers have demonstrated the ability to mitigate carrier scattering at the substrate interface. This review also addresses impurity doping techniques for precise Fermi level control, strain engineering effects on grain boundary barrier energies, and metal-induced lateral crystallization for grain alignment. These innovations have culminated in achieving record-high carrier mobilities of 690 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for p-type and 450 cm 2 V −1 s −1 for n-type films, approaching single-crystal performance. The insights provided herein will pave the way for the development of high-performance Ge-based thin-film transistors and flexible electronic devices via low-temperature processing.},

  abstract     = {The field of 2D materials has grown dramatically in the past two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computing applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. To overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest, including graphene, phosphorene, MoS 2 , CrI 3 , VSe 2 , GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.},

  abstract     = {Mie scattering between incident light and nanoparticles (NPs) plays a vital role in improving the performance of optical and photonic devices, such as sensors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. While traditional far-field spectroscopy and electromagnetic simulations have been used to study Mie scattering, these methods lack real-space imaging capabilities, limiting their ability to capture single-particle scattering phenomena. Scanning probe microscopy-based nanoscopy techniques have become essential for studying Mie scattering at the nanoscale to address this limitation. This review explores the theoretical foundations of Mie scattering and the role of near-field microscopy in bridging the gap between theory and experiment through high-resolution imaging. By focusing on real-space imaging, we highlight the practical aspects of Mie scattering and its applications in fields such as biosensing, photocatalysis, and materials science. Nanoscopy techniques allow for direct visualization of scattering processes in nanostructures, offering more profound insights into how NPs interact with light at the nanoscale. Additionally, we discuss the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance near-field analysis, providing more accurate interpretations of Mie scattering phenomena. In conclusion, combining advanced nanoscopy and AI-driven analysis will significantly advance our understanding of Mie scattering and its diverse applications in various scientific and technological fields. The synergy between cutting-edge imaging methods and computational simulation not only enriches our theoretical understanding of scattering phenomena but also accelerates the development of next-generation photonic devices, paving the way for a wide range of practical applications across scientific and technological domains.},

In the magnetic measurements, this requires the use of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which is a highly sensitive magnetic device for detecting changes in minute magnetic fluxes. In this review, two types of SQUID magnetometers for pressure ( P ) of up to 30 GPa are reviewed. One is a commercial SQUID magnetometer with a miniature diamond anvil cell (DAC) covering a wide temperature range of 1.8–400 K, and the other is a vibrating-coil SQUID magnetometer equipped with DAC, which provides more accurate measurements. The former was used for oxygen molecules, molecule-based magnets, permanent magnets, organic radial ferromagnets, and lanthanide ferromagnets, whereas the latter was applied to organic radial ferromagnets, samarium (Sm), and an iron-based superconductor. Further developments of accurate magnetization measurements at high pressures are important for condensed matter studies on magnets and superconductors.},

  abstract     = {III-V multi-junction solar cells have yielded the highest solar cell efficiencies for nearly three decades and recently achieved record efficiencies approaching 40% under standard conditions and 50% under concentrated sunlight. Such high efficiencies are currently only possible using four or more junctions to partition the broad solar spectrum into bins where each subcell efficiently collects a narrow range of photon energies. High-efficiency, wide-bandgap (1.7–2.2 eV) absorbers play a crucial role in multi-junction solar cells by efficiently converting visible photons into electrons and delivering them at high voltage. Since all subcells are interconnected in series, the widest bandgap junction produces both the highest voltage and highest power in the stack. Wide-bandgap absorbers also present the greatest materials challenges in the stack, including high aluminum content, lattice mismatch, lack of heterojunction barriers, and the sensitivity of phosphides to defects such as vacancies and oxygen. We review the history, current status, and opportunities for wide-bandgap III-V solar cells, ranging from ∼1.7 eV for the top subcell of III-V/Si hybrid tandems to >2.2 eV for the top subcell of a 6+ junction stack. Future directions and recommendations to overcome remaining materials and device challenges will be discussed.},

  abstract     = {Thermal-driven multi-carrier transport is essential for both scientific research and technological applications in electronic, spintronic, and energy conversion devices. This article reviews the fundamentals of phonon, electron, spin, and ion transport driven by temperature gradients in solid-state and soft condensed matter, and the microscopic interactions between energy/charge carriers that can be leveraged for manipulating electrical and thermal transport in energy conversion devices, such as electron–phonon coupling, spin–phonon interaction, and ion–solvent interactions. In coupled electron–phonon transport, we discuss the basics of electron–phonon interactions and their effects on phonon dynamics, thermalization, and nonequilibrium thermal transport. For the phonon–spin interaction, nonequilibrium transport formulation is introduced first, followed by the physics of spin thermoelectric effect and strategies to manipulate them. Contributions to thermal conductivity from magnons as heat carriers are also reviewed. For coupled transport of heat and ions/molecules, we highlight the importance of local molecular configurations that determine the magnitude of the electrochemical gradient, which is the key to improving the efficiency of low-grade heat energy conversion.},

  abstract     = {Photostrictive effect exhibits a high potential to realize the smart micro-optomechanical devices, which can be operated at a simple principle of direct conversion of light energy into mechanical strain. Unlike electrostrictive and magnetostrictive effects, it does not involve complex circuits, therefore offering a promising prospect of accomplishing the advanced, compact, and remote-control devices. The key step to produce the light-induced strain of practical value is to design highly efficient photostrictive materials. Based upon the nature of the material systems to be explored for micro-optomechanical devices, the photostriction in inorganic–materials-based systems, including semiconductors, transition metal oxides, halide perovskites, and ferroelectrics in bulk and two-dimensions, are summarized herein. For each material, the feasible strategies of compositional engineering, processing conditions, and sample sculpturing, with a special focus on the meticulous tailoring of multiple phase boundaries in representative ferroelectric systems to produce significant photostriction, are given. Since ferroelectric photostriction is accounted as the superposition effect of photovoltaic and inverse piezoelectric effects, both effects are introduced and discussed. Finally, perspectives on future research of photostrictive materials are added. We believe that this review will bring new insights in producing highly efficient photostrictive materials for the commercial production of upcoming state-of-the-art micro optomechanical devices.},

While acoustic patterning has demonstrated remarkable control over microscale spatial configurations, its scalability into three-dimensional (3D) fabrication has remained constrained by challenges in bonding limitations and vertical stacking. To solve this challenge, hybrid acoustic-assisted 3D printing integrates acoustophoresis with established methods, such as direct ink writing and stereolithography, enhancing material deposition accuracy, microstructure alignment, and porous structuring of 3D printed products. However, these hybrid systems remain tethered to layer-by-layer architectures, limiting the full potential of acoustic techniques. Recent breakthroughs in standalone acoustic 3D fabrication, leveraging levitation, focusing, and ejection, have unlocked potential in contactless, layerless, and flexible multi-material assembly. Acoustic levitation systems enable mid-air construction on non-planar surfaces, and focused ultrasound techniques facilitate deep-penetration polymerization and acoustic droplet ejection advances nozzle-free droplet-based bioprinting.

Its malfunction is related to neurological disorders, including startle disease (hyperekplexia), which is characterized by exaggerated startle responses to sudden unexpected stimuli, such as noise or touch. Here, we unravel the molecular mechanisms of action of a specific mutation that is linked to startle disease: Asn46Lys (N46K). This residue, in the GlyR extracellular domain, is not directly involved in neurotransmitter binding but can disrupt the neurotransmitter pathway. To understand how, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutated extracellular domain of a homomeric α 1 GlyR, assessing the effects of the Asn46Lys mutation. We then sampled multiple unbinding and binding events by means of metadynamics simulations, with a funnel restraint to limit the exploration in the solvent. By evaluating the binding free energy landscape, we observed a substantial reduction in neurotransmitter binding affinity, which is consistent with experiments. We suggest that such a reduction is linked to the interaction of its crucial glutamic acid residue with the lysine mutation competing with the glycine ligand.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that ROS primarily induce structural damage through dehydrogenation reactions and the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds. Notably, the teichoic acid (TA) from S. aureus was found to be more susceptible to damage compared to that of S. pneumoniae , which exhibited stronger antioxidant properties due to its ring structure and chemical modifications. The efficiency of damage increased with ROS concentration, following the order, O > O 3 > OH, with a maximum of 22.22% C–C bond cleavage observed at the highest concentration. In addition, the patterns of damage in the TA of these two bacterial species were significantly different. In S. aureus , WTA damage was predominantly characterized by C–C and C–O bond cleavage in the repeating units, whereas LTA damage was primarily due to the cleavage of C–C bonds in the ring structure. In S. pneumoniae , damage to both WTA and LTA mainly occurred at the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) ring structure and the poly (RboP) site.

In this study, we investigate how varying Ag + concentrations affect the mechanical properties of DNA, in particular, contour length, persistence length, end-to-end distance, and area of occupation, using atomic force microscopy. At low Ag + concentrations, we observe localized stiffening and shortening of DNA molecules, which we attribute to the formation of monoadducts and biadducts with specific DNA bases. These interactions promote the emergence of secondary structures that contribute to DNA compaction and a reduction in contour length. At intermediate concentrations, accumulation of torsional stress and the formation of multiple metal-mediated contacts lead to a global conformational collapse, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the effective persistence length. At the highest Ag + concentration tested (1.5 mM), the uniform distribution of molecular area suggests a widespread structural collapse of DNA. These findings support previous reports of Ag + -induced DNA condensation and reveal a progressive structural transition from extended to globular conformations. The observed behavior provides insights into the biophysical consequences of metal–DNA interactions and may have implications for understanding the molecular basis of the antimicrobial activity of silver ions.},

Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, the heterogeneity of extensibility arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool for describing biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying extensibility. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise extensibility profiles. We find that this heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables, such as mean squared displacement, while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform for interpreting heterogeneous extensibility from experimental data, especially for biopolymers, as well as for designing heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.},

  abstract     = {In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies toward disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations, we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.},

  abstract     = {Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here, we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space, we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.},

Despite the absence of surface charge on the (non-polarizable) channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. In addition, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. Here, however, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena in uncharged tapered nanoslits, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.},

In response, surface-grafted polymers undergo a transition from an isotropic brush-layer in a good solvent to heterogeneous patches in CNS. To quantitatively describe this transition, we use the surface coverage θ as an additional order parameter and develop a theoretical model for its calculation, which is compared with the simulations. By further examining θ as a function of CNS concentration, we observe that PDNPs exhibit a collapse-reentry process similar to planar brushes, but with richer details of the two-step reentry behavior: angular isotropy recovery followed by radial expansion. We investigate how this CNS-induced collapse transition influences the reversible adsorption/exclusion of cargo nanoparticles on PDNPs, depending on the size of the cargo and the concentration of the cosolvent.},

  abstract     = {The generalized Langevin equation provides a powerful framework for modeling and interpreting the conformational dynamics of (macro)molecules in solution. However, recent studies have shown that the standard fluctuation–dissipation relation—linking the memory kernel to the statistics of the random force—can include a non-zero cross correlation term between conservative and random forces. This raises questions about how to correctly extract memory kernels from simulation data when this correlation is neglected and whether inverting the Volterra equation to obtain a memory kernel yields a physically meaningful result. In a recent work [Wolf et al. J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 054113 (2025)], we proposed an approximation to account for the cross correlation term. We demonstrate in this work that cross correlations play a significant role in the collapse transition of a hydrophobic polymer under various solvent conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation yields an improved description of barrier crossing times. Notably, we find that this improvement has the same magnitude as the improvement gained by accounting for memory effects.},

Thermal effects on the structure, enthalpy (Δ ads H ), and Gibbs free energy (Δ ads G ) of adsorption were analyzed. The relatively fast surface diffusion of the adsorbate was identified as the dominant anharmonic effect causing an increase in Δ ads G of up to 50% compared to static harmonic calculations. In contrast, the anharmonic effect on Δ ads H was shown to be nearly negligible. The computed thermodynamic data were used to predict the desorption kinetics parameters, i.e., activation energy ( E a ), Arrhenius pre-factor ( ν ), and position of desorption maximum ( T max ). Among the DFAs tested, the PBE + D4 method was found to provide the best overall agreement with the experimental data. The SCAN + MBD, PBE + D3, and PBE + D2 methods predict E a values that agree with the experimentally determined value within the reported uncertainty but significantly underestimate T max .},

By analyzing mode distributions with respect to coordination environments, we identify the distinct contributions of terminal and bridging hydrogen atoms to specific spectral regions. The results show that structural modifications, such as interlayer stacking and edge termination, have a significant influence on vibrational characteristics, particularly in the intermediate and high frequency regions. The vibrational database enables the precise interpretation of infrared spectra and offers a reliable reference for model selection and peak analysis in both experimental and theoretical studies on hydrogen boride sheets and related materials.},

The functionalization of graphene induces charge localization, while ring disorder disrupts the continuous flow of electrons.

Aqueous mixtures of cesium hydroxide and sodium nitrite were compared to alkali hydroxide analogs using small-angle x-ray scattering, revealing that cesium disrupts the sodium nitrite electrolyte structure, forming cesium-rich domains. This mesoscale segregation contrasts with the near-ideal mixing observed in other mixed hydroxide–nitrite systems. Raman spectroscopy indicates cesium–nitrite ion pairing, evidenced by vibrational shifts distinct from those associated with sodium. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further supports cesium–nitrite and cesium–hydroxide association, revealing a distinct local environment for nitrite in cesium-containing solutions. Together, these findings show that cesium promotes a unique solution structure dominated by specific ion pairing within segregated domains.

One of the advantages of the present method is that it is applicable to deeply cooled and heavily compressed states where a CO 2 hydrate is formed. The experimental solubility curve against temperature is successfully recovered with an appropriate correction for the self-polarization energy implicitly embedded in the pairwise additive interaction model for water. The solubility of water in liquid CO 2 coexisting with an aqueous solution decreases upon cooling. It is found that the intervening hydrate steadily reduces the solubility of water compared to that assumed to be in direct contact with the aqueous phase. The significant decrease results from the decrease in the chemical potential of water in the hydrate, relocating the boundary from the water/hydrate to the hydrate/fluid. Liquid CO 2 loses its capacity to retain water upon cooling more seriously than that anticipated from the water/fluid boundary, and an excessive amount of water is precipitated into hydrate at low temperatures. The thermodynamic properties thus calculated provide valuable information on problems in the massive transport of CO 2 , specifically the blockage of pipelines and corrosion of vessels.},

  abstract     = {Modeling ionic activity is essential for understanding ion-specific effects in environmental and industrial systems. The microscopic interactions of heavy metal salts in aqueous solutions become increasingly complex with rising salt molality, posing significant challenges for accurately modeling ionic activity. This study applies, for the first time, an electrolyte version of the cubic-plus-association equation of state to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficients of several heavy metal salts in water at 298.15 K. Experimental data for four types of salts—nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc salts—were compiled, and the ion–water binary interaction parameters are regressed from these measurements. The model successfully predicts water activity, osmotic coefficients, and mean ionic activity coefficients across most systems. Without explicit incorporation of ionic association, the average calculation relative average deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for nickel and cobalt salts is 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, extending the applicable molality range up to 5.0 mol/kg water and 5.5 mol/kg water. For solutions of cadmium salts and zinc salts that have been confirmed to contain ion pairs, ion association was introduced into the model for calculation. The calculation results indicate that the consideration of ion association has significantly reduced the calculation deviations. Within the calculated salt molality ranges, the average relative deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for cadmium salts is all below 2.0%, while that for zinc salts is all less than 5.5%, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the micro-level factors influencing activity coefficients and offers recommendations for improving model accuracy under complex conditions.},

We compare this standard method to a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods. We propose that, for a liquid with a sufficiently high dielectric permittivity, the cavity protocol yields a self-spectrum consistent with the electrostatic boundary conditions applicable to the experimental situation.},

  abstract     = {We have generated SiNSi in supersonic free jet expansions and measured laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra in the ultraviolet region. On the basis of rotational analyses, nine vibronic bands in the LIF spectra have been attributed to the C ̃ Δ u 2 – X ̃ Π g 2 electronic transition of SiNSi. The 32 393 and 32 505 cm −1 subbands have been assigned to the two spin components of the 0 0 0 band. In addition, the C ̃ (02 2 0) μ Σ u ( + ) 2 –, (02 0 0) Δ u 2 –, (02 2 0) κ Σ u ( − ) 2 –, (10 0 0) Δ u 2 –, (04 2 0) μ Σ u ( + ) 2 –, (04 0,4 0) μ Δ u 2 –, ( 0 6 2 0 ) μ Σ u ( + ) 2 –, and ( 1 6 2 0 ) μ Σ u ( + ) 2 – X ̃ ( 0 0 0 0 ) Π g 2 bands have been identified. The experimental identification that the Σ u ( + ) 2 level is lower than Σ u ( − ) 2 suggests that the in-phase bending potential, labeled as V + , is the lower (or outer) one for the C ̃ Δ u 2 electronic state. The Δl = ±2 vibronic bands, such as C ̃ (02 2 0) Σ u ( + ) 2 – X ̃ ( 0 0 0 0 ) Π g 2 ⁠ , which are forbidden by the Δl = 0 selection rule, are induced by the (quadratic) Renner–Teller (R–T) interaction of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state with the E ̃ Σ u + 2 state, i.e., the vibronic transition moment is induced by the quadratic R–T (2RT) interaction of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state with the E ̃ Σ u + 2 state. The vibronic bands can also obtain their transition moments through their neighbors, which are the vibronic bands of the electronically forbidden D ̃ Σ g + 2 – X ̃ Π g 2 transition. Based on the theory of the quaternary R–T (4RT) interaction, the vibrational structure of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state has been analyzed, and a local perturbation between the C ̃ ( 0 2 l 0 ) levels and their neighbor, D ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π u 2 ⁠ , has been identified. The observations suggest that, although the direct couplings between the C ̃ Δ u 2 and D ̃ Σ g + 2 states are negligible, their indirect couplings through the other states are effective.},

  abstract     = {We have generated SiNSi in supersonic free expansions and observed laser induced fluorescence (LIF) in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions. We measured two kinds of LIF excitation spectra from the X ̃ Π g 2 electronic state: one detecting UV fluorescence and the other detecting visible fluorescence. By exciting the vibronic bands observed in the LIF excitation spectra, we recorded dispersed fluorescence (DF) spectra from the single vibronic levels to the X ̃ Π g 2 state. The vibrational structures of the DF spectra are complicated due to the relatively large vibronic interactions in the X ̃ Π g 2 state. We were not able to analyze the structure using regular formulations derived from perturbational treatments that consider the Renner–Teller (R–T) and spin–orbit (SO) couplings and the anharmonicity of the ν 2 bending potential. Instead, we analyzed it by directly diagonalizing the vibronic Hamiltonian, including not only R–T, SO, and the anharmonicity but also Fermi resonance between the ν 1 symmetric stretching and ν 2 modes and anharmonicities, x 11 and x 12 . The vibronic analysis revealed two characteristics: a relatively large R–T parameter, ϵ = +0.51, and a SO constant close to the bending frequency, A ≈ 0.8 ω 2 . Both these characteristics bring about accidental proximity of the vibronic levels in the D ∞h system, and this proximity causes heavy mixing among the vibronic levels. The results can be applied to find weak vibrationally hot bands in the rotationally resolved LIF excitation spectra observed, and actually the Q 1 p band head of the hot band, C ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π g 2 − X ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) κ Σ g ( + ) 2 ⁠ , has been able to be assigned. The band head assignment suggests an accuracy of a few cm −1 for the present vibronic analysis of the DF spectra, with a peak accuracy of ±3 cm −1 .},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds, crucial for the formation and stabilization of complex organic molecules, present intriguing possibilities for the existence of such molecular complexes in extraterrestrial environments. To investigate the microscopic hydrogen-bonding networks in nitrile–methanol clusters—potential candidates for interstellar organic complexes—we recorded infrared spectra of neutral XN-M (XN = nitriles; M = methanol) heterodimers in the 2600-3900 cm −1 range using infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR-VUV) spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations based on harmonic approximations are typically used to simulate such spectral peaks; however, they often fail to fully reproduce the experimental features. To overcome these limitations, we employed ab initio anharmonic algorithms and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Anharmonic algorithms successfully assigned elusive spectral features by accounting for vibrational couplings (e.g., Fermi resonances and combination bands), and AIMD proved essential for accurately assigning characteristically broad hydrogen-bonded OH bands unresolved by harmonic methods. Applying this integrated approach, we confirmed the distinct H-bonding preferences in the XN-M heterodimers: acetonitrile (ACN) and unsaturated aliphatic nitriles (e.g., 3-butene nitrile, 3BN; 4-pentene nitrile, 4PN) predominantly adopt linear N⋯H–O configurations, whereas acrylonitrile and benzonitrile favor cyclic double H-bonded structures. This study establishes a powerful framework that integrates advanced computational methodologies to decipher hydrogen-bonding motifs from complex spectral data, enabling the direct interpretation of both laboratory and astronomical infrared observations.},

The vertical detachment energy of Ta 2 N 3 − was determined to be 2.22 eV from the experimental photoelectron spectrum. Charge and bond order analyses reveal significant electron transfer from Ta to N and strong Ta–N bonding, supporting the relative stability and reactivity of the cluster. Energy decomposition analysis and natural orbitals for chemical valence analysis show that orbital interactions, especially π- and σ-donations from Ta 2 N − to N 2 , dominate the activation process of N 2 . Substantial charge transfer occurs from the Ta 2 N − fragment to the N 2 fragment, accompanied by noticeable polarization, which facilitates the breaking of the N≡N bond. The results highlight the importance of Ta–N bond coordination in stabilizing dissociated nitrogen atoms, making Ta 2 N − a potentially efficient species for N 2 activation.},

In this study, the impacts of temperature and the presence of a CO or O 2 atmosphere on the structures of Au 79 , Cu 19 Au 60 , Cu 39 Au 40 , Cu 60 Au 19 , and Cu 79 nanoparticles were investigated using a combination of global optimization, machine learning interatomic potentials, and density functional theory. We find that increasing gold content weakens CO and O adsorption and limits oxygen-induced structural changes, while copper-rich particles undergo pronounced oxidation and reconstruction. Bader charge analysis shows that, in bare nanoalloys, Au withdraws electron density from Cu due to their electronegativity difference. In oxidized Cu–Au nanoalloys, the charge on Cu atoms depends on the number of O neighbors and can reach values typical of Cu 2 O (0.6 e ) and CuO (1.1 e ). On average, the Cu atoms exhibit positive effective Bader charges of ∼0.9 e in these nanoalloys. Our results indicate that models of Cu–Au catalysts under oxidizing conditions must incorporate the full ensemble of metallic and oxidized configurations rather than a single most probable structure to predict true catalytic activity.},

  abstract     = {4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is a widely utilized DNA sensor, renowned for its strong affinity for the AT minor groove. Despite its essential role as a fluorescent probe in molecular biology and biomedical research, the origins of DAPI’s intrinsic fluorescence and the mechanisms behind its fluorescence enhancement upon DNA sensing remain unresolved. This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fluorescence dynamics of DAPI, both in solution and when bound to detect the AT minor groove of a self-complementary dodecamer duplex DNA. We employed an integrated approach combining femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence, transient absorption, and supported by theoretical calculations. The results reveal an unprecedented ultrafast inter-solute–solvent three-state excited-state proton transfer pathway, which clarifies the root cause of low fluorescence yield and fluorescence dynamics of free form DAPI in aqueous solution. Irrespective of the structural heterogeneity and rotamer conformation of the ground state of DAPI, this involves deprotonation of the excited state at a rate of ∼2.4 ps, followed by proton reuptake by the resulting weakly emissive deprotonated state, leading to direct reformation of DAPI’s ground state at 139 ps. Binding to the DNA minor groove completely inhibits this proton transfer, accounting for the significant fluorescence enhancement observed in the DAPI-DNA complex. Furthermore, the broadband capacity of our time-resolved fluorescence approach enables, for the first time, direct tracking of the fluorescence dynamic Stokes shift of minor groove-bound DAPI, revealing significant dispersive collective solvation dynamics specific to the sensing site. These findings provide valuable insights into how microenvironments dictate DAPI fluorescence dynamics and may assist in the strategic design of light-up sensors for recognizing interior hydration dynamics and local residue motions of DNA.},

However, there is a need to improve the inclusion of electron–vibrational interaction, the exchange and correlation effects arising from electron–electron interactions, and non-Born–Oppenheimer coupling to enhance the predictive power of the theory and its agreement with experiments. In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, we advance in the present work a microscopic quantum mechanical treatment of CISS based on the relativistic Breit–Pauli many-particle Hamiltonian. In particular, we determine in this context the effect that including non-Born–Oppenheimer components arising in a Taylor expansion of the electron–nuclear potential has on the spin–orbit coupling term of this Hamiltonian. We also consider in this framework the electron–electron exchange and correlation effects and propose some practical approximations based on non-relativistic approaches. Finally, we extend the application of the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian to describe nuclear–nuclear spin interactions and discuss the possibility of explaining enantiomeric selectivity in cross-polarization nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.},

It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so-called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. In this paper, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing us to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+ U , and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard U parameter for DFT+ U is determined using linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima—primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d -orbitals—leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+ U , and Hartree–Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+ U and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. Analysis of the band structures shows that while PBE often predicts metallic or half-metallic FM states, DFT+ U opens band gaps and correctly yields insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+ U and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+ U , suggesting that the Hubbard U parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+ U and PBE methods.},

Our methodology combines ab initio molecular dynamics with time-dependent density functional theory and a polarizable continuum model to characterize the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces of the rotor in cyclohexane. Time-resolved vibrational analysis based on wavelet transform enables the decomposition of the nuclear motion into time–frequency components. This approach allows us to follow the evolution of vibrational dynamics and their role in key relaxation pathways and spectroscopic signals. We propose that, although not directly observable, complex vibrational dynamics influence the emission by modulating both the transition energy and the emission dipole moment. These include C=C stretching, out-of-plane motions at the axle carbon, and rotor–stator torsional modes. For the first time, we assign and interpret low-frequency modes observed experimentally at ∼180 cm −1 in time-resolved fluorescence. We reproduce the extent and the dynamics of the pronounced red shift of the C=C stretching mode upon excitation, as observed in the femtosecond stimulated Raman spectrum (1585 cm −1 in the ground state vs 1350–1440 cm −1 in the excited state). Regarding the photoisomerization, we identify a clear correlated steric-relief mechanism of the two main relaxation coordinates: torsion about the C=C axle and pyramidalization at the stator–bridge carbon.

  abstract     = {Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is to frequently discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as Poisson’s ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson’s ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more information efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.},

Accurately capturing their flexibility requires the use of enhanced-sampling methods. Here we present a set of collective variables (CVs) for metadynamics simulations that extend the Cremer–Pople puckering coordinates to seven-membered rings, and we validate them on cycloheptane and other molecules of increasing complexity (buxenine-G, two azepane derivatives, and ε - caprolactone ) . The new CVs can be used directly in PLUMED—a popular open-source library for enhanced-sampling and free-energy methods—so they can be used directly in metadynamics workflows. They allow the investigation of conformational transitions, the identification of metastable states, and the mapping of free-energy landscapes of any seven-membered-ring molecule. This provides a quantitative framework for probing the conformational behavior of flexible seven-membered scaffolds and will aid in the rational design of conformationally locked substrates for enzyme engineering and related applications.},

The computational complexity of this model scales identically to CC2 with molecular size. Conventional CC2 and its regularized BWs-CC2 variants, as well as conventional MP2 and two of its regularized BW-s2 variants, were assessed on a 535 element database spanning thermochemistry, non-covalent interactions, barrier heights, and isomerization energies. To ensure a well-defined model chemistry, the assessment was performed using internally stable spin-polarized Hartree–Fock (HF) orbitals in the finite aug-cc-pVQZ basis without counterpoise corrections. As a result of using stable orbitals, contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that CC2 substantially outperforms MP2 on molecules with significantly spin contaminated reference orbitals without a significant increase in error on systems with a spin-pure reference, showing the value of its single substitutions. While no single choice of regularization parameters can be optimal for all datasets, we find that BWs-CC2 generally outperforms both CC2 and BW-s2 with a single judicious parameter choice. Additional tests on dipole moments and bond lengths of diatomics provide further support for the utility of this choice. The main outliers and poorest performing cases are associated with large amounts of spin-contamination in the HF reference, which is indicative of systems with either strong correlation or extensive artificial symmetry breaking. Overall, these findings argue that the perception of the quality of the CC2 ground state should be reevaluated and that it can be further improved upon by the soundly based BWs-CC2 variant with the recommended parameter choice.},

  abstract     = {Forming new hybrid quasiparticles by strong light–matter coupling is a promising tool for tailoring the photophysics and photochemistry of molecules. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of polaritons formed upon strong light–matter coupling has been extensively studied by pump–probe spectroscopy. Although it was predicted that the partial photonic character of polaritons should shorten their lifetime compared to purely molecular excited states, many studies do not observe this effect. So far, the unexpected longevity of the spectral signatures has been either explained by relaxation into a manifold of so-called dark states or by other uncontrolled effects that change the properties of cavity materials. In order to resolve these issues, we investigate here the dependence of the line shape of pump–probe spectra of polaritons on the ratio of photonic and molecular character. Furthermore, by phenomenologically including relaxation to dark states, we find that it is possible to spectrally resolve this relaxation process by observing a characteristic phase flip in the pump–probe signal. Our results show that the signatures of dark state relaxation and the influence of the cavity resonance energy and their contributions to the polariton dynamics can be disentangled from the spectral line shapes.},

It was shown that the region near the minimum of the correlation component of the 2RDM associated mainly with the Coulomb hole significantly affects the dispersion interaction energies of the systems concerned. As one of the consequences, the bond function approach to deal with the intermolecular correlation energies calculations was found to essentially and consistently enhance the convergence of the results with respect to the basis set size if the auxiliary functions were placed to cover the 2D minimum region.

For a model of cis – trans isomerization in a protonated Schiff base, vibronic effects induced by intramolecular torsional and bond-length-alternation modes act concertedly with a collective environmental mode, which plays the role of an effective tuning mode. The latter is coupled to a residual environment, and the combination of the effective and residual modes conforms to an overdamped Brownian oscillator type spectral density. Thermal averages are included by the thermofield dynamics approach, in line with the thermal Hamiltonian developed in Paper I. The m-NN potentials, modeled according to the regularized diabatic states representation, permit an accurate representation of the vibronic coupling Hamiltonian beyond a linear vibronic coupling model. The initial excited-state dynamics is determined by the approach to a curved conical intersection seam, followed by a strongly dissipative phase leading to equilibration in the adiabatic ground state. The characteristic inertial time scale of the environment impacts not only the time of approach to the conical intersection seam but also the isomerization yield. The present study makes first steps toward extending the m-NN approach to a treatment of collective environmental non-equilibrium evolution on par with intramolecular excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics.},

Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory’s validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.},

Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions—such as the Matérn kernel—directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a 50 μ s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.},

Typically, the variational Ansatz consists of repeated blocks of parameterized quantum circuits, where all parameters are updated in a standard optimization procedure. In contrast, our method selectively optimizes one block at a time while keeping the others fixed, allowing for significant reductions in computational overhead. This semi-global optimization strategy ensures that all qubits are still involved in the evolution, but the optimization is localized to specific blocks, thus avoiding the need to update all parameters simultaneously. We propose different approaches for choosing the next block for optimization, including sequential, random, and fidelity-based updation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a series of spin-lattice models with varying sizes and complexity. Our method preserves the accuracy of the time evolution with a much lower computational cost.

The fluorescence enhancement in the crystalline state of an ethylene derivative TPE-9CB is studied by adopting a QM:MM based approach using the SF-TDDFT method and RSH functional. It is observed that the OT-RSH functional delivers impressive results regarding photophysical properties. The twisting of the central C=C bond has been identified as the phenomenon that quenches the photoexcited state of the ethylene derivatives in THF solution. Notably, the minimum-gap point (MGP) along the α-torsional coordinate of the S 1 state in solution lies ∼0.1 eV below the Frank–Condon (FC) point for all the derivatives. Interestingly, all examined monomers exhibited nearly zero oscillator strength ( f values) near the point of minimum-gap, indicating minimal radiative transitions in the solution state. Conversely, the excited state deactivation channels, which involve the twisting of the central C=C bond in the solution phase, are effectively restricted in the solid state by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion from the neighboring molecules. In the solid state, the MGP is 0.48 eV above the FC point, demanding high energy to prevent photoinduced rotary relaxation. This effectively blocks nonradiative deactivation pathways, resulting in a significant enhancement of the emission response. Our findings underscore the potential of AIE phenomena in advancing material design and applications.},

  abstract     = {This work extends the variational determination of two-electron reduced density matrices to the generalized spin formulation within the doubly occupied configuration interaction treatment. We describe electronic states of N -electron systems by means of variational evaluation of the corresponding two-electron reduced density matrix elements, subject to determined N -representability conditions, arising from the restricted, unrestricted, and generalized spin approaches. The results are compared with those predicted by the counterpart treatments involving wave functions. We report potential energy curves for a series of hydrogen atom clusters with different geometries in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. These results allow us to analyze and discuss crossings between potential energy curves involving transitions between electronic states of different spin multiplicities. The predictions provided by these methods have been contrasted with the results arising from the full configuration interaction procedure, confirming changes of ⟨ S ̂ 2 ⟩ and ⟨ S ̂ z ⟩ expectation values.},

  abstract     = {In addition to translational and rotational symmetries, clusters of identical interacting particles possess permutational symmetry. Coarse-grained models for such systems are instrumental in identifying metastable states, providing an effective description of their dynamics, and estimating transition rates. We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning of collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship [F. Legoll and T. Lelievre, Nonlinearity 23 , 2131–2163 (2010)]. The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.},

  abstract     = {The (de)methylation regulates the functional interactions between the unstructured N-terminal of histones and other globular proteins. The multistate behavior of methyl-substitution makes the situation complex; for example, being mono-methylated, di-methylated, or tri-methylated. As a pivotal epigenetic marker, understanding its thermodynamic impact on protein-protein binding is crucial for the elucidation of the regulation mechanism of epigenetic modifications on target genes. To this aim, in this work, we present a cost-effective free energy technique named computational (de)methylation scanning with generalized Born and interaction entropy (dMSGB-IE). Our regime is built on implicit-solvent-based end-point free energy techniques and provides an efficient route to access the (de)methylation-induced affinity change with a screening power comparable to costlier alchemical free energy calculations. We first use a batch of histone-reader recognition protein-protein complexes as illustrative cases, showing the capabilities and reliabilities of dMSGB-IE. Then, we augment the method with the integrative structure prediction tool AlphaFold 3, providing a fully computational workflow for fast estimation of (de)methylation free energies. Based on a batch of testing systems, we validate the practical applicability and highlight the predictive power of the promising integrative modeling workflow.},

Polydispersity of the fluid and strong coupling of rotational and translational motions of the rods are two of the various hurdles in interpreting experimental results in complex fluid environments. Furthermore, the influence of volume fraction, ϕ , and absolute free volume, V free , which changes inherently with δ , on the dynamics is not adequately discussed in the literature. Thus, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the rods under two conditions: (i) constant pressure (in which ϕ changes with δ ) and (ii) constant ϕ . Under constant pressure, it is observed that the rotational relaxation time and, hence, the rotational diffusion constant, D R , vary with rod length, l , as D R ∼ l − α , where the value of exponent α increases from ∼3.0 to 3.2 while varying δ from 0% to 40%. It is observed that the effect of increasing ϕ dominates over the effect of increasing V free . Moreover, hydrodynamic interactions among beads within a rod contribute minimally to rotational dynamics, although partial hydrodynamic screening is observed for center-of-mass motion. Meanwhile, for fixed ϕ systems, increasing δ results in increasing V free and thus enhances tracer diffusion, a trend opposite to that observed under constant pressure.},

  abstract     = {We investigate, using Langevin dynamics simulations, the Rouse-type dynamics of active harmonic bead-spring percolation clusters of square and triangular lattices. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as a random telegraph process with correlation time τ , are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual nodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile forces act between pairs of nodes. For force monopoles, a dynamical steady state is reached where the network is dynamically swollen and the mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior at t > τ , MSD ∼ t ν , with ν = 1 − d s 2 where d s is the spectral dimension, in accord with a previously advanced general analytic theory. In contrast, dipolar forces require diverging times to reach steady state and lead to network shrinkage. Within a quasi-steady-state approximation, the MSD is found to saturate at the same temporal regime t > τ , which is followed by ballistic-like and/or diffusive behaviors. We further extend our study of dipolar forces to dilution regimes above the isostatic threshold, also known as “rigidity percolation”. Here, weak dipolar forces effectively do not shrink the network in steady state. Instead, they induce “rotational swimming” of the network. Yet, for the triangular lattice, an incipient discontinuous collapse transition occurs above a critical force amplitude value. Conversely, we find a continuous crossover to a collapsed state for the non-diluted square lattice, resulting from its marginal stability. We suggest that disordered solids be poised above the isostatic point to be stable against active dipolar forces, provided that the dynamical persistent length remains lower than the spring rest length.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen reduction of Fe 3 O 4 plays a pivotal role in sustainable steelmaking, offering a low-carbon alternative to traditional carbothermic processes. In this study, we employ density functional theory to investigate the dissociative adsorption of molecular H 2 and the subsequent adsorption behavior of atomic H on Fe 3 O 4 (110) surfaces, considering both stoichiometric and O-deficient configurations. Our results reveal that the type and location of O vacancies critically influence both the thermodynamics and kinetics of H 2 activation. Compared to the perfect surface, the presence of O vacancies increases the activation barrier for H 2 dissociation. Twofold coordinated O sites, which are thermodynamically more favorable to form, reduce the reaction exothermicity. Conversely, threefold coordinated O vacancies, though less readily formed, stabilize the dissociated state more strongly but incur the highest activation barrier. For atomic H adsorption, adsorption is strongly favored at O sites over Fe, particularly at hollow sites adjacent to twofold O ions. While O vacancies themselves are not favorable adsorption sites, they alter the local electronic environment and change the H binding strength. Bonding strength, quantified via the integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, shows a strong linear correlation with H adsorption energies across all surface types. This correlation underscores the critical role of H–O orbital hybridization in stabilizing adsorbed H species and provides a quantitative link between adsorption strength and the underlying surface–adsorbate bonding characteristics. Our results offer atomic-level insights into defect-mediated H 2 activation and H adsorption on Fe 3 O 4 , with implications for advancing hydrogen-based processes in steel production, hydrogen storage, and heterogeneous catalysis.},

Dodecylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10) was introduced as a surfactant to enhance the wettability of the Bi2212 sol on the single-crystal substrate, leveraging its excellent miscibility with the sol.

Although silver-based quantum switches operate via electrochemical conductance modulation, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework to investigate nitrate anion adsorption on Ag(100), Ag(111), and Ag(511) surfaces under varying electrochemical potentials. The stable configurations of nitrate adsorption on the electrode surfaces as a function of electrode potential are determined using the grand canonical approach within the CHE framework, revealing the surface reconstruction of Ag(511) analogous to the formation of nascent Ag–NO 3 complexes. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the critical phase transition occurs in agreement with the experimental switching threshold. Electronic structure calculations reveal metallic to semiconducting transitions in the reconstructed Ag–NO 3 complex layers, elucidating the mechanism of conductance modulation. The “off state” corresponds to insulating Ag–NO 3 surface complexes, while the “on state” arises from metallic Ag–Ag bridging at lower nitrate coverage under lower control voltage. This study establishes a general framework for anion-mediated quantum switching in transition metals and provides a design for nanoscale electrochemical devices.},

Eight possible dimerized configurations were identified through an exhaustive method, considering both translational and rotational symmetries, which in turn define eight diamond (100) surfaces. These surfaces are nearly degenerate in energy at zero pressure, but their energy differences become larger under high external pressure. At finite temperatures, the increasing pressure induces graphitization of the surfaces. The transition pressures differ among the various surfaces. By calculating the free energies of the surfaces, we determined the most stable surfaces at various pressures and temperatures and constructed a schematic P–T “phase diagram” to illustrate the stability competition and structural transitions of the surfaces.

In order to shed light on such coupled exciton–lattice dynamics, in this paper, we use a restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham approach, which is a computationally efficient method for electronic structure calculations in the lowest excited states. Within this framework, we analyze the correlated electron–hole dynamics of a bright exciton in the 1H–MoS 2 monolayer in real space at different temperatures and obtain the exciton diffusion rate that is in reasonable agreement with the experimental findings.},

  abstract     = {2D gallium nitride possesses distinctive electronic states, making it ideal for future optoelectronic devices because of the quantum confinement and enhanced many-body interactions inherent in its atomically thin form. This study explores the impact of molecular doping with Fe(II)-porphyrin (FeP) on these characteristics using first-principle calculations. Contact of the magnetic center Fe with the nitrogen site causes a 17% decrease in the energy barrier for the transition from intermediate spin ( S = 1) to high spin ( S = 2) state, highlighting the sensitivity of spin dynamics to doping sites. Molecular diffusion barriers increase by 9.6 kJ/mol upon spin transition, suggesting that the spin state influences molecular mobility within the material. Exploring spectral functions reveals that FeP doping introduces spin-dependent molecule levels within the bandgap, which may play a role in electron–hole separation and spin injection. In addition, we show that the molecule–substrate coupling lowers the exciton binding energy by 0.1 eV, with further reduction during spin transitions. This weakening is attributed to increased electron mobility, quantified by static polarizability. These results indicate that the molecular spin state can control electronic excitations within substrate materials, presenting a promising strategy for designing spintronic devices.},

The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché–Cahn paper [F. C. Larché and J. W. Cahn, Acta Metall. 21 , 1051–1063 (1973)]. Single-phase crystals in Larché–Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product μN of the number of particles N and their chemical potential μ . Similarly, the grand potential and the product pV of pressure and volume V may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs–Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is recovered by treating the number of lattice sites M as an additional thermodynamic variable. The difference G − μN can be identified with νM where ν is the thermodynamic force conjugate to M . The reinstated Gibbs–Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation under isothermal isobaric conditions. We have worked this out for a uniform one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The coupling between composition and strain is implemented by decomposing pressure in a mechanical component depending on deformed density N / V and an elastic term linear in the volume strain as determined by V / M . Various μ , p , T response functions are compared to the μ , V , T counterparts.},

It involves applying an intermediate Hubbard U value to the Ce 4 f states and another U value to the d states of the metal adatom that is optimized for each metal to match its calculated bulk cohesive energy with the experimental value. The results compare favorably with Campbell’s calorimetric measurements of metal adsorption heats on CeO 2 (111). Thus, this approach produces metal adsorption energies on ceria that are more accurate in both the single-atom and the bulk limits. Furthermore, it preserves a common reference for Ce so that calculations involving different metals adsorbed on ceria, e.g., bimetallic and multimetallic clusters, can be analyzed on the same footing.},

  abstract     = {We study compression of coesite to pressures above 35 GPa, substantially beyond the equilibrium transition pressure to octahedral phases (8 GPa to stishovite). Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. In addition to amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is the formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases [Hu et al. , Nat. Commun. 6 , 6630 (2015)], and another one is the formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold coordination [Bykova et al. , Nat. Commun. 9 , 4789 (2018)]. Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here, we show that employing metadynamics with Si–O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential [Erhard et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 1927 (2024)], one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions, but the octahedron chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature while, at 600 K, the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.},

In this study, we analyze orbital-resolved PET in CeO 2 using real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations. We discovered remarkable selectivity in the interatomic PET in CeO 2 . In particular, the photogenerated electrons maintain a consistent transport pathway from the O-2 p orbital to the Ce-4 f and Ce-5 d orbitals, irrespective of the polarization state (linear and circular) of the external optical field. We further observed a secondary splitting found upon the crystal field splitting in Ce-5 d and Ce-4 f orbitals due to the symmetry breaking of the original coordination field of Ce atom. The secondary splitting is manipulated by the polarization state of the external optical field and the detailed dependency is deciphered, which provides us guidance for manipulating the orbital splitting by optical. Comparative analysis with the electrons transfer characteristics induced by hole doping reveals that the selectivity of interatomic electron transfer and the secondary splitting are unique to the photoexcitation process. Our results and findings shed new light on the microscopic mechanisms and dynamical processes underlying PET in CeO 2 and may be generalized to other oxide semiconductors. These new insights may be beneficial for deciphering the ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy experiments and for understanding the photocatalysis mechanisms in ceria-based photocatalysis materials.},

In this study, we theoretically design a molecular switch based on a metal-free polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon diradical molecule dominated by strong electron-electron repulsions. By establishing a customized simulation framework that combines density functional theory with the numerical renormalization group method, and with the aid of a side-coupled two-orbital Anderson model, we systematically simulate the quantum transport governed by various kinds of Kondo effects. When the central energy level sweeps upward, the linear conductance tends to reach its unitary limit in the low-temperature regime, driven by the broadening two-stage Kondo effect window. As the side energy increases, a quantum phase transition from the two-stage Kondo effect to the spin-1/2 Kondo effect emerges, resulting in a stable, full conductance plateau. Furthermore, by tuning the exchange coupling between the central and the side orbitals, we simulate the impact of precisely adjusting the intramolecular dihedral angle of the molecule on the transport properties. The linear conductance exhibits a transition from zero to the unitary limit as the molecule smoothly evolves from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic regime. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon systems. Our suggested “ ab initio + model calculation” theoretical framework may offer a promising methodology for exploring the complex Kondo physics in real magnetic nanosystems.},

The present part of this series serves as a prerequisite for the work. The time-dependent rovibrational temperatures of CO were measured during the vibrational excitation process of CO/O 2 /Ar mixtures within the temperature range of 1680–2970 K and pressures of 1.37–2.43 bar to investigate the vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 . The state-to-state (StS) approach was employed in the simulations, where the vibrational energy levels of CO and O 2 are treated as pseudo-species. The datasets of vibrational state-specific reactive and inelastic rate coefficients for CO + O 2 , O 2 + Ar, and CO + O collisions were generated in this paper. The present StS simulations agreed well with the experimental data, whereas the Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfeld (SSH) formula predicted faster CO vibrational temperatures. A sensitivity analysis was then performed and highlighted that the vibration–vibration (V–V) energy transfer between CO and O 2 ( ⁠ τ V − V CO − O 2 ⁠ ) is the key item inducing the discrepancies observed between the SSH results and experimental data. Therefore, a new expression was summarized for calculating τ V − V CO − O 2 based on the present experiments, and it also agreed well with the measured data in the literature at 100–700 K. In addition, the oxidation of CO and the effects of vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 were discussed. Since differences in vibrational temperatures between CO and O 2 were observed during the relaxation process, the refined rate of vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 paves the way for the investigations in Part II.},

  abstract     = {We present a strategy for the quantum control of polyatomic bimolecular reactions using moderately intense, long-pulse laser fields. Bimolecular reactions pose a challenge to quantum control, not encountered in the unimolecular case, due to their complex scattering dynamics and the averaging of their observables over a thermal distribution of reactant states. Our approach bypasses these hurdles; it involves the interaction of a nonresonant, polarized field with the molecular coordinate-dependent polarizability tensor to generate spatially nonuniform Stark shifts of the potential energy surfaces. We focus on the commonly encountered case where the reaction dynamics involve complicating features such as several coupled electronic states, deep potential wells, a high density of vibronic states, and several transition states en route from reactants to products. We consider highly averaged observables, including the canonical and microcanonical rate constants. It is shown that the complexities of polyatomic bimolecular reactions introduce new opportunities for reaction enhancement and control. In particular, the occurrence of one or more potential wells combines with the spatial structure of the polarizability tensor to introduce a vast enhancement that is subject to control by the choice of field parameters. Our results are based on a quantum mechanical theory and ab initio calculations of the potential energy and polarizability tensor. As a model system, we consider the CH ( X 2 Π ) + N 2 ( X Σ g + 1 ) → HCN ( X Σ + 1 ) + N ( S 4 ) reaction, but our results and conclusions are general.},

The experiment has been performed at an incident electron energy of 1270 eV, using a highly sensitive multichannel electron momentum spectrometer with a coverable momentum range up to 9 a.u. The experimental results were compared with the associated theoretical profiles calculated by the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA), the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA), and the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) models, using the relativistic and non-relativistic Kohn–Sham orbitals as the target electron orbitals. The superiority of the DWBA model over not only the PWIA but also the DWIA was found for the whole momentum range up to 9 a.u., demonstrating that the interaction between the projectile and target electrons, as well as the distorted wave effect, plays an important role in explaining the momentum profile of inner-shell ionization. Furthermore, it was experimentally revealed that the branching ratio of the 4d 5/2 and 4d 3/2 ionizations slightly deviates from the value of the non-relativistic ratio and is only weakly dependent upon the momentum over the momenta investigated, indicating that the relativistic effect on the Xe 4d wavefunction is fairly small, as predicted by the theory. These results would provide detailed insight into the relativistic effect on electron distributions and (e, 2e) reaction dynamics for the inner-shell ionization.},

  abstract     = {The use of spectroscopic techniques to resolve the energy level structure of excitonic excited states and to elucidate the interaction mechanisms between excitons in quantum dots is of vital importance for the development and application of such materials. However, various static and dynamic one-dimensional spectroscopic techniques are limited by inhomogeneous broadening effects, making it challenging to directly observe the fine-level energy structure of quantum dots. We developed a 25 kHz shot-to-shot phase-cycling two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy technique to investigate the excitonic energy structure and exciton–exciton interactions in a quantum dot aggregate. Using CdTe/CdSe/ZnS core–shell–shell quantum dots as a model system, we implemented a 36-step phase-cycling scheme to acquire rephasing 2D spectra at zero waiting time under varying excitation powers. In these spectra, both diagonal and off-diagonal features reveal spectral components that are otherwise obscured in one-dimensional spectroscopy due to inhomogeneous broadening. The presence of off-diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra indicates non-negligible interactions between excitons with different transition energies. Power-dependent 2D spectroscopy reveals that, with increasing excitation power, high-energy states exhibit greater resistance to Auger recombination. The experimental method developed in this work may contribute to advancing the theory of excited-state structures and dynamics in quantum dots and other low-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {The physical picture of gas-phase optical transitions is normally presented as an isolated two-level system balanced by upward and downward processes. Isolated models assume a phenomenological treatment of collisional dephasing but do not strictly account for collisional population exchange with the rotational baths. While this assumption is valid under low-intensity conditions, where excitation is rate-limiting, isolated models can deviate from Beer’s Law at sufficient pressures and monochromatic intensities when both collisional broadening and power broadening are comparable to (or greater than) lifetime broadening, which are not uncommon conditions for cavity enhanced spectroscopies in the mid-IR spectral range. Although this problem has been addressed by rate-equation models for linear absorption measurements, a general treatment for multi-level quantum mechanical models suitable for non-linear absorption measurements (two-photon/two-color/pump–probe) is lacking. Isolated models require physical parameter inputs that disagree with expected values by at least an order of magnitude. These non-physical models undermine the ability to predict non-linear signal strengths under untested conditions and thereby limit the potential to optimize the sensitivity of non-linear spectroscopies and to expand their analytical applications (e.g., new analytes and/or buffer gases, changes in cavity free-spectral-range, changes in intracavity powers or wavelengths, and accurate investigation of physical phenomena). In this study, we derive bath-coupled models for gaseous pump–probe spectroscopy by application of the quantum Lindblad equation and detailed balance. Bath-coupled models are shown to fit data consistently across variations in intensity and agree with all physically expected values.},

  abstract     = {The electrostatic potential plotted on varying contours (V S ) of the electron density guides us in the understanding of how water interactions exactly take place. Water—H 2 O—is extremely well balanced, having a hydrogen V S,max and an oxygen V S,min of similar magnitude. As such, it has the capacity to donate and accept hydrogen bonds equally well. This has implications for the interactions that water molecules form, which are reviewed here, first in water–small molecule models and then in complex sites as lactose and its crystals and in protein–protein interfaces. Favorable and unfavorable interactions are evaluated from the electrostatic potential plotted on varying contours of the electronic density, allowing these interactions to be readily visualized. As such, with one calculation, all interactions can be analyzed by gradually looking deeper into the electron density envelope and finding the nearly touching contour. Its relation with interaction strength has the electrostatic potential to be used in scoring functions. When properly implemented, we expect this approach to be valuable in modeling and structure validation, avoiding tedious interaction strength calculations. Here, applied to water interactions in a variety of systems, we conclude that all water interactions take the same general form, with water behaving as a “neutral” agent, allowing its interaction partner to determine if it donates or accepts a hydrogen bond, or both, as determined by the highest possible interaction strength(s).},

While the results of the continuum DFT agree well with those of our earlier lattice DFT findings, our approach here allows us to refine our understanding of the stability and structure of nanoparticle-laden droplets. This is particularly relevant in light of the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, which has underscored the critical role of aerosol particles in virus transmission.

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are fundamental for probing the structural dynamics of biomolecules, yet their efficiency is limited by the high computational cost of exploring long-timescale events. Generative machine learning (ML) models, particularly the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), offer an emerging strategy to enhance conformational sampling. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities and limitations of DDPM in generating atomistically accurate conformational ensembles across proteins of varying size and structural order, ranging from the 20-residue folded Trp-cage and 58-residue BPTI to the 83-residue intrinsically disordered region Ash1 and the 140-residue intrinsically disordered protein α -Synuclein. Training DDPM on relatively short MD trajectories using both torsion angle and all-atom coordinate data, we demonstrate that it can reproduce key structural features such as secondary structure, radius of gyration, and contact maps, while effectively sampling sparsely populated regions of the conformational landscape. Notably, DDPM can also generate novel conformations, including transitions not explicitly observed in the training data. However, the model occasionally overlooks low-probability regions and may produce conformers with unclear physical relevance, warranting independent validation. These limitations are particularly evident in flexible systems such as IDPs. Overall, this work benchmarks DDPM as a viable tool for augmenting MD simulations, offering enhanced sampling with significant computational savings, while noting its limitations in capturing low-populated conformers. At the same time, it highlights the importance of rigorous validation and thoughtful interpretation when deploying generative models in computational biophysics.},

  abstract     = {Understanding laser-induced dynamics on metal surfaces poses significant challenges due to the intricate interplay between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom, which evolve on distinct timescales. In this study, we introduce a machine learning-accelerated approach to molecular dynamics simulations that incorporates anisotropic electronic friction, providing deeper insights into these complex processes. Our framework extends the accessible time and length scales for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, enabling a detailed investigation of the laser-induced activation of oxygen on the Ru(0001) surface. Statistical analysis reveals that strong electronic excitation dominates the first 800 fs after laser exposure. Beyond this timescale, energy deposited by electronic excitation continues to drive oxygen activation, while phonons, although always present as a dissipation channel, play a weaker role by buffering energy loss and redistributing kinetic energy among vibrational modes. The observed non-linear yield–fluence relationship, described by Y ∼ F n , underscores the pivotal role of electronic excitation. In addition, we identify the z -direction as the key activation mode for oxygen diffusion, with the exponent of the power law representing the quantized energy required for this process. This approach significantly accelerates dynamic simulations while offering valuable insights into the interplay between electronic and phononic excitations during laser-induced oxygen activation on Ru(0001).},

The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREPs) and effective spin–orbit terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin–orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cutoffs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. The transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects.

In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here, we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system’s correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.},

The low-pressure wurtzite phase of ZnO (with fourfold coordination of Zn and O) and the high-pressure rock salt phase (with sixfold coordination) exhibit nearly identical degrees of ionicity. For CO 2 , covalency slightly increases in the high-pressure β -cristobalite phase (where the carbon atom is fourfold coordinated) compared to its low-pressure molecular cubic phase (where it is twofold coordinated).

Based on the variable soft sphere molecular model and statistical inelastic cross section theory, an exponential correlation function was introduced to accurately describe transition probabilities between rotational energy levels, establishing a complete state-to-state rotational relaxation time computational model. Through systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, a strict linear relationship between the averaged rotational relaxation time and the model parameter θ ′ was discovered, significantly streamlining the parameter fitting procedure. For N 2 –N 2 , N 2 –N, O 2 –O 2 , and O 2 –O systems, optimal θ ′ values were determined with average relative errors below 0.7% when validated against recent theoretical data.

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics simulations are typically constrained to have a fixed number of particles, which limits our capability to simulate chemical and physical processes where the composition of the system changes during the simulation time. Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal growth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the composition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics simulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and nucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the addition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition function, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low acceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use a reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute particles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated code implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses harmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which can be considered a proxy for the system’s chemical potential. The osmotic pressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of ideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure regulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of an electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations would produce.},

  abstract     = {We examine the stationary-state equations for lattices with generalized Markovian dephasing and relaxation. When the Hamiltonian is quadratic, the single-particle correlation matrix has a closed system of equations even in the presence of these two processes. The resulting equations have a vectorized form related to, but distinct from, Lyapunov’s equation. We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super-diffusive-to-diffusive transition in a lattice with long-range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to 10 4 sites, representing an increase of 10 to 40 times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine-learning-based classification and extended reservoir approaches for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.},

Furthermore, it enables state estimation with quantified uncertainty, thereby providing researchers with a new aspect for analyzing the underlying physical process and guiding future model refinements. DA was successfully performed using experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis electrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble contact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the supercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8192 ensemble members. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step follows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with increased ensemble sizes.

  abstract     = {Flavoproteins are a ubiquitous class of redox proteins, enzymes, and photoreceptors that derive their versatility from the flavin cofactor—a prosthetic group that serves as the main locus of their spectral, photophysical, and (photo)chemical properties. It is thus common for computational modeling of flavoproteins to employ a hybrid approach that treats the flavin quantum mechanically and the remaining atoms classically. Such quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have proven powerful for studying flavoproteins so far, but users are often faced with a choice between treating the flavin electronic structure with ab initio wave function methods or using more approximate methods that allow for more extensive sampling of the protein dynamics. Herein, we present APEC-F 2.0, an automated QM/MM workflow that uses several open-source software packages to construct QM/MM models of flavoproteins. Exploiting the rigidity of flavin’s tricyclic isoalloxazine ring, the APEC approach iteratively optimizes flavin’s geometry in a static MM environment that represents a dynamic protein using a superposition of configurations generated from molecular dynamics. The automation of the code enables the systematic construction of QM/MM models using a common protocol and is suitable for comparing flavin’s spectral, electronic, and chemical properties in different redox, protonation, or excited states in a wide range of flavoproteins.},

This study investigates the connection between the Haven ratio H R , which measures the deviation of diffusivity of modifier alkali cations from random walk due to their backward-correlated hopping, and the stretching exponent β of the orientational correlation function associated with the nuclear magnetic resonance spin–lattice relaxation (NMR SLR) of these alkali nuclides. By analyzing the temperature-dependent NMR SLR rate data of alkali ions in a wide range of supercooled oxide network liquids, this study reveals a hitherto unknown approximate equality between H R and β . This relationship is shown to be consistent with a model of backward-correlated hopping of mobile modifier ions in a temporally frozen oxide network. Estimation of NMR SLR β for individual alkali ions in mixed-alkali systems offers a pathway to estimate species-specific H R values that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. These findings, when taken together, suggest that β can serve as a proxy for H R and offer new insight into the microscopic nature of glassy ion transport.},

Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all mean-field critical exponents characterizing the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted mean-field exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network’s sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network’s topology.},

Coupled cluster (CC) theory is systematically improvable toward the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation; however, it is very quickly limited by the computational cost of the calculation. Therefore, it has become imperative to develop low-cost methods that are able to reproduce CC results beyond the CC theory with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level of theory. Here, the distinguishable cluster (DC)-CCSDT and singular value decomposed (SVD)-DC-CCSDT methods are examined for their fidelity to the CCSDT(Q) correlation interaction energies for the A24 dataset and are shown to outperform CCSDT and CCSD(T). Furthermore, with (T)-based corrections of the SVD approximation, the SVD-DC-CCSDT method becomes an accurate and relatively low-cost tool for the calculation of previously intractable post-CCSD(T) energies in atomic orbital basis sets of unprecedented size.},

Our results indicate that condensates can show directed motion toward the promoter, driven by gradients in the RNA concentration. Analytical theory, consistent with simulations, predicts that the droplet velocity has a non-monotonic dependence on the distance to the promoter. We explore the consequences of this gradient-sensing mechanism for enhancer–promoter (E–P) communication using polymer simulations of the intervening chromatin chain. Directed motion of enhancer-bound condensates can, together with loop extrusion by cohesin, collaboratively increase the enhancer–promoter contact probability. Finally, we investigate under which conditions condensates can exhibit oscillations in their morphology and in the distance to the promoter. Oscillatory dynamics are caused by a delayed response of transcription to condensate-promoter contact and negative feedback from the accumulation of RNA at the promoter, which results in charge repulsion.},

While the time evolution of the structure factor can be measured relatively easily, modeling it has proved to be much more difficult. We believe the latter could be impeding our ability to control spinodal decomposition. Using synthetic data corresponding to two different polymer blends, we investigate the use of dynamic mode decomposition to model the time evolution of the structure factor during polymeric spinodal decomposition. Based on the accuracy and range of the predictions we obtained using dynamic mode decomposition, we believe our results are promising for the use of dynamic mode decomposition in an experimental setting, which could improve our ability to control spinodal decomposition in automated experiments.},

  abstract     = {Polymer density is a critical factor influencing material performance and industrial applications, and it can be tailored by modifying the chemical structure of repeating units. Traditional polymer density characterization methods rely heavily on domain expertise; however, the vast chemical space comprising over one million potential polymer structures makes conventional experimental screening inefficient and costly. In this study, we proposed a machine learning framework for polymer density prediction, rigorously evaluating four models: neural networks (NNs), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). Using a curated dataset of 1432 homopolymers from the PoLyInfo database, our comparative analysis indicated that the GCNN model enhanced by a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) for feature extraction achieves superior predictive accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE = 0.0497 g/cm 3 ; coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.8097) relative to the other models. Experimental validation on six polymers demonstrated strong agreement between measured densities and GCNN predictions with relative errors not exceeding 4.8%. In-depth error analysis combined with SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) and subgroup evaluations reveals fundamental relationships between specific functional groups and polymer density, improving the model’s interpretability. Furthermore, t-SNE visualization and kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis revealed that the D-MPNN framework effectively captures critical chemical space features governing density, explaining the GCNN’s superior performance. This work establishes a reliable and scalable computational framework for high-throughput polymer screening, providing scientific insights into structure–property relationships while positioning density prediction as a prerequisite for incorporating density-dependent properties into polymer informatics and accelerating the discovery of novel polymer materials.},

We then introduce a hidden variable method and a time-local approach to include temporal memory in the tICA-generated dynamics and generalize it to construct continuum models for the nonequilibrium case of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric diblock copolymer melt.},

However, surface defects generally affect the PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells because they serve as trapping and recombination sites for excitons (electron–hole pairs). In this study, density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the molecular passivation of surface defects in Sn-based mixed-halide perovskites. The results showed that a Lewis base is effective for passivating p -type defects. In addition, we established a molecule–defect interaction model to explain the passivation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are well known to give rise to a quantum confined structure of excitons. Because of this quantum confinement, new physics of hot exciton relaxation dynamics arises. Decades of work using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy have yielded initial simple observations, such as estimates of the cooling rate from single pump photon energy experiments. More detailed TA experiments employed variable pump photon energies to measure excitonic state-resolved transition rates. These TA measurements, usually the simplest form, have been employed to characterize QDs and their relaxation dynamics to this day. Yet, these TA measurements are fundamentally lacking in their ability to measure energy-resolved hot exciton cooling, which requires observation of the full cooling history through the real excitonic manifold. Here, we employ coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy (CMDS) to perform an atomistically directed study of hot exciton cooling in CdSe QDs, revealing energy resolved relaxation dynamics. CMDS experiments are compared with simulations and prior TA measurements and simpler theories. Our findings reveal a hot exciton relaxation dynamics landscape. This relaxation dynamics landscape is a linear or sub-linear function of excess energy for different structures of QDs, with a strong size dependence. Our model simulations parameterized by the empirical pseudopotential model reproduces the experimental functional form and the dependence upon QD diameter and shell.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of graphene are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature T and external stress τ . The elastic response is characterized by calculating elastic constants via three complementary methods: (i) numerical derivatives of stress–strain curves, (ii) analysis of cell fluctuation correlations, and (iii) phonon dispersion analysis. Simulations were performed with two interatomic models: an empirical potential and a tight-binding electronic Hamiltonian. Both models predict that the Poisson’s ratio ν of graphene increases monotonically with applied stress. The range of stresses studied spans the entire domain of mechanical stability of the planar structure. Two mechanical instabilities are identified. Under tensile stress, fracture occurs, signaled by the softening of a phonon mode at the Brillouin zone boundary ( K point). At the studied temperatures ( T < 1500 K), auxetic behavior ( ν < 0) appears only at high tensile stresses, near the fracture threshold. Under compressive stress, a spinodal instability associated with long-wavelength wrinkling is observed. Finite-size analysis of this instability at 300 K reveals the existence of a finite surface tension σ in the unstressed membrane, which arises from the anharmonic coupling between out-of-plane and in-plane fluctuations. The surface tension stabilizes the membrane’s flat morphology. In the thermodynamic limit, the onset of the wrinkling instability occurs when the compressive stress matches the surface tension ( τ = σ ). Under this spinodal condition, the area compressibility modulus B is characterized by a scaling law N −1/2 , where N is the number of atoms in the simulation cell.},

  abstract     = {Increasing evidences show the significance of low melting entropy in glass formation of substances. Our previous studies have uncovered the strong dependence between melting entropy in the eutectic mixtures and mixing enthalpy, which has been serving as an important reference for glass formation, showing that negative mixing enthalpy largely reduces the melting entropy. In this paper, we focused on the question as to how melting entropy is associated with another classical glass formation criterion of molecule/atom size difference of components. This question has been challenging since it is constantly entangled with the effect of mixing enthalpy and easily smeared. Here, four binary eutectics constituted by molecules with similar structural and chemical characteristics but quite different molecular size were elaborately selected. The extremely low mixing enthalpy measured in four eutectic systems using a C80 microcalorimeter guarantees the neglectable effect of the mixing enthalpy. The determination of melting entropies and the critical cooling rate for glass formation at the eutectic compositions for the four systems uncovers an evident relation between melting entropy and molecular size difference, confirming the compatibility of the two glass formation criteria for mixing systems.},

Both systems turned out to be good glass formers, differing by 17 K in the glass transition temperature, which indicated a strong change in the self-assembly pattern. This supposition was further confirmed by the analysis of dielectric spectra, where, apart from the α -relaxation, also a unique Debye (D)-mode, being a fingerprint of the self-association, characterized by different dynamical properties (dielectric strength, timescale separation from the α -process), was detected in both samples. Further diffraction and infrared investigations, supported by density functional theory computations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed that hydrogen (H)-bonds play a key role in the association in 3P1Pol, while in 3P1Pal, there are at least five different intermolecular interactions involving dipole–dipole forces and π-stacking, as well as extraordinary H-bonds formed between methylene groups neighboring with the formyl unit and carbonyl moiety. Finally, optimized dimeric structures, along with MD simulations, allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism responsible for the D-process in 3P1Pal. The presented data systematize previous understanding of molecular association as well as open new ways of exploring this phenomenon in aldehydes.},

This combination of techniques is useful to probe the individual motions of the anions and the cations, and the sample's overall flow response. The 35 Cl − dynamics appears to be close to the structural (or α-) relaxation as seen by rheology. To examine possible sub-α responses, we scrutinize different representations of the viscoelastic response, including the shear modulus G *, compliance J * = 1/ G *, fluidity F* = i ωJ* , and viscosity η* = 1/ F* , with some of these quantities being more susceptible to low-frequency features than others. This way, we are able to detect supramolecular rheological signatures not only for HmimCl but also for 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide. These results call for caution in the course of choosing particular response functions when estimating the degree of decoupling between the mesoscale dynamics and the structural rearrangements in ionic liquids.},

  abstract     = {Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li + ). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr 14 ][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x LiTFSI ≤ 0.3. We find that the charge–charge and density–density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI-doped [pyr 14 ][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density–density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x LiTFSI -sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.},

At temperatures <230 °C, a Sb 2 O 3 crystalline phase formed along the rhombohedral Sb 2 S 3 structure. The normal growth model with the activation energy of ∼250 kJ mol −1 was used to describe the microscopic crystal growth rate data, and the viscosity–diffusivity decoupling was characterized by Ediger’s parameter ξ varying between 0.40 and 0.55. The crystal growth rate was slightly higher in the film deposited on the glass substrate, with the compressive stress introduced at higher T having only a small effect. Meanwhile, the deposition on the glass substrate led to a significantly higher (especially below the glass transition temperature) nucleation rate, which underlines the key aspect of the crystallization process in very thin chalcogenide films: the formation of nuclei due to the internal stresses arising from the difference of the film/substrate thermal expansion coefficients.},

By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlate with the structural stability of the glasses and allow tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. In addition, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1 + d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.},

In addition to generating a database of minima and the transition states that connect them, these calculations and the PES based on them have been used to develop a simple and accurate model for the energy landscape. The model for the local minima is based on the number of gauche torsions as well as their interactions with neighbors and next-nearest neighbors, resulting in three parameters, which are fitted using the direct DFT results. The transition states are governed by 13 parameters based on differences between the two connected local minima. The model predicts that there are 44 530 local minima (not counting permutation-inversion isomers) connected by 525 028 transition states, including degenerate rearrangements. When compared to the actual stationary points, it achieves a minimum absolute energy error of 43 cm −1 for the local minima and 47 cm −1 for the transition state barriers connecting levels of different energy. The model also provides accurate predictions of the most kinetically relevant folding and unfolding pathways, for example, from very highly excited configurations to the global minimum.

  abstract     = {The formation of carbinolamine represents the crucial initial step in the aldol reaction, specifically involving the interaction between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone, facilitated by amine-catalyzed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (amine-MSN). In this process, a nitrogen atom from propylamine, which acts as the catalytic moiety, engages in the formation of a covalent bond with a carbon atom from acetone, leading to the generation of a carbinolamine intermediate. This reaction is significantly influenced by the presence of silanol groups located on the surface of the amine-MSN, which contribute to the catalytic activity. Moreover, the reaction solvent plays a vital role; water serves as an essential solvent that enhances the rate of the aldol reaction. In this work, a comprehensive investigation is conducted to understand the catalytic influence of water explicitly in carbinolamine formation via three distinct pathways: (1) without the assistance of silanol groups, (2) silanol assistance occurs indirectly through hydrogen bonding, and (3) a pathway that showcases direct silanol assistance in the hydrogen atom transfer processes. To analyze the reaction mechanism in the amine-MSN system, this study employs the fragment molecular orbital method, which can accurately treat the complexities associated with large molecular systems like the MSN pore model (Si 392 O 958 H 348 ). The concerted mechanism study reveals that the presence of water molecules significantly lowers the energy barrier associated with carbinolamine formation, thereby enhancing the feasibility and efficiency of the reaction. This insight highlights the pivotal role of the solvent and the nature of catalytic sites in optimizing aldol reactions within mesoporous silica frameworks.},

Here, we utilize time-dependent density functional theory to calculate the absorption spectrum of C 6 − ⁠ , allowing us to reassign the peaks in the experimental spectrum to the vibronic progressions associated with the C 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u and D 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u electronic transitions. A vibronic coupling density analysis reasonably explains the strong vibronic peaks and validates the reassignment. We also discuss the potential softening caused by quadratic vibronic coupling in the excited states and the partially allowed vibronic transitions. In addition, we show that a pseudo-Jahn–Teller distortion occurs along the ν 4 ( σ u + ) antisymmetric stretching mode due to the pseudo-degeneracy of the A and B states.},

As an example, the spectra of the E 3 Σ 1 + ← A 3 Π 0 + ( 5 3 P 1 ) transition, originating from the excitation of a single 116 Cd 40 Ar isotopologue, are recorded and analyzed. In the experiment, the optical–optical double resonance method is employed, utilizing the E 3 Σ 1 + ( υ ′ ) ← A 3 Π 0 + ( 5 3 P 1 ) ( υ ″ = 6 ) ← X 1 Σ 0 + ( υ = 0 ) scheme. The excitation of a single isotopologue and the influence of the first-step excitation wavenumber on rotational level population distribution are carefully investigated, facilitating the simulation of the recorded rotational profiles. Spectra of several υ ′ ← υ ″ = 6 vibrational components are measured. Their analysis resulted in the determination of B e ′ ⁠ , α e ′ ⁠ , and β e ′ rotational constants. In addition, the R e ′ bond length in the E 3 Σ 1 i n + Rydberg-state inner well of 116 Cd 40 Ar was determined.

The key findings reveal a clear β -dependent ( β is the angle of alignment) scattering behavior: the β = 90° configuration in the abstraction channel enhances reactivity and dominates the formation of the products at lower vibrational states with increasing collision energy. In contrast, the β = 0° configuration promotes all vibrational states in the exchange channel. Notably, the β = 45° configuration displays the smallest cross sections in both channels due to destructive quantum interference, contrasting with the constructive interference in the β = 90° configuration. Channel competition analysis demonstrates that β = 0°/45° configurations enhance exchange channel dominance, whereas β = 90° favors the abstraction channel. The differential cross section shows that the products in the abstraction channel shift from backward to forward in the β = 0°/45° configuration, while maintaining sideways distributions in the β = 90° configuration, and in the exchange channel, it is always backward scattering. The highest reaction rate in the abstraction channel occurs at the parallel alignment in the temperature region between 200 and 1000 K.},

  abstract     = {The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex and dynamic environment in which molecular collisions play a crucial role. Among these, protonated carbon chains are of great interest due to the presence of a permanent dipole moment and their relevance in describing astrochemical processes, making their detection possible in cold molecular clouds such as TMC-1. C 5 H + ( ⁠ 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) is an important molecule for understanding the formation and evolution of carbon-rich environments. However, to accurately model its abundance and spectroscopic properties, it is essential to account for its collisional interactions with H 2 , the most abundant molecule in the ISM. In this study, we present a quantum dynamical study for the C 5 H + –H 2 collision, employing high-level CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations to construct an accurate potential energy surface (PES). The PES is further augmented using a neural network fitting model, ensuring spectroscopic accuracy. The PES is expanded into radial components using bispherical harmonics. Then, close coupling methods were used to calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for different rotational transitions of C 5 H + , up to 100 K. Throughout the temperature range, a propensity is observed for even transitions over odd transitions. The rate coefficients for He and H 2 collisions are compared for C 5 H + , C 5 , and C 6 H − . For both low and high temperatures, rate coefficients for C 5 H + are found to be higher than C 5 and C 6 H − for both the He and H 2 collisions.},

This study demonstrates that high-energy kHz pulses can confine 1- μ m-radius polystyrene beads in water within ∼26 μ m. This approach utilizes the unique properties of high-energy pulsed lasers, distinct from continuous-wave and megahertz pulsed lasers traditionally used in optical trapping. The pulsing nature of the kHz laser generates strong instantaneous forces that attract and confine particles within a specific region, inducing a “ping-pong” motion within the confined space. When the laser pulses strike the microparticles, the strong gradient forces pull the particles toward the laser focus, while the scattering force from the laser pushes them away. This interaction creates a dynamic equilibrium, causing the particles to oscillate continuously in a back-and-forth motion until the laser is blocked. This phenomenon differs from conventional optical trapping, which offers unique particle confinement possibilities. When combined with optical trapping, especially at femtomolar concentrations or single-particle conditions, this novel development shows that the kHz laser draws particles from significant distances toward the focal point, enhancing its trapping efficiency. All experiments were conducted on a single setup, varying only laser characteristics, ensuring high credibility in the results.},

  abstract     = {Sum-frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) has been well-established as a unique spectroscopic probe to interrogate the structure, interaction, and dynamics of molecular interfaces, with sub-monolayer sensitivity and broad applications. Sub-1 cm −1 High-Resolution Broadband SFG-VS (HR-BB-SFG-VS) has shown advantages with high spectral resolution and accurate spectral line shape. However, due to the lower peak intensity for the long picosecond pulse used in achieving sub-wavenumber resolution in the HR-BB-SFG-VS measurement, only molecular interfaces with relatively strong signal have been studied. To achieve detailed understanding and broader applications in molecular interfacial studies with HR-BB-SFG-VS, higher sensitivity and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HR-BB-SFG-VS is required. In this report, we present a systematic effort on the significant improvement of sensitivity and SNR for HR-BB-SFG-VS. Through optimization of laser pulse characteristics, automatic sample height control, and detection conditions, the sensitivity of HR-BB-SFG-VS was improved, reaching a level of 3 × 10 −6 of the SFG signal from the α-quartz standard. The high SNR spectra of various molecular interfaces are thus obtained with exquisite line shapes and fine spectral features. To name a couple of examples, a new hydrogen-bonded water band around 3300 cm −1 can be explicitly identified in the air/neat-water interface spectra and pure chiral spectral peaks at the level of 1 × 10 −5 of the quartz signal were measured at the air/Leucine aqueous solution interface etc. Such improvements in sensitivity and SNR in HR-BB-SFG-VS have brought and shall bring new opportunities and new discoveries with broad applications to molecular interface studies, in addition to the advantage of HR-BB-SFG-VS for its sub-wavenumber spectral resolution and the ability for intrinsic spectral line shape.},

The reference is obtained as the antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals, termed Strictly Localized Geminals (SLG), which can capture static correlation at mean-field cost. Geminals entering SLG are spin unrestricted, in general, and are expanded in the one-electron basis of the natural orbitals of the unrestricted Hartree–Fock wavefunction. Dynamic correlation is accounted for by perturbation theory (PT) at second order via a Dyall-like Hamiltonian acting as the zero-order operator [Földvári et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 034103 (2019)]. Here, an explicitly correlated (F12) correction is added to SLGPT2 to improve the description of dynamic correlation and enhance convergence with respect to the basis size. The resulting SLGPT2-F12 scheme inherits the fragmented structure of the SLGPT2 method, facilitating an efficient solution scheme. For numerical illustration, the SLGPT2-F12 approach is applied to small diradical systems, mainly focusing on singlet–triplet splittings.},

For this purpose, we decompose the complex MP2 energy of the core-hole state into contributions from specific decay channels and propose a corresponding equation-of-motion (EOM) method for computing the doubly ionized final states of Auger decay. These methods lead to significant savings in computational cost compared to our recently developed approaches based on coupled-cluster theory [F. Matz and T.-C. Jagau, J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 114117 (2022)]. The test set for this study comprises water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and silane. The energies of the final states of Auger decay are obtained with an accuracy comparable to EOM coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) theory. Partial decay widths and branching ratios between KLL, KLM, and KMM decay of K-shell holes in third-row hydrides are in good agreement with EOM-CCSD, while deviations are more significant for second-row hydrides. For L 1 -shell holes, which undergo Coster–Kronig decay, MP2 yields unphysical results. However, we show that a suitable shift of the MP2 energy denominators leads to more reliable branching ratios and spectra for these problematic cases.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scales of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields that recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.},

  abstract     = {Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power make FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method’s inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water–methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move, the determinant locality approximation, or the determinant T-move schemes, while the older locality approximation leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes—highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an efficient method, TTN-HEOM, for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme with the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system–bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac–Frenkel variational principle, which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO , tensor equations for non-Markovian structured open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics and one adaptive-rank method with a variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude–Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable of simulating both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum systems interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with an affordable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {We present a self-consistent algorithm for optimal control simulations of many-body quantum systems. The algorithm features a two-step synergism that combines discrete real-time machine learning (DRTL) with Quantum Optimal Control Theory (QOCT) using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Specifically, in step (1), DRTL is employed to identify a compact working space (i.e., the important portion of the Hilbert space) for the time evolution of the many-body quantum system in the presence of a control field (i.e., the initial or previously updated field), and in step (2), QOCT utilizes the DRTL-determined working space to find a newly updated control field for a chosen objective. Steps 1 and 2 are iterated until a self-consistent control objective value is reached such that the resulting optimal control field yields the same targeted objective value when the corresponding working space is systematically enlarged. To demonstrate this two-step self-consistent DRTL-QOCT synergistic algorithm, we perform optimal control simulations of strongly interacting 1D as well as 2D Heisenberg spin systems. In both scenarios, only a single spin (at the left end site for 1D and the upper left corner site for 2D) is driven by the time-dependent control fields to create an excitation at the opposite site as the target. It is found that, starting from all spin-down zero excitation states, the synergistic method is able to identify working spaces and convergence of the desired controlled dynamics with just a few iterations of the overall algorithm. In the cases studied, the dimensionality of the working space scales only quasi-linearly with the number of spins.},

  abstract     = {H 3 S, LaH 10 , and hydrogen-based compounds have garnered significant interest due to their high-temperature superconducting properties. However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH 4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of yttrium (Y) by scandium (Sc), lanthanum (La), and zirconium (Zr). Pure YH 4 , stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature ( T c ) of 84–95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases T c to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H 4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H 4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H 4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed T c of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H 4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without an optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y–H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron–phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance T c in hydride superconductors.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic Schrödinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), designed for simulating open quantum system dynamics under arbitrary spectral densities. This extension employs non-exponential basis sets to expand the bath correlation functions, overcoming the reliance of the original cNMSSE on exponential decompositions of the spectral density. Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward–backward stochastic Schrödinger equations and extended hierarchical equation of motion.},

Here, we introduce an adversarial training framework that aligns CG trajectory ensembles with all-atom (AA) reference dynamics, ensuring both thermodynamic and kinetic fidelity. Our method adapts the adversarial learning paradigm, combining a physics-based generator with a neural network discriminator that differentiates between AA and CG trajectories. By adversarially optimizing CG parameters, our approach eliminates the need for predefined kinetic features. Applied to liquid water, it accurately reproduces radial and angular distribution functions as well as dynamical mean squared displacement, even extrapolating long-timescale dynamics from short training trajectories. This framework offers a new approach for bottom-up CG modeling, offering a systematic and principled way to preserve dynamic consistency in complex coarse-grained molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modeling volume-dependent properties of water remains a challenge for density functional theory (DFT), with widely used functionals failing to reproduce key features of the water density isobar, including its shape, density, and temperature of the density maximum. Here, we compare the performance of the RPBE-D3 and vdW-DF-cx functionals using replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) driven by machine-learned force fields. Our simulations reveal that vdW-DF-cx predicts the water density more accurately than RPBE-D3 and reproduces the isobar closely between 307 and 340 K. In contrast, RPBE-D3 underestimates the density across the entire temperature range. However, vdW-DF-cx predicts the maximum density temperature to be ∼30 K higher than experiment. Using the local structure index, we attribute this shift to an onset of low-density, ice-like structures in the vdW-DF-cx-based MD at too high temperatures. Static DFT calculations on water dimers and representative high- and low-density water structures reveal that key features of the density isobars are reflected in the static energy-volume curves. In particular, the equilibrium intermolecular distance and curvature correlate with the maximum density and curvature around the maximum of the density isobar. Similarly, the early onset of the low-density structure is connected to the energetic preference for more structured, low-density water over a less ordered, high-density water structure. Decomposing the exchange–correlation energy reveals that the non-local dispersion energy decisively influences the predicted equilibrium intermolecular distances, whereas the semi-local part governs the balance between low- and high-density liquid structures.},

In the Kohn–Sham scheme, the many-electron Schrödinger equation is replaced by a set of effective single-particle equations. Thus, the full complexity of the quantum mechanical many-particle effects is mapped to the exchange–correlation potential v xc ( r ). Almost all DFT calculations done in practice rely on approximations to v xc ( r ). However, numerical representations of the quasi-exact v xc ( r ) can be obtained from quasi-exact densities by inverting the Kohn–Sham procedure. This inverse Kohn–Sham scheme is an important source of insight into exact DFT. Here, we review the inverse Kohn–Sham problem and explain in detail several aspects of why Kohn–Sham inversion is intrinsically difficult. We then present several inversion schemes and discuss their pros and cons, specifically addressing the effects of statistical uncertainties that are inevitable in quantum Monte Carlo reference densities. We use these schemes to obtain representations of v xc ( r ) that correspond to the ground-state densities that have become available from accurate diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on real space grids for the Li 2 and N 2 molecules, and the C atom. In the latter, the highest occupied orbital has a nodal line and the exchange–correlation potential goes to a different asymptotic value in this direction. As an outlook, we discuss the possibility of interlacing quantum Monte Carlo and Kohn–Sham theory by using the quasi-exact Kohn–Sham determinant to fix the nodes in a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation.},

They register displacements/velocities caused by random forces, but do not address their physical nature. This deficiency is resolved in the force route to the diffusion constant leading to Kirkwood equation for massive diffusive particles (Brownian motion). Approximate Kirkwood equation becomes exact when the force relaxation time is replaced with the memory time. To formulate the force route to the diffusion constant, memory functions were calculated here from molecular dynamics simulations of six charge mutants of the green fluorescent protein and the plastocyanin protein in a wide range of temperatures. The memory time falls between the velocity and force relaxation times, with the Kirkwood equation overestimating diffusion constants of proteins by a factor of ∼ 4 ⁠ . Diffusion constants from the velocity/displacement route strongly increase with increasing system size. Standard protocols accounting for finite-size effects show serious flaws when applied to protein diffusion by producing system-size corrections far exceeding both the finite-size diffusion constants and their infinite-size extrapolations. Diffusion constants from the force route show much less system-size dependence, and corrected values are mostly independent of the system size.},

There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble and, in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity–force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations.

For highly bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines whether, upon increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or via a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on binding site topology, we numerically investigate APs made of DNA, where “sticker” sites formed by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, ( AA ) 6 , and the other with two distinct alternating types, ( AB ) 6 . At low temperatures, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the ( AA ) 6 system remains homogeneous, while the ( AB ) 6 system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead–spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- vs inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable and realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depend on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled manner.},

However, most theoretical models require in-depth knowledge or advanced mathematical and computational skills, which prevents their broad use. Here, we present a simple model extending the Alexander–De Gennes ansatz for arbitrary chain length distributions, allowing us to easily rationalize the effect of polydispersity, which is a feature of all realistic brushes. This model can predict the interaction of a brush with nanoparticles or an opposing wall, as demonstrated by good qualitative agreement with molecular dynamics simulations. An open-source Python implementation of our model is freely available on GitHub, and the model allows for efficient screening of brush designs to reach technological applications.},

  abstract     = {All-solid-state Li-metal batteries using solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) in combination with high-voltage cathodes such as lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) promise enhanced battery safety, energy density, and flexibility. However, understanding the oxidative decomposition of SPEs on the cathode surfaces and characterizing the resulting cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) remain challenging both experimentally and computationally. This study introduces a new computational protocol based on ab initio molecular dynamics for simulating the decomposition of PEO:LiTFSI SPE on the NMC-811 cathode surface using a combined electron- and Li + -removal simulation approach. This method incorporates the effects of the applied electric potential and Li + migration on electrolyte oxidation during battery charging. The calculations indicate that electrons are withdrawn from both the C–C bonds of PEO and the Ni–O bonds of NMC-811, resulting in C–C bond cleavage and the formation of decomposition fragments. The created Li vacancies in the NMC facilitate coupling between decomposed PEO and exposed surface oxygen. The ROCH 2 O-M species, identified as the major degradation product on the NMC-811 cathode surface, is in agreement with the experimental XPS spectra. This approach provides detailed insights into the oxidative decomposition of PEO-based SPEs and demonstrates its effectiveness in exploring CEI component formation.},

We first provide a description whereby elements of the second-order susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the order parameters ⟨ P 1 ⟩ and ⟨ P 3 ⟩. We then illustrate how experimental data would be used to extract those parameters and how a most probable orientation distribution function could be determined by subsequently maximizing the information entropy.

However, providing a consistent computational description of the unique structural features of these SAMs, such as adsorption patterns, chain conformations, and superlattice arrangements, is challenging, particularly within a versatile computational framework that can simulate both the structural features of these systems and their irradiation-driven chemical transformations. This study systematically analyzes molecular mechanics force field parameters for bonded and nonbonded (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions in alkanethiol SAMs with different terminal groups. Using structure optimization and energy decomposition analysis, we assess the impact of force field parameters on key properties, such as the equilibrium tilt angle, ligand packing density, and nanoscale structural organization. Based on this detailed benchmarking, an optimal set of force field parameters has been identified that reproduces the experimentally determined structural and energetic properties of SAMs and ensures their dynamic stability at room temperature. This provides a validated framework for simulating pristine and functionalized alkanethiol-coated substrates under thermal conditions relevant to experimental applications.},

  abstract     = {In close proximity to quantum emitters (QEs), plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate energy exchange with the QEs, which is known as plasmon–exciton coupling. The strong coupling regime, associated with Rabi splitting, is crucial for advanced nanophotonic devices, including solar cells, single-photon nonlinear optics, and nanolasers. Recently, high refractive index semiconductor NPs (typically Si NPs) have emerged for designing strongly coupled systems. However, their large mode volumes of magnetic Mie resonances have limited their success in achieving strong coupling. This study investigates the plasmon–exciton coupling between an Ag–Si core–shell and a monolayer QE of WS 2 (Ag–Si–WS 2 system) in air and water environments. Here, we compare the coupling dynamics of the hybrid Ag–Si–WS 2 system to that of the Si–WS 2 system as a benchmarking system. Employing Mie’s theory of core–shell scattering, in conjunction with Maxwell–Garnett effective medium theory, we analyze the optical responses of both configurations. Then, we calculate the Rabi splitting frequency for each system to identify the coupling regime. Our results suggest that the Ag–Si–WS 2 system can achieve a deep-strong coupling regime when the Ag core radius is less than 30 nm, with enhanced coupling strength in water compared to air. Conversely, the Si–WS 2 system does not achieve strong coupling in either medium. The hybrid modes in Ag–Si–WS 2 demonstrate remarkable symmetrical spectral characteristics compared to the asymmetric spectral line shape observed in the Si–WS 2 system. The findings suggest avenues for utilizing the plasmon–exciton strong coupling in the Ag–Si–WS 2 system to enhance optoelectronic and quantum electronic devices.},

Equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations are used to obtain density-wave amplitude distributions, which serve as inputs for the GL model to predict γ and its anisotropy. The predicted γ values exhibit strong agreement with prior benchmark simulation experimental studies, particularly for FCC crystal–melt interfaces (CMIs). The GL models for the CMI γ are proved to be both computationally efficient and reasonable, offering quantitative predictions of γ while providing insights into the factors controlling its magnitude and anisotropy. Key improvement is suggested for the variational procedure used in the two-mode CMI free energy functionals, and potential upgrades to the GL model are also proposed to further enhance predictive accuracy.},

In this work, we examined the bandgap nonlinearity and composition-dependent bowing in pure-phase α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 epilayers (0 < x < 0.62) grown via laser molecular beam epitaxy on m -plane sapphire substrates. The variations in the x-ray rocking curve full width at half maximum and surface roughness of epilayers with increasing Al composition x follow the trend predicted by the theoretical formation enthalpy of α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys. The high crystalline quality of the α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 epilayers was further confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations. While lattice constants adhered to Vegard’s law, the optical bandgap (5.28–7.22 eV) exhibited nonlinearity, with a bowing factor of 1.33 eV, aligning closely with theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that the observed optical bandgap nonlinear effect in the α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloy primarily stems from charge exchange, rather than volume deformation or strain relaxation effects, providing a pathway for precise bandgap tuning in Ga 2 O 3 for high-performance power electronics.},

  abstract     = {Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) is a critical material in non-linear optics, with significant applications in electro-optical and laser technologies. Despite its importance, the solution properties of KDP remain poorly understood, and to the best of our knowledge, no prior molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have directly probed the structure and behavior of KDP in aqueous solutions. This study presents results from MD simulations of KDP in both solution and solid states and compares four dihydrogen phosphate (DP) force-field models in five different water models. Our results reveal that the solution structure is strongly dominated by the association of the DP anions through direct hydrogen bonding, where the degree of association exhibits a marked concentration dependence in accord with the experiment. Of the four DP models evaluated, two are much better able to reproduce experimental data, including from neutron scattering and ab initio MD simulation results, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the hydrogen bonding patterns that appear to govern local solution structure. We find that the extent of hydrogen bonding between DP anions is also sensitive to the choice of water models, with stronger hydration reducing DP–DP association. We have also examined the two models for both tetragonal and monoclinic crystal structures of KDP and found that these models are able to reproduce the experimental parameters relatively well. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of KDP solutions and lay the groundwork for future investigations into its solution and solid-state properties and behavior.},

Deep potentials are a recent alternative to investigate the properties of ice I h , aiming to match the accuracy of ab initio simulations with the simplicity and scalability of classical molecular dynamics. This becomes particularly significant if one wishes to address nuclear quantum effects. In this work, we use machine learning potentials obtained for different exchange and correlation functionals to simulate the structural and vibrational properties of ice I h . We show that most functionals overestimate the density of ice compared to experimental results. Furthermore, a quantum treatment of the nuclei leads to even further distancing from experiments. We understand this by highlighting how different interatomic interactions play a role in obtaining the equilibrium density.

According to a complexation scenario proposed earlier, a steady-state ensemble of finite-sized droplets of a metastable solute-rich liquid can emerge in a solution, if the solute molecules can form transient complexes with each other and/or solute. Here, we solve for the thermodynamics of an explicit model of a self-associating fluid in which particles can form transient dimers. We determine ranges of parameters where two distinct dense liquid phases, dimer-rich and monomer-rich, respectively, can co-exist with each other and the solute-poor phase. We find that within a certain range of the dimer’s binding strength, thermodynamic conditions for mesoscopic clusters to emerge are indeed satisfied. The location and size, respectively, of the corresponding region on the phase diagram are consistent with observation. We predict that the clusters are comprised of a metastable monomer-rich dense liquid, while the bulk solution itself contains substantial amounts of the dimer and exhibits large, pre-critical density fluctuations. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase commonly observed during the macroscopic liquid–liquid separation should be dimer-rich, another testable prediction.

Force fields can provide effective surrogates for first-principles calculations, and in the case of Au, many such force fields exist. To clarify the current state of Au structure prediction using force fields, we used parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations to explore the temperature-dependent shape distributions of Au 147 and Au 55 from three different Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) force fields. We used machine learning to classify nanoparticle shapes and observe a wide variation in the temperature-dependent shape distributions among the various force fields, accompanied by a wide range of melting temperatures. We also compared the EAM structures to those from literature studies employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Gaussian process regression machine-learning force field, density functional tight binding, the Gupta potential, and Density Functional Theory (DFT). We re-optimized the lowest-energy structures from each force field/study using DFT and found that the lowest-energy structures for both Au 147 and Au 55 are amorphous. These structures were predicted by the ANN and DFT. Most of the 30 structures with minimum energy for each size are either hollow or partially to totally disordered and not icosahedral, as the sizes of these nanocrystals might imply.},

  abstract     = {Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) leverage superatomic properties via well-defined geometric/electronic configurations to enable novel reactions. The development of SCCs has facilitated atomic-level insights into catalyst design, thereby advancing our understanding of the fundamental nature of catalytic reactions. While orbital symmetry rules guide unimolecular catalyst design, the role of superatomic orbital symmetry in SCC reactivity remains elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated the gas-phase reactions of Ag n − ( n = 7–25) clusters with C 2 H 4 , employing a combination of time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This revealed strong size-dependent reactivity: Ag 7–11, 18–23 − showed remarkable stability, whereas Ag 12–17, 24–25 − adsorbed one or even two C 2 H 4 molecules. The electron clouds of 1S superatomic orbital in Ag 12–15, 24–25 − clusters are partially localized on specific atoms. This partial localization enables effective interactions between the 1S orbital and the π orbital of C 2 H 4 , while concurrently enhancing stability through the formation of bonding orbitals and the d -orbital coupling among silver atoms. Notably, C 2 H 4 adsorption induces structural reorganization of Ag 16, 17 − , resulting in the formation of icosahedral cages. These cages contain highly symmetrical electron clouds that provide symmetrically matched orbitals, favoring secondary C 2 H 4 adsorption and thereby enhancing the stability of complexes. Our research introduces a novel framework for the precision engineering of superatomic clusters while broadening the application scope of the superatomic properties of metal clusters. The discovery of the superatomic orbital symmetry rule sheds light on the activity series of SCCs and offers new insights into precise SCC engineering.},

In 2006, Wester’s group introduced a novel ion-trap-based technique to measure the absolute photodetachment cross section [Trippel et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 , 193003 (2006)] of OH − . In the present work, we propose a novel methodology to streamline this technique to reduce the measurement time by several orders of magnitude by combining a single experimental rate measurement with a simulated column density distribution of the trapped ions. We validated our approach by reproducing the cross section reported for OH − at 632.8 nm. Using this technique, we report the first such measurement for a molecule of biological interest, deprotonated indole, at a laser wavelength of 403 nm. The proposed scheme is anticipated to have a significant and transformative impact on the development of a comprehensive database for photodetachment and photodissociation cross sections of molecular ions. Furthermore, these measurements have the potential to drive the development of cutting-edge computational codes for cross section calculations, enabling an unprecedentedly detailed understanding of electron dynamics in large molecules and the light–matter interaction.},

  abstract     = {Propargyl radical (•C 3 H 3 ) and butadienyl radical (• i -C 4 H 5 ) are two crucial intermediates in combustion and astrochemistry, particularly in the formation of C 7 H 8 aromatics such as toluene. However, the precise formation mechanisms of the first-ring aromatics through C 3 + C 4 reactions have remained ambiguous. This study explores the detailed potential energy surface (PES) of C 7 H 8 at the •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 entrance reaction channel, alongside conducting kinetic calculations and modeling. The PES reveals distinct mechanistic pathways that depend on the resonance configurations of •C 3 H 3 (propyne-3-yl and allenyl-1-yl). Key C 7 H 8 isomers, including 5-ethylidenecyclopenta-1,3-diene, cycloheptatriene, and norcaradiene, are preferentially formed via the allenyl-1-yl configuration, underlining the significant influence of π electron delocalization of propargyl. Kinetic analysis using the phase space theory and the RRKM/ME method identifies well-skipping reactions, leading to larger resonance-stabilized •C 7 H 7 radical and hydrogen atom through the less dominant allenyl-1-yl configuration reacting with • i -C 4 H 5 . Rate constants for •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 reaction yielding toluene and vinylcyclopentadienyl (vinylCPDyl) + H are determined. Subsequent kinetic modeling indicates that the formation pathway •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 → toluene predominates at low temperatures and pressure, contrasting with other toluene formations via benzyl + H and phenyl + CH 3 reactions. •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 reaction is also notably significant for generating vinylCPDyl at temperatures exceeding 1050 K at 760 Torr. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) typically form in high-temperature scenarios, this research suggests viable low-temperature pathways for toluene, which are important in cooling zones of engines, thereby influencing PAH and soot production via resonance stabilized radical chain reactions.},

  abstract     = {The proton transfer reactions of the Ne atom with the H 2 + molecular ion and its isotope variants have attracted considerable attention due to their importance in plasma physics and the fundamental study of elementary reaction dynamics. To obtain high-precision dynamics results, a globally accurate ground-state NeH 2 + potential energy surface (PES) is constructed using the permutation invariant polynomial-neural network method based on 35 035 ab initio points calculated at the UCCSD(T)/AV5Z level. On the new PES, the state-to-state quantum dynamics calculations of the Ne( 2 S) + H 2 + /D 2 + ( v 0 = 0, j 0 = 0) reactions are performed. The calculated results indicate that the products of the two reactions are generated by the dissociation of short-lived complexes when the collision energy is slightly larger than the reaction thresholds, whereas a direct abstraction process gradually plays the dominant role as the collision energy increases. The newly constructed PES can be used to further accurately study the quantum dynamics of the Ne + H 2 + reactive system, including the effects of rovibrational excitations and the spatial alignment of reactant molecules.},

  abstract     = {Molecular systems with orbital (near-)degeneracy at the Fermi level tend to adopt a high-spin ground state. In these systems, one often finds low-lying electronic excitations with a lower total spin that can be reached from the ground state by a spin-flip-down excitation. In this work, we present three spin-adapted spin-flip-down time-dependent density functional theory (SFD-TD-DFT) approaches to calculate the excitation energies for these types of electronic transitions. These SFD-TD-DFT methods are based on a restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham (ROKS) formulation within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), giving rise to the ROKS-SFD-TDA family of methods. The three methods differ in the kernel, having different two-electron coupling elements in the resulting working equations. In agreement with earlier work, we find that a noncollinear description of the kernel is vital for producing a decent description of these excitations. In terms of obtaining excitations with a definite spin, we present two fully spin-adapted ROKS-SFD-TDA methods that either stem from configuration interaction with single excitations (SF-CIS) or from the already existing equation-of-motion ansatz (SF-TDA). It is shown that the spin-adaptation in SF-CIS and SF-TDA gives rise to artificial double counting of correlation effects by incorporating double excitations. When discarding this double counting, one ends up with an excited state that is partly spin-adapted (only in the open-to-open configurations). This method is called quasi-spin-adapted SF-TDA (Q-SF-TDA) and is shown to be a stable and efficient method that performs similarly to spin-unrestricted SFD-TD-DFT.},

However, accurately calculating spectral features at the L or M edges is challenging due to the significant influence of spin–orbit and multiplet effects. While scalar-relativistic effects can be incorporated with minimal computational cost, accounting for spin–orbit interactions requires complex frameworks that can be computationally expensive. In this work, we develop a reduced-cost state-interaction approach for simulating near-edge soft x-ray absorption spectra of closed-shell transition metal complexes with relativistic effects incorporated using the ZORA-Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian. The computed spectra closely agree with those obtained with state-of-the-art approaches. This methodology provides a practical and cost-effective alternative to more rigorous two-component methods, making it particularly valuable for large-scale calculations and applications such as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering simulations, where capturing a large number of excited states is essential.},

Our analysis reveals that the relaxation time to equilibrium scales inversely with the square of the memory decay rate λ , i.e., τ relax ∝ λ −2 . To understand the origin of this scaling, we analyze the escape dynamics from a potential well and find that the mean escape time follows the same λ −2 dependence. This indicates that the slow relaxation arises from memory-suppressed fluctuations that delay escape events. To explain these findings, we reformulate the GLE using an auxiliary variable, embedding the non-Markovian dynamics in a higher-dimensional Markovian system. This approach provides a clear physical picture of how memory influences noise, diffusion, and relaxation in non-Markovian systems.},

While significant advances have been made through frameworks, such as the fluctuation theorem, it remains challenging to define thermodynamic quantities, such as energy, entropy, and free energy, at the local level during nonequilibrium processes. Recently, Jinwoo and Tanaka [Sci. Rep. 5 , 7832 (2015)] have proposed a formalism (the JT formalism) that defines local thermodynamic properties via a path ensemble of microstates over time. In this work, we apply the JT formalism to the polymer collapse process as a model nonequilibrium system to observe the collapse dynamics in terms of the end-to-end distance as the mesoscopic variable. Through extensive Langevin dynamics simulations, we quantify conformational free energy, lost information, and nonequilibrium free energy as functions of time and conformation. Our results validate the JT’s work fluctuation theorem, which relates work and local nonequilibrium free energy. This study highlights the utility of the JT formalism in analyzing dynamic thermodynamic behavior in complex soft matter systems.},

  abstract     = {Isotope-edited infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing site-specific structures and dynamics within proteins. However, the interpretation is often complicated by spectral congestion and environmental heterogeneity. In this study, vibrational exciton models combined with molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine the frequency distributions and IR spectra of isotope-labeled local modes (ILMs) in parallel coiled-coil dimers. Based on the difference spectra obtained by subtracting the unlabeled spectrum from the labeled one, a new method to estimate labeled local-mode frequencies is proposed. The IR peak positions predicted from both the ILMs and specific normal modes systematically deviate from their corresponding average frequencies, primarily owing to asymmetric broadening. This asymmetry, which is characterized by the skewness of the mode density of states, arises from heterogeneous fluctuations in the local environment. Time correlation analysis revealed that solvation-induced dynamics persist on timescales (0.22–3.30 ps) exceeding the vibrational lifetime, causing incomplete motional averaging and pronounced inhomogeneous broadening. These effects result in skewed frequency distributions and contribute to peak localization errors. The application of asymmetric Gaussian fitting models and perturbative corrections improved the accuracy of the ILM frequency estimates, with sub-wavenumber precision achieved when spectral separation was sufficient. The heptad-repeat architecture of coiled coils further introduced register-specific vibrational patterns, emphasizing the role of the local environment. Collectively, the results highlight the critical role of solvation-induced heterogeneity in shaping isotope-edited IR spectra and demonstrate the need to consider both dynamic and statistical spectral asymmetry when performing high-resolution vibrational analysis of proteins.},

  abstract     = {Three-body interactions have long been conjectured to play a crucial role in the stability of matter. However, rigorous studies have been scarce due to the computational challenge of evaluating small energy differences in high-dimensional lattice sums. This work provides a rigorous analysis of Bain-type cuboidal lattice transformations, which connect the face-centered cubic (fcc), mean-centered cubic (mcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and axially centered cubic (acc) lattices. Our study incorporates a general ( n , m ) Lennard-Jones (LJ) two-body potential and a long-range repulsive Axilrod–Teller–Muto (ATM) three-body potential. The two-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations are evaluated to full precision using super-exponentially convergent series expansions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to computing three-body lattice sums by converting the multi-dimensional sum into an integral involving products of Epstein zeta functions. This enables us to evaluate three-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations to machine precision within minutes on a standard laptop. Using our computational framework, we analyze the stability of cuboidal lattice phases relative to the close-packed fcc structure along a Bain transformation path for varying ATM coupling strengths. We analytically demonstrate that the ATM cohesive energy exhibits an extremum at the bcc phase and show numerically that it corresponds to a minimum for repulsive three-body forces along the Bain path. Our results indicate that strong repulsive three-body interactions can destabilize the fcc phase and render bcc energetically favorable for soft LJ potentials. However, even in this scenario, the bcc phase remains susceptible to further cuboidal distortions. These results suggest that the stability of the bcc phase is, besides vibrational, temperature, and pressure effects, strongly influenced by higher than two-body forces. Because of the wrong short-range behavior of the triple–dipole ATM model, the LJ potential is limited to exponents n > 9 for the repulsive wall, otherwise one observes distortion into a set of linear chains collapsing to the origin.},

  abstract     = {The water molecule’s electronic Cartesian multipole moment and polarizability tensors have been fitted with Gaussian process regression to the internal coordinates and are used to evaluate accurate electrostatic, induction, and dispersion energy components between flexible molecules. The model yields a handful of damping and scaling parameters that were adjusted for the energy components to agree with 2-body symmetry-adapted perturbation theory decomposition and then fine-tuned in order for the total energy to agree with CCSD(T) for small clusters. We present a simple algorithm for rotating symmetric Cartesian tensors and employ a dispersion potential based on multipole polarizabilities. At short range, the 2- and 3-body potential energy was corrected to CCSD(T) accuracy using Gaussian approximation potentials. The radial distribution function and self-diffusion coefficient obtained with molecular dynamics simulations agree well with experiments.},

  abstract     = {We develop a multiset matrix product state (MPS) approach based on the time-dependent variational principle to solve the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for the fermionic bath and apply it to inelastic vibrational scattering on metal surfaces. By using a Newns–Anderson model with two nuclear degrees of freedom, we investigate the vibrational energy relaxation of NO scattering on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. Our results show that the extent of vibrational relaxation depends strongly on both incident energy and molecule–surface coupling strength. Vibrational relaxation on the Au(111) surface is enhanced with increasing incident energy due to greater transient electron transfer. The dependence on molecule–surface coupling strength and effective metal bandwidth is more complex. In the case of scattering on the Au(111) surface with low initial vibrational excitation, the landscape of the adiabatic potential energy surface plays an important role. Stronger coupling enhances transient electron transfer and leads to more pronounced vibrational relaxation. However, for high initial vibrational excitation, the extent of transient electron transfer remains similar. Larger coupling strength increases adiabaticity and reduces vibrational relaxation. The vibrational relaxation on the Ag(111) surface is found to be more pronounced than on the Au(111) surface, consistent with experimental observations. Our study provides detailed insights into the nonadiabatic dynamics during molecule–surface scattering and demonstrates the utility of the multiset MPS–HEOM approach for studying such processes.},

In this paper, we present OD-QMEs for systems with time-dependent electronic coupling terms, which can be accomplished by driving the system with a time-dependent external field. We also present an asymptotic analysis that shows how the dynamics described by the OD-QMEs for a CT system driven by a CW field turns into rate kinetics governed by field-modified Marcus theory rate constants at long times and high temperatures (when Gaussian statistics is assumed). The ability of off-diagonal driving to open up new CT pathways that can compete with non-radiative pathways is demonstrated in the case of the Garg–Onuchic–Ambegaokar CT model driven by a CW field.},

  abstract     = {Proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) is pervasive throughout chemistry, biology, and physics. Over the last few decades, we have developed a general theoretical formulation for PCET that includes the quantum mechanical effects of the electrons and transferring protons, including hydrogen tunneling, as well as the reorganization of the environment and the donor–acceptor fluctuations. Analytical rate constants have been derived in various well-defined regimes. This Tutorial focuses on the vibronically nonadiabatic regime, in which a golden rule rate constant expression is applicable. The goal is to provide detailed instructions on how to compute the input quantities to this rate constant expression for PCET in molecules, proteins, and electrochemical systems. The required input quantities are the inner-sphere and outer-sphere reorganization energies, the diabatic proton potential energy profiles, the electronic coupling, the reaction free energy, and the proton donor–acceptor distance distribution function. Instructions on how to determine the degree of electron–proton nonadiabaticity, which is important for determining the form of the vibronic coupling, are also provided. Detailed examples are given for thermal enzymatic PCET, homogeneous molecular electrochemical PCET, photochemical molecular PCET, and heterogeneous electrochemical PCET. A Python-based package, pyPCET, for computing nonadiabatic PCET rate constants, along with example scripts, input data, output files, and detailed documentation, is publicly available.},

This Perspective offers mathematical context, illustrative applications, and conceptual motivation for using persistent homology (PH) to identify and provide new physical insight into the multiple spatiotemporal-scale patterns present in chemical data. We address the implications of different data representations and highlight the relationships of PH-derived descriptors to physicochemical properties and chemical behavior.

From this general connection, we derive a statistical connection, thereby establishing a statistical structure on the Newtonian gauge. Within this framework, we analyze the conformal symmetry of the tensor field K , defined as the difference between the statistical connection and the Levi–Cività connection. Moreover, we characterize the conditions under which a conformal Killing vector field on the underlying manifold also serves as a statistical conformal Killing vector field in the induced statistical geometry.},

Next, we construct a system of dissipative differential inequalities via the finite truncation of the proposed infinite RCS model. This overcomes the difficulty brought by the inaccessibility of infinite norms, which enables us to analyze the solution’s flocking behaviors.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability. The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler–Poincaré variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin–Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model’s Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map. Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie–Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie–Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler–Poincaré principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints. The dual Euler–Poincaré/Lie–Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.},

In this paper, we first prove the corresponding dynamical system is a gradient system. By the abstract results about the existence of global attractor, we will establish a quasi-stability inequality by using the global L r -regularity ( r ≥ 2) in time of the nonlocal Balakrishnan-Taylor term under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear damping term, which is sufficient to show the existence of a finite dimensional global attractor for such system.},

  abstract     = {The Hénon–Heiles system, initially introduced as a simplified model of galactic dynamics, has become a paradigmatic example in the study of nonlinear systems. Despite its simplicity, it exhibits remarkably rich dynamical behavior, including the interplay between regular and chaotic orbital dynamics, resonances, and stochastic regions in phase space, which have inspired extensive research in nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we investigate the system’s solutions at small energy levels, deriving asymptotic constants of motion that remain valid over remarkably long timescales—far exceeding the range of validity of conventional perturbation techniques. Our approach leverages the system’s inherent two-scale dynamics, employing a novel analytical framework to uncover these long-lived invariants. The derived formulas exhibit excellent agreement with numerical simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the system’s long-term behavior.},

By developing some new analytical techniques, we first provide a complete classification for the asymptotic behavior of the system by two real-valued parameters λ 1 , λ 2 . It is shown that: (i) If λ 1 < 0, both predator and prey populations go extinct eventually; (ii) Only the predator population will die out exponentially if λ 1 > 0 and λ 2 < 0; (iii) If λ 1 > 0 and λ 2 > 0, the existence and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution of the system is derived, which reflects the long-term coexistence of prey and predator populations. For practical application, a stochastic quasi-positive equilibrium N * is defined. By solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation, we obtain an approximate expression of the density function of the stationary distribution around N *. Finally, some numerical examples are performed to demonstrate our theoretical results. The techniques and methods used in the paper are general, and can be successfully applied to other complex stochastic population models.},

Viewing eigenvalues as nonlinear functionals of potentials, we use the complete continuity of eigenvalues to deduce a family of critical systems consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are dependent on the exponent p ∈ (1, ∞) of the Lebesgue spaces and m free parameters. The problem of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators can be transformed into the solvability of critical systems. Based on this relation, for p = 2 we can theoretically obtain the optimal potential from the integrability theory of Hamiltonian systems point of view. Finally, we observe the numerical experiments for the critical systems to propose the future direction.},

For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n : Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the η -correspondence ). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t = 4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the η correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.},

In the quantum information community, it is commonly believed that SIC-POVMs exist in all dimensions; however, the general proof of their existence is still an open problem. By mapping SIC-POVMs onto the generalized Bloch sphere, we prove two geometric existence statements associated with the SIC-POVM existence problem. First, we prove the Knaster’s conjecture for n vertices of an n -simplex and use that to prove the existence of a continuous family of general SIC-POVMs where the trace of the k th power of the operators is the same for ( n 2 − 1) of the elements. Furthermore, by using numerical methods, we show that in dimensions 3 and 4, a regular simplex can be constructed on the Bloch sphere such that all its vertices correspond to density matrices having the same trace of ρ 3 . In the three-dimensional Hilbert space, we generate 10 4 general SIC-POVMs for where all the elements have the same set of randomly chosen eigenvalues, indicating the continuous set of general SIC-POVMs can be constructed for all possible values of trace of ρ 3 .},

  abstract     = {For a diagonalizable linear operator H : H → H acting in a separable Hilbert space H ⁠ , i.e., an operator with a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of eigenvectors that form a Reisz basis of H ⁠ , the pseudo-Hermiticity of H is equivalent to its generalized parity-time-reversal ( P T ) symmetry, where the latter means the existence of an antilinear operator X : H → H satisfying [ X , H ] = 0 and X 2 = 1 ⁠ . The original proof of this result makes use of the anti-pesudo-Hermiticity of every diagonalizable operator L : H → H ⁠ , which means the existence of an antilinear Hermitian bijection τ : H → H satisfying L † = τL τ −1 . We establish the validity of this result for block-diagonalizable operators, i.e., those which have a purely point spectrum, eigenvalues with finite algebraic multiplicities, and a set of generalized eigenvectors that form a Jordan Reisz basis of H ⁠ . This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized P T -symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators. For a pair of pseudo-Hermitian operators acting respectively in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain explicit expressions for the antlinear operators τ and X that realize their anti-pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized P T -symmetry at and away from the exceptional points.},

  abstract     = {Recent works have revealed the intricate effect of long-range interactions on information transport in quantum many-body systems: In D spatial dimensions, interactions decaying as a power-law r − α with α > 2 D + 1 exhibit a Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) with a linear light cone and the threshold 2 D + 1 is sharp in general. Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form t r − α for any α > 0, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at α = 1 in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.},

  abstract     = {We study the decomposition into SU( N ) irreducible representations (irreps) of the tensor product 27 ⊗ 27 , where 27 is the highest-dimensional SU( N ) irrep present in a two-gluon system, and explicitly construct all Hermitian projectors on these irreps, as well as transition operators between them. This yields an explicit basis of the complete 27 ⊗ 27 color space (defined as the space of 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 color maps) in terms of orthogonal multiplets. This study shows that even complex color structures can be addressed, with the help of the birdtrack pictorial technique, using only elementary tools. In particular, we highlight the usefulness of the quadratic Casimir operator, whose eigenspaces allow efficient filtering of all projectors and transition operators, and of the permutation operators that further improve this filtering. The product 27 ⊗ 27 also has an interesting feature: three equivalent irreps 27 appear in the decomposition, two of which are symmetric and can therefore be distinguished neither by the quadratic Casimir operator nor by their symmetry under permutation. In this case, it is convenient to use Clebsch–Gordan coefficients to derive the two associated, symmetric projectors. The latter are not uniquely determined (only their sum is), and we give the set of all solutions. Finally, we explicitly derive the soft anomalous dimension matrix associated with 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 , whose block-diagonal main structure is easy to understand, but whose detailed spectrum properties remain intriguing. The approach presented for 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 could in principle be applied to any product of SU( N ) irreps, and eventually automated.},

Although the considered system with non-negative pressure is strictly hyperbolic with two genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, the delta shock wave still occurs in the solutions. For the delta shock wave, the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition are clarified. Under the impact of the friction term, the rarefaction waves and shock waves as well as delta shock wave are bent into parabolic curves. Also, it is shown that as the pressure goes to zero, the non-self-similar solutions of the considered system just converge to the non-self-similar solutions of the zero-pressure Euler system with friction.},

Since the pioneering work by Cao and Wu [Adv. Math. 226 , 1803–1822 (2011)], such problem has garnered much more attention. When the magnetic field is close to an equilibrium state, the study of stability and large-time behavior provides a significant example of the stabilizing effects of the magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids. In this paper, we consider the global well-posedness for 2D partially dissipation MHD equations around a uniform magnetic field in R + 2 with no-slip boundary condition. An efficient Stokes estimate is developed, which can be used to obtain the global low order ( H 2 ) energy for the partially dissipative MHD system with physical boundary. In addition, we obtain an explicit decay rate for the linear system using spectral analysis methods. We also observe that the half-space shares some similarities with the Cauchy problem, but exhibits some differences, especially when considering spatial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss lattice energy minimization problems for various interacting potentials, including Born-Mayer, Coulomb, Lennard-Jones, and Rydberg potentials. The main methods and techniques used in this paper are derived from Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016). Based on this, we derive a more comprehensive attractive-repulsive model that can be understood in the sense of exponential decay. Our research leads to a new lower bound for the inverse density of the triangular lattice when the Lennard-Jones potential with exponential decay is minimal, which is a significant improvement over previous results. More specifically, in Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016), the degree of the lowest order term of the Lennard-Jones potential is to satisfy x 1 > 3/2, but our result covers the interval (1, 3/2], making it the optimal case with a lower bound of 1. We extend the results for Morse potential to derive the optimal attractive-repulsive correlation coefficient conditions, i.e., ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 2.3853 and ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 7.3069. Also, our findings provide the first-ever inverse density bound when the triangular lattice is optimal for the Coulomb and Rydberg potentials, while the former gives global optimality without density constraints, and the latter gives upper and lower bounds on the density interval for optimality. Finally, we present numerical estimates of the inverse density, and these findings have critical applications in improving numerical simulations of radiation defects in crystals, especially in the α -iron lattice, and better understanding the properties of rare gases. Our solutions and improved estimates will enable researchers to better understand lattice energy minimization.},

  abstract     = {We show that for the Lindblad evolution defined using (at most) quadratically growing classical Hamiltonians and (at most) linearly growing classical jump functions (quantized into jump operators assumed to satisfy certain ellipticity conditions and modeling interaction with a larger system), the evolution of a quantum observable remains close to the classical Fokker–Planck evolution in the Hilbert–Schmidt norm for times vastly exceeding the Ehrenfest time (the limit of such agreement with no jump operators). The time scale is the same as in the recent papers by Hernández–Ranard–Riedel but the statement and methods are different. The appendix presents numerical experiments illustrating the classical/quantum correspondence in Lindblad evolution and comparing it to the mathematical results.},

  abstract     = {The existence of smooth periodic traveling solutions in the Dullin-Gottwald-Holm (DGH) equation and the monotonicity of the period function are clarified. By introducing two suitable parameters, we show the existence of periodic traveling solutions of DGH equation in a concise way. The monotonicity of period function with respect to different variables are proved by using Chicone’s criterion and the method developed by Geyer and Villadelprat. The problem of the spectral stability of smooth periodic waves in the DGH equation is discussed. Within the functional-analytic framework, we obtain a criterion for the spectral stability of smooth periodic traveling waves in DGH equation. In addition, we show the smooth periodic traveling solutions are orbitally stable under certain conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to studying the logarithmic nonlinear heat equations on a locally finite connected weighted graph G = ( V , E ). In a discrete sense, the global existence of point-wise solutions and blow-up phenomena at + ∞ are obtained under the general conditions. With the addition of the curvature dimension condition CDE ′( n , K )( K > 0) and other conditions, it is possible to estimate the range of mountain-pass level by using logarithmic Sobolev inequality, then decay estimates of the global point-wise solutions can be given. Finally, several numerical experiments are provided to validate the observed conclusions.},
