  abstract     = {The glycine receptor (GlyR) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays important physiological roles in the nervous system. Its malfunction is related to neurological disorders, including startle disease (hyperekplexia), which is characterized by exaggerated startle responses to sudden unexpected stimuli, such as noise or touch. Here, we unravel the molecular mechanisms of action of a specific mutation that is linked to startle disease: Asn46Lys (N46K). This residue, in the GlyR extracellular domain, is not directly involved in neurotransmitter binding but can disrupt the neurotransmitter pathway. To understand how, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the wild-type and mutated extracellular domain of a homomeric α 1 GlyR, assessing the effects of the Asn46Lys mutation. We then sampled multiple unbinding and binding events by means of metadynamics simulations, with a funnel restraint to limit the exploration in the solvent. By evaluating the binding free energy landscape, we observed a substantial reduction in neurotransmitter binding affinity, which is consistent with experiments. We suggest that such a reduction is linked to the interaction of its crucial glutamic acid residue with the lysine mutation competing with the glycine ligand.},

  abstract     = {In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage to wall teichoic acid (WTA) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) in two bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we found that ROS primarily induce structural damage through dehydrogenation reactions and the cleavage of C–C and C–O bonds. Notably, the teichoic acid (TA) from S. aureus was found to be more susceptible to damage compared to that of S. pneumoniae , which exhibited stronger antioxidant properties due to its ring structure and chemical modifications. The efficiency of damage increased with ROS concentration, following the order, O > O 3 > OH, with a maximum of 22.22% C–C bond cleavage observed at the highest concentration. In addition, the patterns of damage in the TA of these two bacterial species were significantly different. In S. aureus , WTA damage was predominantly characterized by C–C and C–O bond cleavage in the repeating units, whereas LTA damage was primarily due to the cleavage of C–C bonds in the ring structure. In S. pneumoniae , damage to both WTA and LTA mainly occurred at the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) ring structure and the poly (RboP) site. This study offers new insights into the sterilizing effects of plasma.},

  abstract     = {Silver ions (Ag + ) are known to interact with DNA through nonspecific and specific mechanisms, inducing conformational and mechanical changes in the double helix. In this study, we investigate how varying Ag + concentrations affect the mechanical properties of DNA, in particular, contour length, persistence length, end-to-end distance, and area of occupation, using atomic force microscopy. At low Ag + concentrations, we observe localized stiffening and shortening of DNA molecules, which we attribute to the formation of monoadducts and biadducts with specific DNA bases. These interactions promote the emergence of secondary structures that contribute to DNA compaction and a reduction in contour length. At intermediate concentrations, accumulation of torsional stress and the formation of multiple metal-mediated contacts lead to a global conformational collapse, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the effective persistence length. At the highest Ag + concentration tested (1.5 mM), the uniform distribution of molecular area suggests a widespread structural collapse of DNA. These findings support previous reports of Ag + -induced DNA condensation and reveal a progressive structural transition from extended to globular conformations. The observed behavior provides insights into the biophysical consequences of metal–DNA interactions and may have implications for understanding the molecular basis of the antimicrobial activity of silver ions.},

  abstract     = {Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, the heterogeneity of extensibility arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool for describing biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying extensibility. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise extensibility profiles. We find that this heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables, such as mean squared displacement, while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform for interpreting heterogeneous extensibility from experimental data, especially for biopolymers, as well as for designing heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.},

A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations, we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.},

These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here, we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space, we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.},

Despite the absence of surface charge on the (non-polarizable) channel walls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe robust ion selectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip when the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to tip when the field direction is reversed. In addition, we observe a corresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the electric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic flow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double layers. Here, however, we uncover a novel mechanism for these phenomena in uncharged tapered nanoslits, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the heterogeneous water polarization.},

In response, surface-grafted polymers undergo a transition from an isotropic brush-layer in a good solvent to heterogeneous patches in CNS. To quantitatively describe this transition, we use the surface coverage θ as an additional order parameter and develop a theoretical model for its calculation, which is compared with the simulations. By further examining θ as a function of CNS concentration, we observe that PDNPs exhibit a collapse-reentry process similar to planar brushes, but with richer details of the two-step reentry behavior: angular isotropy recovery followed by radial expansion. We investigate how this CNS-induced collapse transition influences the reversible adsorption/exclusion of cargo nanoparticles on PDNPs, depending on the size of the cargo and the concentration of the cosolvent.},

  abstract     = {The generalized Langevin equation provides a powerful framework for modeling and interpreting the conformational dynamics of (macro)molecules in solution. However, recent studies have shown that the standard fluctuation–dissipation relation—linking the memory kernel to the statistics of the random force—can include a non-zero cross correlation term between conservative and random forces. This raises questions about how to correctly extract memory kernels from simulation data when this correlation is neglected and whether inverting the Volterra equation to obtain a memory kernel yields a physically meaningful result. In a recent work [Wolf et al. J. Chem. Phys. 162 , 054113 (2025)], we proposed an approximation to account for the cross correlation term. We demonstrate in this work that cross correlations play a significant role in the collapse transition of a hydrophobic polymer under various solvent conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that our proposed approximation yields an improved description of barrier crossing times. Notably, we find that this improvement has the same magnitude as the improvement gained by accounting for memory effects.},

Thermal effects on the structure, enthalpy (Δ ads H ), and Gibbs free energy (Δ ads G ) of adsorption were analyzed. The relatively fast surface diffusion of the adsorbate was identified as the dominant anharmonic effect causing an increase in Δ ads G of up to 50% compared to static harmonic calculations. In contrast, the anharmonic effect on Δ ads H was shown to be nearly negligible. The computed thermodynamic data were used to predict the desorption kinetics parameters, i.e., activation energy ( E a ), Arrhenius pre-factor ( ν ), and position of desorption maximum ( T max ). Among the DFAs tested, the PBE + D4 method was found to provide the best overall agreement with the experimental data.

While sodium is the dominant alkali metal in such systems, cesium often exhibits distinct bulk behavior relative to lighter alkali cations. Aqueous mixtures of cesium hydroxide and sodium nitrite were compared to alkali hydroxide analogs using small-angle x-ray scattering, revealing that cesium disrupts the sodium nitrite electrolyte structure, forming cesium-rich domains. This mesoscale segregation contrasts with the near-ideal mixing observed in other mixed hydroxide–nitrite systems. Raman spectroscopy indicates cesium–nitrite ion pairing, evidenced by vibrational shifts distinct from those associated with sodium. Multinuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy further supports cesium–nitrite and cesium–hydroxide association, revealing a distinct local environment for nitrite in cesium-containing solutions. Together, these findings show that cesium promotes a unique solution structure dominated by specific ion pairing within segregated domains.

  abstract     = {We investigate the solubilities of water in liquid CO 2 in the presence and absence of coexisting clathrate hydrate from theoretical calculations of the chemical potentials of water and CO 2 in the aqueous, hydrate, and CO 2 fluid phases across a wide range of temperatures and pressures. One of the advantages of the present method is that it is applicable to deeply cooled and heavily compressed states where a CO 2 hydrate is formed. The experimental solubility curve against temperature is successfully recovered with an appropriate correction for the self-polarization energy implicitly embedded in the pairwise additive interaction model for water. The solubility of water in liquid CO 2 coexisting with an aqueous solution decreases upon cooling. It is found that the intervening hydrate steadily reduces the solubility of water compared to that assumed to be in direct contact with the aqueous phase. The significant decrease results from the decrease in the chemical potential of water in the hydrate, relocating the boundary from the water/hydrate to the hydrate/fluid. Liquid CO 2 loses its capacity to retain water upon cooling more seriously than that anticipated from the water/fluid boundary, and an excessive amount of water is precipitated into hydrate at low temperatures. The thermodynamic properties thus calculated provide valuable information on problems in the massive transport of CO 2 , specifically the blockage of pipelines and corrosion of vessels.},

Here, we prepared Ir(ppy) 3 doped vapor-deposited glasses in three different organic semiconductor hosts; Ir(ppy) 3 in a dilute concentration is often used as a light emitter in phosphorescent OLEDs. We studied these glasses during temperature ramping using spectroscopic ellipsometry and found that the Ir(ppy) 3 doped PVD glasses have high kinetic stability and high density. Surprisingly, the observed kinetic stability exceeds that of single-component PVD glasses.

  abstract     = {Modeling ionic activity is essential for understanding ion-specific effects in environmental and industrial systems. The microscopic interactions of heavy metal salts in aqueous solutions become increasingly complex with rising salt molality, posing significant challenges for accurately modeling ionic activity. This study applies, for the first time, an electrolyte version of the cubic-plus-association equation of state to calculate the mean ionic activity coefficients of several heavy metal salts in water at 298.15 K. Experimental data for four types of salts—nickel, cadmium, cobalt, and zinc salts—were compiled, and the ion–water binary interaction parameters are regressed from these measurements. The model successfully predicts water activity, osmotic coefficients, and mean ionic activity coefficients across most systems. Without explicit incorporation of ionic association, the average calculation relative average deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for nickel and cobalt salts is 5.9% and 6.3%, respectively, extending the applicable molality range up to 5.0 mol/kg water and 5.5 mol/kg water. For solutions of cadmium salts and zinc salts that have been confirmed to contain ion pairs, ion association was introduced into the model for calculation. The calculation results indicate that the consideration of ion association has significantly reduced the calculation deviations. Within the calculated salt molality ranges, the average relative deviation of the mean ionic activity coefficient for cadmium salts is all below 2.0%, while that for zinc salts is all less than 5.5%, respectively. This study provides valuable insights into the micro-level factors influencing activity coefficients and offers recommendations for improving model accuracy under complex conditions.},

We compare this standard method to a protocol that focuses on a virtual cavity whose size is chosen to include short-range dipolar cross correlations, while excluding long-range correlations that are affected by the choice of electrostatic boundary conditions. We tested this protocol on three non-polarizable systems with different dielectric permittivities. We showed that it produces the same dielectric spectra as the standard method while being less sensitive to noise. The question of the decomposition of a dielectric spectrum into self and cross contributions is discussed in the context of both methods.

On the basis of rotational analyses, nine vibronic bands in the LIF spectra have been attributed to the C ̃ Δ u 2 – X ̃ Π g 2 electronic transition of SiNSi. The 32 393 and 32 505 cm −1 subbands have been assigned to the two spin components of the 0 0 0 band.

The experimental identification that the Σ u ( + ) 2 level is lower than Σ u ( − ) 2 suggests that the in-phase bending potential, labeled as V + , is the lower (or outer) one for the C ̃ Δ u 2 electronic state. The Δl = ±2 vibronic bands, such as C ̃ (02 2 0) Σ u ( + ) 2 – X ̃ ( 0 0 0 0 ) Π g 2 ⁠ , which are forbidden by the Δl = 0 selection rule, are induced by the (quadratic) Renner–Teller (R–T) interaction of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state with the E ̃ Σ u + 2 state, i.e., the vibronic transition moment is induced by the quadratic R–T (2RT) interaction of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state with the E ̃ Σ u + 2 state. The vibronic bands can also obtain their transition moments through their neighbors, which are the vibronic bands of the electronically forbidden D ̃ Σ g + 2 – X ̃ Π g 2 transition. Based on the theory of the quaternary R–T (4RT) interaction, the vibrational structure of the C ̃ Δ u 2 state has been analyzed, and a local perturbation between the C ̃ ( 0 2 l 0 ) levels and their neighbor, D ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π u 2 ⁠ , has been identified.

  abstract     = {We have generated SiNSi in supersonic free expansions and observed laser induced fluorescence (LIF) in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions. We measured two kinds of LIF excitation spectra from the X ̃ Π g 2 electronic state: one detecting UV fluorescence and the other detecting visible fluorescence. By exciting the vibronic bands observed in the LIF excitation spectra, we recorded dispersed fluorescence (DF) spectra from the single vibronic levels to the X ̃ Π g 2 state. The vibrational structures of the DF spectra are complicated due to the relatively large vibronic interactions in the X ̃ Π g 2 state. We were not able to analyze the structure using regular formulations derived from perturbational treatments that consider the Renner–Teller (R–T) and spin–orbit (SO) couplings and the anharmonicity of the ν 2 bending potential. Instead, we analyzed it by directly diagonalizing the vibronic Hamiltonian, including not only R–T, SO, and the anharmonicity but also Fermi resonance between the ν 1 symmetric stretching and ν 2 modes and anharmonicities, x 11 and x 12 . The vibronic analysis revealed two characteristics: a relatively large R–T parameter, ϵ = +0.51, and a SO constant close to the bending frequency, A ≈ 0.8 ω 2 . Both these characteristics bring about accidental proximity of the vibronic levels in the D ∞h system, and this proximity causes heavy mixing among the vibronic levels. The results can be applied to find weak vibrationally hot bands in the rotationally resolved LIF excitation spectra observed, and actually the Q 1 p band head of the hot band, C ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) Π g 2 − X ̃ ( 0 1 1 0 ) κ Σ g ( + ) 2 ⁠ , has been able to be assigned.

  abstract     = {Hydrogen bonds, crucial for the formation and stabilization of complex organic molecules, present intriguing possibilities for the existence of such molecular complexes in extraterrestrial environments. To investigate the microscopic hydrogen-bonding networks in nitrile–methanol clusters—potential candidates for interstellar organic complexes—we recorded infrared spectra of neutral XN-M (XN = nitriles; M = methanol) heterodimers in the 2600-3900 cm −1 range using infrared-vacuum ultraviolet (IR-VUV) spectroscopy. Quantum chemical calculations based on harmonic approximations are typically used to simulate such spectral peaks; however, they often fail to fully reproduce the experimental features. To overcome these limitations, we employed ab initio anharmonic algorithms and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Anharmonic algorithms successfully assigned elusive spectral features by accounting for vibrational couplings (e.g., Fermi resonances and combination bands), and AIMD proved essential for accurately assigning characteristically broad hydrogen-bonded OH bands unresolved by harmonic methods. Applying this integrated approach, we confirmed the distinct H-bonding preferences in the XN-M heterodimers: acetonitrile (ACN) and unsaturated aliphatic nitriles (e.g., 3-butene nitrile, 3BN; 4-pentene nitrile, 4PN) predominantly adopt linear N⋯H–O configurations, whereas acrylonitrile and benzonitrile favor cyclic double H-bonded structures. This study establishes a powerful framework that integrates advanced computational methodologies to decipher hydrogen-bonding motifs from complex spectral data, enabling the direct interpretation of both laboratory and astronomical infrared observations.},

We find that increasing gold content weakens CO and O adsorption and limits oxygen-induced structural changes, while copper-rich particles undergo pronounced oxidation and reconstruction. Bader charge analysis shows that, in bare nanoalloys, Au withdraws electron density from Cu due to their electronegativity difference. In oxidized Cu–Au nanoalloys, the charge on Cu atoms depends on the number of O neighbors and can reach values typical of Cu 2 O (0.6 e ) and CuO (1.1 e ). On average, the Cu atoms exhibit positive effective Bader charges of ∼0.9 e in these nanoalloys.

  abstract     = {4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is a widely utilized DNA sensor, renowned for its strong affinity for the AT minor groove. Despite its essential role as a fluorescent probe in molecular biology and biomedical research, the origins of DAPI’s intrinsic fluorescence and the mechanisms behind its fluorescence enhancement upon DNA sensing remain unresolved. This study provides a comprehensive investigation into the fluorescence dynamics of DAPI, both in solution and when bound to detect the AT minor groove of a self-complementary dodecamer duplex DNA. We employed an integrated approach combining femtosecond broadband time-resolved fluorescence, transient absorption, and supported by theoretical calculations. The results reveal an unprecedented ultrafast inter-solute–solvent three-state excited-state proton transfer pathway, which clarifies the root cause of low fluorescence yield and fluorescence dynamics of free form DAPI in aqueous solution. Irrespective of the structural heterogeneity and rotamer conformation of the ground state of DAPI, this involves deprotonation of the excited state at a rate of ∼2.4 ps, followed by proton reuptake by the resulting weakly emissive deprotonated state, leading to direct reformation of DAPI’s ground state at 139 ps. Binding to the DNA minor groove completely inhibits this proton transfer, accounting for the significant fluorescence enhancement observed in the DAPI-DNA complex. Furthermore, the broadband capacity of our time-resolved fluorescence approach enables, for the first time, direct tracking of the fluorescence dynamic Stokes shift of minor groove-bound DAPI, revealing significant dispersive collective solvation dynamics specific to the sensing site. These findings provide valuable insights into how microenvironments dictate DAPI fluorescence dynamics and may assist in the strategic design of light-up sensors for recognizing interior hydration dynamics and local residue motions of DNA.},

  abstract     = {The current status of the theoretical foundations of the Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect has substantially improved from its original one-electron formulation. However, there is a need to improve the inclusion of electron–vibrational interaction, the exchange and correlation effects arising from electron–electron interactions, and non-Born–Oppenheimer coupling to enhance the predictive power of the theory and its agreement with experiments. In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, we advance in the present work a microscopic quantum mechanical treatment of CISS based on the relativistic Breit–Pauli many-particle Hamiltonian. In particular, we determine in this context the effect that including non-Born–Oppenheimer components arising in a Taylor expansion of the electron–nuclear potential has on the spin–orbit coupling term of this Hamiltonian. We also consider in this framework the electron–electron exchange and correlation effects and propose some practical approximations based on non-relativistic approaches. Finally, we extend the application of the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian to describe nuclear–nuclear spin interactions and discuss the possibility of explaining enantiomeric selectivity in cross-polarization nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.},

  abstract     = {The mean back relaxation (MBR) relates the value of a stochastic process at three different time points. It has been shown to detect broken detailed balance under certain conditions. For experiments of probe particles in living and passivated cells, MBR was found to be related to the so-called effective energy, which quantifies the violation of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. In this paper, we discuss the dependence on the length and time parameters that enter MBR, both for cells as well as for a model system, finding qualitative agreement between the two. For the cell data, we extend the phenomenological relation between MBR and effective energy to a larger range of time parameters compared to previous work, allowing us to test it in systems with limited resolution. We analyze the variance of back relaxation (VBR) in dependence of the mentioned parameters, relevant for the statistical error in MBR evaluation. For Gaussian systems, the variance is found analytically in terms of the mean squared displacement, and we determine its absolute minimum as a function of the length and time parameters. Comparing VBR from cell data to a Gaussian prediction demonstrates a non-Gaussian process.},

  abstract     = {Providing highly simplified models of strongly correlated electronic systems that challenge ab initio calculations can serve as a valuable testing ground to improve these methods. In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of one-dimensional transition metal mono-oxide chains (VO, CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO) using density functional theory (DFT), DFT+ U , and coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations. The Hubbard U parameter for DFT+ U is determined using linear response theory. In all systems studied except MnO, the presence of multiple local minima—primarily due to the electronic degrees of freedom associated with the d -orbitals—leads to significant challenges for DFT, DFT+ U , and Hartree–Fock methods in finding the global minimum in ab initio calculations. Our results indicate that the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is energetically favored for all chains, except CrO, when using DFT+ U and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. Analysis of the band structures shows that while PBE often predicts metallic or half-metallic FM states, DFT+ U opens band gaps and correctly yields insulating behavior in all cases. Furthermore, we compared the energy differences between the AFM and FM states using DFT+ U and CCSD for CrO, MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO. Our findings indicate that CCSD predicts larger energy differences in some cases compared to DFT+ U , suggesting that the Hubbard U parameter obtained through linear response theory may be overestimated when used to calculate energy differences between different magnetic states. For CrO, CCSD predicts an AFM ground state, in contrast to the predictions from DFT+ U and PBE methods.},

Our methodology combines ab initio molecular dynamics with time-dependent density functional theory and a polarizable continuum model to characterize the ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces of the rotor in cyclohexane. Time-resolved vibrational analysis based on wavelet transform enables the decomposition of the nuclear motion into time–frequency components. This approach allows us to follow the evolution of vibrational dynamics and their role in key relaxation pathways and spectroscopic signals. We propose that, although not directly observable, complex vibrational dynamics influence the emission by modulating both the transition energy and the emission dipole moment. These include C=C stretching, out-of-plane motions at the axle carbon, and rotor–stator torsional modes. For the first time, we assign and interpret low-frequency modes observed experimentally at ∼180 cm −1 in time-resolved fluorescence. We reproduce the extent and the dynamics of the pronounced red shift of the C=C stretching mode upon excitation, as observed in the femtosecond stimulated Raman spectrum (1585 cm −1 in the ground state vs 1350–1440 cm −1 in the excited state). Regarding the photoisomerization, we identify a clear correlated steric-relief mechanism of the two main relaxation coordinates: torsion about the C=C axle and pyramidalization at the stator–bridge carbon. This study demonstrates the power of transient vibrational analysis in unraveling complex photorelaxation mechanisms by establishing a direct link between experimental data and excited-state molecular dynamics simulations.},

These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is to frequently discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as Poisson’s ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson’s ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more information efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.},

The new CVs can be used directly in PLUMED—a popular open-source library for enhanced-sampling and free-energy methods—so they can be used directly in metadynamics workflows. They allow the investigation of conformational transitions, the identification of metastable states, and the mapping of free-energy landscapes of any seven-membered-ring molecule. This provides a quantitative framework for probing the conformational behavior of flexible seven-membered scaffolds and will aid in the rational design of conformationally locked substrates for enzyme engineering and related applications.},

The computational complexity of this model scales identically to CC2 with molecular size. Conventional CC2 and its regularized BWs-CC2 variants, as well as conventional MP2 and two of its regularized BW-s2 variants, were assessed on a 535 element database spanning thermochemistry, non-covalent interactions, barrier heights, and isomerization energies. To ensure a well-defined model chemistry, the assessment was performed using internally stable spin-polarized Hartree–Fock (HF) orbitals in the finite aug-cc-pVQZ basis without counterpoise corrections. As a result of using stable orbitals, contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that CC2 substantially outperforms MP2 on molecules with significantly spin contaminated reference orbitals without a significant increase in error on systems with a spin-pure reference, showing the value of its single substitutions. While no single choice of regularization parameters can be optimal for all datasets, we find that BWs-CC2 generally outperforms both CC2 and BW-s2 with a single judicious parameter choice. Additional tests on dipole moments and bond lengths of diatomics provide further support for the utility of this choice. The main outliers and poorest performing cases are associated with large amounts of spin-contamination in the HF reference, which is indicative of systems with either strong correlation or extensive artificial symmetry breaking. Overall, these findings argue that the perception of the quality of the CC2 ground state should be reevaluated and that it can be further improved upon by the soundly based BWs-CC2 variant with the recommended parameter choice.},

  abstract     = {Forming new hybrid quasiparticles by strong light–matter coupling is a promising tool for tailoring the photophysics and photochemistry of molecules. Thus, the ultrafast dynamics of polaritons formed upon strong light–matter coupling has been extensively studied by pump–probe spectroscopy. Although it was predicted that the partial photonic character of polaritons should shorten their lifetime compared to purely molecular excited states, many studies do not observe this effect. So far, the unexpected longevity of the spectral signatures has been either explained by relaxation into a manifold of so-called dark states or by other uncontrolled effects that change the properties of cavity materials. In order to resolve these issues, we investigate here the dependence of the line shape of pump–probe spectra of polaritons on the ratio of photonic and molecular character. Furthermore, by phenomenologically including relaxation to dark states, we find that it is possible to spectrally resolve this relaxation process by observing a characteristic phase flip in the pump–probe signal. Our results show that the signatures of dark state relaxation and the influence of the cavity resonance energy and their contributions to the polariton dynamics can be disentangled from the spectral line shapes.},

For a model of cis – trans isomerization in a protonated Schiff base, vibronic effects induced by intramolecular torsional and bond-length-alternation modes act concertedly with a collective environmental mode, which plays the role of an effective tuning mode. The latter is coupled to a residual environment, and the combination of the effective and residual modes conforms to an overdamped Brownian oscillator type spectral density. Thermal averages are included by the thermofield dynamics approach, in line with the thermal Hamiltonian developed in Paper I. The m-NN potentials, modeled according to the regularized diabatic states representation, permit an accurate representation of the vibronic coupling Hamiltonian beyond a linear vibronic coupling model. The initial excited-state dynamics is determined by the approach to a curved conical intersection seam, followed by a strongly dissipative phase leading to equilibration in the adiabatic ground state. The characteristic inertial time scale of the environment impacts not only the time of approach to the conical intersection seam but also the isomerization yield. The present study makes first steps toward extending the m-NN approach to a treatment of collective environmental non-equilibrium evolution on par with intramolecular excited-state nonadiabatic dynamics.},

Here, we show how neural network (NN) potentials can be adapted to a combination of intramolecular coordinates and collective environmental modes. Specifically, we use multiplicative NN (m-NN) potentials, which are fitted to a diabatic representation of regularized diabatic states type. These potentials are readily combined with multiconfigurational wave functions for high-dimensional quantum dynamics. The thermofield dynamics (TFD) approach is employed to include thermal averaging at the wave function level, and we formulate a thermal NN/TFD Hamiltonian that accommodates initial vibronic correlations and collective/residual-mode coupling in the environmental subspace. For a model system describing the isomerization of protonated Schiff bases in solution, the solvent is represented by an overdamped Brownian-oscillator spectral density. In a companion paper [B.

  abstract     = {Understanding the dynamic behavior of polar fluids is essential for modeling complex systems such as electrolytes and biological media. In this work, we develop and apply a stochastic density functional theory (SDFT) framework to describe the polarization dynamics in the Stockmayer fluid, a prototypical model of dipolar liquids consisting of Lennard-Jones particles with embedded point dipoles. Starting from the overdamped Langevin dynamics of dipolar particles, we derive analytical expressions for the intermediate scattering functions and dynamic structure factors of the longitudinal and transverse components of the polarization field, within linearized SDFT. To assess the theory’s validity, we compare its predictions with results from Brownian Dynamics simulations of the Stockmayer fluid. We find that SDFT captures the longitudinal polarization fluctuations accurately, while transverse fluctuations are underestimated due to the neglect of dipolar correlations. By incorporating the Kirkwood factor into a modified SDFT, we recover quantitative agreement for both components across a range of dipole strengths. This study highlights the utility of SDFT as a coarse-grained description of polar fluid dynamics and provides insights into the role of collective effects in polarization relaxation.},

The present study reveals critical insights into the influence of these properties on the optical trapping of core–shell nanoparticles, investigated using generalized Lorenz-Mie theory. Specifically, the presence of Fano resonance is discussed based on the size contribution of the core and shell and its influence on the directionality of the scattering force. Furthermore, the effects of optical nonlinearity on the appearance of Fano resonance and trapping efficiency are explored under femtosecond pulsed excitation.},

  abstract     = {Dimensionality reduction represents a crucial step in extracting meaningful insights from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Conventional approaches, including linear methods such as principal component analysis as well as various autoencoder architectures, typically operate under the assumption of independent and identically distributed data, disregarding the sequential nature of MD simulations. Here, we introduce a physics-informed representation learning framework that leverages Gaussian processes combined with variational autoencoders to exploit the temporal dependencies inherent in MD data. Time-dependent kernel functions—such as the Matérn kernel—directly impose the temporal correlation structure of the input coordinates onto a low-dimensional space, preserving Markovianity in the reduced representation while faithfully capturing the essential dynamics. Using a three-dimensional toy model, we demonstrate that this approach can successfully identify and separate dynamically distinct states that are geometrically indistinguishable due to hidden degrees of freedom. Applying the framework to a 50 μ s-long MD trajectory of T4 lysozyme, we uncover dynamically distinct conformational substates that previous analyses failed to resolve, revealing functional relationships that become apparent only when temporal correlations are taken into account. This time-aware perspective provides a promising framework for understanding complex biomolecular systems, in which conventional collective variables fail to capture the full dynamical picture.},

  abstract     = {We present an efficient approach to simulate real-time quantum dynamics using projected variational quantum dynamics, where the computational cost is reduced by strategically optimizing only a subset of the variational parameters at each time step. Typically, the variational Ansatz consists of repeated blocks of parameterized quantum circuits, where all parameters are updated in a standard optimization procedure. In contrast, our method selectively optimizes one block at a time while keeping the others fixed, allowing for significant reductions in computational overhead. This semi-global optimization strategy ensures that all qubits are still involved in the evolution, but the optimization is localized to specific blocks, thus avoiding the need to update all parameters simultaneously. We propose different approaches for choosing the next block for optimization, including sequential, random, and fidelity-based updation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods in a series of spin-lattice models with varying sizes and complexity. Our method preserves the accuracy of the time evolution with a much lower computational cost. This new optimization strategy provides a promising path toward high-fidelity simulation of the time evolution of complex quantum systems with reduced computational resources.},

  abstract     = {Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has emerged as a groundbreaking advancement in the field of photoluminescence behavior. A thorough understanding of the AIE mechanism is essential for the rational design of innovative molecules exhibiting these exceptional properties. In this study, we report a quantum mechanical (QM) investigation through spin-flip time dependent density functional theory (SF-TDDFT) using optimally tuned range-separated hybrid (OT-RSH) functional to explore the cause of fluorescence quenching of the ethylene derivatives such as TPE-9CB, TPE-3CB, and tetraphenylethene-triphenylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The fluorescence enhancement in the crystalline state of an ethylene derivative TPE-9CB is studied by adopting a QM:MM based approach using the SF-TDDFT method and RSH functional. It is observed that the OT-RSH functional delivers impressive results regarding photophysical properties. The twisting of the central C=C bond has been identified as the phenomenon that quenches the photoexcited state of the ethylene derivatives in THF solution. Notably, the minimum-gap point (MGP) along the α-torsional coordinate of the S 1 state in solution lies ∼0.1 eV below the Frank–Condon (FC) point for all the derivatives. Interestingly, all examined monomers exhibited nearly zero oscillator strength ( f values) near the point of minimum-gap, indicating minimal radiative transitions in the solution state. Conversely, the excited state deactivation channels, which involve the twisting of the central C=C bond in the solution phase, are effectively restricted in the solid state by steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion from the neighboring molecules. In the solid state, the MGP is 0.48 eV above the FC point, demanding high energy to prevent photoinduced rotary relaxation. This effectively blocks nonradiative deactivation pathways, resulting in a significant enhancement of the emission response. Our findings underscore the potential of AIE phenomena in advancing material design and applications.},

The results are compared with those predicted by the counterpart treatments involving wave functions. We report potential energy curves for a series of hydrogen atom clusters with different geometries in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field. These results allow us to analyze and discuss crossings between potential energy curves involving transitions between electronic states of different spin multiplicities.

Coarse-grained models for such systems are instrumental in identifying metastable states, providing an effective description of their dynamics, and estimating transition rates. We propose a numerical framework for learning collective variables that respect translational, rotational, and permutational symmetries and for estimating transition rates and residence times. It combines a sort-based featurization, residence manifold learning in the feature space, and learning of collective variables with autoencoders whose loss function utilizes the orthogonality relationship [F. Legoll and T. Lelievre, Nonlinearity 23 , 2131–2163 (2010)]. The committor of the resulting reduced model is used as the reaction coordinate in the forward flux sampling and to design a control for sampling the transition path process. We offer two case studies, the Lennard-Jones-7 in 2D and the Lennard-Jones-8 in 3D. The transition rates and residence times computed with the aid of the reduced models agree with those obtained via brute-force methods.},

  abstract     = {The (de)methylation regulates the functional interactions between the unstructured N-terminal of histones and other globular proteins. The multistate behavior of methyl-substitution makes the situation complex; for example, being mono-methylated, di-methylated, or tri-methylated. As a pivotal epigenetic marker, understanding its thermodynamic impact on protein-protein binding is crucial for the elucidation of the regulation mechanism of epigenetic modifications on target genes. To this aim, in this work, we present a cost-effective free energy technique named computational (de)methylation scanning with generalized Born and interaction entropy (dMSGB-IE). Our regime is built on implicit-solvent-based end-point free energy techniques and provides an efficient route to access the (de)methylation-induced affinity change with a screening power comparable to costlier alchemical free energy calculations. We first use a batch of histone-reader recognition protein-protein complexes as illustrative cases, showing the capabilities and reliabilities of dMSGB-IE. Then, we augment the method with the integrative structure prediction tool AlphaFold 3, providing a fully computational workflow for fast estimation of (de)methylation free energies. Based on a batch of testing systems, we validate the practical applicability and highlight the predictive power of the promising integrative modeling workflow.},

Polydispersity of the fluid and strong coupling of rotational and translational motions of the rods are two of the various hurdles in interpreting experimental results in complex fluid environments. Furthermore, the influence of volume fraction, ϕ , and absolute free volume, V free , which changes inherently with δ , on the dynamics is not adequately discussed in the literature. Thus, we investigate the dynamical behavior of the rods under two conditions: (i) constant pressure (in which ϕ changes with δ ) and (ii) constant ϕ . Under constant pressure, it is observed that the rotational relaxation time and, hence, the rotational diffusion constant, D R , vary with rod length, l , as D R ∼ l − α , where the value of exponent α increases from ∼3.0 to 3.2 while varying δ from 0% to 40%. It is observed that the effect of increasing ϕ dominates over the effect of increasing V free . Moreover, hydrodynamic interactions among beads within a rod contribute minimally to rotational dynamics, although partial hydrodynamic screening is observed for center-of-mass motion. Meanwhile, for fixed ϕ systems, increasing δ results in increasing V free and thus enhances tracer diffusion, a trend opposite to that observed under constant pressure.},

  abstract     = {We investigate, using Langevin dynamics simulations, the Rouse-type dynamics of active harmonic bead-spring percolation clusters of square and triangular lattices. Two types of active stochastic forces, modeled as a random telegraph process with correlation time τ , are considered: force monopoles, acting on individual nodes in random directions, and force dipoles, where extensile or contractile forces act between pairs of nodes. For force monopoles, a dynamical steady state is reached where the network is dynamically swollen and the mean square displacement (MSD) shows sub-diffusive behavior at t > τ , MSD ∼ t ν , with ν = 1 − d s 2 where d s is the spectral dimension, in accord with a previously advanced general analytic theory. In contrast, dipolar forces require diverging times to reach steady state and lead to network shrinkage. Within a quasi-steady-state approximation, the MSD is found to saturate at the same temporal regime t > τ , which is followed by ballistic-like and/or diffusive behaviors. We further extend our study of dipolar forces to dilution regimes above the isostatic threshold, also known as “rigidity percolation”. Here, weak dipolar forces effectively do not shrink the network in steady state. Instead, they induce “rotational swimming” of the network. Yet, for the triangular lattice, an incipient discontinuous collapse transition occurs above a critical force amplitude value. Conversely, we find a continuous crossover to a collapsed state for the non-diluted square lattice, resulting from its marginal stability. We suggest that disordered solids be poised above the isostatic point to be stable against active dipolar forces, provided that the dynamical persistent length remains lower than the spring rest length.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen reduction of Fe 3 O 4 plays a pivotal role in sustainable steelmaking, offering a low-carbon alternative to traditional carbothermic processes. In this study, we employ density functional theory to investigate the dissociative adsorption of molecular H 2 and the subsequent adsorption behavior of atomic H on Fe 3 O 4 (110) surfaces, considering both stoichiometric and O-deficient configurations. Our results reveal that the type and location of O vacancies critically influence both the thermodynamics and kinetics of H 2 activation. Compared to the perfect surface, the presence of O vacancies increases the activation barrier for H 2 dissociation. Twofold coordinated O sites, which are thermodynamically more favorable to form, reduce the reaction exothermicity. Conversely, threefold coordinated O vacancies, though less readily formed, stabilize the dissociated state more strongly but incur the highest activation barrier. For atomic H adsorption, adsorption is strongly favored at O sites over Fe, particularly at hollow sites adjacent to twofold O ions. While O vacancies themselves are not favorable adsorption sites, they alter the local electronic environment and change the H binding strength. Bonding strength, quantified via the integrated crystal orbital Hamiltonian population, shows a strong linear correlation with H adsorption energies across all surface types. This correlation underscores the critical role of H–O orbital hybridization in stabilizing adsorbed H species and provides a quantitative link between adsorption strength and the underlying surface–adsorbate bonding characteristics. Our results offer atomic-level insights into defect-mediated H 2 activation and H adsorption on Fe 3 O 4 , with implications for advancing hydrogen-based processes in steel production, hydrogen storage, and heterogeneous catalysis.},

Dodecylphenol polyoxyethylene ether (OP-10) was introduced as a surfactant to enhance the wettability of the Bi2212 sol on the single-crystal substrate, leveraging its excellent miscibility with the sol. The influence of OP-10 modification was examined on both the substrate wettability and the key properties of Bi2212 films, including crystallinity, texture, surface morphology, and superconducting performance. The results demonstrate that OP-10 modification significantly improves the wettability of the Bi2212 sol on SrTiO 3 (100) single-crystal substrates. Consequently, Bi2212 superconducting films with smooth, continuous surfaces and (00 l ) epitaxial growth were successfully achieved on SrTiO 3 (100) substrates. The in-plane orientation relationship was determined to be Bi2212[100](001)//SrTiO 3 [011](100). The surface roughness of these films remained around 15 nm. All prepared films displayed excellent superconducting properties. This work establishes a valuable research foundation for the preparation of multicomponent functional oxide thin films via the aqueous sol-gel route.},

  abstract     = {Atomic-scale quantum conductance switches based on metallic quantum point contacts allow controlled binary switching of the electrical current between a conducting “on state” and a non-conducting “off state” via an independent gate electrode. Although silver-based quantum switches operate via electrochemical conductance modulation, the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we employed density functional theory combined with the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) framework to investigate nitrate anion adsorption on Ag(100), Ag(111), and Ag(511) surfaces under varying electrochemical potentials. The stable configurations of nitrate adsorption on the electrode surfaces as a function of electrode potential are determined using the grand canonical approach within the CHE framework, revealing the surface reconstruction of Ag(511) analogous to the formation of nascent Ag–NO 3 complexes. The thermodynamic analysis indicates that the critical phase transition occurs in agreement with the experimental switching threshold. Electronic structure calculations reveal metallic to semiconducting transitions in the reconstructed Ag–NO 3 complex layers, elucidating the mechanism of conductance modulation. The “off state” corresponds to insulating Ag–NO 3 surface complexes, while the “on state” arises from metallic Ag–Ag bridging at lower nitrate coverage under lower control voltage. This study establishes a general framework for anion-mediated quantum switching in transition metals and provides a design for nanoscale electrochemical devices.},

Here, we investigate the pressure-induced structural transitions of the diamond (100) surface using molecular dynamics simulations combined with the volume-Constant Pressure Molecular Dynamics method for finite systems. Eight possible dimerized configurations were identified through an exhaustive method, considering both translational and rotational symmetries, which in turn define eight diamond (100) surfaces. These surfaces are nearly degenerate in energy at zero pressure, but their energy differences become larger under high external pressure. At finite temperatures, the increasing pressure induces graphitization of the surfaces. The transition pressures differ among the various surfaces. By calculating the free energies of the surfaces, we determined the most stable surfaces at various pressures and temperatures and constructed a schematic P–T “phase diagram” to illustrate the stability competition and structural transitions of the surfaces. This study provides a theoretical basis for the efficient utilization of diamond under high pressure and offers insights into the surface properties of materials under extreme conditions.},

  abstract     = {2D gallium nitride possesses distinctive electronic states, making it ideal for future optoelectronic devices because of the quantum confinement and enhanced many-body interactions inherent in its atomically thin form. This study explores the impact of molecular doping with Fe(II)-porphyrin (FeP) on these characteristics using first-principle calculations. Contact of the magnetic center Fe with the nitrogen site causes a 17% decrease in the energy barrier for the transition from intermediate spin ( S = 1) to high spin ( S = 2) state, highlighting the sensitivity of spin dynamics to doping sites. Molecular diffusion barriers increase by 9.6 kJ/mol upon spin transition, suggesting that the spin state influences molecular mobility within the material. Exploring spectral functions reveals that FeP doping introduces spin-dependent molecule levels within the bandgap, which may play a role in electron–hole separation and spin injection. In addition, we show that the molecule–substrate coupling lowers the exciton binding energy by 0.1 eV, with further reduction during spin transitions. This weakening is attributed to increased electron mobility, quantified by static polarizability. These results indicate that the molecular spin state can control electronic excitations within substrate materials, presenting a promising strategy for designing spintronic devices.},

The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larché–Cahn paper [F. C. Larché and J. W. Cahn, Acta Metall. 21 , 1051–1063 (1973)]. Single-phase crystals in Larché–Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product μN of the number of particles N and their chemical potential μ . Similarly, the grand potential and the product pV of pressure and volume V may not add up to zero. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs–Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity is recovered by treating the number of lattice sites M as an additional thermodynamic variable. The difference G − μN can be identified with νM where ν is the thermodynamic force conjugate to M . The reinstated Gibbs–Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation under isothermal isobaric conditions. We have worked this out for a uniform one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The coupling between composition and strain is implemented by decomposing pressure in a mechanical component depending on deformed density N / V and an elastic term linear in the volume strain as determined by V / M . Various μ , p , T response functions are compared to the μ , V , T counterparts.},

It involves applying an intermediate Hubbard U value to the Ce 4 f states and another U value to the d states of the metal adatom that is optimized for each metal to match its calculated bulk cohesive energy with the experimental value. The results compare favorably with Campbell’s calorimetric measurements of metal adsorption heats on CeO 2 (111). Thus, this approach produces metal adsorption energies on ceria that are more accurate in both the single-atom and the bulk limits. Furthermore, it preserves a common reference for Ce so that calculations involving different metals adsorbed on ceria, e.g., bimetallic and multimetallic clusters, can be analyzed on the same footing.},

Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the metastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II and coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa, reconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the complex structure of coesite. In addition to amorphization, two different crystalline outcomes were observed. One is the formation of defective high-pressure octahedral phases [Hu et al. , Nat. Commun. 6 , 6630 (2015)], and another one is the formation of unusual and complex dense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold coordination [Bykova et al. , Nat. Commun. 9 , 4789 (2018)]. Capturing these structural transformations computationally represents a challenge. Here, we show that employing metadynamics with Si–O coordination number and volume as generic collective variables in combination with a machine-learning based ACE potential [Erhard et al. , Nat. Commun. 15 , 1927 (2024)], one naturally observes all three mentioned pathways, resulting in the phases observed experimentally. We describe the atomistic mechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV is simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first, a hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral positions, but the octahedron chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second step, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We predict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature while, at 600 K, the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.},

In this study, we analyze orbital-resolved PET in CeO 2 using real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations. We discovered remarkable selectivity in the interatomic PET in CeO 2 . In particular, the photogenerated electrons maintain a consistent transport pathway from the O-2 p orbital to the Ce-4 f and Ce-5 d orbitals, irrespective of the polarization state (linear and circular) of the external optical field. We further observed a secondary splitting found upon the crystal field splitting in Ce-5 d and Ce-4 f orbitals due to the symmetry breaking of the original coordination field of Ce atom. The secondary splitting is manipulated by the polarization state of the external optical field and the detailed dependency is deciphered, which provides us guidance for manipulating the orbital splitting by optical. Comparative analysis with the electrons transfer characteristics induced by hole doping reveals that the selectivity of interatomic electron transfer and the secondary splitting are unique to the photoexcitation process. Our results and findings shed new light on the microscopic mechanisms and dynamical processes underlying PET in CeO 2 and may be generalized to other oxide semiconductors. These new insights may be beneficial for deciphering the ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy experiments and for understanding the photocatalysis mechanisms in ceria-based photocatalysis materials.},

By establishing a customized simulation framework that combines density functional theory with the numerical renormalization group method, and with the aid of a side-coupled two-orbital Anderson model, we systematically simulate the quantum transport governed by various kinds of Kondo effects. When the central energy level sweeps upward, the linear conductance tends to reach its unitary limit in the low-temperature regime, driven by the broadening two-stage Kondo effect window. As the side energy increases, a quantum phase transition from the two-stage Kondo effect to the spin-1/2 Kondo effect emerges, resulting in a stable, full conductance plateau. Furthermore, by tuning the exchange coupling between the central and the side orbitals, we simulate the impact of precisely adjusting the intramolecular dihedral angle of the molecule on the transport properties. The linear conductance exhibits a transition from zero to the unitary limit as the molecule smoothly evolves from the antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic regime. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon systems. Our suggested “ ab initio + model calculation” theoretical framework may offer a promising methodology for exploring the complex Kondo physics in real magnetic nanosystems.},

  abstract     = {This series of papers aims to investigate the vibrational excitation behaviors of shock-heated high-temperature air using the CO rovibrational thermometry. The present part of this series serves as a prerequisite for the work. The time-dependent rovibrational temperatures of CO were measured during the vibrational excitation process of CO/O 2 /Ar mixtures within the temperature range of 1680–2970 K and pressures of 1.37–2.43 bar to investigate the vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 . The state-to-state (StS) approach was employed in the simulations, where the vibrational energy levels of CO and O 2 are treated as pseudo-species. The datasets of vibrational state-specific reactive and inelastic rate coefficients for CO + O 2 , O 2 + Ar, and CO + O collisions were generated in this paper. The present StS simulations agreed well with the experimental data, whereas the Schwartz–Slawsky–Herzfeld (SSH) formula predicted faster CO vibrational temperatures. A sensitivity analysis was then performed and highlighted that the vibration–vibration (V–V) energy transfer between CO and O 2 ( ⁠ τ V − V CO − O 2 ⁠ ) is the key item inducing the discrepancies observed between the SSH results and experimental data. Therefore, a new expression was summarized for calculating τ V − V CO − O 2 based on the present experiments, and it also agreed well with the measured data in the literature at 100–700 K. In addition, the oxidation of CO and the effects of vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 were discussed. Since differences in vibrational temperatures between CO and O 2 were observed during the relaxation process, the refined rate of vibrational energy transfer between CO and O 2 paves the way for the investigations in Part II.},

  abstract     = {We present a strategy for the quantum control of polyatomic bimolecular reactions using moderately intense, long-pulse laser fields. Bimolecular reactions pose a challenge to quantum control, not encountered in the unimolecular case, due to their complex scattering dynamics and the averaging of their observables over a thermal distribution of reactant states. Our approach bypasses these hurdles; it involves the interaction of a nonresonant, polarized field with the molecular coordinate-dependent polarizability tensor to generate spatially nonuniform Stark shifts of the potential energy surfaces. We focus on the commonly encountered case where the reaction dynamics involve complicating features such as several coupled electronic states, deep potential wells, a high density of vibronic states, and several transition states en route from reactants to products. We consider highly averaged observables, including the canonical and microcanonical rate constants. It is shown that the complexities of polyatomic bimolecular reactions introduce new opportunities for reaction enhancement and control. In particular, the occurrence of one or more potential wells combines with the spatial structure of the polarizability tensor to introduce a vast enhancement that is subject to control by the choice of field parameters. Our results are based on a quantum mechanical theory and ab initio calculations of the potential energy and polarizability tensor. As a model system, we consider the CH ( X 2 Π ) + N 2 ( X Σ g + 1 ) → HCN ( X Σ + 1 ) + N ( S 4 ) reaction, but our results and conclusions are general.},

The experiment has been performed at an incident electron energy of 1270 eV, using a highly sensitive multichannel electron momentum spectrometer with a coverable momentum range up to 9 a.u. The experimental results were compared with the associated theoretical profiles calculated by the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA), the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA), and the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) models, using the relativistic and non-relativistic Kohn–Sham orbitals as the target electron orbitals. The superiority of the DWBA model over not only the PWIA but also the DWIA was found for the whole momentum range up to 9 a.u., demonstrating that the interaction between the projectile and target electrons, as well as the distorted wave effect, plays an important role in explaining the momentum profile of inner-shell ionization. Furthermore, it was experimentally revealed that the branching ratio of the 4d 5/2 and 4d 3/2 ionizations slightly deviates from the value of the non-relativistic ratio and is only weakly dependent upon the momentum over the momenta investigated, indicating that the relativistic effect on the Xe 4d wavefunction is fairly small, as predicted by the theory. These results would provide detailed insight into the relativistic effect on electron distributions and (e, 2e) reaction dynamics for the inner-shell ionization.},

  abstract     = {The use of spectroscopic techniques to resolve the energy level structure of excitonic excited states and to elucidate the interaction mechanisms between excitons in quantum dots is of vital importance for the development and application of such materials. However, various static and dynamic one-dimensional spectroscopic techniques are limited by inhomogeneous broadening effects, making it challenging to directly observe the fine-level energy structure of quantum dots. We developed a 25 kHz shot-to-shot phase-cycling two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy technique to investigate the excitonic energy structure and exciton–exciton interactions in a quantum dot aggregate. Using CdTe/CdSe/ZnS core–shell–shell quantum dots as a model system, we implemented a 36-step phase-cycling scheme to acquire rephasing 2D spectra at zero waiting time under varying excitation powers. In these spectra, both diagonal and off-diagonal features reveal spectral components that are otherwise obscured in one-dimensional spectroscopy due to inhomogeneous broadening. The presence of off-diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra indicates non-negligible interactions between excitons with different transition energies. Power-dependent 2D spectroscopy reveals that, with increasing excitation power, high-energy states exhibit greater resistance to Auger recombination. The experimental method developed in this work may contribute to advancing the theory of excited-state structures and dynamics in quantum dots and other low-dimensional materials.},

  abstract     = {The physical picture of gas-phase optical transitions is normally presented as an isolated two-level system balanced by upward and downward processes. Isolated models assume a phenomenological treatment of collisional dephasing but do not strictly account for collisional population exchange with the rotational baths. While this assumption is valid under low-intensity conditions, where excitation is rate-limiting, isolated models can deviate from Beer’s Law at sufficient pressures and monochromatic intensities when both collisional broadening and power broadening are comparable to (or greater than) lifetime broadening, which are not uncommon conditions for cavity enhanced spectroscopies in the mid-IR spectral range. Although this problem has been addressed by rate-equation models for linear absorption measurements, a general treatment for multi-level quantum mechanical models suitable for non-linear absorption measurements (two-photon/two-color/pump–probe) is lacking. Isolated models require physical parameter inputs that disagree with expected values by at least an order of magnitude. These non-physical models undermine the ability to predict non-linear signal strengths under untested conditions and thereby limit the potential to optimize the sensitivity of non-linear spectroscopies and to expand their analytical applications (e.g., new analytes and/or buffer gases, changes in cavity free-spectral-range, changes in intracavity powers or wavelengths, and accurate investigation of physical phenomena). In this study, we derive bath-coupled models for gaseous pump–probe spectroscopy by application of the quantum Lindblad equation and detailed balance. Bath-coupled models are shown to fit data consistently across variations in intensity and agree with all physically expected values.},

Water—H 2 O—is extremely well balanced, having a hydrogen V S,max and an oxygen V S,min of similar magnitude. As such, it has the capacity to donate and accept hydrogen bonds equally well. This has implications for the interactions that water molecules form, which are reviewed here, first in water–small molecule models and then in complex sites as lactose and its crystals and in protein–protein interfaces. Favorable and unfavorable interactions are evaluated from the electrostatic potential plotted on varying contours of the electronic density, allowing these interactions to be readily visualized. As such, with one calculation, all interactions can be analyzed by gradually looking deeper into the electron density envelope and finding the nearly touching contour. Its relation with interaction strength has the electrostatic potential to be used in scoring functions. When properly implemented, we expect this approach to be valuable in modeling and structure validation, avoiding tedious interaction strength calculations. Here, applied to water interactions in a variety of systems, we conclude that all water interactions take the same general form, with water behaving as a “neutral” agent, allowing its interaction partner to determine if it donates or accepts a hydrogen bond, or both, as determined by the highest possible interaction strength(s).},

While the results of the continuum DFT agree well with those of our earlier lattice DFT findings, our approach here allows us to refine our understanding of the stability and structure of nanoparticle-laden droplets.

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are fundamental for probing the structural dynamics of biomolecules, yet their efficiency is limited by the high computational cost of exploring long-timescale events. Generative machine learning (ML) models, particularly the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), offer an emerging strategy to enhance conformational sampling. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities and limitations of DDPM in generating atomistically accurate conformational ensembles across proteins of varying size and structural order, ranging from the 20-residue folded Trp-cage and 58-residue BPTI to the 83-residue intrinsically disordered region Ash1 and the 140-residue intrinsically disordered protein α -Synuclein. Training DDPM on relatively short MD trajectories using both torsion angle and all-atom coordinate data, we demonstrate that it can reproduce key structural features such as secondary structure, radius of gyration, and contact maps, while effectively sampling sparsely populated regions of the conformational landscape. Notably, DDPM can also generate novel conformations, including transitions not explicitly observed in the training data. However, the model occasionally overlooks low-probability regions and may produce conformers with unclear physical relevance, warranting independent validation. These limitations are particularly evident in flexible systems such as IDPs. Overall, this work benchmarks DDPM as a viable tool for augmenting MD simulations, offering enhanced sampling with significant computational savings, while noting its limitations in capturing low-populated conformers. At the same time, it highlights the importance of rigorous validation and thoughtful interpretation when deploying generative models in computational biophysics.},

In this study, we introduce a machine learning-accelerated approach to molecular dynamics simulations that incorporates anisotropic electronic friction, providing deeper insights into these complex processes. Our framework extends the accessible time and length scales for nonadiabatic dynamics simulations, enabling a detailed investigation of the laser-induced activation of oxygen on the Ru(0001) surface. Statistical analysis reveals that strong electronic excitation dominates the first 800 fs after laser exposure. Beyond this timescale, energy deposited by electronic excitation continues to drive oxygen activation, while phonons, although always present as a dissipation channel, play a weaker role by buffering energy loss and redistributing kinetic energy among vibrational modes. The observed non-linear yield–fluence relationship, described by Y ∼ F n , underscores the pivotal role of electronic excitation. In addition, we identify the z -direction as the key activation mode for oxygen diffusion, with the exponent of the power law representing the quantized energy required for this process. This approach significantly accelerates dynamic simulations while offering valuable insights into the interplay between electronic and phononic excitations during laser-induced oxygen activation on Ru(0001).},

The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin–orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cutoffs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. The transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects.

In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here, we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system’s correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.},

  abstract     = {It is traditionally believed that the degree of covalency of chemical bonds decreases with increasing coordination number, while the degree of ionicity increases. Using Bader charge analysis and our novel definition of atomic charges based on Wannier functions, we demonstrate that this expectation does not hold for zinc oxide (ZnO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and sodium chloride (NaCl). The low-pressure wurtzite phase of ZnO (with fourfold coordination of Zn and O) and the high-pressure rock salt phase (with sixfold coordination) exhibit nearly identical degrees of ionicity. For CO 2 , covalency slightly increases in the high-pressure β -cristobalite phase (where the carbon atom is fourfold coordinated) compared to its low-pressure molecular cubic phase (where it is twofold coordinated). Thus, contrary to the common belief, the degree of covalency of chemical bonds is governed primarily by the chemical nature of the atoms and their stoichiometric ratio, rather than by the coordination number.},

  abstract     = {A theoretical framework for computing Auger spectra that include spin-orbit interaction is presented. The framework is based on the state-interaction approach using equation-of-motion coupled-cluster wave-functions. The working equations for Auger decay rates are derived within the Feshbach–Fano formalism. The capabilities of the theory are illustrated by the calculation of L-edge Auger spectra of H 2 S and Ar using the Feshbach–Fano and complex basis function (CBF) approaches. The quality of the Feshbach–Fano results depends critically on the treatment of the free-electron state. In contrast to the K-edge spectra for which both plane wave and Coulomb wave treatments yield reasonable results, the Feshbach–Fano calculations yield accurate results for L-edges only when using Coulomb wave (FF-CW). The FF-CW and CBF calculations of Auger spectra in H 2 S and Ar agree well with each other and with the available experimental data. The results highlight the importance of spin–orbit interactions for modeling L-edge Auger spectra.},

  abstract     = {In high-temperature non-equilibrium flows, the traditional Parker rotational relaxation model based on the rigid rotor assumption fails to accurately describe the effects of internal molecular structure on the energy transfer processes, creating a critical bottleneck for precise modeling. This study aims to establish an improved computational framework for rotational relaxation times that incorporates vibrational state-resolved calculations and rovibrational coupling effects to overcome fundamental limitations of existing simplified models. Based on the variable soft sphere molecular model and statistical inelastic cross section theory, an exponential correlation function was introduced to accurately describe transition probabilities between rotational energy levels, establishing a complete state-to-state rotational relaxation time computational model. Through systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, a strict linear relationship between the averaged rotational relaxation time and the model parameter θ ′ was discovered, significantly streamlining the parameter fitting procedure. For N 2 –N 2 , N 2 –N, O 2 –O 2 , and O 2 –O systems, optimal θ ′ values were determined with average relative errors below 0.7% when validated against recent theoretical data. Important computational guidelines were established. The improved model provides theoretically accurate and computationally efficient tools for transport coefficient calculations in hypersonic flow numerical simulations, with significant implications for engineering applications such as atmospheric reentry and interplanetary exploration.},

  abstract     = {Molecular dynamics simulations are typically constrained to have a fixed number of particles, which limits our capability to simulate chemical and physical processes where the composition of the system changes during the simulation time. Typical examples are the calculation of nucleation and crystal growth rates in heterogeneous solutions where the driving force depends on the composition of the fluid. Constant chemical potential molecular dynamics simulations would instead be required to compute time-independent growth and nucleation rates. While this can, in principle, be achieved through the addition and deletion of particles using the grand canonical partition function, this is very inefficient in the condensed phase due to the low acceptance probability of these events. Adaptive resolution schemes, which use a reservoir of non-interacting particles that can be transformed into solute particles, circumvent this problem, but at the cost of relatively complicated code implementations. In this work, a simpler approach is proposed that uses harmonic volumetric restraints to control the solute osmotic pressure, which can be considered a proxy for the system’s chemical potential. The osmotic pressure regulator is demonstrated to reproduce the expected properties of ideal gases and ideal solutions. Using the mW water model, the osmotic pressure regulator is shown to provide a constant growth rate for ice in the presence of an electrolyte solution, unlike what standard molecular dynamics simulations would produce.},

We present an efficient solution that helps to achieve the scaling limit, e.g., of the current decay with lattice length. As an example, we study the super-diffusive-to-diffusive transition in a lattice with long-range hopping and dephasing. The approach enables calculations with up to 10 4 sites, representing an increase of 10 to 40 times over prior studies. This enables a more precise extraction of the diffusion exponent, enhances agreement with theoretical results, and supports the presence of a phase transition. There is a wide range of problems that have Markovian relaxation, noise, and driving. They include quantum networks for machine-learning-based classification and extended reservoir approaches for transport. The results here will be useful for these classes of problems.},

DA was successfully performed using experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis electrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble contact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the supercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8192 ensemble members. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step follows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with increased ensemble sizes.

  abstract     = {Flavoproteins are a ubiquitous class of redox proteins, enzymes, and photoreceptors that derive their versatility from the flavin cofactor—a prosthetic group that serves as the main locus of their spectral, photophysical, and (photo)chemical properties. It is thus common for computational modeling of flavoproteins to employ a hybrid approach that treats the flavin quantum mechanically and the remaining atoms classically. Such quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods have proven powerful for studying flavoproteins so far, but users are often faced with a choice between treating the flavin electronic structure with ab initio wave function methods or using more approximate methods that allow for more extensive sampling of the protein dynamics. Herein, we present APEC-F 2.0, an automated QM/MM workflow that uses several open-source software packages to construct QM/MM models of flavoproteins. Exploiting the rigidity of flavin’s tricyclic isoalloxazine ring, the APEC approach iteratively optimizes flavin’s geometry in a static MM environment that represents a dynamic protein using a superposition of configurations generated from molecular dynamics. The automation of the code enables the systematic construction of QM/MM models using a common protocol and is suitable for comparing flavin’s spectral, electronic, and chemical properties in different redox, protonation, or excited states in a wide range of flavoproteins.},

By analyzing the temperature-dependent NMR SLR rate data of alkali ions in a wide range of supercooled oxide network liquids, this study reveals a hitherto unknown approximate equality between H R and β . This relationship is shown to be consistent with a model of backward-correlated hopping of mobile modifier ions in a temporally frozen oxide network. Estimation of NMR SLR β for individual alkali ions in mixed-alkali systems offers a pathway to estimate species-specific H R values that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible. These findings, when taken together, suggest that β can serve as a proxy for H R and offer new insight into the microscopic nature of glassy ion transport.},

Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all mean-field critical exponents characterizing the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted mean-field exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network’s sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network’s topology.},

Coupled cluster (CC) theory is systematically improvable toward the exact solution of the Schrödinger equation; however, it is very quickly limited by the computational cost of the calculation. Therefore, it has become imperative to develop low-cost methods that are able to reproduce CC results beyond the CC theory with single, double, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] level of theory. Here, the distinguishable cluster (DC)-CCSDT and singular value decomposed (SVD)-DC-CCSDT methods are examined for their fidelity to the CCSDT(Q) correlation interaction energies for the A24 dataset and are shown to outperform CCSDT and CCSD(T). Furthermore, with (T)-based corrections of the SVD approximation, the SVD-DC-CCSDT method becomes an accurate and relatively low-cost tool for the calculation of previously intractable post-CCSD(T) energies in atomic orbital basis sets of unprecedented size.},

Our results indicate that condensates can show directed motion toward the promoter, driven by gradients in the RNA concentration. Analytical theory, consistent with simulations, predicts that the droplet velocity has a non-monotonic dependence on the distance to the promoter. We explore the consequences of this gradient-sensing mechanism for enhancer–promoter (E–P) communication using polymer simulations of the intervening chromatin chain. Directed motion of enhancer-bound condensates can, together with loop extrusion by cohesin, collaboratively increase the enhancer–promoter contact probability. Finally, we investigate under which conditions condensates can exhibit oscillations in their morphology and in the distance to the promoter. Oscillatory dynamics are caused by a delayed response of transcription to condensate-promoter contact and negative feedback from the accumulation of RNA at the promoter, which results in charge repulsion.},

  abstract     = {The development of the microstructure during polymeric spinodal decomposition can be monitored in real time using small-angle scattering. Information about the microstructure can be deduced from measurements of the structure factor—a quantity directly proportional to the scattered intensity. While the time evolution of the structure factor can be measured relatively easily, modeling it has proved to be much more difficult. We believe the latter could be impeding our ability to control spinodal decomposition. Using synthetic data corresponding to two different polymer blends, we investigate the use of dynamic mode decomposition to model the time evolution of the structure factor during polymeric spinodal decomposition. Based on the accuracy and range of the predictions we obtained using dynamic mode decomposition, we believe our results are promising for the use of dynamic mode decomposition in an experimental setting, which could improve our ability to control spinodal decomposition in automated experiments.},

  abstract     = {Polymer density is a critical factor influencing material performance and industrial applications, and it can be tailored by modifying the chemical structure of repeating units. Traditional polymer density characterization methods rely heavily on domain expertise; however, the vast chemical space comprising over one million potential polymer structures makes conventional experimental screening inefficient and costly. In this study, we proposed a machine learning framework for polymer density prediction, rigorously evaluating four models: neural networks (NNs), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). Using a curated dataset of 1432 homopolymers from the PoLyInfo database, our comparative analysis indicated that the GCNN model enhanced by a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) for feature extraction achieves superior predictive accuracy (mean absolute error, MAE = 0.0497 g/cm 3 ; coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.8097) relative to the other models. Experimental validation on six polymers demonstrated strong agreement between measured densities and GCNN predictions with relative errors not exceeding 4.8%. In-depth error analysis combined with SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) and subgroup evaluations reveals fundamental relationships between specific functional groups and polymer density, improving the model’s interpretability. Furthermore, t-SNE visualization and kernel density estimation (KDE) analysis revealed that the D-MPNN framework effectively captures critical chemical space features governing density, explaining the GCNN’s superior performance. This work establishes a reliable and scalable computational framework for high-throughput polymer screening, providing scientific insights into structure–property relationships while positioning density prediction as a prerequisite for incorporating density-dependent properties into polymer informatics and accelerating the discovery of novel polymer materials.},

For a polymer undergoing ideal Rouse dynamics, the slow modes identified by these transformations coincide with the conventional Rouse modes. When applied to the Fourier modes of the segment density, we show that tICA generates dynamics equivalent to dynamic self-consistent field theory (D-SCFT) with a wavevector-dependent Onsager coefficient and a free energy functional subject to the random phase approximation. We then introduce a hidden variable method and a time-local approach to include temporal memory in the tICA-generated dynamics and generalize it to construct continuum models for the nonequilibrium case of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric diblock copolymer melt.},

The pronounced decrease in the terminal relaxation time of cyclic macromolecules in the presence of a harmonic potential compared to the Rouse relaxation time leads to a lengthening of the time interval for the transition to the normal, i.e., the Fickian, diffusion regime, generating a quasi-plateau at increasing molecular mass for the time dependence of segmental mean squared displacement.},

Bromide perovskites have a wide bandgap; therefore, they are promising light absorbers for perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells. However, surface defects generally affect the PCE of Sn-based perovskite solar cells because they serve as trapping and recombination sites for excitons (electron–hole pairs). In this study, density functional theory calculations were employed to investigate the molecular passivation of surface defects in Sn-based mixed-halide perovskites. The results showed that a Lewis base is effective for passivating p -type defects. In addition, we established a molecule–defect interaction model to explain the passivation mechanism.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are well known to give rise to a quantum confined structure of excitons. Because of this quantum confinement, new physics of hot exciton relaxation dynamics arises. Decades of work using transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy have yielded initial simple observations, such as estimates of the cooling rate from single pump photon energy experiments. More detailed TA experiments employed variable pump photon energies to measure excitonic state-resolved transition rates. These TA measurements, usually the simplest form, have been employed to characterize QDs and their relaxation dynamics to this day. Yet, these TA measurements are fundamentally lacking in their ability to measure energy-resolved hot exciton cooling, which requires observation of the full cooling history through the real excitonic manifold. Here, we employ coherent multi-dimensional spectroscopy (CMDS) to perform an atomistically directed study of hot exciton cooling in CdSe QDs, revealing energy resolved relaxation dynamics. CMDS experiments are compared with simulations and prior TA measurements and simpler theories. Our findings reveal a hot exciton relaxation dynamics landscape. This relaxation dynamics landscape is a linear or sub-linear function of excess energy for different structures of QDs, with a strong size dependence. Our model simulations parameterized by the empirical pseudopotential model reproduces the experimental functional form and the dependence upon QD diameter and shell.},

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of graphene are investigated using classical molecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature T and external stress τ . The elastic response is characterized by calculating elastic constants via three complementary methods: (i) numerical derivatives of stress–strain curves, (ii) analysis of cell fluctuation correlations, and (iii) phonon dispersion analysis. Simulations were performed with two interatomic models: an empirical potential and a tight-binding electronic Hamiltonian. Both models predict that the Poisson’s ratio ν of graphene increases monotonically with applied stress. The range of stresses studied spans the entire domain of mechanical stability of the planar structure. Two mechanical instabilities are identified. Under tensile stress, fracture occurs, signaled by the softening of a phonon mode at the Brillouin zone boundary ( K point). At the studied temperatures ( T < 1500 K), auxetic behavior ( ν < 0) appears only at high tensile stresses, near the fracture threshold. Under compressive stress, a spinodal instability associated with long-wavelength wrinkling is observed. Finite-size analysis of this instability at 300 K reveals the existence of a finite surface tension σ in the unstressed membrane, which arises from the anharmonic coupling between out-of-plane and in-plane fluctuations. The surface tension stabilizes the membrane’s flat morphology. In the thermodynamic limit, the onset of the wrinkling instability occurs when the compressive stress matches the surface tension ( τ = σ ). Under this spinodal condition, the area compressibility modulus B is characterized by a scaling law N −1/2 , where N is the number of atoms in the simulation cell.},

Our previous studies have uncovered the strong dependence between melting entropy in the eutectic mixtures and mixing enthalpy, which has been serving as an important reference for glass formation, showing that negative mixing enthalpy largely reduces the melting entropy. In this paper, we focused on the question as to how melting entropy is associated with another classical glass formation criterion of molecule/atom size difference of components. This question has been challenging since it is constantly entangled with the effect of mixing enthalpy and easily smeared. Here, four binary eutectics constituted by molecules with similar structural and chemical characteristics but quite different molecular size were elaborately selected. The extremely low mixing enthalpy measured in four eutectic systems using a C80 microcalorimeter guarantees the neglectable effect of the mixing enthalpy. The determination of melting entropies and the critical cooling rate for glass formation at the eutectic compositions for the four systems uncovers an evident relation between melting entropy and molecular size difference, confirming the compatibility of the two glass formation criteria for mixing systems.},

Both systems turned out to be good glass formers, differing by 17 K in the glass transition temperature, which indicated a strong change in the self-assembly pattern. This supposition was further confirmed by the analysis of dielectric spectra, where, apart from the α -relaxation, also a unique Debye (D)-mode, being a fingerprint of the self-association, characterized by different dynamical properties (dielectric strength, timescale separation from the α -process), was detected in both samples. Further diffraction and infrared investigations, supported by density functional theory computations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, revealed that hydrogen (H)-bonds play a key role in the association in 3P1Pol, while in 3P1Pal, there are at least five different intermolecular interactions involving dipole–dipole forces and π-stacking, as well as extraordinary H-bonds formed between methylene groups neighboring with the formyl unit and carbonyl moiety. Finally, optimized dimeric structures, along with MD simulations, allowed us to propose a molecular mechanism responsible for the D-process in 3P1Pal. The presented data systematize previous understanding of molecular association as well as open new ways of exploring this phenomenon in aldehydes.},

This way, we are able to detect supramolecular rheological signatures not only for HmimCl but also for 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide and 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide.

  abstract     = {Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li + ). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr 14 ][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x LiTFSI ≤ 0.3. We find that the charge–charge and density–density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI-doped [pyr 14 ][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density–density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x LiTFSI -sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.},

Calorimetric crystallization proceeded in two steps, originating either from mechanical and stress-induced defects (230–275 °C) or from homogeneously formed nuclei (255–310 °C); both processes exhibited an identical activation energy of 200 kJ mol −1 . At temperatures <230 °C, a Sb 2 O 3 crystalline phase formed along the rhombohedral Sb 2 S 3 structure. The normal growth model with the activation energy of ∼250 kJ mol −1 was used to describe the microscopic crystal growth rate data, and the viscosity–diffusivity decoupling was characterized by Ediger’s parameter ξ varying between 0.40 and 0.55. The crystal growth rate was slightly higher in the film deposited on the glass substrate, with the compressive stress introduced at higher T having only a small effect. Meanwhile, the deposition on the glass substrate led to a significantly higher (especially below the glass transition temperature) nucleation rate, which underlines the key aspect of the crystallization process in very thin chalcogenide films: the formation of nuclei due to the internal stresses arising from the difference of the film/substrate thermal expansion coefficients.},

By developing an algorithm to reconstruct hydrogen-bond networks, we show that bond ring statistics correlate with the structural stability of the glasses and allow tracking crystalline and liquid clusters during devitrification and melting. We find that QG melts in the bulk, whereas melting in DG preferentially begins near the free surface. During devitrification, the DG shows an excess of 5-membered rings near the free surface, which is consistent with its tendency to nucleate the crystal phase in this region. In addition, the DG shows an Avrami exponent exceeding the standard 1 + d behavior, while both glasses display the same sub-3d growth of liquid clusters across heating rates, indicating that the DG enhanced exponent stems from its higher kinetic stability.},

  abstract     = {Folding and unfolding in molecules as simple as short hydrocarbons and as complicated as large proteins continue to be an active research field. Here, we investigate folding in n -C 14 H 30 using both density functional theory (DFT)/B3LYP calculations of 27 772 local minima and a kinetic transition network calculated for a previously reported potential energy surface (PES) obtained by fitting roughly 250 000 B3LYP energies. In addition to generating a database of minima and the transition states that connect them, these calculations and the PES based on them have been used to develop a simple and accurate model for the energy landscape. The model for the local minima is based on the number of gauche torsions as well as their interactions with neighbors and next-nearest neighbors, resulting in three parameters, which are fitted using the direct DFT results. The transition states are governed by 13 parameters based on differences between the two connected local minima. The model predicts that there are 44 530 local minima (not counting permutation-inversion isomers) connected by 525 028 transition states, including degenerate rearrangements. When compared to the actual stationary points, it achieves a minimum absolute energy error of 43 cm −1 for the local minima and 47 cm −1 for the transition state barriers connecting levels of different energy. The model also provides accurate predictions of the most kinetically relevant folding and unfolding pathways, for example, from very highly excited configurations to the global minimum. In addition, it facilitates the determination of a disconnectivity graph using the Cambridge Energy Landscapes programs.},

  abstract     = {The formation of carbinolamine represents the crucial initial step in the aldol reaction, specifically involving the interaction between p-nitrobenzaldehyde and acetone, facilitated by amine-catalyzed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (amine-MSN). In this process, a nitrogen atom from propylamine, which acts as the catalytic moiety, engages in the formation of a covalent bond with a carbon atom from acetone, leading to the generation of a carbinolamine intermediate. This reaction is significantly influenced by the presence of silanol groups located on the surface of the amine-MSN, which contribute to the catalytic activity. Moreover, the reaction solvent plays a vital role; water serves as an essential solvent that enhances the rate of the aldol reaction. In this work, a comprehensive investigation is conducted to understand the catalytic influence of water explicitly in carbinolamine formation via three distinct pathways: (1) without the assistance of silanol groups, (2) silanol assistance occurs indirectly through hydrogen bonding, and (3) a pathway that showcases direct silanol assistance in the hydrogen atom transfer processes. To analyze the reaction mechanism in the amine-MSN system, this study employs the fragment molecular orbital method, which can accurately treat the complexities associated with large molecular systems like the MSN pore model (Si 392 O 958 H 348 ). The concerted mechanism study reveals that the presence of water molecules significantly lowers the energy barrier associated with carbinolamine formation, thereby enhancing the feasibility and efficiency of the reaction. This insight highlights the pivotal role of the solvent and the nature of catalytic sites in optimizing aldol reactions within mesoporous silica frameworks.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated that in a collision-free vacuum environment, C 6 − exhibits fast radiative cooling from its highly vibrationally excited states through inverse internal conversion (IIC). Since IIC is driven by vibronic coupling, the understanding of vibronic structures of C 6 − is of theoretical significance. Here, we utilize time-dependent density functional theory to calculate the absorption spectrum of C 6 − ⁠ , allowing us to reassign the peaks in the experimental spectrum to the vibronic progressions associated with the C 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u and D 2 Π g ← X 2 Π u electronic transitions. A vibronic coupling density analysis reasonably explains the strong vibronic peaks and validates the reassignment. We also discuss the potential softening caused by quadratic vibronic coupling in the excited states and the partially allowed vibronic transitions. In addition, we show that a pseudo-Jahn–Teller distortion occurs along the ν 4 ( σ u + ) antisymmetric stretching mode due to the pseudo-degeneracy of the A and B states.},

The key findings reveal a clear β -dependent ( β is the angle of alignment) scattering behavior: the β = 90° configuration in the abstraction channel enhances reactivity and dominates the formation of the products at lower vibrational states with increasing collision energy. In contrast, the β = 0° configuration promotes all vibrational states in the exchange channel. Notably, the β = 45° configuration displays the smallest cross sections in both channels due to destructive quantum interference, contrasting with the constructive interference in the β = 90° configuration. Channel competition analysis demonstrates that β = 0°/45° configurations enhance exchange channel dominance, whereas β = 90° favors the abstraction channel. The differential cross section shows that the products in the abstraction channel shift from backward to forward in the β = 0°/45° configuration, while maintaining sideways distributions in the β = 90° configuration, and in the exchange channel, it is always backward scattering. The highest reaction rate in the abstraction channel occurs at the parallel alignment in the temperature region between 200 and 1000 K.},

Among these, protonated carbon chains are of great interest due to the presence of a permanent dipole moment and their relevance in describing astrochemical processes, making their detection possible in cold molecular clouds such as TMC-1. C 5 H + ( ⁠ 1 Σ g + ⁠ ) is an important molecule for understanding the formation and evolution of carbon-rich environments. However, to accurately model its abundance and spectroscopic properties, it is essential to account for its collisional interactions with H 2 , the most abundant molecule in the ISM. In this study, we present a quantum dynamical study for the C 5 H + –H 2 collision, employing high-level CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations to construct an accurate potential energy surface (PES). The PES is further augmented using a neural network fitting model, ensuring spectroscopic accuracy. The PES is expanded into radial components using bispherical harmonics. Then, close coupling methods were used to calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for different rotational transitions of C 5 H + , up to 100 K. Throughout the temperature range, a propensity is observed for even transitions over odd transitions. The rate coefficients for He and H 2 collisions are compared for C 5 H + , C 5 , and C 6 H − . For both low and high temperatures, rate coefficients for C 5 H + are found to be higher than C 5 and C 6 H − for both the He and H 2 collisions.},

This study demonstrates that high-energy kHz pulses can confine 1- μ m-radius polystyrene beads in water within ∼26 μ m. This approach utilizes the unique properties of high-energy pulsed lasers, distinct from continuous-wave and megahertz pulsed lasers traditionally used in optical trapping. The pulsing nature of the kHz laser generates strong instantaneous forces that attract and confine particles within a specific region, inducing a “ping-pong” motion within the confined space. When the laser pulses strike the microparticles, the strong gradient forces pull the particles toward the laser focus, while the scattering force from the laser pushes them away. This interaction creates a dynamic equilibrium, causing the particles to oscillate continuously in a back-and-forth motion until the laser is blocked. This phenomenon differs from conventional optical trapping, which offers unique particle confinement possibilities. When combined with optical trapping, especially at femtomolar concentrations or single-particle conditions, this novel development shows that the kHz laser draws particles from significant distances toward the focal point, enhancing its trapping efficiency. All experiments were conducted on a single setup, varying only laser characteristics, ensuring high credibility in the results.},

Sub-1 cm −1 High-Resolution Broadband SFG-VS (HR-BB-SFG-VS) has shown advantages with high spectral resolution and accurate spectral line shape. However, due to the lower peak intensity for the long picosecond pulse used in achieving sub-wavenumber resolution in the HR-BB-SFG-VS measurement, only molecular interfaces with relatively strong signal have been studied. To achieve detailed understanding and broader applications in molecular interfacial studies with HR-BB-SFG-VS, higher sensitivity and better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for HR-BB-SFG-VS is required. In this report, we present a systematic effort on the significant improvement of sensitivity and SNR for HR-BB-SFG-VS. Through optimization of laser pulse characteristics, automatic sample height control, and detection conditions, the sensitivity of HR-BB-SFG-VS was improved, reaching a level of 3 × 10 −6 of the SFG signal from the α-quartz standard. The high SNR spectra of various molecular interfaces are thus obtained with exquisite line shapes and fine spectral features. To name a couple of examples, a new hydrogen-bonded water band around 3300 cm −1 can be explicitly identified in the air/neat-water interface spectra and pure chiral spectral peaks at the level of 1 × 10 −5 of the quartz signal were measured at the air/Leucine aqueous solution interface etc. Such improvements in sensitivity and SNR in HR-BB-SFG-VS have brought and shall bring new opportunities and new discoveries with broad applications to molecular interface studies, in addition to the advantage of HR-BB-SFG-VS for its sub-wavenumber spectral resolution and the ability for intrinsic spectral line shape.},

The reference is obtained as the antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals, termed Strictly Localized Geminals (SLG), which can capture static correlation at mean-field cost. Geminals entering SLG are spin unrestricted, in general, and are expanded in the one-electron basis of the natural orbitals of the unrestricted Hartree–Fock wavefunction. Dynamic correlation is accounted for by perturbation theory (PT) at second order via a Dyall-like Hamiltonian acting as the zero-order operator [Földvári et al. , J. Chem. Phys. 150 , 034103 (2019)]. Here, an explicitly correlated (F12) correction is added to SLGPT2 to improve the description of dynamic correlation and enhance convergence with respect to the basis size. The resulting SLGPT2-F12 scheme inherits the fragmented structure of the SLGPT2 method, facilitating an efficient solution scheme. For numerical illustration, the SLGPT2-F12 approach is applied to small diradical systems, mainly focusing on singlet–triplet splittings.},

For this purpose, we decompose the complex MP2 energy of the core-hole state into contributions from specific decay channels and propose a corresponding equation-of-motion (EOM) method for computing the doubly ionized final states of Auger decay. These methods lead to significant savings in computational cost compared to our recently developed approaches based on coupled-cluster theory [F. Matz and T.-C. Jagau, J. Chem. Phys. 156 , 114117 (2022)]. The test set for this study comprises water, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, phosphine, and silane. The energies of the final states of Auger decay are obtained with an accuracy comparable to EOM coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) theory. Partial decay widths and branching ratios between KLL, KLM, and KMM decay of K-shell holes in third-row hydrides are in good agreement with EOM-CCSD, while deviations are more significant for second-row hydrides. For L 1 -shell holes, which undergo Coster–Kronig decay, MP2 yields unphysical results. However, we show that a suitable shift of the MP2 energy denominators leads to more reliable branching ratios and spectra for these problematic cases.},

We apply mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC to several neutral atoms and diatomic molecules to obtain the ground and first few excited states of the corresponding dication species, and we observe excellent agreement (to within 0.001 eV) between DIPs obtained from mmfX2C- and four-component DIP-EOMCC calculations that include 3-hole–1-particle (3 h 1 p ) excitations, with either the Dirac–Coulomb or Dirac–Coulomb–Gaunt Hamiltonians. We also compare double IPs for mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC calculations with the full Dirac–Coulomb–Breit Hamiltonian to those from experiment. The mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC with 3 h 1 p excitations leads to errors in absolute double IPs that generally overestimate experimental data for noble gases by 0.1–0.4 eV, whereas the inclusion of 4 h 2 p excitations results in double IPs that are too low by 0.1–0.2 eV, at the large basis set limit.},

  abstract     = {Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scales of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields that recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.},

  abstract     = {Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely trusted many-body method for solving the Schrödinger equation, known for its reliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its excellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of computational power make FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in computing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the method is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across the numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This difficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave functions, compounded by the method’s inherent stochastic nature. This study represents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method, affirming that yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the water–methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven different FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the non-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies between them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of determinantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible predictions can be achieved by employing the T-move, the determinant locality approximation, or the determinant T-move schemes, while the older locality approximation leads to considerable variability in results. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of algorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community codes—highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open and reliable computational science.},

  abstract     = {We introduce an efficient method, TTN-HEOM, for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme with the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system–bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac–Frenkel variational principle, which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO , tensor equations for non-Markovian structured open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics and one adaptive-rank method with a variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude–Lorentz component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable of simulating both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum systems interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with an affordable computational cost.},

  abstract     = {We present a self-consistent algorithm for optimal control simulations of many-body quantum systems. The algorithm features a two-step synergism that combines discrete real-time machine learning (DRTL) with Quantum Optimal Control Theory (QOCT) using the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. Specifically, in step (1), DRTL is employed to identify a compact working space (i.e., the important portion of the Hilbert space) for the time evolution of the many-body quantum system in the presence of a control field (i.e., the initial or previously updated field), and in step (2), QOCT utilizes the DRTL-determined working space to find a newly updated control field for a chosen objective. Steps 1 and 2 are iterated until a self-consistent control objective value is reached such that the resulting optimal control field yields the same targeted objective value when the corresponding working space is systematically enlarged. To demonstrate this two-step self-consistent DRTL-QOCT synergistic algorithm, we perform optimal control simulations of strongly interacting 1D as well as 2D Heisenberg spin systems. In both scenarios, only a single spin (at the left end site for 1D and the upper left corner site for 2D) is driven by the time-dependent control fields to create an excitation at the opposite site as the target. It is found that, starting from all spin-down zero excitation states, the synergistic method is able to identify working spaces and convergence of the desired controlled dynamics with just a few iterations of the overall algorithm. In the cases studied, the dimensionality of the working space scales only quasi-linearly with the number of spins.},

  abstract     = {H 3 S, LaH 10 , and hydrogen-based compounds have garnered significant interest due to their high-temperature superconducting properties. However, the requirement for extremely high pressures limits their practical applications. In this study, YH 4 is adopted as a base material, with partial substitution of yttrium (Y) by scandium (Sc), lanthanum (La), and zirconium (Zr). Pure YH 4 , stable at 120 GPa, exhibits a critical temperature ( T c ) of 84–95 K. Substituting half of the Y atoms increases T c to 124.43 K for (Y,Sc)H 4 at 100 GPa but reduces it to 101.24 K for (Y,La)H 4 at 120 GPa. In contrast, (Y,Zr)H 4 at 200 GPa shows a further suppressed T c of 69.55 K. The remarkable superconductivity in (Y,Sc)H 4 might be related to its unique phonon dispersion without an optical-acoustic gap, compressed Y–H bonds, and significant electron delocalization under pressure, collectively boosting electron–phonon interactions. Furthermore, the lowest optical phonons play a crucial role in the superconductivity of these materials. This work suggests that substituting Y with same-group metal elements is an effective strategy to enhance T c in hydride superconductors.},

This extension employs non-exponential basis sets to expand the bath correlation functions, overcoming the reliance of the original cNMSSE on exponential decompositions of the spectral density. Consequently, the extended cNMSSE is applicable to environments beyond those characterized by Debye-type spectral densities. The flexibility to employ general basis functions is particularly advantageous for handling spectral densities with higher-order poles, for which exponential decompositions are often inaccurate or unavailable. The extended cNMSSE is implemented in a pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved efficiently via matrix product state techniques, preserving the favorable linear-scaling and wavefunction-based nature of the original method. Benchmark simulations across four representative cases, including discrete spectral density, Ohmic spectral density with exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral density, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of forward–backward stochastic Schrödinger equations and extended hierarchical equation of motion.},

Our method adapts the adversarial learning paradigm, combining a physics-based generator with a neural network discriminator that differentiates between AA and CG trajectories. By adversarially optimizing CG parameters, our approach eliminates the need for predefined kinetic features. Applied to liquid water, it accurately reproduces radial and angular distribution functions as well as dynamical mean squared displacement, even extrapolating long-timescale dynamics from short training trajectories. This framework offers a new approach for bottom-up CG modeling, offering a systematic and principled way to preserve dynamic consistency in complex coarse-grained molecular systems.},

  abstract     = {Accurately modeling volume-dependent properties of water remains a challenge for density functional theory (DFT), with widely used functionals failing to reproduce key features of the water density isobar, including its shape, density, and temperature of the density maximum. Here, we compare the performance of the RPBE-D3 and vdW-DF-cx functionals using replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) driven by machine-learned force fields. Our simulations reveal that vdW-DF-cx predicts the water density more accurately than RPBE-D3 and reproduces the isobar closely between 307 and 340 K. In contrast, RPBE-D3 underestimates the density across the entire temperature range. However, vdW-DF-cx predicts the maximum density temperature to be ∼30 K higher than experiment. Using the local structure index, we attribute this shift to an onset of low-density, ice-like structures in the vdW-DF-cx-based MD at too high temperatures. Static DFT calculations on water dimers and representative high- and low-density water structures reveal that key features of the density isobars are reflected in the static energy-volume curves. In particular, the equilibrium intermolecular distance and curvature correlate with the maximum density and curvature around the maximum of the density isobar. Similarly, the early onset of the low-density structure is connected to the energetic preference for more structured, low-density water over a less ordered, high-density water structure. Decomposing the exchange–correlation energy reveals that the non-local dispersion energy decisively influences the predicted equilibrium intermolecular distances, whereas the semi-local part governs the balance between low- and high-density liquid structures.},

  abstract     = {Density functional theory (DFT) is a cornerstone of modern electronic structure theory. In the Kohn–Sham scheme, the many-electron Schrödinger equation is replaced by a set of effective single-particle equations. Thus, the full complexity of the quantum mechanical many-particle effects is mapped to the exchange–correlation potential v xc ( r ). Almost all DFT calculations done in practice rely on approximations to v xc ( r ). However, numerical representations of the quasi-exact v xc ( r ) can be obtained from quasi-exact densities by inverting the Kohn–Sham procedure. This inverse Kohn–Sham scheme is an important source of insight into exact DFT. Here, we review the inverse Kohn–Sham problem and explain in detail several aspects of why Kohn–Sham inversion is intrinsically difficult. We then present several inversion schemes and discuss their pros and cons, specifically addressing the effects of statistical uncertainties that are inevitable in quantum Monte Carlo reference densities. We use these schemes to obtain representations of v xc ( r ) that correspond to the ground-state densities that have become available from accurate diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on real space grids for the Li 2 and N 2 molecules, and the C atom. In the latter, the highest occupied orbital has a nodal line and the exchange–correlation potential goes to a different asymptotic value in this direction. As an outlook, we discuss the possibility of interlacing quantum Monte Carlo and Kohn–Sham theory by using the quasi-exact Kohn–Sham determinant to fix the nodes in a diffusion Monte Carlo calculation.},

  abstract     = {Standard algorithms to calculate the diffusion constant from computer simulations are based on either the mean-squared displacement or the velocity autocorrelation function of the tagged particle. They register displacements/velocities caused by random forces, but do not address their physical nature. This deficiency is resolved in the force route to the diffusion constant leading to Kirkwood equation for massive diffusive particles (Brownian motion). Approximate Kirkwood equation becomes exact when the force relaxation time is replaced with the memory time. To formulate the force route to the diffusion constant, memory functions were calculated here from molecular dynamics simulations of six charge mutants of the green fluorescent protein and the plastocyanin protein in a wide range of temperatures. The memory time falls between the velocity and force relaxation times, with the Kirkwood equation overestimating diffusion constants of proteins by a factor of ∼ 4 ⁠ . Diffusion constants from the velocity/displacement route strongly increase with increasing system size. Standard protocols accounting for finite-size effects show serious flaws when applied to protein diffusion by producing system-size corrections far exceeding both the finite-size diffusion constants and their infinite-size extrapolations. Diffusion constants from the force route show much less system-size dependence, and corrected values are mostly independent of the system size.},

In the bubble regime, we identify several distinct types of motion, including an elastic or pinned regime where the probe particle remains inside a bubble and drags all other bubbles with it. There is also a plastic bubble phase where the bubble in which the probe particle is trapped is able to move past the adjacent bubbles. At larger drives, there is a breakthrough regime where the probe particle jumps from bubble to bubble and, in some cases, can induce correlated rotations or plastic rearrangements of the particles within the bubbles. At the highest drives, the probe particle moves sufficiently rapidly that the background particles undergo only small distortions. The distinctive dynamic flow states and the transitions between them are accompanied by signatures in the effective drag on the driven particle, jumps in the velocity–force curves, and changes in the time-dependent velocity fluctuations. We map the dynamic phase diagram for this system for varied interaction lengths, bubble sizes, and densities.},

  abstract     = {Associative polymers (APs) with reversible, specific interactions between “sticker” sites exhibit a phase behavior that depends on a delicate balance between distinct contributions controlling the binding. For highly bonded systems, it is entropy that mostly determines whether, upon increasing concentration, the network forms progressively or via a first-order transition. With the aim of introducing an experimentally viable system tailored to test the subtle dependence of the phase behavior on binding site topology, we numerically investigate APs made of DNA, where “sticker” sites formed by short DNA sequences are interspersed in a flexible backbone of poly-T spacers. Due to their self-complementarity, each binding sequence can associate with another identical sticky sequence. We compare two architectures: one with a single sticker type, ( AA ) 6 , and the other with two distinct alternating types, ( AB ) 6 . At low temperatures, when most of the stickers are involved in a bond, the ( AA ) 6 system remains homogeneous, while the ( AB ) 6 system exhibits phase separation, driven primarily by entropic factors, mirroring predictions from simpler bead–spring models. Analysis of bond distributions and polymer conformations confirms that the predominantly entropic driving force behind this separation arises from the different topological constraints associated with intra- vs inter-molecular bonding. Our results establish DNA APs as a controllable and realistic platform for studying in the laboratory how the thermodynamics of associative polymer networks depend on the bonding site architecture in a clean and controlled manner.},

Here, we present a simple model extending the Alexander–De Gennes ansatz for arbitrary chain length distributions, allowing us to easily rationalize the effect of polydispersity, which is a feature of all realistic brushes. This model can predict the interaction of a brush with nanoparticles or an opposing wall, as demonstrated by good qualitative agreement with molecular dynamics simulations.

However, understanding the oxidative decomposition of SPEs on the cathode surfaces and characterizing the resulting cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) remain challenging both experimentally and computationally. This study introduces a new computational protocol based on ab initio molecular dynamics for simulating the decomposition of PEO:LiTFSI SPE on the NMC-811 cathode surface using a combined electron- and Li + -removal simulation approach. This method incorporates the effects of the applied electric potential and Li + migration on electrolyte oxidation during battery charging. The calculations indicate that electrons are withdrawn from both the C–C bonds of PEO and the Ni–O bonds of NMC-811, resulting in C–C bond cleavage and the formation of decomposition fragments. The created Li vacancies in the NMC facilitate coupling between decomposed PEO and exposed surface oxygen. The ROCH 2 O-M species, identified as the major degradation product on the NMC-811 cathode surface, is in agreement with the experimental XPS spectra. This approach provides detailed insights into the oxidative decomposition of PEO-based SPEs and demonstrates its effectiveness in exploring CEI component formation.},

This study systematically analyzes molecular mechanics force field parameters for bonded and nonbonded (van der Waals and electrostatic) interactions in alkanethiol SAMs with different terminal groups. Using structure optimization and energy decomposition analysis, we assess the impact of force field parameters on key properties, such as the equilibrium tilt angle, ligand packing density, and nanoscale structural organization. Based on this detailed benchmarking, an optimal set of force field parameters has been identified that reproduces the experimentally determined structural and energetic properties of SAMs and ensures their dynamic stability at room temperature.

  abstract     = {In close proximity to quantum emitters (QEs), plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) facilitate energy exchange with the QEs, which is known as plasmon–exciton coupling. The strong coupling regime, associated with Rabi splitting, is crucial for advanced nanophotonic devices, including solar cells, single-photon nonlinear optics, and nanolasers. Recently, high refractive index semiconductor NPs (typically Si NPs) have emerged for designing strongly coupled systems. However, their large mode volumes of magnetic Mie resonances have limited their success in achieving strong coupling. This study investigates the plasmon–exciton coupling between an Ag–Si core–shell and a monolayer QE of WS 2 (Ag–Si–WS 2 system) in air and water environments. Here, we compare the coupling dynamics of the hybrid Ag–Si–WS 2 system to that of the Si–WS 2 system as a benchmarking system. Employing Mie’s theory of core–shell scattering, in conjunction with Maxwell–Garnett effective medium theory, we analyze the optical responses of both configurations. Then, we calculate the Rabi splitting frequency for each system to identify the coupling regime. Our results suggest that the Ag–Si–WS 2 system can achieve a deep-strong coupling regime when the Ag core radius is less than 30 nm, with enhanced coupling strength in water compared to air. Conversely, the Si–WS 2 system does not achieve strong coupling in either medium. The hybrid modes in Ag–Si–WS 2 demonstrate remarkable symmetrical spectral characteristics compared to the asymmetric spectral line shape observed in the Si–WS 2 system. The findings suggest avenues for utilizing the plasmon–exciton strong coupling in the Ag–Si–WS 2 system to enhance optoelectronic and quantum electronic devices.},

The variations in the x-ray rocking curve full width at half maximum and surface roughness of epilayers with increasing Al composition x follow the trend predicted by the theoretical formation enthalpy of α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloys. The high crystalline quality of the α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 epilayers was further confirmed by x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy characterizations. While lattice constants adhered to Vegard’s law, the optical bandgap (5.28–7.22 eV) exhibited nonlinearity, with a bowing factor of 1.33 eV, aligning closely with theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest that the observed optical bandgap nonlinear effect in the α -(Al x Ga 1−x ) 2 O 3 alloy primarily stems from charge exchange, rather than volume deformation or strain relaxation effects, providing a pathway for precise bandgap tuning in Ga 2 O 3 for high-performance power electronics.},

Despite its importance, the solution properties of KDP remain poorly understood, and to the best of our knowledge, no prior molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have directly probed the structure and behavior of KDP in aqueous solutions. This study presents results from MD simulations of KDP in both solution and solid states and compares four dihydrogen phosphate (DP) force-field models in five different water models. Our results reveal that the solution structure is strongly dominated by the association of the DP anions through direct hydrogen bonding, where the degree of association exhibits a marked concentration dependence in accord with the experiment. Of the four DP models evaluated, two are much better able to reproduce experimental data, including from neutron scattering and ab initio MD simulation results, demonstrating their effectiveness in capturing the hydrogen bonding patterns that appear to govern local solution structure. We find that the extent of hydrogen bonding between DP anions is also sensitive to the choice of water models, with stronger hydration reducing DP–DP association. We have also examined the two models for both tetragonal and monoclinic crystal structures of KDP and found that these models are able to reproduce the experimental parameters relatively well. The findings of this study enhance our understanding of KDP solutions and lay the groundwork for future investigations into its solution and solid-state properties and behavior.},

  abstract     = {Hexagonal ice (I h ), the most common structure of ice, displays a variety of fascinating properties. Despite major efforts, a theoretical description of all its properties is still lacking. In particular, correctly accounting for its density and interatomic interactions is of utmost importance as a stepping stone for a deeper understanding of other properties. Deep potentials are a recent alternative to investigate the properties of ice I h , aiming to match the accuracy of ab initio simulations with the simplicity and scalability of classical molecular dynamics. This becomes particularly significant if one wishes to address nuclear quantum effects. In this work, we use machine learning potentials obtained for different exchange and correlation functionals to simulate the structural and vibrational properties of ice I h . We show that most functionals overestimate the density of ice compared to experimental results. Furthermore, a quantum treatment of the nuclei leads to even further distancing from experiments. We understand this by highlighting how different interatomic interactions play a role in obtaining the equilibrium density. In particular, different from water clusters and bulk water, nuclear quantum effects lead to stronger H-bonds in ice I h .},

  abstract     = {In conflict with standard notions of thermodynamics, mesoscopically sized inclusions (“clusters”) of a solute-rich liquid have been observed in equilibrated solutions of proteins and other molecules. According to a complexation scenario proposed earlier, a steady-state ensemble of finite-sized droplets of a metastable solute-rich liquid can emerge in a solution, if the solute molecules can form transient complexes with each other and/or solute. Here, we solve for the thermodynamics of an explicit model of a self-associating fluid in which particles can form transient dimers. We determine ranges of parameters where two distinct dense liquid phases, dimer-rich and monomer-rich, respectively, can co-exist with each other and the solute-poor phase. We find that within a certain range of the dimer’s binding strength, thermodynamic conditions for mesoscopic clusters to emerge are indeed satisfied. The location and size, respectively, of the corresponding region on the phase diagram are consistent with observation. We predict that the clusters are comprised of a metastable monomer-rich dense liquid, while the bulk solution itself contains substantial amounts of the dimer and exhibits large, pre-critical density fluctuations. Surprisingly, we find that the dense phase commonly observed during the macroscopic liquid–liquid separation should be dimer-rich, another testable prediction. The present findings provide further evidence for the complexation scenario and suggest new experimental ways to test it.},

  abstract     = {Gold nanocrystals have been widely used in sensing and medicine, where nanocrystal shape can profoundly influence properties. To describe and predict the structure and properties of Au nanomaterials, first-principles studies are the most accurate. Force fields can provide effective surrogates for first-principles calculations, and in the case of Au, many such force fields exist. To clarify the current state of Au structure prediction using force fields, we used parallel tempering molecular dynamics simulations to explore the temperature-dependent shape distributions of Au 147 and Au 55 from three different Embedded-Atom Method (EAM) force fields. We used machine learning to classify nanoparticle shapes and observe a wide variation in the temperature-dependent shape distributions among the various force fields, accompanied by a wide range of melting temperatures. We also compared the EAM structures to those from literature studies employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Gaussian process regression machine-learning force field, density functional tight binding, the Gupta potential, and Density Functional Theory (DFT). We re-optimized the lowest-energy structures from each force field/study using DFT and found that the lowest-energy structures for both Au 147 and Au 55 are amorphous. These structures were predicted by the ANN and DFT. Most of the 30 structures with minimum energy for each size are either hollow or partially to totally disordered and not icosahedral, as the sizes of these nanocrystals might imply.},

  abstract     = {Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) leverage superatomic properties via well-defined geometric/electronic configurations to enable novel reactions. The development of SCCs has facilitated atomic-level insights into catalyst design, thereby advancing our understanding of the fundamental nature of catalytic reactions. While orbital symmetry rules guide unimolecular catalyst design, the role of superatomic orbital symmetry in SCC reactivity remains elusive. Herein, we systematically investigated the gas-phase reactions of Ag n − ( n = 7–25) clusters with C 2 H 4 , employing a combination of time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. This revealed strong size-dependent reactivity: Ag 7–11, 18–23 − showed remarkable stability, whereas Ag 12–17, 24–25 − adsorbed one or even two C 2 H 4 molecules. The electron clouds of 1S superatomic orbital in Ag 12–15, 24–25 − clusters are partially localized on specific atoms. This partial localization enables effective interactions between the 1S orbital and the π orbital of C 2 H 4 , while concurrently enhancing stability through the formation of bonding orbitals and the d -orbital coupling among silver atoms. Notably, C 2 H 4 adsorption induces structural reorganization of Ag 16, 17 − , resulting in the formation of icosahedral cages. These cages contain highly symmetrical electron clouds that provide symmetrically matched orbitals, favoring secondary C 2 H 4 adsorption and thereby enhancing the stability of complexes. Our research introduces a novel framework for the precision engineering of superatomic clusters while broadening the application scope of the superatomic properties of metal clusters. The discovery of the superatomic orbital symmetry rule sheds light on the activity series of SCCs and offers new insights into precise SCC engineering.},

  abstract     = {The absolute photodetachment cross section characterizes the photostability of atomic and molecular anions against photodestruction by neutralization. The measurement of this quantity has been reported only for atomic and simple molecular ions. In 2006, Wester’s group introduced a novel ion-trap-based technique to measure the absolute photodetachment cross section [Trippel et al. , Phys. Rev. Lett. 97 , 193003 (2006)] of OH − . In the present work, we propose a novel methodology to streamline this technique to reduce the measurement time by several orders of magnitude by combining a single experimental rate measurement with a simulated column density distribution of the trapped ions. We validated our approach by reproducing the cross section reported for OH − at 632.8 nm. Using this technique, we report the first such measurement for a molecule of biological interest, deprotonated indole, at a laser wavelength of 403 nm. The proposed scheme is anticipated to have a significant and transformative impact on the development of a comprehensive database for photodetachment and photodissociation cross sections of molecular ions. Furthermore, these measurements have the potential to drive the development of cutting-edge computational codes for cross section calculations, enabling an unprecedentedly detailed understanding of electron dynamics in large molecules and the light–matter interaction.},

  abstract     = {Propargyl radical (•C 3 H 3 ) and butadienyl radical (• i -C 4 H 5 ) are two crucial intermediates in combustion and astrochemistry, particularly in the formation of C 7 H 8 aromatics such as toluene. However, the precise formation mechanisms of the first-ring aromatics through C 3 + C 4 reactions have remained ambiguous. This study explores the detailed potential energy surface (PES) of C 7 H 8 at the •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 entrance reaction channel, alongside conducting kinetic calculations and modeling. The PES reveals distinct mechanistic pathways that depend on the resonance configurations of •C 3 H 3 (propyne-3-yl and allenyl-1-yl). Key C 7 H 8 isomers, including 5-ethylidenecyclopenta-1,3-diene, cycloheptatriene, and norcaradiene, are preferentially formed via the allenyl-1-yl configuration, underlining the significant influence of π electron delocalization of propargyl. Kinetic analysis using the phase space theory and the RRKM/ME method identifies well-skipping reactions, leading to larger resonance-stabilized •C 7 H 7 radical and hydrogen atom through the less dominant allenyl-1-yl configuration reacting with • i -C 4 H 5 . Rate constants for •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 reaction yielding toluene and vinylcyclopentadienyl (vinylCPDyl) + H are determined. Subsequent kinetic modeling indicates that the formation pathway •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 → toluene predominates at low temperatures and pressure, contrasting with other toluene formations via benzyl + H and phenyl + CH 3 reactions. •C 3 H 3 + • i -C 4 H 5 reaction is also notably significant for generating vinylCPDyl at temperatures exceeding 1050 K at 760 Torr. Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) typically form in high-temperature scenarios, this research suggests viable low-temperature pathways for toluene, which are important in cooling zones of engines, thereby influencing PAH and soot production via resonance stabilized radical chain reactions.},

On the new PES, the state-to-state quantum dynamics calculations of the Ne( 2 S) + H 2 + /D 2 + ( v 0 = 0, j 0 = 0) reactions are performed. The calculated results indicate that the products of the two reactions are generated by the dissociation of short-lived complexes when the collision energy is slightly larger than the reaction thresholds, whereas a direct abstraction process gradually plays the dominant role as the collision energy increases. The newly constructed PES can be used to further accurately study the quantum dynamics of the Ne + H 2 + reactive system, including the effects of rovibrational excitations and the spatial alignment of reactant molecules.},

  abstract     = {Molecular systems with orbital (near-)degeneracy at the Fermi level tend to adopt a high-spin ground state. In these systems, one often finds low-lying electronic excitations with a lower total spin that can be reached from the ground state by a spin-flip-down excitation. In this work, we present three spin-adapted spin-flip-down time-dependent density functional theory (SFD-TD-DFT) approaches to calculate the excitation energies for these types of electronic transitions. These SFD-TD-DFT methods are based on a restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham (ROKS) formulation within the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA), giving rise to the ROKS-SFD-TDA family of methods. The three methods differ in the kernel, having different two-electron coupling elements in the resulting working equations. In agreement with earlier work, we find that a noncollinear description of the kernel is vital for producing a decent description of these excitations. In terms of obtaining excitations with a definite spin, we present two fully spin-adapted ROKS-SFD-TDA methods that either stem from configuration interaction with single excitations (SF-CIS) or from the already existing equation-of-motion ansatz (SF-TDA). It is shown that the spin-adaptation in SF-CIS and SF-TDA gives rise to artificial double counting of correlation effects by incorporating double excitations. When discarding this double counting, one ends up with an excited state that is partly spin-adapted (only in the open-to-open configurations). This method is called quasi-spin-adapted SF-TDA (Q-SF-TDA) and is shown to be a stable and efficient method that performs similarly to spin-unrestricted SFD-TD-DFT.},

While scalar-relativistic effects can be incorporated with minimal computational cost, accounting for spin–orbit interactions requires complex frameworks that can be computationally expensive. In this work, we develop a reduced-cost state-interaction approach for simulating near-edge soft x-ray absorption spectra of closed-shell transition metal complexes with relativistic effects incorporated using the ZORA-Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian. The computed spectra closely agree with those obtained with state-of-the-art approaches. This methodology provides a practical and cost-effective alternative to more rigorous two-component methods, making it particularly valuable for large-scale calculations and applications such as resonant inelastic x-ray scattering simulations, where capturing a large number of excited states is essential.},

Our analysis reveals that the relaxation time to equilibrium scales inversely with the square of the memory decay rate λ , i.e., τ relax ∝ λ −2 . To understand the origin of this scaling, we analyze the escape dynamics from a potential well and find that the mean escape time follows the same λ −2 dependence. This indicates that the slow relaxation arises from memory-suppressed fluctuations that delay escape events. To explain these findings, we reformulate the GLE using an auxiliary variable, embedding the non-Markovian dynamics in a higher-dimensional Markovian system. This approach provides a clear physical picture of how memory influences noise, diffusion, and relaxation in non-Markovian systems.},

While significant advances have been made through frameworks, such as the fluctuation theorem, it remains challenging to define thermodynamic quantities, such as energy, entropy, and free energy, at the local level during nonequilibrium processes. Recently, Jinwoo and Tanaka [Sci. Rep. 5 , 7832 (2015)] have proposed a formalism (the JT formalism) that defines local thermodynamic properties via a path ensemble of microstates over time. In this work, we apply the JT formalism to the polymer collapse process as a model nonequilibrium system to observe the collapse dynamics in terms of the end-to-end distance as the mesoscopic variable. Through extensive Langevin dynamics simulations, we quantify conformational free energy, lost information, and nonequilibrium free energy as functions of time and conformation. Our results validate the JT’s work fluctuation theorem, which relates work and local nonequilibrium free energy. This study highlights the utility of the JT formalism in analyzing dynamic thermodynamic behavior in complex soft matter systems.},

  abstract     = {Random generation of crystal structures is a key to the success of predicting unknown crystals. In this work, we introduce a general method for refining and selecting random structures that relies on minimal prior information. The method establishes a quotient graph from the random structure using a near-neighbor finding algorithm, which subsequently guides the refinement of the initial structure. To validate this approach, we apply it to nine distinct systems, and the outcomes indicate that it effectively yields a great number of low-energy structures. This technique could be integrated into most structure prediction algorithms to generate more sound initial structures, thereby expediting the search for ground state structures.},

  abstract     = {Isotope-edited infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing site-specific structures and dynamics within proteins. However, the interpretation is often complicated by spectral congestion and environmental heterogeneity. In this study, vibrational exciton models combined with molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine the frequency distributions and IR spectra of isotope-labeled local modes (ILMs) in parallel coiled-coil dimers. Based on the difference spectra obtained by subtracting the unlabeled spectrum from the labeled one, a new method to estimate labeled local-mode frequencies is proposed. The IR peak positions predicted from both the ILMs and specific normal modes systematically deviate from their corresponding average frequencies, primarily owing to asymmetric broadening. This asymmetry, which is characterized by the skewness of the mode density of states, arises from heterogeneous fluctuations in the local environment. Time correlation analysis revealed that solvation-induced dynamics persist on timescales (0.22–3.30 ps) exceeding the vibrational lifetime, causing incomplete motional averaging and pronounced inhomogeneous broadening. These effects result in skewed frequency distributions and contribute to peak localization errors. The application of asymmetric Gaussian fitting models and perturbative corrections improved the accuracy of the ILM frequency estimates, with sub-wavenumber precision achieved when spectral separation was sufficient. The heptad-repeat architecture of coiled coils further introduced register-specific vibrational patterns, emphasizing the role of the local environment. Collectively, the results highlight the critical role of solvation-induced heterogeneity in shaping isotope-edited IR spectra and demonstrate the need to consider both dynamic and statistical spectral asymmetry when performing high-resolution vibrational analysis of proteins.},

  abstract     = {Three-body interactions have long been conjectured to play a crucial role in the stability of matter. However, rigorous studies have been scarce due to the computational challenge of evaluating small energy differences in high-dimensional lattice sums. This work provides a rigorous analysis of Bain-type cuboidal lattice transformations, which connect the face-centered cubic (fcc), mean-centered cubic (mcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and axially centered cubic (acc) lattices. Our study incorporates a general ( n , m ) Lennard-Jones (LJ) two-body potential and a long-range repulsive Axilrod–Teller–Muto (ATM) three-body potential. The two-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations are evaluated to full precision using super-exponentially convergent series expansions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach to computing three-body lattice sums by converting the multi-dimensional sum into an integral involving products of Epstein zeta functions. This enables us to evaluate three-body lattice sums and their meromorphic continuations to machine precision within minutes on a standard laptop. Using our computational framework, we analyze the stability of cuboidal lattice phases relative to the close-packed fcc structure along a Bain transformation path for varying ATM coupling strengths. We analytically demonstrate that the ATM cohesive energy exhibits an extremum at the bcc phase and show numerically that it corresponds to a minimum for repulsive three-body forces along the Bain path. Our results indicate that strong repulsive three-body interactions can destabilize the fcc phase and render bcc energetically favorable for soft LJ potentials. However, even in this scenario, the bcc phase remains susceptible to further cuboidal distortions. These results suggest that the stability of the bcc phase is, besides vibrational, temperature, and pressure effects, strongly influenced by higher than two-body forces. Because of the wrong short-range behavior of the triple–dipole ATM model, the LJ potential is limited to exponents n > 9 for the repulsive wall, otherwise one observes distortion into a set of linear chains collapsing to the origin.},

The model yields a handful of damping and scaling parameters that were adjusted for the energy components to agree with 2-body symmetry-adapted perturbation theory decomposition and then fine-tuned in order for the total energy to agree with CCSD(T) for small clusters. We present a simple algorithm for rotating symmetric Cartesian tensors and employ a dispersion potential based on multipole polarizabilities. At short range, the 2- and 3-body potential energy was corrected to CCSD(T) accuracy using Gaussian approximation potentials. The radial distribution function and self-diffusion coefficient obtained with molecular dynamics simulations agree well with experiments.},

  abstract     = {We develop a multiset matrix product state (MPS) approach based on the time-dependent variational principle to solve the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) for the fermionic bath and apply it to inelastic vibrational scattering on metal surfaces. By using a Newns–Anderson model with two nuclear degrees of freedom, we investigate the vibrational energy relaxation of NO scattering on Au(111) and Ag(111) surfaces. Our results show that the extent of vibrational relaxation depends strongly on both incident energy and molecule–surface coupling strength. Vibrational relaxation on the Au(111) surface is enhanced with increasing incident energy due to greater transient electron transfer. The dependence on molecule–surface coupling strength and effective metal bandwidth is more complex. In the case of scattering on the Au(111) surface with low initial vibrational excitation, the landscape of the adiabatic potential energy surface plays an important role. Stronger coupling enhances transient electron transfer and leads to more pronounced vibrational relaxation. However, for high initial vibrational excitation, the extent of transient electron transfer remains similar. Larger coupling strength increases adiabaticity and reduces vibrational relaxation. The vibrational relaxation on the Ag(111) surface is found to be more pronounced than on the Au(111) surface, consistent with experimental observations. Our study provides detailed insights into the nonadiabatic dynamics during molecule–surface scattering and demonstrates the utility of the multiset MPS–HEOM approach for studying such processes.},

We also present an asymptotic analysis that shows how the dynamics described by the OD-QMEs for a CT system driven by a CW field turns into rate kinetics governed by field-modified Marcus theory rate constants at long times and high temperatures (when Gaussian statistics is assumed). The ability of off-diagonal driving to open up new CT pathways that can compete with non-radiative pathways is demonstrated in the case of the Garg–Onuchic–Ambegaokar CT model driven by a CW field.},

Over the last few decades, we have developed a general theoretical formulation for PCET that includes the quantum mechanical effects of the electrons and transferring protons, including hydrogen tunneling, as well as the reorganization of the environment and the donor–acceptor fluctuations. Analytical rate constants have been derived in various well-defined regimes. This Tutorial focuses on the vibronically nonadiabatic regime, in which a golden rule rate constant expression is applicable. The goal is to provide detailed instructions on how to compute the input quantities to this rate constant expression for PCET in molecules, proteins, and electrochemical systems. The required input quantities are the inner-sphere and outer-sphere reorganization energies, the diabatic proton potential energy profiles, the electronic coupling, the reaction free energy, and the proton donor–acceptor distance distribution function. Instructions on how to determine the degree of electron–proton nonadiabaticity, which is important for determining the form of the vibronic coupling, are also provided. Detailed examples are given for thermal enzymatic PCET, homogeneous molecular electrochemical PCET, photochemical molecular PCET, and heterogeneous electrochemical PCET. A Python-based package, pyPCET, for computing nonadiabatic PCET rate constants, along with example scripts, input data, output files, and detailed documentation, is publicly available.},
