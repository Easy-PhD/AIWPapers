  abstract     = {Atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) dopes silicon with enough carriers to change its electronic structure and can be used to create novel devices by defining metallic regions whose boundaries have single-atom abruptness. Incompatibility with the thermal and lithography process requirements for gated silicon transistor manufacturing have inhibited exploration of both how APAM can enhance CMOS performance and how transistor manufacturing steps can accelerate the discovery of new APAM device concepts. In this work, we introduce an APAM process that enables direct integration into the middle of a transistor manufacturing workflow. We show that a process that combines sputtering and annealing with a hardmask preserves a defining characteristic of APAM, a doping density far in excess of the solid solubility limit, while trading another, the atomic precision, for compatibility with manufacturing. The electrical characteristics of a chip combining a transistor with an APAM resistor show that the APAM module has only affected the transistor through the addition of a resistance and not by altering the transistor. This proof-of-concept demonstration also outlines the requirements and limitations of a unified APAM tool, which could be introduced into manufacturing environments, greatly expanding access to this technology and inspiring a new generation of devices with it.},

  abstract     = {The disclination of a bulk crystalline lattice could host strongly localized states protected by quantized fractional charges, known as disclination states. Although disclination states of topological crystalline insulators have been extensively explored in wave systems, i.e., electromagnetic and acoustic wave systems, their experimental realizations in the diffusion process, particularly thermal diffusion, have remained underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we theoretically model and experimentally measure topologically protected disclination states in C 4 , C 5 , and C 7 -symmetric thermal crystalline lattices composed of aluminum disks. The temperature evolution is tied to an effective Hamiltonian hosting topological disclination modes, which have a diffusion rate that is robust against defects. Our findings extend topological disclination phases and the physics of fractional charges from Hermitian to anti-Hermitian systems, opening new avenues for future research in thermal information processing and temperature management processes that are robust against disturbances.},

  abstract     = {Scanning spreading resistance microscopy (SSRM) has recently celebrated 30 years of existence when counting from the original patent of 1994. In this time, the technique has experienced an incredible journey with substantial evolutions that transformed SSRM from a small-scale experiment into a staple for chip manufacturing laboratories for physical analysis of materials, failure analysis, and process development of integrated circuits. As the nanoelectronics industry is ready for a new inflection point, with the introduction of nanosheet field-effect transistor to replace FinFETs and cell track scaling architectures such as the complementary field-effect transistors, SSRM is once again at a turning point. This review aims to highlight the state-of-the-art while discussing the emerging challenges introduced by the ever-increasing complexity in complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing. We start by illustrating the unique capability of the SSRM technique, its origin, and its evolution. Next, we continue by showing the considerable research effort that enabled SSRM to transition to a tomographic sensing method in support of FinFET transistors. Here, the high aspect ratio fin geometry and the complex contacts technology have imposed important modifications to the original method. Later, we elaborate on some of the key challenges introduced by the upcoming device transition from three-sided channel FinFETs into nanosheet FETs, i.e., offering a four-sided electrostatic control of the channel. Finally, we present the use of machine learning for automation in carrier calibration with increased accuracy. We close by introducing some of the concepts that we consider promising for further extension of SSRM to obtain sub-nm structural information and doping profiles in the area of advanced FinFETs and nanosheet FET technologies, including (a) correlative analysis flow, (b) liquid-assisted probing, and (c) top–down and bottom–up multi-probe sensing schemes to merge low- and high-pressure SSRM scans.},

  abstract     = {Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a type of zero-dimensional carbon-based nano-luminescent material with excellent fluorescent properties and have potential applications in many areas. Usually, the fluorescence of CQDs is quenched when they aggregate, limiting further exploration of their application. In recent years, research on CQDs with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) features has shown promise in addressing the issue of poor luminescence efficiency upon aggregation, although the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Here, inter-dots/molecular excitonic and intra-dots/molecular electron-vibration couplings are employed to potentially explore the mechanism of aggregation-caused quenching and AIE of CQDs. In addition, the CQDs with AIE feature are classified into two categories, the CQDs possessing intrinsic AIE properties (AIE-CQDs) and the exogenous CQDs (endowed-AIE-CQDs). The detailed research progress on both types is also summarized. Furthermore, the documented applications of AIE-CQDs and endowed-AIE-CQDs in biomedical imaging, chemical analysis, and solid-state lighting are summarized based on their enhanced fluorescence and redshifted emission wavelengths upon aggregation.},

  abstract     = {Optical microscopy constitutes an essential cornerstone in the life sciences, facilitating detailed investigations into the structural and dynamic complexities of biological systems. Nonetheless, classical optical microscopy encounters significant challenges in probing the intricate complexities of cellular and molecular systems, particularly due to the diffraction limit of light and limitations posed by detection noise. Although significant advances in optical microscopy have realized super-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratios, and high-speed imaging, these methods frequently require high-intensity illumination, potentially inducing photodamage and photobleaching in biological samples. Quantum-twinned photons, characterized by their unique properties of quantum entanglement, quantum correlation, and quantum interference at the single photon level, present transformative solutions to these limitations. Several imaging modalities have been developed that utilize quantum-twinned photons, encompassing quantum correlation imaging, quantum entanglement imaging, and quantum interference imaging. These techniques exhibit quantum-enhanced imaging capabilities that markedly outperform classical methods, with diverse applications in cellular, tissue, and organism imaging. Centered on this theme, here we present a comprehensive review of quantum biological imaging leveraging the three pivotal quantum properties of quantum-twinned photons. The review encompasses the physical principles underlying these methods, recent experimental advancements, and an exploration of future prospects and challenges in the practical implementation of quantum bio-imaging.},

  abstract     = {Radio frequency (RF) filters for communication have been developed rapidly, driven by new communication standards and the dramatic expansion of wide-range applications. Although they are currently playing crucial roles in applications such as mobile communication, space-to-ground communication, and the Internet of Thing, there are significantly stringent and challenging requirements demanded for their rapid and successful applications. Compared with conventionally adopted low-temperature co-fired ceramics, integrated passive device filters, and dielectric filters, acoustic wave filters have been regarded as the competitive choice, mainly attributed to their wide bandwidth, small size, and low insertion loss. This paper reviews the advances and outlines future perspectives of high frequency acoustic wave devices for RF communication, focusing on several critical issues including bandwidth, roll-off, frequency, power-handling, insertion loss, out-of-band rejection, tunability, and size/package. It is focused mainly on the extreme performance breakthroughs of RF acoustic wave filter, e.g., how to achieve acoustic devices with operating frequency above 8 GHz, bandwidth around 1 GHz, and quality factor exceeding 2000. Various principles, strategies, and technologies for achieving the superior performance of super-high frequency RF filters are discussed, e.g., applying advanced materials such as scandium-doped AlN or single crystals of AlN and LiNbO 3 , creating new topology structures such as hybrid filters, and generating new types of vibration modes of acoustic waves.},
