We focus particularly on the structure of the associated conformal factors and examine several nontrivial special cases. By utilizing the symmetries of affine geometry, we construct an affine connection on the Newtonian gauge space-time without imposing common geometric constraints such as flatness, metric compatibility, or torsion-freeness. From this general connection, we derive a statistical connection, thereby establishing a statistical structure on the Newtonian gauge. Within this framework, we analyze the conformal symmetry of the tensor field K , defined as the difference between the statistical connection and the Levi–Cività connection. Moreover, we characterize the conditions under which a conformal Killing vector field on the underlying manifold also serves as a statistical conformal Killing vector field in the induced statistical geometry.},

First, we derive the infinite RCS model from the kinetic RCS model with non-compact support through the particle-in-cell method, and then we show that the diameter and radius of the velocity variable in the RCS model are non-increasing. Next, we construct a system of dissipative differential inequalities via the finite truncation of the proposed infinite RCS model. This overcomes the difficulty brought by the inaccessibility of infinite norms, which enables us to analyze the solution’s flocking behaviors. Finally, we establish the model’s classical limit and derive the optimal convergence rate in terms of the speed of light, which is the same as a finite-time classical limit.},

Our method follows the second moment approach developed recently in Arous et al. [Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 73 (8), 1732–1828 (2020)], from which the ground state energy can be derived for the pure - like mixed p -spin model. By analyzing the complexity function with given radial derivative and energy, we derive the convergence of the Hessian spectrum from the vanishing mean number of critical points. For the 1-RSB model, the ground state energy was explicitly computed in Huang and Sellke [arXiv:2311.15495 (2023)]. Combined with the complexity function of local maxima with given radial derivative obtained in Belius and Schmidt [arXiv:2207.14361 (2022)], this allows us to obtain the corresponding results more directly. Our result extends those corresponding results in the regime of topology trivialization.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability. The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler–Poincaré variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin–Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model’s Lie–Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map. Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie–Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie–Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler–Poincaré principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints. The dual Euler–Poincaré/Lie–Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.},

Due to the shortage of the compactness of Sobolev embedding theorem, the asymptotic compactness of the corresponding semigroup generated by problem (1.1) can not be obtained by the method of contraction function in the case that the exponent of the source term is critical. In this paper, we first prove the corresponding dynamical system is a gradient system. By the abstract results about the existence of global attractor, we will establish a quasi-stability inequality by using the global L r -regularity ( r ≥ 2) in time of the nonlocal Balakrishnan-Taylor term under some suitable assumptions on the nonlinear damping term, which is sufficient to show the existence of a finite dimensional global attractor for such system.},

Despite its simplicity, it exhibits remarkably rich dynamical behavior, including the interplay between regular and chaotic orbital dynamics, resonances, and stochastic regions in phase space, which have inspired extensive research in nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we investigate the system’s solutions at small energy levels, deriving asymptotic constants of motion that remain valid over remarkably long timescales—far exceeding the range of validity of conventional perturbation techniques. Our approach leverages the system’s inherent two-scale dynamics, employing a novel analytical framework to uncover these long-lived invariants. The derived formulas exhibit excellent agreement with numerical simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the system’s long-term behavior.},

For practical application, a stochastic quasi-positive equilibrium N * is defined. By solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation, we obtain an approximate expression of the density function of the stationary distribution around N *. Finally, some numerical examples are performed to demonstrate our theoretical results.

  abstract     = {This paper presents an equivalent characterization of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators with L p potentials. Viewing eigenvalues as nonlinear functionals of potentials, we use the complete continuity of eigenvalues to deduce a family of critical systems consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are dependent on the exponent p ∈ (1, ∞) of the Lebesgue spaces and m free parameters. The problem of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators can be transformed into the solvability of critical systems. Based on this relation, for p = 2 we can theoretically obtain the optimal potential from the integrability theory of Hamiltonian systems point of view. Finally, we observe the numerical experiments for the critical systems to propose the future direction.},

In these applications, the tensor powers of the defining representation seem particularly important. The representation theory of these tensor powers is understood in two regimes. 1. For odd qudits in the case where the power t is not larger than the number of systems n : Here, a duality theory between the Clifford group and certain discrete orthogonal groups can be used to make fairly explicit statements about the occurring irreps (this theory is related to Howe duality and the η -correspondence ). 2. For qubits: Tensor powers up to t = 4 have been analyzed on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we provide a unified framework for the duality approach that also covers qubit systems. To this end, we translate the notion of rank of symplectic representations to representations of the qubit Clifford group, and generalize the η correspondence between symplectic and orthogonal groups to a correspondence between the Clifford and certain orthogonal-stochastic groups. As a sample application, we provide a protocol to efficiently implement the complex conjugate of a black-box Clifford unitary evolution.},

In the quantum information community, it is commonly believed that SIC-POVMs exist in all dimensions; however, the general proof of their existence is still an open problem. By mapping SIC-POVMs onto the generalized Bloch sphere, we prove two geometric existence statements associated with the SIC-POVM existence problem. First, we prove the Knaster’s conjecture for n vertices of an n -simplex and use that to prove the existence of a continuous family of general SIC-POVMs where the trace of the k th power of the operators is the same for ( n 2 − 1) of the elements. Furthermore, by using numerical methods, we show that in dimensions 3 and 4, a regular simplex can be constructed on the Bloch sphere such that all its vertices correspond to density matrices having the same trace of ρ 3 . In the three-dimensional Hilbert space, we generate 10 4 general SIC-POVMs for where all the elements have the same set of randomly chosen eigenvalues, indicating the continuous set of general SIC-POVMs can be constructed for all possible values of trace of ρ 3 .},

Under the condition that the embedded eigenvalue of the unperturbed operator lies away from the thresholds of the continuous spectrum, we show that the set of nearby potentials for which the embedded eigenvalue persists forms a smooth manifold of finite and even codimension. The proof employs tools from Floquet theory, exponential dichotomies, and Lyapunov–Schmidt reduction.

Here, we observe that mutually commuting, long-range interactions satisfy an enhanced LRB of the form t r − α for any α > 0, and this scaling is sharp. In particular, the linear light cone occurs at α = 1 in any dimension. Part of our motivation stems from quantum error-correcting codes. As applications, we derive enhanced bounds on ground state correlations and an enhanced local perturbations perturb locally principle for which we adapt a recent subharmonicity argument of Wang-Hazzard. Similar enhancements hold for commuting interactions with stretched exponential decay.},

This yields an explicit basis of the complete 27 ⊗ 27 color space (defined as the space of 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 color maps) in terms of orthogonal multiplets. This study shows that even complex color structures can be addressed, with the help of the birdtrack pictorial technique, using only elementary tools. In particular, we highlight the usefulness of the quadratic Casimir operator, whose eigenspaces allow efficient filtering of all projectors and transition operators, and of the permutation operators that further improve this filtering. The product 27 ⊗ 27 also has an interesting feature: three equivalent irreps 27 appear in the decomposition, two of which are symmetric and can therefore be distinguished neither by the quadratic Casimir operator nor by their symmetry under permutation. In this case, it is convenient to use Clebsch–Gordan coefficients to derive the two associated, symmetric projectors. The latter are not uniquely determined (only their sum is), and we give the set of all solutions. Finally, we explicitly derive the soft anomalous dimension matrix associated with 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 , whose block-diagonal main structure is easy to understand, but whose detailed spectrum properties remain intriguing. The approach presented for 27 ⊗ 27 → 27 ⊗ 27 could in principle be applied to any product of SU( N ) irreps, and eventually automated.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on the isentropic Euler system for the Born-Infeld equation of state with friction, for which the Riemann problem is solved by applying the variable substitution method. The non-self-similar Riemann solutions with five different structures are obtained. Although the considered system with non-negative pressure is strictly hyperbolic with two genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, the delta shock wave still occurs in the solutions. For the delta shock wave, the generalized Rankine-Hugoniot relation and entropy condition are clarified. Under the impact of the friction term, the rarefaction waves and shock waves as well as delta shock wave are bent into parabolic curves. Also, it is shown that as the pressure goes to zero, the non-self-similar solutions of the considered system just converge to the non-self-similar solutions of the zero-pressure Euler system with friction.},

  abstract     = {Whether smooth solutions of partially dissipative 2D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations develop singularities in finite time has been a long-standing open problem. Since the pioneering work by Cao and Wu [Adv. Math. 226 , 1803–1822 (2011)], such problem has garnered much more attention. When the magnetic field is close to an equilibrium state, the study of stability and large-time behavior provides a significant example of the stabilizing effects of the magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids. In this paper, we consider the global well-posedness for 2D partially dissipation MHD equations around a uniform magnetic field in R + 2 with no-slip boundary condition. An efficient Stokes estimate is developed, which can be used to obtain the global low order ( H 2 ) energy for the partially dissipative MHD system with physical boundary. In addition, we obtain an explicit decay rate for the linear system using spectral analysis methods. We also observe that the half-space shares some similarities with the Cauchy problem, but exhibits some differences, especially when considering spatial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss lattice energy minimization problems for various interacting potentials, including Born-Mayer, Coulomb, Lennard-Jones, and Rydberg potentials. The main methods and techniques used in this paper are derived from Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016). Based on this, we derive a more comprehensive attractive-repulsive model that can be understood in the sense of exponential decay. Our research leads to a new lower bound for the inverse density of the triangular lattice when the Lennard-Jones potential with exponential decay is minimal, which is a significant improvement over previous results. More specifically, in Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016), the degree of the lowest order term of the Lennard-Jones potential is to satisfy x 1 > 3/2, but our result covers the interval (1, 3/2], making it the optimal case with a lower bound of 1. We extend the results for Morse potential to derive the optimal attractive-repulsive correlation coefficient conditions, i.e., ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 2.3853 and ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 7.3069. Also, our findings provide the first-ever inverse density bound when the triangular lattice is optimal for the Coulomb and Rydberg potentials, while the former gives global optimality without density constraints, and the latter gives upper and lower bounds on the density interval for optimality. Finally, we present numerical estimates of the inverse density, and these findings have critical applications in improving numerical simulations of radiation defects in crystals, especially in the α -iron lattice, and better understanding the properties of rare gases. Our solutions and improved estimates will enable researchers to better understand lattice energy minimization.},

Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number is greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable.
