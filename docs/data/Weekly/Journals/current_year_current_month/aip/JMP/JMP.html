We focus particularly on the structure of the associated conformal factors and examine several nontrivial special cases. By utilizing the symmetries of affine geometry, we construct an affine connection on the Newtonian gauge space-time without imposing common geometric constraints such as flatness, metric compatibility, or torsion-freeness. From this general connection, we derive a statistical connection, thereby establishing a statistical structure on the Newtonian gauge. Within this framework, we analyze the conformal symmetry of the tensor field K , defined as the difference between the statistical connection and the Levi–Cività connection. Moreover, we characterize the conditions under which a conformal Killing vector field on the underlying manifold also serves as a statistical conformal Killing vector field in the induced statistical geometry.},

Specifically, we show that its empirical spectral measure converges in probability to a shifted and rescaled semicircle law and does not have outliers. Our method follows the second moment approach developed recently in Arous et al. [Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 73 (8), 1732–1828 (2020)], from which the ground state energy can be derived for the pure - like mixed p -spin model. By analyzing the complexity function with given radial derivative and energy, we derive the convergence of the Hessian spectrum from the vanishing mean number of critical points. For the 1-RSB model, the ground state energy was explicitly computed in Huang and Sellke [arXiv:2311.15495 (2023)]. Combined with the complexity function of local maxima with given radial derivative obtained in Belius and Schmidt [arXiv:2207.14361 (2022)], this allows us to obtain the corresponding results more directly. Our result extends those corresponding results in the regime of topology trivialization.},

It is shown that: (i) If λ 1 < 0, both predator and prey populations go extinct eventually; (ii) Only the predator population will die out exponentially if λ 1 > 0 and λ 2 < 0; (iii) If λ 1 > 0 and λ 2 > 0, the existence and uniqueness of an ergodic stationary distribution of the system is derived, which reflects the long-term coexistence of prey and predator populations. For practical application, a stochastic quasi-positive equilibrium N * is defined. By solving the corresponding Fokker–Planck equation, we obtain an approximate expression of the density function of the stationary distribution around N *. Finally, some numerical examples are performed to demonstrate our theoretical results. The techniques and methods used in the paper are general, and can be successfully applied to other complex stochastic population models.},

Viewing eigenvalues as nonlinear functionals of potentials, we use the complete continuity of eigenvalues to deduce a family of critical systems consisting of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which are dependent on the exponent p ∈ (1, ∞) of the Lebesgue spaces and m free parameters. The problem of the optimal estimations for the sums of the first m eigenvalues of Sturm–Liouville operators can be transformed into the solvability of critical systems. Based on this relation, for p = 2 we can theoretically obtain the optimal potential from the integrability theory of Hamiltonian systems point of view. Finally, we observe the numerical experiments for the critical systems to propose the future direction.},

In the quantum information community, it is commonly believed that SIC-POVMs exist in all dimensions; however, the general proof of their existence is still an open problem. By mapping SIC-POVMs onto the generalized Bloch sphere, we prove two geometric existence statements associated with the SIC-POVM existence problem. First, we prove the Knaster’s conjecture for n vertices of an n -simplex and use that to prove the existence of a continuous family of general SIC-POVMs where the trace of the k th power of the operators is the same for ( n 2 − 1) of the elements. Furthermore, by using numerical methods, we show that in dimensions 3 and 4, a regular simplex can be constructed on the Bloch sphere such that all its vertices correspond to density matrices having the same trace of ρ 3 . In the three-dimensional Hilbert space, we generate 10 4 general SIC-POVMs for where all the elements have the same set of randomly chosen eigenvalues, indicating the continuous set of general SIC-POVMs can be constructed for all possible values of trace of ρ 3 .},

The original proof of this result makes use of the anti-pesudo-Hermiticity of every diagonalizable operator L : H → H ⁠ , which means the existence of an antilinear Hermitian bijection τ : H → H satisfying L † = τL τ −1 .

This allows us to generalize the original proof of the equivalence of pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized P T -symmetry for diagonalizable operators to block-diagonalizable operators. For a pair of pseudo-Hermitian operators acting respectively in two-dimensional and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain explicit expressions for the antlinear operators τ and X that realize their anti-pseudo-Hermiticity and generalized P T -symmetry at and away from the exceptional points.},

Partial Differ. Equ. 63 , 81 (2024), we investigate the existence of solutions to Kazdan–Warner type equations on a finite connected graph, which are based on the theory of Brouwer degree. Specifically, we consider the equation −Δ u = h ( x ) f ( u ) − c , where h is a real-valued function defined on the vertex set V , c ∈ R and f satisfies the asymptotic condition f ( t ) e t → 1 as t → ± ∞ . Different from the above studies, the main difficulty in this paper is to show that the Kazdan–Warner type equation has only three constant solutions, based on delicate analysis and the connectivity of graphs, which have not been extensively explored in previous literature.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we discuss lattice energy minimization problems for various interacting potentials, including Born-Mayer, Coulomb, Lennard-Jones, and Rydberg potentials. The main methods and techniques used in this paper are derived from Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016). Based on this, we derive a more comprehensive attractive-repulsive model that can be understood in the sense of exponential decay. Our research leads to a new lower bound for the inverse density of the triangular lattice when the Lennard-Jones potential with exponential decay is minimal, which is a significant improvement over previous results. More specifically, in Bétermin, SIAM J. Math. Anal. 48 , 3236–3269 (2016), the degree of the lowest order term of the Lennard-Jones potential is to satisfy x 1 > 3/2, but our result covers the interval (1, 3/2], making it the optimal case with a lower bound of 1. We extend the results for Morse potential to derive the optimal attractive-repulsive correlation coefficient conditions, i.e., ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 2.3853 and ln( b 2 : b 1 ) ≥ 7.3069. Also, our findings provide the first-ever inverse density bound when the triangular lattice is optimal for the Coulomb and Rydberg potentials, while the former gives global optimality without density constraints, and the latter gives upper and lower bounds on the density interval for optimality. Finally, we present numerical estimates of the inverse density, and these findings have critical applications in improving numerical simulations of radiation defects in crystals, especially in the α -iron lattice, and better understanding the properties of rare gases. Our solutions and improved estimates will enable researchers to better understand lattice energy minimization.},

  abstract     = {We study the spectral stability of smooth, small-amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Novikov equation, which is a Camassa-Holm type equation with cubic nonlinearities. Specifically, we investigate the L 2 ( R ) -spectrum of the associated linearized operator, which in this case is an integro-differential operator with periodic coefficients, in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane. Our analysis shows that such small-amplitude periodic solutions are spectrally unstable to long-wavelength perturbations if the wave number is greater than a critical value, bearing out the famous Benmajin-Feir instability for the Novikov equation. On the other hand, such waves with wave number less than the critical value are shown to be spectrally stable. Our methods are based on applying spectral perturbation theory to the associated linearization.},

The time scale is the same as in the recent papers by Hernández–Ranard–Riedel but the statement and methods are different. The appendix presents numerical experiments illustrating the classical/quantum correspondence in Lindblad evolution and comparing it to the mathematical results.},

By introducing two suitable parameters, we show the existence of periodic traveling solutions of DGH equation in a concise way. The monotonicity of period function with respect to different variables are proved by using Chicone’s criterion and the method developed by Geyer and Villadelprat. The problem of the spectral stability of smooth periodic waves in the DGH equation is discussed. Within the functional-analytic framework, we obtain a criterion for the spectral stability of smooth periodic traveling waves in DGH equation. In addition, we show the smooth periodic traveling solutions are orbitally stable under certain conditions.},
