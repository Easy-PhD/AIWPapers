  abstract     = {In this article, we introduce and analyze some statistical properties of a class of models of random landscapes of the form H ( x ) = μ 2 x 2 + ∑ l = 1 M ϕ l ( k l ⋅ x ) , x ∈ R N , μ > 0 where both the functions ϕ l ( z ) and vectors k l are random. An important example of such landscape describes superposition of M plane waves with random amplitudes, directions of the wavevectors, and phases, further confined by a parabolic potential of curvature μ . Our main efforts are directed toward analyzing the landscape features in the limit N → ∞ , M → ∞ keeping α = M / N finite. In such a limit we find (i) the rates of asymptotic exponential growth with N of the mean number of all critical points and of local minima known as the annealed complexities and (ii) the expression for the mean value of the deepest landscape minimum (the ground-state energy). In particular, for the latter we derive the Parisi-like optimization functional and analyze conditions for the optimiser to reflect various phases for different values of μ and α : replica-symmetric, one-step and full replica symmetry broken, as well as criteria for continuous, Gardner and random first order transitions between different phases.},

Firstly, a stochastic representation of the solution is derived by the stochastic differential equation associated with a subordinated Brownian motion and a birth-death process, in which the drift term is the solution of the INSE on R d ( d ≥ 2 ) ⁠ . Regarding the existence of the birth-death semigroup in ℓ p ( π ) ( p ≥ 2), equipped with a positive weight measure π , it is proved via a perturbation theorem without requiring the boundedness of the birth and death rates. Then, relying on the regularity estimates of the solution for INSE and the properties of the birth-death semigroup, we prove that the stochastic representation is a unique local strong solution in ℓ p ′ ( π ) × L p ( R d ) ( p ′ ≥ 2 , p > d ) via spatial regularity analyses of the random flow. The Picard iteration is used to prove that it is both unique local mild and weak solution in ℓ 2 ( π ) × L 2 ( R d ) ⁠ .},

Previous research has explored the nonlinear spinor field in various anisotropic and isotropic cosmological models, revealing that the presence of nontrivial, non-diagonal components of the spinor field’s energy-momentum tensor imposes severe restrictions on both the space-time geometry and the spinor field itself. In our current study, we find that while these restrictions still apply, the introduction of Lyra’s geometry significantly influences the evolution of the Universe. This influence arises from the fact that the invariants of the spinor field are dependent on the parameter of Lyra’s geometry.},

  abstract     = {Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor M to generate an MPU of size N , namely, Tr ( E M N ) = Tr ( E T N ) = 1 ⁠ , where E M and E T denote the transfer matrices of M and T = MM † , respectively, with M † being the Hermitian adjoint of M with respect to the physical indices. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.},

Taking the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions as a state space, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of a periodic evolution system of measures for the fast equation when the slow component of the solution is fixed, and then establish the exponential ergodicity for the stochastic systems under certain conditions. By using the time discretization and variational methods, we finally show the strong rate of convergence for the slow component of the solution operator. The results of this paper are also valid when the fractional Laplace operator (−Δ) s with s ∈ (0, 1) becomes the standard Laplace operator −Δ.},

  abstract     = {This paper concerns the well-posedness of subsonic combustion flows in a cylindrical nozzle. We establish the existence and uniqueness of three-dimensional smooth subsonic flows to the steady Zeldovich–von Neumann–Döring combustion equations by prescribing the Bernoulli’s quantity, the entropy, the fraction of unburned gas and the tangential velocity at the entrance and the pressure at the exit. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear boundary value problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system. The main difficulty is that all the physical quantities are coupled with each other due to the combustion process. One of the key points in the analysis is to utilize the deformation-curl decomposition to deal with the hyperbolic and elliptic modes. Another one is to solve the deformation-curl system for the velocity field with mixed boundary conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper aims to establish the global well-posedness of the free boundary problem for the incompressible viscous resistive magnetohydrodynamic equations. Under the framework of Lagrangian coordinates, a unique global solution exists in the half-space provided that the norm of the initial data in the critical homogeneous Besov space B ̇ p , 1 − 1 + N / p ( R + N ) is sufficiently small, where p ∈ [ N , 2 N − 1). Building upon prior work such as Danchin and Mucha [J. Funct. Anal. 256 , 881–927 (2009)] and Ogawa and Shimizu [J. Differ. Equ. 274 , 613–651 (2021)] in the half-space setting, we establish maximal L 1 -regularity for both the Stokes equations without surface stress and the linearized equations of the magnetic field with zero boundary condition. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlinear problems are proven using the Banach contraction mapping principle.},
