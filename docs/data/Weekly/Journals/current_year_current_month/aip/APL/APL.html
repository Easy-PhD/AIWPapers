  abstract     = {Quantum random number generators play a vital role in securing communication and encryption. In the present work, we have produced bright twin beams using four-wave mixing in a double- Λ configuration in rubidium-85 vapor and generated two strings of highly correlated random numbers. The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.},

By leveraging high-volume SiC technology, we achieve a substantial reduction in optical losses, reaching 3.5 dB/cm at 785 nm, thereby surpassing the performance of previously reported planar SiC waveguides. A comprehensive analysis of the signal mode profile yields valuable insights into the modal characteristics of the waveguides, enabling the optimization of N-doping profiles for the optimal incorporation of V2 silicon vacancy color centers, which possess unique optical and spin properties essential for quantum sensing applications. Notably, our platform demonstrates broadband capability, supporting the development of both multi-mode and single-mode waveguides. Furthermore, we minimize surface roughness of the coupling facets to an root mean square value of 0.2 nm, thereby reducing scattering losses and enhancing device performance while maintaining compatibility with high-volume manufacturing processes. V2 color centers are created within the waveguide through proton implantation, as evidenced by the detection of fluorescence light above 850 nm within the guided waveguide mode, highlighting the potential of our platform for highly sensitive and compact SiC-based quantum sensors.},

  abstract     = {Passive cooling strategies, such as radiative cooling and evaporation cooling, have attracted lots of interest in the heat dissipation of solar cells. However, how to evaluate the effect of these passive cooling strategies on the solar cell performance was lacking, which is critical for the passive cooling design of solar cells. In this work, an electricity-thermal model was built to discuss the solar cell performance under different passive cooling conditions. Compared with the common solar cell with a glass cover, the sky radiative cooling by improving mid-infrared thermal emittance or above- λ g (effective cutoff wavelength) reflectance in the solar spectrum had a slight effect on the temperature drop or power improvement under natural convection. The core point was to ensure the near-perfect sub- λ g transmittance using anti-reflection coatings, which played the main role in the solar cell performance. A low cell temperature did not mean a high cell outpower under the selective spectral cover, and the sub- λ g transmittance could not be suppressed to improve heat dissipation performance. After introducing an evaporation cooling layer, the output power could be enhanced greatly, showing the wide adaptability to cool the solar cell with little effect on solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in sub- λ g spectra. These results could guide subsequent cooling structure design by integrating different cooling strategies to achieve a near-perfect passive cooling system.},

  abstract     = {Fe doping is widely known to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni-based electrocatalysts; however, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial, with interpretations focused on post-incorporation effects. Here, we uncover a previously overlooked pre-incorporation mechanism: Fe 3+ -mediated redox cycling in solution that directly generates high-valent Ni 3+ species, facilitating the formation of catalytically active Ni 2 O 3 H and nanostructures. Under hydrothermal conditions, spontaneous electron transfer occurs from Ni 2+ to Fe 3+ , yielding Ni 3+ , while simultaneous regeneration of Fe 2+ sustains a self-perpetuating redox cycle for continuous Ni 2+ oxidation. Remarkably, at ultra-low Fe 3+ concentrations, a hybrid morphology featuring both 2D and 1.5D structural characteristics emerges. Most Fe 3+ precipitates as colloidal Fe(OH) 3 without incorporation into the lattice, particularly near critical doping thresholds. The trace Fe-induced 2/1.5D nanostructures exhibit superior OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of merely 225 mV––comparable to that of heavily doped counterparts. Additionally, Fe doping synergistically activates both the lattice oxygen mechanism and the adsorbate evolution mechanism. These findings reveal a paradigm in Fe–Ni catalyst design, wherein controlled dopant-mediated redox chemistry and nanostructure play pivotal roles in optimizing electrocatalytic performance.},

  abstract     = {Air stability issues in layered oxides present significant challenges for sodium-ion batteries due to the high activity in humid air. The fundamental instability arises from inherently weak Na–O bonding, exacerbated by their wider interlayer spacing. Here, we propose that incorporating ions with high electronegativity can effectively modulate the Na + binding strength, thereby enhancing intrinsic air stability. As a case study, P'2-type Na 0.67 MnO 2 (NM), one of the promising cathodes that benefits from its cost-effectiveness and high specific capacity, was selected to verify the above-mentioned concept by introducing strongly electronegative Pb 4+ ions. To synergistically enhance structural stability, electrochemically inactive Mg 2+ ions were also incorporated, resulting in the P'2-type Na 0.67 Pb 0.04 Mg 0.08 Mn 0.88 O 2 (NMP4M8). As confirmed by x-ray diffraction, the reduced layer spacing in NMP4M8 effectively inhibits spontaneous Na + /H + exchange, resulting in excellent air stability. After 4-day air-exposure (20 °C, 50% RH), no significant hydrated phases were detected, whereas the unmodified NM exhibits clear structural degradation. After 7-day air-exposure, NMP4M8 achieved a capacity retention rate of 80.6% after 200 cycles, significantly higher than the 20.8% observed in aged NM. Density functional theory calculation revealed that Pb 4+ incorporation strengthened Na–O attraction, while Gibbs free energy analysis showed thermodynamically unfavorable degradation for NMP4M8. This co-doping strategy presents a promising pathway toward developing air-stable layered oxides.},

To evaluate their effectiveness, both numerical and experimental analyses of the conductive and convective behavior of Kresling origami fins are conducted. Experimental measurements are performed in a controlled wind tunnel environment, while numerical results are obtained using a three-dimensional transient model based on the fundamental conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. The results indicate that the contracted Kresling fin achieves a 20% higher Nusselt number compared to the expanded configuration at low Reynolds numbers, along with improved temperature uniformity across the surface. These findings demonstrate the potential of Kresling origami as an efficient and reconfigurable thermal management solution, particularly for systems requiring adaptability.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior carrier transport is critical in thermoelectric (TE) materials. However, traditional strategies, such as doping and alloying, always generate a trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility caused by the complex scattering of carriers, limiting the carrier transport properties. Herein, we report a unique high-pressure strategy without introducing scattering centers to optimize carrier transport properties by taking Bi 2 S 3 as an example. The layered nature of Bi 2 S 3 offers a strong response of band structures to pressure. It was found that a unique electronic topological transition emerged under ∼4 GPa revealed by the in situ high-pressure Raman spectra, leading to simultaneous increases in carrier concentration and mobility. This enabled significant enhancement of carrier transport property to boost the electrical conductivity while maintaining a high Seebeck coefficient due to the accompanied large enhancement in the density of states, resulting in a notably improved power factor. Separately, the relatively low thermal conductivity remained due to the preserved layered structure characteristic. Consequently, a record-high figure of merit of 1.05 was achieved at 5 GPa and 744 K, which is higher than those reported state-of-the-art Bi 2 S 3 -based thermoelectrics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of pressure in optimizing carrier transport properties, providing profound insights of high pressure in designing high-performance thermoelectrics.},

Such a dual-field synergistic energy storage capacitor overcomes the limitations of conventional single-field systems, where the energy storage density and efficiency are severely constrained by dielectric losses and the intrinsic trade-off in ferroelectric materials under pure electric fields. Utilizing a hybrid fabrication technique combining cluster beam deposition with chemical solution deposition, the Sr 2 Bi 4 Ti 5 O 18 /TbFe 2 cluster composite film capacitor was fabricated on a flexible Pt/Mica substrate. Under external magnetic fields, the TbFe 2 cluster layer generates a giant magnetostrictive strain, which subsequently induces an electrical polarization signal in the ferroelectric Sr 2 Bi 4 Ti 5 O 18 layer via the piezoelectric response, achieving dual-field energy conversion and storage. At a magnetic field of 1 T, the energy storage density and efficiency of the flexible film capacitor increase by 19.2% and 5.5%, respectively.

The on/off ratio of the AlN memristors could be improved to 10 6 using one device cell, which consists of two memristors connected in parallel with a common bottom electrode. We identified space charge limited conduction in the low resistance state and Schottky emission in the high resistance state as the dominant conduction mechanisms. The AlN-based memristors could transform to volatile memory by reducing the interfacial barrier height. We further designed and fabricated a vertically integrated double barrier AlN memristor as a nonvolatile ReRAM on 2-in. sapphire and silicon wafers.

However, their low output saturation current ( I dsat ) remains a significant challenge. In this work, tunneling contact thin-film transistors (TC-TFTs) with a high-mobility indium tin oxide (InSnO) channel were fabricated, and the effect of oxygen partial pressure on their performance was systematically investigated. Compared to conventional InSnO transistors, InSnO TC-TFTs demonstrated a significant increase in intrinsic gain and a reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure during the sputtering of InSnO, the output current of the TC-TFTs was improved to a level comparable to that of conventional InSnO transistors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the output current's dependence on oxygen partial pressure is attributable to variations in Schottky barrier height, which are induced by changes in carrier concentration. These results demonstrate the potential for fabricating high-performance InSnO TC-TFTs that combine large saturation current, high intrinsic gain, and low power consumption.},

  abstract     = {The ultraviolet (UV) response of a floating-base 4H-SiC n–p–n phototransistor is characterized before and after 10 MeV electron irradiation. The pristine device demonstrates visible-blind UV detection at 275 nm, achieving a UV/dark current ratio of ∼10 6 , a specific detectivity of 1.37 × 10 12 Jones, and a responsivity of 1.36 A/W. Responsivity monotonically increases with incident optical power density. After 500 kGy irradiation, responsivity degrades by 80%, with dose dependence following a double-exponential decay. Vacuum annealing at 800 K restores 79% of the pre-irradiation optical gain, confirming a partial reversibility of irradiation-induced defects. Deep level transient spectroscopy reveals defect evolution post-annealing, identifying corresponding energy levels, identities, and annihilation dynamics. High-temperature annealing primarily annihilates irradiation-induced point defects, enabling significant recovery, while thermally stable defect complexes prevent full restoration.},

The nitrogen atoms of pyridine and hydrazine (-NH-NH 2 ) as active sites can effectively drive coordination with unsaturated Pb 2+ ions by Lewis acid–base interaction and anchor iodine-related defects by forming hydrogen bond. This synergistic defect passivation strategy reduced trap-state density and suppressed the defect-induced charge recombination loss. Consequently, the optimal 2-HP-modified CsPbI 3 devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.08%, corresponding to a 12% enhancement over their unmodified counterparts.

In this study, we engineered a minimized topological electronic structure with controllable gaps in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , through a synergistic strategy combining bulk antimony (Sb) doping and surface potassium (K) modification. Systematic investigations were performed using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 80 K. Bulk Sb doping effectively induces the formation of topological surface state gaps, with their magnitude dramatically increasing from 10 meV in Mn(Bi 0.95 Sb 0.05 ) 2 Te 4 to 103 meV in Mn(Bi 0.76 Sb 0.24 ) 2 Te 4 , while simultaneously reducing carrier concentration and shifting the Dirac point toward the Fermi level. Subsequent K surface modification induces a non-monotonic Fermi level shift, accompanied by a distinctive “closure-reopening” evolution of the topological surface state gap. We attribute this phenomenon to the transition of surface termination types induced by low-dose K modification and surface potential reconstruction caused by high-dose K deposition. This synergistic doping strategy establishes an effective pathway to achieve the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.},

In this study, we introduce fluorination of C 3 N as an innovative strategy to create a monolayer that features a quasiflat band near the Fermi level. The absorption energy, molecular dynamics simulations, and calculations of mechanical constants indicate that it is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable. Additionally, the orbital-projected energy band structure analysis shows that the quasiflat band predominantly arises from the unfluorinated carbon atoms. Further calculations reveal that its quasiflat band is partially occupied when spin freedom is disregarded. According to the Stoner criterion, spin splitting and ferromagnetism would be induced if spin freedom is considered. Subsequent calculations indicate that the spin-up channel hosts a nontrivial second-order topological phase with spin-polarized corner states existing in the zero-dimensional nanodisk. It is suggested that the spin-polarized quasiflat band can be effectively preserved around the Fermi level when placed on the h-BN monolayer. Taking into account the experimentally synthesized C 3 N and experimentally achievable fluorination for 2D materials, our work introduces a material for investigating the fascinating properties of flat bands and spin-polarized second-order topological states.},

It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet, established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.},

Throughput analysis of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and the possible magnetic configurations show that most of them look like 2D Ising ferromagnets, while Cr 3 TeF 7 is like an XY ferromagnet. Moreover, Cr 3 TeBr 7 is an ideal candidate to verify the Mermin–Wagner theorem due to its negligible MAE. More interestingly, three neighboring magnetic moments capped by a Te atom in Cr 3 TeCl 7 are ferromagnetically coupled with each other, and then these trimers will form an inverse in-plane triangular spin configuration at an angle of 120° with S eff = 9/2. For Cr 3 XY 7 , their flatbands show very weak dispersion, and the Dirac cones will open a gap due to the breaking anisotropy. However, van Hove singularities at M point still remain intact. In addition, Berry curvatures of single isolated Dirac bands show the opposite and identical symbols at K and K′ points for Cr 3 SCl 7 and Cr 3 XCl 7 (X = Se and Te), respectively, further indicating that they are very promising candidates for valleytronics.},

Improving their ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and photoelectric properties is essential for expanding their functional scope. In this work, we report the application of ultrathin self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for effective surface defect passivation in PZT film. By introducing [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) as a SAM on the surface of PZT films, both Pb 0 surface states and oxygen vacancy defects are efficiently passivated. As a result, the remanent polarization ( P r ) is enhanced from 26 to 31 μ C/cm 2 , while the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) increases significantly from 100–150 to 200–250 pm/V. Furthermore, the favorable energy level alignment between Me-4PACz and PZT contributes to improved polarization performance under illumination. These results underscore the potential of SAM-based strategies to enhance the functional performance of perovskite ferroelectric films and offer a promising route for integrating perovskite ferroelectric films into lightweight and portable electronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Local dipoles significantly influence the properties of paraelectric perovskites. Potassium tantalate niobate (KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 , abbreviated as KTN) is a perovskite with excellent electro-optic and piezoelectric properties. Manipulating dipoles via electric fields in paraelectric KTN demonstrates significant application potential. Therefore, such dipole dynamics under electric fields are essential to research. In this work, we investigated dipole reorientation under electric fields in paraelectric KTN crystals. We found that, under an electric field of 10 kV/cm, local polarization opposing the direction of the applied field still exists in the KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 ( T C = 13 °C) crystal. Additionally, a macroscopic piezoelectric coefficient of ∼40 pC/N was achieved in the paraelectric KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 crystal by applying a 12.5 kV/cm electric field for 24 h. This phenomenon is attributed to the maintainable field-induced reorientation state of the dipoles after the removal of the electric field. Furthermore, since complete dipole reorientation requires strong fields, in the case of a KTa 0.61 Nb 0.39 O 3 crystal with a T C (23 °C) approaching room temperature, a field-induced phase transition (at 2.1 kV/cm) occurs prior to the complete switching of dipoles in the paraelectric phase. This results in a multi-domain state in the recently phase-transformed crystal. Our findings help in understanding the performance exhibited under electric fields and can facilitate the optimization of paraelectric perovskites.},

  abstract     = {Polar domain boundaries in non-polar antiferroelectric crystals exhibit emergent tunable polarity, yet some fundamental questions remain to be answered—particularly the origin of the domain boundaries. Here, in antiferroelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 crystals, through temperature-dependent second-harmonic-generation microscopy and x-ray diffuse scattering, we reveal that the domain-wall characteristics change actively at temperatures more than 100 K lower than that of the antiferroelectric phase transition. This observation indicates that the previously considered domain wall can be a local object. Its occurrence is associated with the competition of polar and antipolar arrangements. These findings provide a better understanding of domain boundaries in antiferroelectrics and suggest a potential control strategy for engineering polar domain boundaries in non-polar crystals.},

The electron–phonon coupling constant is independent of the external magnetic field, while the spin–lattice dynamics are strongly influenced by the applied field. We demonstrate that the magnetic-field-induced modification of the spin–lattice interaction originates from a reduction in the magnetic entropy.

Currently, it is established that valley polarization in altermagnetism remains largely insensitive to spin–orbit coupling and spin. We select monolayer Cr 2 S 2 as a model altermagnetic system to investigate the mechanism through which an external field modulates valley polarization in altermagnetism. This effect arises from breaking the diagonal mirror symmetry M x y under uniaxial strain, which lifts the degeneracy of the X and Y valleys, inducing significant valley polarization. Crucially, biaxial strain preserves M x y symmetry and fails to induce polarization. Uniaxial strain simultaneously induces valley polarization and a nearly uniform Zeeman-like field in the reciprocal lattice space, reaching up to 118.39 T under 5% uniaxial strain. Moreover, the symmetry breaking in the monolayer Cr 2 S 2 leads to strong piezomagnetic effects, merging piezomagnetic and altermagnetic characteristics in two-dimensional materials.},

A synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer configuration has been proposed to enhance the robustness of these devices against external magnetic field disturbance. Here, we systematically investigate the stochastic properties of SAF-based s-MTJs, with a particular focus on their size dependence. We demonstrate that decreasing the junction size from approximately 100 nm to around 40 nm reduces the relaxation time. Importantly, smaller junctions show markedly enhanced robustness against external magnetic fields, achieving susceptibility values below 0.1 mT −1 for sizes under 80 nm. Furthermore, we observe that smaller junctions exhibit enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage, with sensitivity values of around 0.5 V −1 at device sizes of approximately 40 nm, which is 100 times lower than that of conventional s-MTJs. These quantitative results provide clear guidelines for designing robust and scalable s-MTJ devices, essential for advancing spintronic probabilistic computing toward practical implementation.},

Here, using first-principles calculations and spin dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the RuICl Janus structure exhibits a high Curie temperature (T c ) of 319 K, significant DMI, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and spontaneous polarization. Interestingly, as tensile strain is progressively applied, RuICl transforms from the initial PMA to in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which leads to the evolution of spin texture through a sequence of transitions, progressing from a single-domain state to stripe domains, followed by a mixed state of domain walls and skyrmions, and ultimately transitioning to in-plane stripe domains. Furthermore, the synergistic application of tensile strain and an external magnetic field effectively induces skyrmions states. Spin texture modulation strongly depends on the magnetic field orientation. In addition, tensile strain significantly modulates the vertical polarization in the Janus RuICl monolayer. Our findings highlight the potential of the RuICl monolayer as a promising candidate for spintronic devices based on topological spin textures.},

However, it remains challenging. In this study, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the spin-FET based on the altermagnetic monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 with spin–layer coupling can achieve perfect and controllable spin filtering depending on the transport direction. Notably, at zero gate voltage, the spin-FET exhibits a remarkable 100% spin-filtering efficiency (SFE) for spin-up and spin-down electrons along the [100] and [010] transport directions, respectively. Interestingly, due to the spin–layer coupling inherent in the monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 , the application of gate voltage can effectively modulate the SFE and improve the current in the [110] transport direction. Specifically, a positive (or negative) gate voltage enhances the SFE to 100% of spin-down (or spin-up) currents.

  abstract     = {Lead chalcogenides crystallizing in NaCl-type structure are known as excellent thermoelectric materials. Yet, they have suffered the long-standing issue of performance imbalance between n -type and p -type thermoelectric devices. In this work, we have explored a highly stable low-energy allotrope of those lead chalcogenides, namely rockseline phase. This phase is energetically close to the stable NaCl-type phase with a hull distance of only 50 meV/atom. It can be potentially realized by applying elevated pressure on an existing experimental phase. Compared with the NaCl-type structure containing solely octahedron units with an isotropic bonding network, the rockseline structure has alternatively stacked octahedron and triangular prism units, thus exhibiting the appealing feature of hierarchical bonds. This causes the lattice thermal conductivity in the rockseline structure being few times smaller than its NaCl-type counterpart, thanks to the softened phonon modes and concurrently enhanced anharmonicity. In addition, the rockseline structure favors superior electrical conductivity at n -type doping and an appealing valence band convergence feature, being beneficial for the pronounced Seebeck coefficient at p -type doping, causing balanced thermoelectric performances under different doping conditions. As an outstanding representative of the rockseline family, rockseline PbTe exhibits an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.8 W / ( m · K ) at room temperature and an excellent yet balanced figure of merit approaching 2 at both n -type and p -type doping and high temperatures. This work highlights the important role of crystal structure engineering in the design of thermoelectric materials with superior thermoelectric performances.},

  abstract     = {The ultrawide-bandgap gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) polymorphs have opened frontiers in high-power electronics and multifunctional devices. Among these, the orthorhombic phase (commonly referred to as κ-Ga 2 O 3 or ε-Ga 2 O 3 , hereafter denoted as ε-Ga 2 O 3 in this work) stands out with its exceptional spontaneous polarization and large piezoelectric coefficients, positioning it as a prime candidate for next-generation high-electron mobility transistors and radio frequency resonators. However, the epitaxial growth of high-quality ε-Ga 2 O 3 films remains challenging due to interfacial transition layers and limited crystallographic control. Herein, we demonstrate a pioneering Sn-assisted low-pressure mist chemical vapor deposition technique that enables the growth of single-phase ε-Ga 2 O 3 films on c-plane sapphire substrates with unprecedented crystalline quality. The resulting films exhibit a remarkably narrow x-ray diffraction rocking curve (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 0.08°) while achieving atomically smooth surfaces (root mean square, RMS roughness = 1.51 nm). Key innovations include the complete suppression of interfacial transition layers through Sn-mediated nucleation and the realization of true layer-by-layer growth under optimized low-pressure conditions. This synergistic approach combines the inherent cost-effectiveness of Mist-CVD with enhanced crystallographic precision, establishing a viable pathway for industrial-scale production of ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based quantum well devices and polarization-engineered heterostructures.},

By applying a moderate negative gate bias (−5 V) over a temperature range of 25–150 °C, we analyze the charge-trapping/detrapping dynamics at the Fin sidewall and dielectric interfaces. Activation energy (E a ) of 0.74 eV confirms the temperature-dependent nature of the trapping mechanisms. Furthermore, partial V TH recovery after stress removal highlights the presence of deep-level sidewall traps with a slow detrapping process. Additionally, by extrapolating time-dependent gate dielectric breakdown (TDDB) data across high-temperature stress conditions, the device demonstrates a 10-year lifetime at 150 °C under an operating voltage of approximately 8.22 V. Furthermore, the extracted E a ranging from 0.59 to 0.63 eV confirms the presence of deep-level traps within the AlGaN barrier layer, which contributes to the electron trapping during degradation, leading to the point-level defect generation, ultimately driving TDDB.},

Two electron emission signals have been detected in DLTS spectra of all Al x Ga 1− x N samples and the activation energy for electron emission relative to the conduction band edge ( E C ) from the first level shifts from E C –0.25 to E C –0.34 eV and that for the second level shifts from E C –0.6 to E C –0.68 eV upon changes of x from 0 to 0.063. In the L-DLTS spectra of the Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N samples, the electron emission signals associated with the E C –0.34 eV donor and E C –0.68 eV acceptor levels split into individual components due to aluminum fluctuations in the nearest neighbor (NN) shells. The splitting patterns are nearly identical for both signals and the ratios of peak magnitudes are consistent with calculated probabilities of finding a given number of aluminum atoms in the second NN shell around a Ga lattice site. These findings provide strong evidence that the E C –0.34 and E C –0.68 eV trap states in Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N are related to point defects in the Ga sub-lattice. Finally, a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defect levels in GaN and Al x Ga 1−x N using first-principles calculations suggests that the E C –(0.25–0.34) eV electron trap in Al x Ga 1− x N (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.063) is most likely related to carbon or molybdenum donor states, specifically, C Ga (0/+) or Mo Ga (0/+).},

This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of lattice-matched single- and multichannel AlScN/GaN heterostructures. A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forms at the AlScN–GaN interface with a lattice-matched AlScN barrier as thin as 2.5 nm and increases with AlScN thickness, exceeding 2.5 × 10 13 /cm 2 for a 10 nm barrier. Stacking of lattice-matched AlScN/GaN multilayers produces parallel 2DEGs whose total density scales linearly with the number of AlScN/GaN periods, reaching 1 × 10 14 /cm 2 for five-period structures, with moderate average electron mobility of 583 cm 2 /V.s and sheet resistance of 106 Ω / □ at 300 K. Structural analyses reveal that coherently strained epilayers with sub-nm surface roughness were achieved. The electron mobility in the lattice-matched AlScN/GaN single- and multichannel heterostructures is limited by alloy disorder and interface roughness scattering. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements confirm the presence of multiple conducting 2D carrier sheets with less than 15% carrier freeze out, carrier mobility of 851 cm 2 /V.s, and sheet resistance of 78 Ω / □ at 10 K.

  abstract     = {This work demonstrates an in situ etching technique for β-Ga 2 O 3 using solid-source metallic gallium (Ga) in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on ( ⁠ 2 ¯ 01) β-Ga 2 O 3 films and patterned (010) β-Ga 2 O 3 substrates as a function of temperature (1000–1100 °C), Ar carrier gas flow (80–400 sccm) and Ga source-to-substrate distance (1–5 cm). The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of ∼2.25 µm/h on (010) substrates at 1050 °C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding. Collectively, these findings establish LPCVD-based in situ etching as a scalable, damage-free, and orientation-selective technique for fabricating high-aspect-ratio β-Ga 2 O 3 3D structures in next-generation power devices.},

However, the conductance states relaxation effect substantially narrows the operational window, thereby exacerbating the occurrence of data storage errors. This study investigates the relaxation characteristics of the high-resistance state collected from a 2 Kb RRAM array which was fabricated in 28 nm commercial foundry. Three distinct drift behaviors of the RRAM resistance states were observed: (1) transient conductance drift, (2) stair-stepping conductance drift, and (3) reversible conductance drift. A programming strategy based on electron release was proposed to identify unstable devices efficiently. The amplitude and width modulation of the release pulse reveals that amplitude modulation has a more significant effect due to a certain barrier height for trapped electrons to be released. A physical model based on the trap-assisted tunneling mechanism is proposed to fit the cumulative distribution function of unstable bits under different pulse amplitudes and widths. Compared to existing long pulse and delay verify programming strategies, the release verify method significantly reduces the impact of RRAM relaxation while maintaining programming efficiency.},

In this work, the thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ l ⁠ ) of the BiOCl monolayer was studied using first-principles calculations and the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, in which four-phonon scattering processes are explicitly considered. Our results indicate that the predicted κ l is reduced from 7.1 to 5.2 W/(mK) after including four-phonon scattering (a 27% reduction). When introducing a tensile strain of 3%, the room temperature κ l can be further reduced by 77% as compared to that of the strain-free case. Such a huge reduction primarily arises from the flattening transverse acoustic branch and the densified low-frequency phonons in the strained BiOCl monolayer, which enables qualitative changes in the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering: from three-phonon scattering to four-phonon scattering. These findings provide deeper insights into the thermal transport behavior of the BiOCl monolayer and underscore the significant potential of strain engineering as a power tool to tailor high-order anharmonic effects for symmetry-breaking 2D materials.},

Two trap states were observed consistently and uniformly, with their trapping parameters quantified. Consistent with the high performance of these 1.55 μ m photodetectors, total trap concentrations were very low, in the order of 10 12 cm −3 . The activation energies of the two detected states were found to be E C - 0.21 eV and E C - 0.40 eV. The near mid-gap position of the E C - 0.40 eV state implies a role as an efficient recombination-generation center and could be an important lifetime-limiting defect for MBE-grown GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 . A comparison was made with an inferior performing GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodiode. DLTS measurements revealed the same defect states and spectra, implying that the sources of these defects are the same. However, trap concentrations were found to be substantially higher for the poorer-performing device. This correlation was further supported by comparing the minority carrier lifetimes of the two samples, measured using transient microwave reflectance (TMR). A significantly lower minority carrier lifetime was extracted for the lower performance device, consistent with higher trap concentrations. It was suggested that the near mid-gap trap detected at E C - 0.40 eV could be an important contributor to limiting the minority carrier lifetime within 1.55 μ m GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodetectors grown by MBE.},

  abstract     = {A wideband three-dimensional (3D) electromagnetic absorber with a large incidence angle is designed and experimentally investigated using a design methodology that integrates resistive frequency selective surfaces (RFSS) with three-dimensional metastructures (3D MS). The RFSS acts as a strong absorption layer, while dual 3D MSs (3D MS-I/II) with low loss characteristics synergistically broaden absorption bandwidth. Multi-interface exploitation optimizes angular stability, featuring resistive patch integration in 3D MS-II for compensation absorption under TE polarization and strategically positioned vertical metal patches in 3D MS-I extending the propagation distance of electromagnetic waves in 3D MS-I under TM polarization. Benefiting from the hybrid absorbing mechanism, the proposed absorbing material demonstrates over 90% absorptivity from 6.3 to 27.2 GHz with angular stability below 60°, covering full X/Ku bands (−20 dB bandwidth). Notably, 80% wideband absorption persists even at 70° oblique incidence.},

The absorber adopts a three-layer structure, consisting of patterned indium tin oxide–polyethylene terephthalate conductive layers on the top and bottom, with a polyvinyl chloride dielectric layer in between. Through a genetic algorithm to assist in structural design and parameter optimization, the absorber simultaneously achieves ohmic loss and electromagnetic resonance effects, ensuring efficient dissipation of incident electromagnetic waves within the absorbing structure. Experimental results demonstrate that the absorber achieves over 90% absorption in the 50–70 GHz wide frequency band, with absorption exceeding 99% in the 50.8–67.2 GHz frequency range, under normal incidence. Notably, the absorber maintains over 90% absorption efficiency within a wide incident angle range of 0°–30°. These structural and absorption characteristics endow it with excellent performance in shielding electromagnetic interference. Moreover, its transparency and flexibility make it applicable to applications such as automotive glass and radomes.},

The emitter on stainless steel achieves an outstanding continuous emission density of 125 mA cm −2 and a pulse emission up to 750 mA cm −2 . In addition, the arrayed CNT/MXene emitter on structured polydimethylsiloxane displays a current density of 73.9 mA cm −2 at a low field of 2.5 V µm −1 , as well as good stability for 13.8 h. Meanwhile, the CNT/MXene emitter could operate when powered by a triboelectric nanogenerator, and the result indicates that CNT/MXene emitter can be used as a generator for producing plasma in air.

However, the growth of atomically flat polar oxide MgO films with arbitrary thickness has been hindered by polarity issues. In this study, we analyze the interfacial structure and band alignment of MgO (111) thin films deposited on 6h-SiC (0001) by the molecular beam epitaxy method. An epitaxial growth of the MgO (111) thin film on SiC is demonstrated. We show that the interface is O-terminated by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The insulating characteristics are preserved in the vicinity of the interface according to electronic structure calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the valence band offset is approximately 1.6 eV. Electronic structure calculations for a realistic model constructed using the atomically resolved electron microscopy images show an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured valence band offsets, further confirming the validity of the developed atomic interface model. These findings pave the way for further advancements in MgO-based electronic devices, considering the ability to tailor the interface atomic structure, which could be employed to engineer the overall electronic properties at the interface, including the valence band offset.},

Post-growth vacuum annealing and growth pressure were used to control film orientations, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Films grown with diffusion planes oriented in-plane had oxygen-rich, perovskite-like nanodomains spread throughout the film, and fabricated devices exhibited worse switching consistency and more stochasticity. In contrast, films grown with diffusion planes oriented out-of-plane had a more uniform oxygen-rich perovskite interfacial layer above the bottom electrode, and devices built from this film orientation showed significant statistical improvements in switching voltages and cycling consistency.},

For samples without the AlN interlayer, the defects in the GaN channel layer near the heterointerface were induced by the strain from the Al 1−x Ga x N barrier depending on the AlN mol fraction. The density of strain-induced defects was markedly increased near the conduction band minimum to 1 × 10 18 cm −3 peaked at a depth of ∼10 nm from the heterointerface for the Al 0.24 Ga 0.76 N/GaN sample. The AlN interlayer was confirmed to suppress the formation of strain-induced defects. The carrier mobility evaluated by magneto transport measurements was also improved clearly in samples with the AlN layer because of the reduction in the density of strain-induced defects leading to remote 2DEG scattering. We have clarified the correlation between the density of strain-induced defects and the 2DEG mobility for a comprehensive understanding of the carrier transport in strained heterostructures.},

In our experiments, femtosecond second harmonic generation (SHG) signals were temporally broadened to the nanosecond scale through an absorption-and-remission process facilitated by a highly efficient quantum dot material positioned in front of a photomultiplier tube. This process yielded a 77% increase in SHG SI, along with improved image quality. Furthermore, the enhancement in both SI and SBR was consistently observed throughout the full imaging depth of three-dimensional collagen fiber samples. This method not only boosts signal strength and SBR simultaneously but also reduces the risk of photodamage and enables faster imaging. Owing to its simplicity, compatibility with other intensity-enhancing techniques, and ease of integration, the proposed time-stretching strategy holds significant potential for advancing both fundamental research and industrial applications in NLM.},

This is in contrast to conventional vertical-field optoelectronic tweezers (VOETs). The impedance mismatch effects that cause issues for VOETs are shown to be absent in LOETs as the medium impedance appears as an element parallel to the photoconductor impedance instead of being in series. Results from the model are found to be in good agreement with electric field results obtained from full-wave numerical solvers. Demonstrating that LOETs do not suffer from the same impedance constraints as VOETs enables a broader range of suspension media and applications to be explored.},

  abstract     = {Collimating high-current-density sheet electron beams using external magnetic fields presents significant challenges, particularly due to complications such as diocotron instability. To address these issues, we introduce a non-magnetic, plasma-assisted planar collimator in this Letter. In this study, a plasma-assisted planar collimator was developed, and its performance was analyzed by utilizing a pulsed electron beam source to propagate a transient sheet electron beam through it for 50 ns duration. A collimated beam of dimensions 7.1 mm × 0.75 mm was captured near the collimating region, exhibiting notable compression along the beam height compared to its width. This uneven compression highlights the need for a detailed understanding of particle dynamics within the collimator. However, experimental diagnostics using traditional probes inside a planar collimator are constrained due to spatial limitations. To overcome this, a 3D Particle-In-Cell simulation study was conducted using VSim Multiphysics to model the interaction of the electron beam with neutral gas, resulting in impact ionization within the collimator. The simulation results reveal the role of the temporal and spatial ionization profiles that drive beam compression and shaping. A good correlation of compression factor between experimental and simulated results was observed, with the simulated beam size measuring 6.75 mm × 0.65 mm. This work offers valuable insights into the design of collimators for high-current-density sheet electron beams, with applications in high-power, compact microwave and THz sources.},

A 1-kJ, 15-ps laser at a center wavelength of 1053 nm irradiated the back plate of the capacitor with an intensity of ∼8.3 × 10 18 W/cm 2 , creating ultra large currents in the connecting coils. High-quality proton data obtained in the axial probing geometry show definitive signatures of magnetic field generation, allowing precision measurement of the field distribution and strength. The data show a coil current of 120 ± 10 kA producing 200 ± 20 Tesla magnetic fields at the coil center at 1.127 ns after the laser drive. This sets a record for magnetic field generation by the short-pulse-powered capacitor-coil targets.},

  abstract     = {Quantum illumination (QI) is implemented by a joint measurement between the idler field and the signal field reflected from the low-reflectivity stationary target in a noisy environment. The joint measurement is possible only with prior knowledge of the target's location, which is unknown in many cases. The technique described in this article overcomes this limitation by using optical entanglement and quantum cross-correlated homodyne measurement. This technique offers the following additional advantages in comparison with QI implementation through joint measurement: (1) quantum storage and prior knowledge about the target's distance are not required, (2) it adds ranging capability, and (3) it adds anti-stealth mechanism to suppress the low-reflectivity of the target. As the detection is at optical frequencies, the environment is considered as a stray laser, which could be a decoy, a jamming field, a probe field from another ranging application, or a field used to mask the actual probe. Thus, the environment considered in this Letter is suitable for ranging applications like lidar.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of aqueous polymer-based supercapacitors is significantly hampered by issues such as limited operating potential windows and low energy density. To address these challenges, this study introduces a straightforward and rapid approach involving the incorporation of an active metal, copper (Cu), into a conductive polymer matrix, poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor configuration (CP//AC). This strategy aims to broaden the potential window of individual cells within aqueous electrolytes, thereby enhancing energy density. The synthesized polymer composite (CP) features a layered nanoflake morphology that facilitates conduction pathways, substantially boosting electron transfer and ion mobility rates. Notably, the CP electrode (CP-2) achieves a specific capacity of 935 mAh g −1 at 3 A g −1 and demonstrates cycling stability with negligible capacity loss over 10 000 cycles at 20 A g −1 in a three-electrode system, corresponding to a maximum power density of 8249 W kg −1 and energy density of 189 Wh kg −1 . Upon fabrication of a flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor using CP-2//AC, an 80.3% capacity retention is observed after 1500 charge–discharge cycles at 15 A g −1 . This research highlights the potential of polymeric materials for energy storage and demonstrates their feasibility in flexible aqueous supercapacitor technologies.},

This work proposes a Ca/Cu/Ti co-doping strategy and systematically regulates the crystal phase among 24 types of layered oxides, from P2-, mixed P2/O3- to O3-type phase, by precisely controlling the Na content and adjusting the transition metal layer microenvironment. The optimum O3-type Na 0.80 Ca 0.06 Ni 0.48 Mn 0.40 Cu 0.06 Ti 0.06 O 2 delivers a high initial capacity of 151.37 mAh g −1 at 1 C (120 mA g −1 ) with 102.56 mAh g −1 retained after 200 cycles, while maintaining 80.67% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that an optimal Ca/Cu/Ti doping improves the Na + diffusion kinetics, where Na vacancies activate Cu/Ni redox activity to sustain capacity under Na + -deficient conditions, and effectively suppresses Mn activity, thereby simultaneously enhancing the cycling stability of cathodes. This work provides a wide range of component-phase regulation, achieving highly stable Na-deficient O3-type layered oxides through a multi-cation trace doping strategy for SIBs.},

  abstract     = {Fluorite-structured antiferroelectric (AFE) dielectric capacitors have emerged as promising candidates in energy storage applications. The AFE behaviors of dielectrics generally stem from an electric field-induced phase transition. Thus, the initial phase composition in the AFE film plays an important role in determining the performance of energy storage. This work systematically investigates the impact of oxygen plasma pulse time (OPPT) on the AFE properties of atomic-layer-deposited ZrO 2 films. As the OPPT increases from 3 to 5 s, the as-deposited ZrO 2 film changes from an amorphous to polycrystalline state. The ratio of cubic/tetragonal phase (C/T) in the polycrystalline ZrO 2 film gradually rises with increasing the OPPT from 5 to 15 s, accompanied by a gradual decrease in defect oxygen. To improve the performance of the as-deposited ZrO 2 capacitors, post-annealing is performed at 450 °C for 30 min in the forming gas. It is found that the post-annealing increases the concentration of the T phase in the ZrO 2 films, which reduces gradually with prolonging the OPPT. For the amorphous as-deposited ZrO 2 film under an OPPT of 3 s, the post-annealing generates the largest maximum polarization ( P max ) and energy storage density, corresponding to 19.7 μ C/cm 2 and 34.7 J/cm 3 , respectively. The results indicate that the AFE properties of the ZrO 2 film are determined by the T phase content, which can be modulated by the oxygen plasma dosing duration and post-annealing. Our findings provide a different perspective for improving the energy storage performance of AFE capacitors.},

Here, we introduce a PEDOT:PSS/NiO x bilayer hole transport layer (HTL) that optimizes energy-level alignment, achieving a threefold enhanced hole extraction rate ( k H = 1.17 × 10 8 s −1 ). Comprehensive microscopic analyses reveal that the optimized bilayer HTL effectively reduces localized charge accumulation, kinetically suppressing ion migration and phase separation. Consequently, the perovskite film retains compositional homogeneity under prolonged illumination, substantially enhancing both photovoltaic performance and operational stability.

However, obtaining excellent morphology of the active layer is an important challenge for achieving efficient all-PSCs. In this work, a ternary-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy is used to optimize the morphology of all-PSCs. The polymers PM6, PM1, and PY-IT are selected as host donor, guest donor, and acceptor to fabricate a series of LbL all-PSCs, respectively. The high compatibility between PM6 and PM1 promotes the formation of an alloy state within the active layer, which enhances molecular arrangement orderliness and crystallinity, and vertical structural phase distribution. The ternary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6:PM1/PY-IT exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.10% and better stability compared to the binary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6/PY-IT with a PCE of 16.96%. The optimized ternary LbL all-PSCs retain over 82% of their initial PCE after 790 h of storage in a glovebox. This research demonstrates that the effective combination of dual-donor ternary strategy and the LbL strategy provides a feasible route for achieving high-performance all-PSCs through regulating the morphology of the active layer.},

Critical to their advancement is the engineering of carrier-selective contacts that minimize interfacial losses. Here, we demonstrate a carbazole-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM), [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz), as an efficient electron-selective layer in [poly(3,4 ethylenedi oxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)]/Si solar cells. The Me-4PACz SAM introduces a directional dipole moment at the c-Si/Al interface, generating a built-in electric field that enhances electron extraction. This interface modification leads to a linear Ohmic contact, reducing the contact resistivity between n-Si and the metal electrode interface to 4.12 mΩ cm 2 . Consequently, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.75% with a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 651 mV and fill factor of 78.03%, representing a ∼14% relative PCE improvement over the control device (PCE = 14.75%).

  abstract     = {We report a method of engineering a reversible change in interlayer bonding between layers of exfoliated thin films of MoS 2 by means of hydrogen intercalation through forming gas annealing. Interlayer bonding strength is probed through the behavior of MoS 2 under process-induced strain engineering, where two-dimensional (2D) flakes are encapsulated with a deposited stressed thin film layer to transfer strain into the underlying 2D materials. It is shown that after forming gas annealing, the depth of the strain transferred into multilayer MoS 2 is enhanced as determined through layer-thickness-dependent Raman spectroscopic mapping. This change represents a transition from a 2D van der Waals-bonded material in the as-exfoliated samples to a more three-dimensional (3D)-bonded system in the annealed samples. We demonstrate the reversibility of this effect by means of vacuum annealing of previously forming gas annealed samples. The process of forming gas annealing itself also imparts strain into MoS 2 due to a combination of 2D-to-3D bonding transition with differential thermal mismatch between the MoS 2 and the substrate. These strains are shown to be retained after the vacuum annealing process, despite the transition back to 2D bonding. Since forming gas annealing is a common technical process in engineering 2D electronic devices, these results represent an important consideration in understanding non-intentionally applied strains due to changes in the mechanical properties of 2D materials.},

To overcome these challenges, we develop NanoGap, a piezoelectric-driven strain platform that achieves full compatibility with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques while enabling continuous strain in multilayer vdW crystals. Applying this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride flakes (20–50 nm thickness), we achieve 1.2% uniaxial tensile strain, as quantified through in situ atomic force microscopy measurements. Moreover, our strain-SPM integration reveals the direct correlation between progressive lattice deformation and phonon polariton dispersion alterations, as demonstrated through photo-induced force microscopy.

Under the deep UV light with 29.38 μ W/cm 2 irradiation at 228 nm, the photo-to-dark current ratio ( PDCR ), responsivity ( R ), detectivity ( D * ), response speed, and UV-visible rejection ratio ( R peak / R 400 nm ) were as high as 2.37 × 10 6 , 15.15 A/W, 2.35 × 10 13 Jones, 0.20/0.21 s, and 2.46 × 10 6 , respectively. In addition, the PD based on H 2 -annealed ZnGa 2 O 4 still exhibits a high PDCR of ∼10 3 under extremely minimal light intensity irradiation. This PD can sensitively record a brief “FJ” image generated by deep UV light. This work provides a feasible method for the construction of high-performance optoelectronic devices and systems based on amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 .},

  abstract     = {In order to address the issue of the substantial contact resistance commonly encountered at the metal and two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, an approach involving the reduction of Schottky barrier width by electron beam-induced defects has been demonstrated. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) field-effect transistors (FETs) demonstrate notable enhancements in their performance after electron beam irradiation (EBI) of the contact regions. Systematic studies revealed an optimal relationship between EBI dose and MoS 2 layer thickness, with field-effect mobility ( μ EF ) as a key metric. Under an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and an irradiation dose of 600 µC/cm 2 , 7 nm thick MoS 2 FETs achieved a μ FE exceeding 150 cm 2 /V s, representing a tenfold improvement over untreated devices, while contact resistance decreased significantly to 1.4 kΩ µm, an order of magnitude reduction. The observed performance improvement is attributed to EBI-induced sulfur vacancies, which narrow the Schottky barrier width by approximately 45% and enhance electron injection efficiency. The results highlight that EBI-induced defect engineering is a promising method for optimizing electrical performance in 2D-based FETs.},

However, due to the large thermal expansion coefficient difference between perovskite and inorganic substrate, such heterostructure faces the challenge of thermal stress induced mechanical instability. This problem will be extremely severe for the thick perovskite film for radiation detection because the thermal strain energy accumulates with film thickness. Here, first by theoretical analysis, we quantized the thermal stress instability and found that a temperature variation of only 20 °C around room temperature will suffice to delaminate a 100 µm thick perovskite film from the substrate, which prediction agrees with experiments. We then proposed to promote the heterostructure's mechanical stability by increasing the perovskite nucleation rate on inorganic substrate to enhance the interface adhesive energy. Based on a sacrificial seeding layer, we realized stable interface between the thick perovskite film and the typical inorganic substrate, including indium tin oxide, silicon, and gallium nitride that can withstand at least 100 cycles of temperature variation between 25 and 150 °C and then fabricated high performance radiation detectors based on such heterostructures.},

This study reveals that the addition of Al 3+ can concurrently augment both the luminescence and photosensitization abilities of glutathione-protected gold nanoclusters. Time-resolved spectroscopic investigations indicate that Al 3+ induces intermolecular aggregation of gold nanoclusters, thereby promoting the radiative transition of the excited triplet state and enhancing the energy transfer efficiency to molecular oxygen.

  abstract     = {Lead-free Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 perovskite memristors have emerged as promising candidates for nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing due to their environmental friendliness and stability. However, their practical applications are hindered by severe endurance degradation during repetitive resistive switching (RS) cycles, attributed to incomplete RESET of conductive filaments (CFs) at grain boundaries (GBs). Herein, we systematically investigate this degradation mechanism and propose two innovative strategies to enhance device endurance: (1) grain engineering via thermal annealing to reduce GB density and (2) GB passivation using polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives. By optimizing annealing temperatures (100–250 °C), Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 films exhibit progressively larger grain sizes (158.6–295.2 nm), which delays high resistance state degradation by minimizing CF nucleation sites. However, residual GBs still permit partial Ag accumulation. To address this, PEG incorporation chemically passivates GBs, effectively blocking ion migration and trapping. The optimized PEG-passivated Ag/Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 :PEG/ITO memristor achieves remarkable improvements: endurance is extended from 100 to 1000 cycles, and the switching window expands from 6 to 176 times. Furthermore, the optimized device demonstrates continuous conductance modulation for multilevel storage and synaptic function emulation, enabling a 784–100–10 fully connected neural network to achieve 92.2% recognition accuracy on the MNIST dataset after 100 training epochs. This study elucidates the GB-mediated degradation mechanism and demonstrates that combining grain size optimization with GB passivation provides a universal framework for high-performance RS devices in neuromorphic computing and nonvolatile memory.},

In this work, we report a transistor featuring a MoS 2 /graphite heterojunction with a platinum (Pt) bottom source and a mechanically transferred graphite top drain electrode. This architecture preserves the structural integrity of MoS 2 while optimizing interfacial properties. The device, fabricated via pre-patterned Pt deposition and sequential dry transfer of MoS 2 and graphite, exhibits exceptional performance metrics: a rectification ratio exceeding 10 6 , an ideality factor of ∼1.47, and a switching ratio of about 6 × 10 6 at room temperature. Energy band analysis reveals that rectification originates from asymmetric Schottky barriers at the MoS 2 /electrode interfaces, where negative drain–source bias enables carrier conduction, while positive bias blocks current via channel depletion. We demonstrate that Pt electrodes outperform Ag counterparts due to strategically engineered potential barriers that suppress electron leakage. Dynamic rectification measurements confirm reliability under switching cycles, enabling dual-mode functionality as a reconfigurable AND logic gate and an optoelectronic ternary-state output unit. This work establishes a scalable framework for high-frequency, energy-efficient nanoelectronics, effectively bridging the gap between the theoretical promise of 2D materials and their multifunctional practical applications.},

We use niobium (Nb) resonators as a test platform, leveraging their well-characterized performance metrics for benchmarking. To address IBE-induced surface redeposition, we introduce an in situ aluminum capping layer combined with targeted post-fabrication chemical treatment. This strategy yields resonators with internal quality factors as high as 6 × 10 5 in the single-photon regime at 50 mK. These results establish low-energy IBE as a promising patterning technique for superconducting devices, with the potential to accelerate development across chemically diverse and multilayered material platforms.},

However, the small anomalous Hall conductivity of Mn 3 Ga makes it lack competitiveness. In this paper, c axis oriented Mn 3 Ga thin films with D0 19 hexagonal structure were prepared by optimizing the MgO(111) substrate temperature. Large anomalous Hall resistivity up to 1.53 μ Ω cm at 300 K is observed for (0002) oriented Mn 3 Ga film grown at 450 °C, corresponding to a Hall conductivity of about 30 Ω −1 cm −1 .

While the threshold current scales linearly with magnetic damping at a fixed OOP field, a distinct non-monotonic behavior emerges with varying OOP field strength, giving rise to a tunable current–field minimum. This phenomenon is consistently observed across constriction widths ranging from 20 to 150 nm and is particularly pronounced in narrower constrictions. As the OOP angle decreases, the current–field minimum shifts toward lower field values, reflecting changes in spin-wave localization and spin-transfer torque efficiency. Analysis with an extended macrospin model reveals that the observed behavior results from transitions between distinct spin-wave localization regimes, each associated with varying degrees of radiation losses, driven by geometry-induced demagnetizing fields under different OOP field strengths. These findings provide key insight into the complex auto-oscillation dynamics of nano-constriction SHNOs and establish a strategic pathway to optimize current–field conditions, paving the way for energy-efficient and scalable SHNO networks in neuromorphic and unconventional computing applications.},

This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal–semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain.

Despite the demonstrable efficacy of machine learning in addressing such issues, existing strategies remain constrained to specific material categories, exhibiting limited generalizability across diverse systems. Herein, we propose a multi-model ensemble framework that overcomes the limitations of the conventional single-model paradigm in NiMnFeCoBP high-entropy-amorphous-alloys. The integration of complementary methodologies has yielded a 9%–13% increase in prediction accuracy when utilizing an ensemble model compared with single models. This adaptive strategy effectively resolves the accuracy-generality trade-off dilemma in materials informatics by leveraging the collective strengths of multiple predictive models.},

Among them, CaSnO 3 possesses the widest bandgap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO 3 across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ∼ 10 20 cm −3 , the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO 3 , establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.},

The spring-shaped architecture is rationally designed to enhance axial compliance and mechanical resilience, significantly outperforming straight SiNWs under airflow-induced strain, as validated by finite element simulations and mechanical testing. The sensor demonstrates a rapid response time of 80 ms and a linear electrical output in response to gentle airflow ranging from 0.5 to 3 m/s under bending conditions.

In this study, we investigate the temporal coherence properties of excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) using interferometric Fourier spectroscopy. We reveal a coherence time of approximately 24 ps and a homogeneous linewidth of 0.017 nm (55 μ eV) at 4.7 K under non-resonant two-photon excitation. We also analyze the impact of relaxation, scattering, and the experimental setup on the decrease in coherence time. The 1S orthoexciton shows robust photoluminescence intensity and negligible spectral diffusion over 120 min. These results suggest that Cu 2 O presents itself as an exceptional material for generating indistinguishable single photons, demonstrating considerable potential for advanced applications in quantum photonics.},

  abstract     = {Chemically robust III-nitrides (III-N) with bandgaps in the visible spectral range are critical for advancing emerging technologies such as solar-driven photocatalysis and optoelectronics. Conventional methods for bandgap reduction of GaN, such as increasing indium content in InGaN alloys, are limited by lattice mismatch strain-induced defects that compromise device performance. Incorporating small number of anions like arsenic (As) or antimony (Sb) offers an alternative through significant band bowing in GaN; however, achieving high visible emission efficiency remains challenging for in situ epitaxial incorporation due to thermodynamic barriers of limited solubility. This study demonstrates high-temperature (550 and 1000 °C) ion implantation as an effective strategy to tailor the spectral response of various GaN semiconductor structures into the visible range, achieving bright room-temperature photoluminescence at ∼485 and ∼550 nm for As- and Sb-related emissions, respectively. Notably, the implanted impurity concentration is only at the ∼1 × 10 19 cm −3 level and localized at a depth of ∼30 nm below the surface. Based on density functional theory calculations, the observed As-related emission arises from a combined effect of valence band edge shifting by As replacing N isoelectronically and an Arsenic interstitial (As i 3+ ) defect level formation. The Sb-related emission was attributed only to the substitutional Sb in N site (Sb N 0 ) related band energy shift, as previously reported for epitaxial incorporation. This work establishes high-temperature ion implantation as a viable technique to enable effective concurrent impurity activation and crystal damage repair, opening pathways for deep-level defect and bandgap engineering in GaN for energy conversion and photonic and quantum applications.},

To address this challenge, we employ swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation—516 MeV Xe ions—on Pt/SrTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 devices, introducing controlled ion track defects that guide filament formation. The irradiated memristors demonstrate remarkable performance improvements, achieving a lower SET voltage of 0.65 V (compared to 0.85 V for unirradiated devices), extended retention (>10 6 s vs <10 5 s), and superior stability (σ/μ = 0.06/0.06 vs 0.14/0.04). Moreover, these devices reliably emulate synaptic plasticity with minimal cycle-to-cycle variations (<7.2%), enabling high-fidelity neuromorphic applications. When deployed in simulated neural networks for handwritten digit recognition, the irradiated memristors attain a recognition accuracy of 91.6%, showcasing their robustness in real-time computing tasks.

Unlike conventional TMDs, Janus TMDs lack mirror symmetry and exhibit a built-in in-plane dipole due to their asymmetric atomic configuration. A larger electronegativity gradient across the Janus TMDs leads to enhanced charge redistribution at the vdWH interface and a stronger in-plane dipole, resulting in unusual Fermi-level pinning (FLP). The calculated pinning factors for 1T-TMDs/MoSTe and 1T-TMDs/WSTe vdWHs are particularly low, reflecting a strong FLP effect. Despite the wide variation in work functions among the 1T-TMDs, their Fermi levels are consistently pinned near the band edges of MoSTe and WSTe, enabling quasi-Ohmic or Ohmic p -type and n -type contacts. Furthermore, the vdWHs exhibit low tunneling-specific resistivity, confirming their potential for ultra-low contact resistance applications in next-generation single-layer transistors.},

The integration of the narrow-bandgap VO 2 film with the wide-bandgap SiC creates a Z-type heterojunction, which significantly enhances photocurrent due to the built-in electric field at the interface. Furthermore, a notable increase in photocurrent is achieved by the deposition of gold nanoparticles on the device's surface.

This study reveals the atomic-scale dynamics of phase transitions induced by ion migration in mixed halide perovskites CsPbBrCl 2 using an integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscope. Unlike pure perovskites, the orthorhombic-to-cubic transition in mixed halide perovskites involves octahedral distortions and halogen migration. This ion migration facilitates a uniform halogen distribution within the structure, correcting the initially uneven arrangement. The dynamics of octahedral distortions are also examined, with accurate changes in Pb-X bond lengths and distortion angles identified throughout the transition. This cubic phase helps suppress ion migration, as supported by first-principles calculations.

  abstract     = {The in situ exsolution process for metallic Co is crucial for developing low-cost and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on perovskite materials. However, traditional exsolution methods normally require working in a hydrogen-reducing atmosphere. To address these limitations, by introducing nanodiamond (ND) into La 0.7 Sr 0.2 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3 (LSFC), Co nanoparticles (NPs) were exsolved on the surface after thermal treatment. Owing to the unique sp 2 /sp 3 hybrid structure of ND, the electron transfer at high temperature enhances the electron density on the ND surface, creating a reducing environment for the exsolution of Co NPs. The electrocatalyst exhibits significantly reduced overpotentials (265 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 327 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ), a small Tafel slope of 52.14 mV dec −1 , and good stability (88.9% of initial current density after a chronoamperometric durability test). This enhancement primarily results from the exsolution of Co NPs, which increases the number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations explain the role of ND in improving OER performance. This approach holds great promise for innovating various energy storage and conversion technologies.},

Here, we realize the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of high-quality EuSe thin films on SrTiO 3 (001) and bilayer graphene (BLG) substrates. The EuSe grown on SrTiO 3 substrate forms an out-of-plane (001) facet single-crystalline film, with the in-plane orientation EuSe〈110〉 direction paralleled to the SrTiO 3 〈100〉 direction. In contrast, the EuSe film grown on the BLG substrate has various in-plane rotational domains. The electronic band structures of the EuSe films are experimentally characterized by in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, showing a semiconductive nature with the Eu 4 f band as the top of the valence band. The bandgap size of EuSe grown on BLG is further determined as about 2.8 eV via low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The MBE growth and the electronic structure characterizations of the EuSe thin films would promote further research and applications on the half-filled 4f electrons of rare-earth Eu-based compounds.},

The regulation of contact resistance by process control enables significant variance of both breakdown current density and structural characteristics. The ZrTe 3 interconnects fabricated with a conventional photolithography process show high contact resistance, low breakdown current density, and electromigration-dominated structural breakdown characteristics. By supplementing a reactive ion etching step to reduce contact resistance, the breakdown current density and structural characteristics change significantly. Further contact resistance reduction by adopting a transfer process promotes significantly increased breakdown current density and distinct thermal decomposition-dominated structural characteristics. The current investigation implies that the process control is crucial for quasi-one-dimensional ZrTe 3 interconnects.},

  abstract     = {Zoom lenses are essential for optical imaging applications. The development of metasurfaces offers an approach to overcoming the complexities and bulkiness of conventional zoom systems. Most current tunable zoom metalenses only adjust focus in axial or transverse directions and lack multi-dimensional light field adjustment capabilities. In this study, a dual-polarization responsive three-dimensional zoom metalens based on the Moiré lens effect was designed. The metalens can provide continuous three-dimensional control of the focal point by adjusting the rotation angles of the three metasurfaces, achieving micrometer-level positioning accuracy across the entire spatial range. Furthermore, the metalens exhibits phase modulation characteristics associated with chirality. Specifically, when the incident light is excited in different circular polarization states (right-handed and left-handed), it produces a focal field distribution that depends on the polarization state. This is important for acquiring multi-dimensional information and enhancing target features in complex scenes. The metalens achieves axial zoom ranges of 1–6.5× for right handed circularly polarized light and 1–5.7× for left-handed circularly polarized light, with lateral deflection angles of ±12.5° and ±15.4°, respectively. The focusing efficiencies reach 65.2% and 67.1% for right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. This dual-polarization three-dimensional zoom metalens shows great promise for machine vision, microscopic imaging, and dynamic three-dimensional tracking, advancing multifunctional integrated optical systems.},

The disks act as perfect reflectors at the resonance frequency, and the energy becomes perfectly trapped between the disks, forming an FP-BIC when the distance between them satisfies the Fabry–Pérot quantization condition. We investigate the system both theoretically and experimentally, revealing how the total and radiative quality ( Q ) factor depends on the inter-disk distance. We gain valuable insights into the Fano features observed in the transmission spectra using the quasi-normal mode technique and temporal coupled-mode theory. Notably, we find that as the system approaches the BICs, the Fano asymmetry parameters diverge, resulting in a Lorentzian peak in the transmission spectrum. The experimentally measured radiative Q factor is on the order of 10 5 ⁠ , while the total Q factor, limited by material losses, remains around 10 3 ⁠ . These results open up new possibilities for utilizing BICs in microwave technology, with the potential to significantly enhance the performance of microwave devices.},

Results showed a clear dependence on metal type, with charge polarity and magnitude following a descending trend from positive to negative: Pb > Al > Fe > Cu > Sn. The observed trends correspond strongly with the triboelectric series, indicating that triboelectric charging is the primary charge generation mechanism. Other factors, such as electrochemical reactions, thermoelectric effects, wettability, and pre-existing droplet charge, showed limited influence. These findings not only address a fundamental gap in the understanding of droplet-induced electrification at the nanoscale but also lay the groundwork for advanced applications in charge-controlled nanodroplet technologies.},

We also investigate the laser-induced damage characteristics of diamond and the system's operational stability. Owing to diamond's high laser-induced damage threshold and exceptional thermal stability, the SC exhibits significant potential for long-term stable operation at high pump energies. Furthermore, simulations effectively corroborate experimental observations, indicating that longer crystals and smaller pump numerical apertures facilitate broader SC generation. These results establish diamond as a promising nonlinear medium for SC generation, offering superior characteristics including an ultra-broadband spectrum (covering the entire visible range), excellent spectral reproducibility, and high-energy output.},

Introducing an extra algorithm to optical differentiation will further extend its functionality. Here, we integrate an omnidirectional subtracter with a multi-order optical differentiator via combining distinct spiral lens phases with deflection phases. With this design, zeroth-, first-, and second-order differentiations are spatially separated, and the local linear polarization always orients toward the normal of optical edges for linearly polarized incidence. Thereby, selective edge subtractions can be carried out through simply rotating a polarizer. The design is verified in a photopatterned liquid crystal, whose electro-optical tunability enables a broadband operation across the entire visible spectrum. Rotating a polarizer confirms omnidirectional edge extraction in first- and second-order differentiations while preserving the zeroth-order bright field imaging. The direction-selective defect suppression enhances applications like rainy-day autonomous driving and object recognition in directional noise.

Here, we investigate how defect positioning affects lasing performance in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) with three defect layers. Simulations reveal that synchronously displacing the first two defect layers toward the third layer significantly enhances the central defect mode's density of states (DOS), particularly in asymmetric configurations near the third defect layer. This asymmetry-induced DOS enhancement boosts dye emission efficiency. Experimentally, we use wedge-shaped LC films to continuously tune defect positions and observe that asymmetric structures near the third defect layer exhibit higher lasing intensity and a lower threshold. The threshold of the asymmetric structure could be reduced by a factor of 3.4 compared to the symmetric structure. Our findings provide a strategy for low-threshold CLC lasers by leveraging defect positioning.},

We apply electrowetting wobulation to an optical sectioning structured illumination microscope and demonstrate lateral shifting of a structured pattern while maintaining optical sectioning, which requires high quality images.

The memristor demonstrated a data retention time of 10 4 s and stable resistive switching behavior over 100 cycles under electrical pulses stimulation. Furthermore, it emulated a range of biologically relevant synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, spike-amplitude-dependent plasticity, spike-number-dependent plasticity, and spike-duration-dependent plasticity. Capitalizing on its nonlinear dynamics and short-term memory characteristics, the device was further integrated into a reservoir computing (RC) system. The RC system demonstrated strong recognition performance and robustness when tested with distorted digital image datasets.
