  abstract     = {The aerodynamic stability of large-scale birds, attributed to their covert feathers, has long fascinated biologists and bio-inspired design communities. However, existing theories cannot accurately describe the biological physics of coverts. Here, we propose a theory, based on their biological constraints, by defining covert behavior in terms of two modes: Mode Attach and Mode Deform. To validate the theory and to provide a greater understanding of the physics involved, we conduct a series of wind tunnel experiments using coverts on a man-made wing. Both the biological and physical aspects of this theory are well validated. The results show that in Mode Attach, the covert wake coincides with the wing-bound vortices, whereas in Mode Deform, it detaches from the wing wake vortices. The root constraint level affects the process of transitioning from Mode Attach to Mode Deform. Coverts positioned closer to the wing's leading edge result in smaller coherent turbulence structure scales exhibited in the wake region and higher shedding stability of the wake vortices. Furthermore, compared to those in the clean wing case, the nonlinear vortex packets attached to the wing's suction surface are modulated into self-sustaining attached vortices at multiple scales. Additional anechoic tunnel tests also demonstrated that this theory and definition provide a platform for studying both the aerodynamics and the aeroacoustics of coverts.},

In this Letter, we report the discharge similarities in steady-state CF 4 rf plasmas via fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations. The results show that the rf discharges of different dimensional scales obey the similarity law in both the striation mode and drift-ambipolar mode when the similarity conditions are fulfilled with the scaling factor k being relatively small (e.g., k ⩽ 2 ⁠ ). As the scaling factor k increases, violations caused by “nonlinear collisions” become important, and deviations from the similarity are observed. The nondimensional parameters, η ω and η n ⁠ , for characterizing the formation of the striation mode are evaluated for understanding the mode transitions under similar discharge conditions.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, I-V-VI 2 compounds have attracted significant scholarly attention due to their inherently low thermal conductivity. However, almost no n -type counterpart with a similar rock salt structure has been identified within the I-V-VI 2 family. It is worth noting that AgBiSe 2 synthesized via the high-temperature solid-state method stands out as one of the rare n -type semiconductors. In this work, the thermoelectric performance of AgBiSe 2 was significantly improved by partial substitution of Ag + upon Mn 3+ ions. Electrical conductivity ( σ ) of Ag 1− x Mn x BiSe 2 ( x = 0, 0.015, 0.03, 0.045, 0.06) compounds increases from ∼39 S cm −1 ( x = 0, at 727 K) to ∼166 S cm −1 ( x = 0.06, at 733 K), while the total thermal conductivity ( κ t ) reduces from ∼0.44 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0 at 727 K to respective ∼0.38 and ∼0.36 W m −1 K −1 for x = 0.03 and 0.015, at 733 K. Accordingly, a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit ZT ( ZT max ) value of ∼0.80 is achieved at 733 K for both x = 0.03 and 0.015 samples, representing a substantial improvement by 74% in comparison with the pristine AgBiSe 2 ( ∼ 0.46 at 727 K). These results demonstrate that the Mn 3+ ion doping should be a very promising strategy in designing medium-temperature n -type thermoelectric materials.},

In this work, an interfacial synergy strategy was proposed to overcome this limitation by integrating micro- and nanostructured interfaces between polyimide (PI) and polyamide (PA) materials. Through systematic investigation, the combination of electrospun PI nanofiber membranes with microstructured PA fabrics maximizes the effective contact area and charge-transfer pathways. The results showed that the PI nanofiber/PA fabric pairing yields an open-circuit voltage of 76 V and a short-circuit current of 5.9 µA under a 20 N load at 3 Hz. The optimized device powered 56 light-emitting diodes and charged commercial capacitors with high efficiency. Additionally, an intelligent security system based on TENG technology was developed, underscoring its versatility for self-powered electronics and energy storage. This work elucidates the pivotal role of coordinated micro-/nanostructural matching in enhancing triboelectric output and provides a generalizable approach for advancing TENG performance in sustainable energy, flexible electronics, and smart device applications.},

It is observed that the salt treatment could raise the power conversion efficiency of the devices, and CsI treatment comes out with the fastest rising rate. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope studies observe that CsI treatment triggers secondary growth of PVSK, as well as the doping behavior at the A site of PVSK. Transient photovoltaic/photocurrent decay curve recording and Mott–Schottky study on the devices show that CsI treatment comes out with the longest lifetime of charge carriers, the shortest charge-extraction time, and the highest built-in potential. Accordingly, CsI blending upgrades the power conversion efficiency from 17.22% to 19.16% (on average, optimized to 19.89%), leading to an increment of 11%, compared to that of 7%,1% and 2% for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. Moisture stability is estimated. CsI blending comes out with a T 80 lifetime (time for efficiency dropping to 80% of the initial value) of ∼209 h, compared to that of ∼180h, ∼67h, and ∼90h for LiI, KI, and control cases, respectively. The observation is ascribed to the improved crystallization, and molar Gibbs free energy of hydration (Δ hyd G * ) for these alkaline-metal ions. Cs + owns the lowest Δ hyd G * , thus enhancing the hydrophobicity of the CE. Besides, Li + owns the highest Δ hyd G * , thus triggering the “slow-release effect” on H 2 O molecules from open air.},

It is observed that power conversion occurs only after 20 min of annealing, though severe hysteresis is seen due to the existence of an intermediate phase. Meanwhile, the heterojunction structure evolves obviously in the device, from that formed between the electron transport layer (ETL) and PVSK precursor, to that formed between ETL and PVSK crystallites. As annealing time increases to 120 min, the intermediate phase is reduced, and the buried interface of PVSK is strengthened, leading to accelerated charge-extraction and retarded charge-recombination, as well as an upgraded built-in potential ( V bi ). Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency ( PCE ) improves from 10.47% to 12.42%, with the hysteresis index sharply dropping from 19.19% to 1.06%. Increasing the carbon-electrode thickness and prolonging the annealing time could further improve the crystallization quality of PVSK, thus elevating the PCE up to 15.26%, as well as the T80 lifetime of ∼390 h for unsealed devices, during the quasi-maximum power point tracking test in open air.},

Finally, we built an artificial neural network to recognize handwritten digits in the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, achieving 93.9% recognition accuracy.

In this work, we develop a multi-physical field microscopic imaging system, which is capable of achieving high spatiotemporal resolution characterization in an individual GaN Micro LED. By integrating fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and time-correlated single-photon counting, our system enables real-time tracking of the evolution of defects under coupled optical, electrical, and thermal fields. Equipped with this system, we systematically analyze the spatial distribution and depth of defects introduced by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. Two distinct regions are observed: a narrow fluorescence lifetime decrease zone (∼2 μ m) near the chip edges and a broader fluorescence intensity decrease zone (∼5 μ m). To explain this, we propose a physical model that describes the interplay between defect-induced non-radiative recombination and carrier diffusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wet etching effectively mitigates these ICP-induced damages, leading to enhanced brightness across a wide range of Micro LED sizes. Notably, this passivation process enables a 3 μ m size blue Micro LED chip to achieve a peak external quantum efficiency of 27.6% with a current density of 33.7 A/cm 2 . These findings provide insights into the localized impact of plasma etching and highlight the potential of wet etching for enhanced performance in Micro LED.},

In this study, we propose a direct encapsulation of inorganic clusters into highly aligned CNT microfibers and demonstrate the modulation of the electrical conductivity ( σ ) and thermal conductivity ( κ ) through the incorporation of Mo 4 S 4 nanoclusters. Commercially available CNT microfibers were used as the host material, and the encapsulation was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. As a result, both κ and σ were reduced by approximately 50% and 30%, respectively, compared to pristine microfibers at room temperature. This modulation contributes to an improvement in the thermoelectric figure of merit. The methodology indicates the potential of nanomaterial encapsulation for tuning the thermal transport properties of CNT-based bulk materials, offering a promising strategy for advanced thermal engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {We propose a metasurface design filled with porous medium inside Helmholtz resonators, which can project multiple predesigned images at different frequencies. It is easier to fabricate and more practical than the conventional multiplexed acoustic holographic metasurface of collateral Helmholtz resonators. Moreover, the amplitude and phase of the reflected acoustic wave it modulates have decoupled characteristics, which means there is no need to search for amplitude-phase space by algorithms. We theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the meta-unit can achieve arbitrary amplitude-phase combinations at four frequencies. Then, the fourfold acoustic holographic images are numerically generated by one metasurface at 1180, 1490, 2340, and 3480 Hz, respectively. These proposed strategies significantly increase the degree of freedom of the classical metasurfaces, which may open up additional avenues for multifunctional compact acoustic devices.},

Bi, Ta, and Kr ions with linear energy transfer (LET) values of 99.7, 75, and 37 MeV/(mg·cm 2 ), respectively, were used in the experiments. The results show that the SEB threshold voltage decreases with increasing LET, indicating a strong dependence on energy deposition. In addition, reverse bias is identified as a critical triggering condition for SEB, which occurs only when the applied voltage is high enough to initiate thermal runaway and cause irreversible damage. To further elucidate the failure mechanism, Kr ions were selected for detailed investigation. technology computer-aided design simulations combined with scanning electron microscopy-based failure analysis revealed that transient current surges can rapidly elevate the local temperature. Once the temperature reaches the melting point of Ga 2 O 3 material, SEB is triggered by irreversible thermal failure. Moreover, the failure sites were primarily located at the edge of the Schottky junction, indicating structural vulnerability in this region. These findings clarify the LET and reverse bias dependence of SEB in ultra-wide bandgap devices and provide insights into radiation-hardened design.},

This challenge becomes even more critical in cryogenic environments, such as superconducting quantum computing and space exploration applications, where ultralow quiescent power consumption is essential for maintaining reliable circuit operation at extremely low temperatures. Using the unique low-temperature electrical properties of carbon nanotube materials, we fabricated a carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) that exhibits significantly reduced currents under cryogenic conditions. These carbon-based FETs were implemented to construct a carbon nanotube analog operating amplifier (CNT-OPA). Comprehensive experimental characterization across a wide temperature range (293–10 K) revealed that the CNT-OPA's quiescent power consumption decreases at cryogenic temperatures without any degradation in the gain performance. These results demonstrate the strong potential of carbon-based analog amplifiers for cryogenic electronic applications, particularly in superconducting quantum computing systems and space electronics where conventional silicon-based devices face fundamental limitations.},

By systematically varying the strain conditions, we study how different strain configurations influence the electronic and interfacial properties of this two-dimensional (2D) material-based system. Under tensile strain, the Schottky barrier height (SBH) at the Au/MoS 2 interface decreases and the interfacial binding energy increases, leading to a reduced van der Waals gap and enhanced electron tunneling probability. In contrast, compressive strain has the opposite effect, i.e., compressive strain increases the SBH and weakens the interface interaction. The SBH reduction under tensile strain gives rise to enhanced electron transfer from Au to MoS 2 , resulting in charge redistribution that effectively dopes MoS 2 with electrons and shifts its Fermi level closer to the conduction band minimum. The tunability of SBH and tunneling barriers via strain highlights a viable strategy for optimizing metal–2D semiconductor contacts in nanoelectronics applications.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been regarded as promising candidates for next-generation nanoelectronics devices. However, the intrinsically low carrier mobility severely limits device performance. In this work, we have systematically investigated the carrier transport in 2D hexangular InN based on the ab initio Boltzmann transport theory. The room-temperature carrier mobility is evaluated over a wide range of carrier concentration (n 2D ), with the free-carrier screening effect incorporated via the 2D homogeneous electron gas model. The high intrinsic electron mobility of InN is verified. At low n 2D , the electron mobility remains nearly a constant of 790 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , whereas a peak value of 1150 cm 2 V −1 s −1 is observed at high n 2D . Our mode-by-mode analysis of the scattering events demonstrates that the long-range electron–phonon couplings govern the electron transport. The high electron mobility is attributed to the exceptionally small effective masses in combination with the significant suppression of LO-phonon scattering. Furthermore, we show that applying biaxial tensile strain can significantly enhance the electron transport. At low n 2D = 1 × 10 10 cm −2 , 3% tensile strain makes the mobility increase by 186%. The further analysis has demonstrated that the mobility enhancement results from the increased band velocity and the reduced scattering rates. Our work not only sheds light on the carrier transport in 2D InN but also underscores its great promise for high-performance electronic devices. Moreover, the provided estimation of the gauge factor highlights the potential for strain-sensing applications.},

Moreover, comparing thin films obtained through different techniques is not straightforward. Particularly, analyzing grain size across samples is challenging, making it difficult to clearly correlate growth conditions with the resulting crystal structure. In this Letter, we developed an approach based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) morphology measurements to analyze nanograins in large-area thin films obtained through relevant growth techniques such as chemical vapor deposition and sputter deposition followed by pulsed laser annealing. To address the challenges in comparing thin films grown by different methods, we propose a robust approach based on statistical grain analysis. By combining well-established investigation tools, such as AFM, with advanced watershed-segmentation algorithms, we demonstrate a reliable method for identifying grains and grain boundaries. This approach allows for a robust and quantitative comparison of film morphology across different growth conditions, providing a crucial benchmark for evaluating and differentiating various growth methods.},

Although carrier doping is the most straightforward way for achieving metallization, and it can be realized by interlayer charge transfer in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure constructed with another two-dimensional material, current attempts such as graphene/ h- BN and α -In 2 Se 3 /h-BN vdW heterostructures fail in the h- BN metallization. In this work, a vdW heterostructure of graphene/ α -In 2 Se 3 / h − BN is proposed. Interestingly, with the negative (positive) charge side of α -In 2 Se 3 interfacing with h -BN (graphene), the polarization field of α -In 2 Se 3 pushes the valence band of h -BN to higher energy and the Dirac point of graphene to lower energy so that charge transfer mediated by α -In 2 Se 3 from h -BN to graphene becomes possible, driving h -BN to be metallic. In contrast, with the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization of α -In 2 Se 3 , no charge transfer from or to h -BN is allowed, and h -BN recovers its insulating feature. The nonvolatile resistance switching of h -BN by the graphene/In 2 Se 3 / h -BN vdW heterostructure will promote its practical applications, such as memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Achieving both high electrocaloric effect and broad working temperature span in ferroelectric materials is crucial for practical cooling applications, yet it remains a big challenge. In the present work, a large electrocaloric temperature change ( ΔT ) over a wide temperature range is obtained through disorder modulation of perovskite titanates, specifically by introducing an electric field-sensitive Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 TiO 3 (BNT) into Ba 0.6 Sr 0.4 TiO 3 (BST). Ceramic samples in the BST-100xBNT (0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.28) solid solution system show typical characteristics of relaxor ferroelectrics with a high density of polar nano-regions due to short-range ordering of A-site cations. As the concentration of BNT (x) increases, the freezing temperature ( T f ) decreases and the Burns temperature ( T B ) increases, suggesting the extension of the temperature range of the relaxor in the ergodic state. Moreover, the field-induced polarization was found to increase along with x. The observed structurally induced changes in the relaxor behavior are proposed to contribute to the optimal electrocaloric performance of the BST-28BNT ceramic, with a maximum ΔT of 0.91 °C and a maximum working temperature span of 24.4 °C under an applied electric field of 5 kV/mm. The concept of the A-site disorder modulation provides an innovative strategy to develop high-performance electrocaloric materials from lead-free relaxor ceramics.},

While 6 and 8 nm films achieve optimal ferroelectric properties ( ⁠ 2 P r up to 41 μ C / cm 2 ⁠ ) and good endurance, they suffer from accelerated retention loss, suggesting that prominent (002) texture may enhance charge injection and time-dependent imprint.

We attribute this to its significantly lower remanent polarization, which likely stems from a distinct nanocrystalline/amorphous microstructure, suppressing imprint development. Through quantitative imprint analysis, we establish that wake-up cycling simultaneously improves polarization while degrading retention—a fundamental constraint arising from the coupling between spontaneous polarization and charge injection dynamics.

However, solid-phase synthesis often yields secondary silicide phases that degrade performance. Here, we investigate the influence of substrate properties using two silicon-on-insulator architectures: one with a polycrystalline HfO 2 buried layer (group A) and the other with amorphous SiO 2 (group B). Both systems exhibit superconductivity consistent with V 3 Si formation, yet structural analysis reveals mixed-phase films in both cases. Crucially, only group A maintains an atomically sharp and chemically stable interface, a prerequisite for phase purity. Prolonged annealing in group A reduces the unwanted V 5 Si 3 phase but also leads to the emergence of Si-rich VSi 2 , likely due to localized substrate degradation. Preliminary atomic-resolution imaging suggests that HfO 2 crystallinity may promote local phase-selective nucleation.

  abstract     = {Zigzag graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) with two antiferromagnetic coupled edges possess PT (combined spatial inversion and time reversal) symmetry and spin double degenerate electronic structures. By breaking PT symmetry via the structure design, we are able to generate spatial spin density in twisted bilayer ZGNRs (TBZGNRs) with different stacking configurations and twisted angles, forming a class of quasi-one dimensional carbon nanoribbon antiferromagnets. We investigate the spin transport in TBZGNRs by employing the non-equilibrium Green's functions method and reveal that the electric current is nonreciprocal and spin-polarized in non- PT symmetric TBZGNRs. Moreover, in PT symmetric TBZGNRs, the spin degenerate can be lifted by applying bias voltage. It shows unique nonreciprocal spin transport with opposite spin-polarization under positive and negative bias voltages. Our results indicate that TBZGNRs should be useful carbon-based materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic order and spin-polarized transport. Thus, this work provides a strategy to achieve spin transport in graphene nanoribbons and carbon-based spintronics via the structural design.},

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets are two kinds of classic magnetic materials and are particularly important for modern magnonic and spintronic devices because of their steadily coupled antiferromagnetic sublattices, which result in chirality-dependent magnons, efficient charge-spin conversion, altermagnetism, and great scalability for high-density integration. However, here, we report the observation of asynchrony among sublattices by using typical CoGd ferrimagnets, where the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices fail to remain synchronized during high-speed precession. By employing magnetic resonance, we demonstrate that the asynchrony occurs when the resonance frequency exceeds a critical value corresponding to the delay time ( τ d ) between the two sublattices under microwave excitations. The determined τ d is about 60 ps in CoGd, varies slightly with temperature and composition, but decreases sharply near magnetization and angular momentum compensation. These results demonstrate the speed limit of device performance relying on the antiferromagnetically coupled sublattices as a matter of fundamental principle, and also indicate that the antiferromagnetic attributes during high-speed operations cannot be described as statically coupled sublattices.},

The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector-pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating-pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data.

In this work, an unclosed evolution protocol is proposed, which consists of parallel coupling and buffering branches and evolves through five distinct stages. Buffering the variation of Hamiltonian, inducing the transition to a low energy state, the evolution with favorable adiabaticity guarantees the EP encircling no longer depends on the precise loss manipulation. A non-Hermitian acoustic waveguide coupler (AWC), which is composed of combined cavities and air slit arrays, is presented to realize the encirclement. Experimental results of chiral phase conversion in a 0.5 m long AWC, spanning a broad bandwidth from 9.5 to 17.5 kHz, confirm the simplicity and effectiveness of state evolution encircling the EP.

Following rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 550 °C for 30 s, all dielectrics are confirmed to exhibit the orthorhombic (111) phase by grazing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD). Electrical measurements reveal that the SL5 structure achieves an outstanding reduction in leakage current, decreasing from 0.936 A cm −2 (HZO) to 0.004 A cm −2 at 3 V, and exhibits the highest remanent polarization (2P r = 29.3 μ C cm −2 ), compared to 27.3 μ C cm −2 (HZO), 22.4 μ C cm −2 (SL10), and 17 μ C cm −2 (SL15). Moreover, the SL5 capacitor demonstrates excellent reliability, maintaining robust endurance up to 1 × 10 11 cycles at room temperature and 1 × 10 10 cycles at 150 °C without degradation and stable retention over 1 × 10 4 s. Importantly, interface state analysis reveals that after annealing, SL5 maintains the lowest and most stable interface trap density within the energy range of 0.25–0.45 eV. The trap state density (6.39 × 10 12 –7.11 × 10 12 cm −2 eV −1 ) is significantly lower than that of HZO in the same energy range.

  abstract     = {Ultra-wide bandgap beta-phase gallium oxide ( β -Ga 2 O 3 ) power devices hold great promise in space applications; however, their intrinsic vulnerability to heavy ion irradiation, particularly defect behavior and catastrophic burnout mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. By performing bias voltage-dependent multiple rounds of statistical experiments with 1.35 GeV high-energy Ta ion irradiation, this work identifies electron and hole traps before burnout in NiO/ β -Ga 2 O 3 heterojunction diodes (HJDs), among which the introduced hole trap H2 ( E V + 0.6 eV, 2.9 × 10 13 cm −3 ) is revealed to dominate the irrecoverable leakage degradation associated with device damage by deteriorating the junction barrier. This trap in Ga 2 O 3 is attributed to the electron energy loss along the ion incidence trajectory based on the “thermal spike” physics theory, possibly resulting in a localized amorphous latent track. Beyond device damage, the catastrophic burnout in irradiated HJD is identified in two distinct regions: Region I (p-NiO/n − -Ga 2 O 3 ) dominated by trap-assisted electric field breakdown, and Region II (n − -Ga 2 O 3 /n + -Ga 2 O 3 ) characterized by thermally driven damage from charge accumulation. Additionally, thermal effects also impact the active area of Region I along the carrier dissipation pathway. These findings provide insight into the damage and failure physics of β -Ga 2 O 3 devices under heavy-ion strikes and inform strategies for improved irradiation hardness.},

Remarkably, the grown NWs, even with sub-micron active volumes, could generate short-circuit current densities and open-circuit voltage of several mA/cm 2 and several hundreds of mV, respectively, under white light illumination.

  abstract     = {Multiferroic (MFE) systems with rich tunability encompassing multiple degrees of freedom like spin and dipole are competitive candidates for nonvolatile memory applications. The development of two-dimensional (2D) MFE configurations could further enhance this technology, facilitating the advancement of next-generation microcontroller units. However, most reported 2D multiferroics rely on spatially separated ferromagnetic and ferroelectric layers, which introduce interfacial complexities and limit device scalability. Here, we design a van der Waals multiferroic tunneling junction using antiferromagnetic VSe 2 as a unified magnetic and ferroelectric layer, with 2D metallic TaS 2 and Au (intercalated by monolayer graphene, Gr) serving as the right and left electrodes, respectively. Through ab initio quantum transport simulations, we systematically investigate its electronic transport properties. Our results reveal that the device exhibits four switchable ferroelectric conductance states, which can be modulated via interlayer sliding. When the magnetization alignment of trilayer VSe 2 is additionally controlled, the number of distinguishable conductance states increases to 12. The conductance difference is quantified by tunneling magnetoresistance and tunneling electroresistance, which can maximally increase to 8000% and 4000%, respectively, under optimized bias voltages. Our research expands the application of 2D antiferromagnetic materials and provides a viable strategy for designing high-performance, multi-state memory devices.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen passivation has been established as an effective method to decrease the interface state density (D it ) for silicon carbide (SiC) devices. However, the effect of nitrogen passivation on the carrier capture cross section distributions of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects is still unclear, which is another critical factor governing the interface recombination characteristics and device performances of SiC power devices. In this work, the local band bending is regulated in deep level transient spectroscopy characterizations to modulate the carrier capture and emission behaviors of interface defects in localized energy levels. Therefore, the distribution of carrier capture cross section is determined as a function of the interface state density. Surprisingly, it is found that nitrogen passivation leads to an increase in the capture cross sections of SiC/SiO 2 interface defects, especially for deeper interface states within the bandgap. Based on those findings, the mechanisms of the temperature dependence of leakage current characteristics are explored, where the leakage currents first decrease with rising temperature, reaching a minimum at 250 K, and subsequently increase further with elevated temperature. An interfacial defect-assisted Fowler–Nordheim tunneling mechanism is proposed to explain the temperature dependence of leakage currents, which is suggested to originate from the synergistic interplay between the energy-level dependent capture cross section and interface state densities.},

While in the classical physical paradigm, the causal relationships are deduced based on physical principles or via experiment, the rapid accumulation of observational data necessitates learning causal relationships between dissimilar aspects of material structure and functionalities based on observations. For this, it is essential to integrate experimental data with prior domain knowledge. Here, we demonstrate this approach by combining high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy data with insights derived from large language models (LLMs). By applying ChatGPT to domain-specific literature, such as arXiv papers on ferroelectrics, and combining the obtained information with data-driven causal discovery, we construct adjacency matrices for directed acyclic graphs that map the causal relationships between structural, chemical, and polarization degrees of freedom in Sm-doped BiFeO 3 . This approach enables us to hypothesize how synthesis conditions influence material properties and guides experimental validation. The ultimate objective of this work is to develop a unified framework that integrates LLM-driven literature analysis with data-driven discovery, facilitating the precise engineering of ferroelectric materials by establishing clear connections between synthesis conditions and their resulting material properties.},

Metal thiophosphates (MTPs), with their layered structures and tunable electronic properties, are of particular interest. However, the link between crystal symmetry, stacking order, and anisotropic optical behavior remains inadequately understood in MTPs. Herein, we synthesized high-quality, large-sized monoclinic phase of SnP 2 S 6 single crystals via the chemical vapor transport method. Structural analysis revealed that the monoclinic phase is featured by a unique bilayer stacking configuration with a 180° in-plane rotation of adjacent metal sites. This stacking arrangement disrupts the threefold rotational symmetry of the monolayer, resulting in in-plane structural anisotropy as revealed by polarized Raman spectroscopy and consequently optical birefringence. To showcase its application potential, photodetectors based on monoclinic SnP 2 S 6 were fabricated, exhibiting exceptional polarization-sensitive performance under 405 nm excitation. This work highlights the importance of interlayer stacking patterns on the structural and optical properties of van der Waals MTPs, delivering a unique strategy for property tailoring.},

By tuning linewidth, gap, and electrode layout, discrete LIG elements can be activated individually or along predefined paths, delivering millimeter-scale, site-specific heating without mechanical reconfiguration. A 4 × 4 matrix heater offers programmable thermal pixels: switching two bias lines directs current, and consequently heat, along the shortest-resistance path, producing local temperatures from 25 to 150 °C. Representative tracks reach 165 °C at 5 V, while a 2 V bias yields an increase in ≥ 40 °C. Because the temperature field is primarily governed by the geometry of the conductive tracks, not the overall heater size, the same fabrication step can yield regions with different thermal outputs by adjusting local pattern dimensions such as linewidth and length. This ability to spatially program heating behavior within a thin, flexible film, where heat distribution can be reconfigured simply by changing the biasing direction, highlights its potential for applications in reconfigurable soft robotics, on-skin thermal therapy, and adaptive microfluidic control.},

  abstract     = {Quantifying energy dissipation in dissipative periodic discrete metamaterials remains a challenge, as traditional interpretations of metadamping, based on summing modal damping ratios, do not consistently reflect actual time-domain energy loss in multi-modal systems. The study addresses this critical gap by introducing a framework grounded in a consistent definition of the unit cell for discrete dissipative systems. A single-term exponential energy decay coefficient, obtained through least squares minimization of the transient response, is proposed as a robust descriptor of system-level dissipation. The coefficient approximately captures energy decay behavior in both phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, offering a more physically meaningful measure than conventional damping metrics. The proposed meta-dissipation framework establishes a critical link between dispersion-based analysis and transient energy dissipation, enabling more effective design and optimization of metamaterials for vibration attenuation across a wide range of engineering applications.},

Balancing the advantages of high capillary force of the V-shape and low viscous resistance of the U-shape, long-distance wicking velocity of gradient designs efficiently improved over 40% than conventional V-shape designs. Leveraging the enhanced mechanism, segmental structures with maximized long-distance wicking velocity were further developed, reaching a 100% enhancement.

By decomposing the Bessel vortex wave into a spectrum of plane wave components, we independently compute the PO and EEC scattering contributions for each spectral element. The coherent superposition of these contributions yields the total scattered field, significantly improving modeling accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate a 20%–30% enhancement in radar cross section prediction accuracy over the standard PO method.

  abstract     = {The p -type Cu 2 SnS 3 compounds have been experimentally identified as a promising thermoelectric material. Here, we demonstrate the p-type nature of mohite Cu 2 SnS 3 using experimental techniques as well as density functional theory calculations. The experimental results have shown that Ga substitution at the Sn site remarkably enhances the hole concentration and electrical conductivity, reduces the bandgap, and decreases the thermal conductivity, resulting in increased figure of merit. First principle calculations have indicated that Ga substitution changes the electronic structure of Cu 2 SnS 3 , primarily due to the reduction in lattice volume and interatomic bond distances. Notably, the appearance of DOS states near the Fermi level has been significantly increased, driven by enhanced hybridization among Cu 3d, Ga 4p, Sn 5p, and S 3p orbitals, which has led to increased electrical conductivity of Cu 2 Sn 0.80 Ga 0.20 S 3 to 79 S/cm. Moreover, the substitution of Ga in Cu 2 SnS 3 modifies the electronic structure of Cu 2 SnS 3 substantially, especially the density of states near fermi level is increased, which leads to high carrier concentration of 9.38 × 10 20 cm −3 , power factor of 329 μ W/mK 2 , and lattice thermal conductivity of 0.50 W/mK, thus high zT of 0.4 is realized in Cu 2 Sn 0.70 Ga 0.20 S 3 .},

However, the enormous diversity of material structures and the substantial costs associated with experimental validation have hindered the exploration of MXenes' potential. In this work, we obtained property data for 213 different MXene structures through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and subsequently developed an atomic descriptor suitable for MXenes. Building upon this foundation, we established two machine learning (ML) prediction models, used the predicted data to perform high-throughput screening of numerous MXene structures, and finally conducted theoretical validation using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) method and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) of the two optimal prediction models reached 95% and 93%, respectively. Through high-throughput screening, 21 photocatalyst candidates were identified from 23 857 MXene structures, among which YTaC(OCl)(NCS) and Y 2 CFH exhibit high optical absorption coefficients (>1 × 10 5 cm −1 ), solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiencies (>14%), and thermodynamic stability.

In particular, eco-friendly flexible supercapacitors (Eco-FSCs) are essential for advancing technologies within the Technology with Sustainability (TWS) framework. In this work, a one-step, binder-free, direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering technique was employed for the reactive fabrication of vertically aligned vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5 ) nanorods at room temperature (RT) over a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) substrate. The symmetric two-electrode mode electrochemical characterization in 1M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte revealed a specific capacitance of 160 F/g, a power density of 2 kW/kg, and an energy density of 3.6 Wh/kg. It demonstrated 100% capacitance retention for 2000 charging-discharging cycles, excellent mechanical flexibility, and rapid disposability. For the real-time application, four devices connected in series powered the different colored light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for over 60 s. Therefore, this work presents a facile strategy for fabricating eco-friendly FSCs with superior storage performance. The fabricated materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).},

  abstract     = {Sodium-ion layered transition metal oxides (Na x [TM 1 , TM 2 ]O 2 , where TM denotes transition metals) serve as potential cathodes for high-performance sodium-ion batteries due to their high specific capacity and operating voltage. Nonetheless, the ordering of Na + /vacancy and the cationic arrangement of TM 1 /TM 2 adversely affect their structural stability and Na + diffusion kinetics. Herein, an F − doping method on a typical P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 2 (NNMO) layered oxide is presented to disrupt the above-mentioned ordering. First, the redox center is altered by the introduction of F − , resulting in the reduction of Mn 4+ and the redistribution of Ni/Mn ions. The TM 1 /TM 2 cationic ordering and Na + /vacancy ordering are disrupted, hence improving ion transport efficiency. Second, as the amount of F − introduced rises, the interlayer gap of the alkali metal layer is extended, which is helpful for the insertion and extraction of Na + . Third, the associated strong TM–F bonds could considerably boost the stability of the NNMO. Hence, the optimized sample P2-Na 0.67 Ni 0.33 Mn 0.67 O 1.73 F 0.07 gives an excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 85% after 1000 cycles at 0.5 C and 2.0–4.0 V.

This approach integrates in situ -grown MIL-53(Fe) nanosheets with sulfur-modified ZIF-L (S-ZIF-L), synergistically enhancing interfacial charge transfer dynamics while optimizing active site accessibility. The S-ZIF-L@MIL-53/NF catalyst demonstrates exceptional OER performance in an alkaline medium, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 336 mV at 500 mA cm −2 . Remarkably, it exhibits robust stability for 300 h at 350 mA cm −2 . In situ characterization reveals the coexistence of adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen-mediated mechanisms, which collectively govern intermediate adsorption energetics and reaction kinetics. The sulfur-doping-induced morphological modulation and oxygen vacancy enrichment further contribute to enhanced electronic conductivity and catalytic activity.

In this study, we present an innovative growth strategy utilizing an FTO substrate as an in situ Sn source, enabling controlled synthesis of large-area (4 cm × 4 cm) SnSe 2 nanosheet arrays. One-dimensional (1D) Te/two-dimensional (2D) SnSe 2 vertical mixed-dimensional heterostructures were further fabricated. The Te/SnSe 2 vertical heterostructures demonstrate significantly enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction performance compared to individual Te and SnSe 2 nanostructures, achieving an overpotential of 0.73 V at 10 mA/cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 110.05 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The first-principles calculation results reveal that interfacial charge redistribution at the heterojunction substantially lowers the water dissociation energy barrier while optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy. This growth strategy establishes a viable pathway for fabricating large-area 1D/2D vertical heterojunctions, and the combined experimental and theoretical findings advance our fundamental understanding of their hydrogen evolution reaction mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Reliability of β -Ga 2 O 3 based trench Schottky barrier diodes with a breakdown voltage of 4 kV and a Baliga's figure of merit of ∼1 GW/cm 2 is reported. The devices were stressed with reverse voltages up to 3 kV in increasing steps of 250 V, followed by an evaluation of the on-state characteristics after each step-stress. The step-stress testing revealed an increase in on-state resistance of <3% when stressed up to 2.25 kV but degrades to 13% when stressed at 3 kV, recovering fully after 3 h rest time. The degradation in on-state characteristics (current collapse) under high reverse bias stress is attributed to the negative charge trapping near the bottom corner of the fins, which reduces the net conductive area of the fins. The current degradation could be replicated through drift-diffusion simulations, with trapped charge density of ∼3 × 10 12 cm −2 required to match 13% degradation observed experimentally. This work highlights the critical influence of dielectric properties and charge trapping on the reliability and performance of ultra-wide bandgap materials like Ga 2 O 3 .},

Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi 2 X 4 could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.},

We report both linear and nonlinear current–voltage characteristics over a temperature range of 5–300 K. The thermal evolution of the nonlinear characteristics exhibits power-law scaling and collapses onto a single universal curve when scaled by temperature.

  abstract     = {To elucidate the origin of ferroelectric properties and underlying mechanisms in experimentally discovered two-dimensional (2D) vermiculite, we performed first-principles calculations on structures with varying Al 3+ doping concentrations in the Mg–O octahedra. Our results reveal that intrinsic ferroelectricity stems from Al 3+ induced proton symmetry breaking. Ferroelectricity emerges with doping along the x -direction, while doping along the y -direction produces antiferroelectricity. This direction dependence arises because the ferroelectric phase along y experiences stronger short-range ionic repulsion, forcing adjacent dipoles into antiparallel alignment to minimize close ionic contacts. Furthermore, the 2D vermiculite exhibits both in-plane and out-of-plane polarization, with components of 1.47, 1.37, and 0.63 e Å/proton and 0.18, 0.17, and 0.12 e Å/proton, respectively. The formation of a local dioctahedral configuration effectively reduces the ferroelectric switching barrier. Additionally, we designed 1D and 3D-P vermiculite structures to preserve semiconductor properties while mitigating the depolarization effect inherent in the antiferroelectric configuration. Compared to traditional perovskite materials, vermiculite demonstrates superior ferroelectricity and greater robustness during switching. These attributes position 2D vermiculite as a promising candidate for developing low-cost, high-performance room-temperature ferroelectric materials.},

Under biaxial strain and a -axis uniaxial strain, the system undergoes a phase transition from the original G-type antiferromagnetic to C-type antiferromagnetic order due to a significant reduction in the out-of-plane bond angles. Simultaneously, marked changes also occur in both the spectral weight distribution of low-energy spin wave modes and the in-plane longitudinal thermal conductivity.

Currently, three mechanisms of magnetization switching have been identified through theoretical and experimental studies: domain wall motion, coherent rotation, and magnetization curling. Here, we report a different mechanism of magnetization switching characterized by uniform and continuous transformation of a single ferromagnetic microdomain into alternating nanodomains of two magnetization vectors with different directions. Such a “magnetization spinodal” mechanism occurs at the ferromagnetic morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of the Tb 1− x Dy x Fe 2 system when the magnetization vector of the microdomain is located within the region on the free energy curve with respect to the magnetization direction where the second derivative becomes negative, which is similar to the compositional spinodal mechanism in diffusional phase transformations. Further calculations show that magnetization spinodal mechanism enables easier magnetization rotation as compared to coherent magnetization rotation and contributes to large magnetostriction at MPB. This finding could advance the theory of magnetization switching and phase transitions. It could also shed light on the design of ferromagnetic devices.},

A high-quality yttrium iron garnet film was structured via precise laser ablation to form an integrated resonator system incorporating magnonic-crystal sections. Using Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy alongside micromagnetic simulations based on the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert framework, we demonstrate that the resonator element induces Fabry–Pérot-like interference, leading to multi-mode spin-wave propagation and selective energy transfer between the magnonic-crystalline and waveguiding regions. The resonator enables selective excitation of transverse modes, leading to distinct directional coupling regimes: at specific frequencies, spin waves propagate preferentially into either the MC or waveguide sections. Simulations reveal mode interference and bandgap effects, aligning with experimental observations. Resonant modes within the system enable distinct coupling regimes: at specific frequencies, spin waves are directionally routed into either the waveguide or MC section, governed by transverse mode formation and Bragg scattering effects. In this case, the modes of directional coupling of the spin waves are associated with the intersection of the dispersion characteristics of the forward and backward waves for the first and third modes. These findings highlight the potential of resonator-coupled magnonic systems for reconfigurable signal processing, enabling applications such as frequency-division multiplexing, logic gates, and adaptive magnonic circuits with ultra-low-power consumption.},

Motivated by the recent synthesis of SGS CoFeCrAl (CFCA) with a high Curie temperature (575.2 K) and the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based on the CFCA electrode, we utilized density functional theory combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function method to investigate the magnetic anisotropy energy of the CFCA/MgO heterostructure and the spin transport properties of the CFCA/MgO/CFCA MTJ, with a comparative analysis against the experimentally fabricated CoFe/MgO/CFCA MTJ. Our findings demonstrate that the CoFe–O interface configuration is the most stable and shows a considerable interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of 0.69 mJ/m 2 , with its origin elucidated through layer- and orbital-resolved analysis. More intriguingly, the CFCA/MgO/CFCA MTJ exhibits a large tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 1.3 × 10 7 %, resulting from the interfacial spin filtering. Additionally, we reveal that the TMR of CoFe/MgO/CFCA MTJ is only 1.56 × 10 3 % due to mismatched wave function distribution between the left and right electrodes. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the PMA and TMR, indicating that CFCA is a promising SGS material for spintronic applications.},

  abstract     = {An integrated magnonic device is a miniaturized system that manipulates magnons to perform computing, signal processing, or sensing functions. These devices leverage the wave-like nature of magnons to transmit and process information with low energy consumption. However, a major contemporary challenge lies in managing the reflections between cascaded magnonic devices during the design of two-dimensional integrated magnonic circuits. To address this issue, a magnonic directional coupler with non-reciprocal behavior has been developed using interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (iDMI). This design has been validated through micromagnetic simulations. The iDMI induces an asymmetric dispersion curve in the coupled waveguide, resulting in non-reciprocal coupling strength in the spin waves transmitted in the positive and negative directions. The non-reciprocal directional coupler effectively suppresses reflections along the original propagation path, functioning similarly to a circulator to isolate connected magnonic devices. This advancement represents a significant step forward in the development of robust and scalable spin-wave computing systems.},

The magnetic damping of the epitaxial FeV film is revealed to be anisotropic in the FeV/Al bilayer without any spin sink, which is confirmed by the spin-pumping effect in the FeV/Pt bilayers with spin sink. The spin transport between the FeV layer with anisotropic magnetic damping and the Pt layer is anisotropic, which demonstrates by the measurement of the anisotropic SOT efficiency. The anisotropic magnetic damping and SOT can be attributed to the variation of the spin–orbit coupling in different crystallographic directions of the FeV film. These results provide insights and effective pathways for constructing anisotropic charge-to-spin conversion systems based on ferromagnetic materials with anisotropic magnetic damping.},

Here, the spin mixing conductance serves as a pivotal parameter to quantify spin transport efficiency at ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic interfaces. To date, most studies have focused on optimizing the efficiency of spin current generation, while the modulation of interfacial spin transparency remains underexplored. In this work, we fabricate freestanding MoS 2 /NiFe heterostructures with intrinsically high spin mixing conductance surpassing conventional ferromagnetic systems by two orders of magnitude. Owing to the high tunability of the band structure in MoS 2 with strain and charge doping, a 135% enhancement in the spin mixing conductance of MoS 2 /NiFe heterostructures has been achieved using PMN-PT ferroelectric single-crystal substrates. Our findings demonstrate a model for dynamically tuning spin transport at 2D/ferromagnetic interfaces and further provide foundational insight into the design of flexible, freestanding spintronic devices with ultralow power consumption and field-tunable functionality.},

However, the validity of this correlation remains an open-ended question, especially in the context of inelastic scattering at room temperature. To address this gap in knowledge, we perform independent measurements of the in-plane thermal and electrical conductivities across four AlCu (0.5% Cu) films [thickness ( ⁠ h ⁠ ) ≈ 174, 98, 53, and 24 nm] using optical pump–probe metrologies and four-point probe techniques, respectively. For in-plane thermal conductivity measurements, we utilize time-domain thermoreflectance, in both concentric and beam-offset configurations, and the time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect. Our results show that the WF law overpredicts the thermal conductivity by at least ∼10% in all films, thus demonstrating modest deviations in predicted thermal conductivity when applying the WF law to dilute AlCu films. Using infrared variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, we demonstrate increased electron scattering rates in the thinnest film ( ⁠ h ≈ 24 nm), indicating electron-boundary scattering drives the reduction in in-plane thermal conductivity. This is generally an elastic scattering process, which is supported by our thermal conductivity measurements and analysis.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimension (2D) Janus materials with asymmetric atomic structure have been found to have unique intrinsic vertical polarization properties, where an electron is more likely to deviate from the neutral center and make a greater contribution to the dipole moment. Here, based on the calculation of the piezoelectric properties of ten types of 2D Janus materials, we identify the sole material Y 2 Se 2 IF, where the contribution of internal-strain piezoelectricity plays a dominant role. We further conduct a lattice dynamics analysis of its piezoelectric properties and find that the A1(6) (9.313 THz) mode contributes 73% of the internal-strain piezoelectric component e 31 i ⁠ , resulting from the large mode polarity and large phonon–strain coupling. The electronic structure indicates that this significant mode contribution comes from high bond ionicity, large electronegativity differences, and the effective regulation of bond length by modal factors. We further analyze the evolution of the piezoelectric components, phonon mode contributions, atomic contributions, mode polarity, and phonon–strain coupling of the piezoelectricity of the Y 2 Se 2 IF under biaxial strain. The results show that strain leads to an enhancement of phonon–strain coupling, resulting in a significant fluctuation in the piezoelectric contribution of the A1(6) mode. These dynamic analyses of the piezoelectric properties provide a theoretical basis for the application of 2D Janus materials in the field of piezoelectrics.},

Here, we investigated the phase evolution of solid nitrogen at low temperatures (87–300 K) and high pressures (0–175 GPa) along two different thermodynamic pathways: the isothermal compression and the isobaric cooling. When we compress nitrogen above 130 GPa, below 150 K, we find an extended solid (named μ- N 2 ) that exhibits Raman vibron fluctuations, which may be related to exciton–vibron coupling or electron–vibron coupling. Three missing low-temperature and high-pressure phase transition boundaries ( ζ – κ , κ – μ , μ – η ) have been identified by using a self-designed isothermal compression Raman spectroscopy. We also find that the dissociation of nitrogen significantly alters the Clapeyron slope in the phase diagram.},

Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by three to seven times (e.g., shifting from 250–430 to 1400–2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.},

By combining the advantages of a phonon and a photon, the long-lifetime PP generated by minor Mg-alloying of ZnTe marks an improvement over the PP of pristine ZnTe, which, from the Raman cross section calculation, can only achieve a balanced compromise between the two kinds of advantages, intensity and speed. The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ≤ 0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro- and microstructure using x-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the native phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn 1− x Mg x Te ( ⁠ x ∼ 0), considering various Mg isotopes.},

The results indicate that under reverse gate bias, the leakage mechanism consistently remains trap-assisted tunneling (TAT) both before and after irradiation. However, under forward gate bias, the dominant conduction mechanism shifts from Poole–Frenkel emission to TAT as a result of the introduction of hole traps with an energy level of E V + 0.93 eV.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient halide perovskites (HPs) is critical for advancing optoelectronic device performance. Herein, we systematically investigate the excited-state dynamics of three crystalline systems with distinct symmetries using time-domain nonadiabatic dynamics simulations. Compared to the tetragonal phase P4 mm with higher symmetry, the orthorhombic phase Fmmm significantly alters the spin polarization at the conduction band minimum, leading to the classification of two exciton types: charge-transfer excitons and Frenkel excitons. The two exciton types exhibit distinct temporal responses under photoexcitation. To ensure the generality of our findings, we employed a comprehensive set of crystalline models for MAPbI 3 , including Fmmm, Im3, Pm 3 ¯ m, Pnma, I4/mcm, P4 mm, and P4/mbm symmetries, which were optimized and subjected to ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations. Incorporating spin–orbit coupling effects to approximate realistic scenarios, the NAMD simulations reveal that the electron–hole recombination in the tetragonal P4 mm phase with a narrow bandgap occurs within approximately 78.63 fs, whereas the orthorhombic Fmmm phase exhibits an extended carrier lifetime of ∼93 fs due to the spatial separation of charge density between electrons and holes. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to modulate the excited-state dynamics in metal HPs through tailored structural ordering, offering critical insights for designing high-performance perovskite materials tailored for optoelectronic applications.},

  abstract     = {The aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) nanoarray is becoming increasingly significant as a photocathode configuration for use in electronic devices and ultraviolet sensors. Traditional photocathode design techniques rely on physical models that utilize empirical data and trial-and-error methods, making it difficult to optimize all parameters simultaneously. This research explores how machine learning (ML) can expedite the photocathode design process by creating a comprehensive database derived from a full-parameter photoemission model. This database includes various characteristic parameters (such as structural, material, and system parameters) alongside target parameters like photocurrent. We compare the effectiveness of several ML algorithms (including linear regression, random forest, support vector machine, and bi-layer/tri-layer fully connected neural network) using the data generated from the physical model. The findings indicate that ML can significantly enhance the design workflow for nanoarray photocathodes and assess the significance of each parameter. The neural network effectively maintains an error rate in performance predictions of around 4.7% while achieving a prediction speed of 13 000 observations per second. Optimal ranges for several parameters were identified, including nanowire diameter (243–347 nm), nanoarray height (278–412 nm), incident light angle (40–60°), Al component (0.3–0.5), and surface emission rate (10 3 –10 5 cm/s). These outcomes imply that combining ML with physical modeling presents a fresh perspective for the design and conceptualization of nanoarray photocathodes.},

The incorporation of two WO x interfacial layers has significantly reduced the concentration of oxygen vacancies at the interface of the HZO film, leading to an impressive decrease in leakage current density by 94.9% compared to the conventional Si/W/HZO/W capacitor. Consequently, the remnant polarization of the capacitor retains 98.9% and 96.3% of its initial value after more than 10 11 read/write cycles at voltages of 1.5 V under temperatures of 25 and 150 °C, respectively. Furthermore, during the “1/0” hold process at 150 °C, the imprint voltage is reduced by 44.4% relative to that observed in the Si/W/WO x /HZO/W capacitor.

However, the practical realization of electrically programmable excitonic functionalities remains hindered by inefficient and power-intensive exciton–trion switching. Here, we demonstrate an energy-efficient exciton–trion switching strategy through integration of monolayer WSe 2 with gold micropillar arrays. Micropillars with radii down to 1 µm induce strong localized strain in WSe 2 , significantly enhancing modulation efficiency and reducing the required gating voltage to as low as 0.6 V—approximately an order of magnitude lower than previously reported values. Periodic gating enables robust, reversible switching between neutral and trion exciton, supporting logic-like functionalities including binary encoding and signal inversion. Combined experiments and simulations reveal that this enhanced tunability arises from the synergistic interplay between strain localization and plasmonic field enhancement at the micropillar apex. These results establish an integrable, low-power approach for electrically programmable excitonic states, advancing integrated excitonic circuits based on two-dimensional semiconductors.},

LaCoO 3 is paramagnetic in bulk, while the epitaxially strained films become ferromagnetic, whereas the origin of the emergent ferromagnetic order remains controversial. Here, we report the observation of an unexpected ferromagnetic order in freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes, even though the strain has completely released in the membranes. Atomic-resolution microscopy revealed that the freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes have maintained a large Co–O–Co bond angle after releasing from the substrates, giving rise to a hidden ferromagnetic phase as supported by density-functional theory calculations. Moreover, the magnetic state of the freestanding LaCoO 3 membranes is controllable by wrinkle formation via transferring the membranes to wafers with distinct surface roughness. Our work proposes an alternative pathway for the creation of hidden phases in correlated oxides and demonstrates that strain is not a prerequisite of emergent ferromagnetism in LaCoO 3 films.},

The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction.

The Bi doping concentration is up to around 30 at. % owing to the high similarity of In 2 Se 3 and Bi 2 Se 3 lattice structures. At low doping concentrations (0.2–2 at. %), the β -In 2− x Bi x Se 3 films possess improved crystallinity and present good layer-by-layer epitaxial growth.

  abstract     = {The texture of superhydrophobic surfaces can reduce solid–liquid contact time by altering the droplet impact dynamics, which is widely used in applications such as self-cleaning and anti-icing. However, the influence of the roughness of superhydrophobic surfaces on the behavior of droplet impact has not been fully elucidated, which limits the engineering applications of such surfaces. In this study, superhydrophobic surfaces with different roughnesses were prepared, and the kinetic behavior of droplets impacting these surfaces for different Weber numbers ( We ) was systematically analyzed by combining high-speed photographic experiments and hydrodynamic simulations. The results show that the droplets become more thermodynamically unstable due to the significant tensile deformation developed at the droplet retraction stage with increasing We , and secondary droplet splashing occurs due to the Plateau–Rayleigh instability. Moreover, the critical We for a droplet transitioning from complete rebound to breakage splashing decreases monotonically with increasing surface roughness. The physical mechanism of the droplet splashing phenomenon on superhydrophobic surfaces facilitated by surface roughness is elucidated by modeling the quantitative relationship between the air spillage velocity and the initial impact velocity of the droplets, combined with the synergistic analyses of the contact force distributions, the internal velocity field, and the pressure field distributions during the retraction phase of the droplets. This study not only deepens our understanding of the complex physical processes underlying the impact of droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces but also provides a theoretical basis for self-cleaning and anti-icing applications.},

However, the limited average power of the modulation laser poses a bottleneck for increasing the repetition rate of these coherent radiation sources. To address this challenge, improving the efficiency of laser–electron interaction is essential. In this Letter, we propose an efficient scheme to enhance the laser–electron energy coupling by employing a perfect vortex laser beam within a helical undulator. The electron beam trajectory is highly consistent with the helical wavefront of the laser field, which improves the utilization efficiency of the optical electric field. Three-dimensional time-dependent simulation results indicate that the repetition rate can be improved by over two orders of magnitude over the conventional Gaussian laser beam at the same input power. We anticipate that the proposed scheme will pave the way for the development of high repetition rate coherent radiation sources.},

  abstract     = {Negative terahertz photoconductivity is a rare effect that holds great significance for numerous applications. However, the maintenance and enhancement of negative photoconductivity response still face a huge challenge. Here, combined with material selection and band alignment engineering, we have proposed a mixed-dimensional heterostructure comprised of 1D tellurium (Te) nanowires and 2D monolayer graphene. Intriguingly, the Te/graphene heterojunction could enhance negative terahertz photoconductivity by twice compared with graphene, following a transition from negative to positive photoconductivities. We have further performed first-principles calculations and characterizations to elucidate the type-I band alignment at the heterointerface, revealing the phenomena attributed to interfacial charge transfer. Our results provide in-depth physical insights into the carrier transport mechanism, which is crucial for further exploration of optoelectronic devices based on mixed-dimensional heterostructures.},

Recent studies on dual-comb Yb-doped light sources with an all-normal dispersion mechanism have been proposed. In this work, we experimentally and numerically demonstrate a variable and switchable all-normal dispersion dual-wavelength Yb-doped fiber mode-locked laser based on a birefringent filter. In contrast to the previous dual-comb spectroscopy demonstrations directly enabled by the single-wavelength dual-comb all-normal dispersion Yb-doped laser, this work demonstrates broadband spectral coverage expansion in a dual-wavelength dual-comb laser source through an external Yb-doped fiber amplifier and photonic crystal fiber, with little additional intensity and phase noise. To evaluate mutual coherence and verify the feasibility by utilizing broadening combs, we performed proof-of-concept dual-comb spectroscopy of the transmission measurements with a homemade Sagnac filter; the results showed very good agreement with those obtained using an optical spectrum analyzer. It is of great significance to use a periodic filter in the cavity and eventually measure the transmission curve of such a periodic filter. Our work paves the way for the development of broadening all-normal-dispersion Yb-doped fiber lasers, which are well-suited for dual-comb applications.},

The randomness originates from the probabilistic nature of the intensity fluctuations of the twin beams and the quantum correlations are certified by measuring the intensity-difference squeezing in the generated twin beams. At an analysis frequency of 2 MHz, we have measured 95% correlation between the random intensity fluctuations of the twin beams. We observe over 5 bits/sample of entropy from the quantum fluctuations of the twin beams. Furthermore, to extract identical strings of random numbers, post-selection of the binned data and hashing algorithms are used, leading to a binary string of random numbers at a rate of 6 Mbps that passes standard statistical tests from NIST and TestU01. Here, the simplicity of generating bright twin beams shows the potential of this method in quantum cryptography and quantum communication.},

A comprehensive analysis of the signal mode profile yields valuable insights into the modal characteristics of the waveguides, enabling the optimization of N-doping profiles for the optimal incorporation of V2 silicon vacancy color centers, which possess unique optical and spin properties essential for quantum sensing applications.

Furthermore, we minimize surface roughness of the coupling facets to an root mean square value of 0.2 nm, thereby reducing scattering losses and enhancing device performance while maintaining compatibility with high-volume manufacturing processes. V2 color centers are created within the waveguide through proton implantation, as evidenced by the detection of fluorescence light above 850 nm within the guided waveguide mode, highlighting the potential of our platform for highly sensitive and compact SiC-based quantum sensors.},

However, how to evaluate the effect of these passive cooling strategies on the solar cell performance was lacking, which is critical for the passive cooling design of solar cells. In this work, an electricity-thermal model was built to discuss the solar cell performance under different passive cooling conditions. Compared with the common solar cell with a glass cover, the sky radiative cooling by improving mid-infrared thermal emittance or above- λ g (effective cutoff wavelength) reflectance in the solar spectrum had a slight effect on the temperature drop or power improvement under natural convection. The core point was to ensure the near-perfect sub- λ g transmittance using anti-reflection coatings, which played the main role in the solar cell performance. A low cell temperature did not mean a high cell outpower under the selective spectral cover, and the sub- λ g transmittance could not be suppressed to improve heat dissipation performance. After introducing an evaporation cooling layer, the output power could be enhanced greatly, showing the wide adaptability to cool the solar cell with little effect on solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency in sub- λ g spectra. These results could guide subsequent cooling structure design by integrating different cooling strategies to achieve a near-perfect passive cooling system.},

  abstract     = {Fe doping is widely known to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni-based electrocatalysts; however, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial, with interpretations focused on post-incorporation effects. Here, we uncover a previously overlooked pre-incorporation mechanism: Fe 3+ -mediated redox cycling in solution that directly generates high-valent Ni 3+ species, facilitating the formation of catalytically active Ni 2 O 3 H and nanostructures. Under hydrothermal conditions, spontaneous electron transfer occurs from Ni 2+ to Fe 3+ , yielding Ni 3+ , while simultaneous regeneration of Fe 2+ sustains a self-perpetuating redox cycle for continuous Ni 2+ oxidation. Remarkably, at ultra-low Fe 3+ concentrations, a hybrid morphology featuring both 2D and 1.5D structural characteristics emerges. Most Fe 3+ precipitates as colloidal Fe(OH) 3 without incorporation into the lattice, particularly near critical doping thresholds. The trace Fe-induced 2/1.5D nanostructures exhibit superior OER performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm −2 at an overpotential of merely 225 mV––comparable to that of heavily doped counterparts. Additionally, Fe doping synergistically activates both the lattice oxygen mechanism and the adsorbate evolution mechanism. These findings reveal a paradigm in Fe–Ni catalyst design, wherein controlled dopant-mediated redox chemistry and nanostructure play pivotal roles in optimizing electrocatalytic performance.},

  abstract     = {Air stability issues in layered oxides present significant challenges for sodium-ion batteries due to the high activity in humid air. The fundamental instability arises from inherently weak Na–O bonding, exacerbated by their wider interlayer spacing. Here, we propose that incorporating ions with high electronegativity can effectively modulate the Na + binding strength, thereby enhancing intrinsic air stability. As a case study, P'2-type Na 0.67 MnO 2 (NM), one of the promising cathodes that benefits from its cost-effectiveness and high specific capacity, was selected to verify the above-mentioned concept by introducing strongly electronegative Pb 4+ ions. To synergistically enhance structural stability, electrochemically inactive Mg 2+ ions were also incorporated, resulting in the P'2-type Na 0.67 Pb 0.04 Mg 0.08 Mn 0.88 O 2 (NMP4M8). As confirmed by x-ray diffraction, the reduced layer spacing in NMP4M8 effectively inhibits spontaneous Na + /H + exchange, resulting in excellent air stability. After 4-day air-exposure (20 °C, 50% RH), no significant hydrated phases were detected, whereas the unmodified NM exhibits clear structural degradation. After 7-day air-exposure, NMP4M8 achieved a capacity retention rate of 80.6% after 200 cycles, significantly higher than the 20.8% observed in aged NM. Density functional theory calculation revealed that Pb 4+ incorporation strengthened Na–O attraction, while Gibbs free energy analysis showed thermodynamically unfavorable degradation for NMP4M8. This co-doping strategy presents a promising pathway toward developing air-stable layered oxides.},

  abstract     = {Achieving superior carrier transport is critical in thermoelectric (TE) materials. However, traditional strategies, such as doping and alloying, always generate a trade-off between carrier concentration and mobility caused by the complex scattering of carriers, limiting the carrier transport properties. Herein, we report a unique high-pressure strategy without introducing scattering centers to optimize carrier transport properties by taking Bi 2 S 3 as an example. The layered nature of Bi 2 S 3 offers a strong response of band structures to pressure. It was found that a unique electronic topological transition emerged under ∼4 GPa revealed by the in situ high-pressure Raman spectra, leading to simultaneous increases in carrier concentration and mobility. This enabled significant enhancement of carrier transport property to boost the electrical conductivity while maintaining a high Seebeck coefficient due to the accompanied large enhancement in the density of states, resulting in a notably improved power factor. Separately, the relatively low thermal conductivity remained due to the preserved layered structure characteristic. Consequently, a record-high figure of merit of 1.05 was achieved at 5 GPa and 744 K, which is higher than those reported state-of-the-art Bi 2 S 3 -based thermoelectrics. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of pressure in optimizing carrier transport properties, providing profound insights of high pressure in designing high-performance thermoelectrics.},

  abstract     = {As one of the most promising high-speed nonvolatile memristors, aluminum nitride-based memristors have shown ultrafast switching at or even below nanoseconds. However, the on/off ratio, lifespan, and endurance of nitride memristors are very limited due to their intrinsic nitrogen vacancy conduction. Here, we demonstrate that memristors built on wide bandgap semiconductor aluminate nitride AlN possessed a representative prototypical digital memristive behavior through device structure optimization. The on/off ratio of the AlN memristors could be improved to 10 6 using one device cell, which consists of two memristors connected in parallel with a common bottom electrode. We identified space charge limited conduction in the low resistance state and Schottky emission in the high resistance state as the dominant conduction mechanisms. The AlN-based memristors could transform to volatile memory by reducing the interfacial barrier height. We further designed and fabricated a vertically integrated double barrier AlN memristor as a nonvolatile ReRAM on 2-in. sapphire and silicon wafers. These integrated double barrier AlN memristors possess high performance with an endurance of 10 4 , a retention of 10 5 s, and clear switching threshold voltages, indicating a promising nonvolatile memory.},

  abstract     = {Thin-film transistors with a source barrier—such as source-gated transistors and tunneling contact transistors—exhibit ultrahigh intrinsic gain ( A i ) and low power consumption, making them promising candidates for low-power circuits and wearable devices. However, their low output saturation current ( I dsat ) remains a significant challenge. In this work, tunneling contact thin-film transistors (TC-TFTs) with a high-mobility indium tin oxide (InSnO) channel were fabricated, and the effect of oxygen partial pressure on their performance was systematically investigated. Compared to conventional InSnO transistors, InSnO TC-TFTs demonstrated a significant increase in intrinsic gain and a reduction in power consumption. Furthermore, by adjusting the oxygen partial pressure during the sputtering of InSnO, the output current of the TC-TFTs was improved to a level comparable to that of conventional InSnO transistors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed that the output current's dependence on oxygen partial pressure is attributable to variations in Schottky barrier height, which are induced by changes in carrier concentration. These results demonstrate the potential for fabricating high-performance InSnO TC-TFTs that combine large saturation current, high intrinsic gain, and low power consumption.},

Responsivity monotonically increases with incident optical power density. After 500 kGy irradiation, responsivity degrades by 80%, with dose dependence following a double-exponential decay. Vacuum annealing at 800 K restores 79% of the pre-irradiation optical gain, confirming a partial reversibility of irradiation-induced defects. Deep level transient spectroscopy reveals defect evolution post-annealing, identifying corresponding energy levels, identities, and annihilation dynamics. High-temperature annealing primarily annihilates irradiation-induced point defects, enabling significant recovery, while thermally stable defect complexes prevent full restoration.},

The nitrogen atoms of pyridine and hydrazine (-NH-NH 2 ) as active sites can effectively drive coordination with unsaturated Pb 2+ ions by Lewis acid–base interaction and anchor iodine-related defects by forming hydrogen bond. This synergistic defect passivation strategy reduced trap-state density and suppressed the defect-induced charge recombination loss. Consequently, the optimal 2-HP-modified CsPbI 3 devices achieved a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.08%, corresponding to a 12% enhancement over their unmodified counterparts.

In this study, we engineered a minimized topological electronic structure with controllable gaps in the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi 2 Te 4 , through a synergistic strategy combining bulk antimony (Sb) doping and surface potassium (K) modification. Systematic investigations were performed using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy at 80 K. Bulk Sb doping effectively induces the formation of topological surface state gaps, with their magnitude dramatically increasing from 10 meV in Mn(Bi 0.95 Sb 0.05 ) 2 Te 4 to 103 meV in Mn(Bi 0.76 Sb 0.24 ) 2 Te 4 , while simultaneously reducing carrier concentration and shifting the Dirac point toward the Fermi level. Subsequent K surface modification induces a non-monotonic Fermi level shift, accompanied by a distinctive “closure-reopening” evolution of the topological surface state gap. We attribute this phenomenon to the transition of surface termination types induced by low-dose K modification and surface potential reconstruction caused by high-dose K deposition. This synergistic doping strategy establishes an effective pathway to achieve the high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.},

In this study, we introduce fluorination of C 3 N as an innovative strategy to create a monolayer that features a quasiflat band near the Fermi level. The absorption energy, molecular dynamics simulations, and calculations of mechanical constants indicate that it is energetically, dynamically, and mechanically stable. Additionally, the orbital-projected energy band structure analysis shows that the quasiflat band predominantly arises from the unfluorinated carbon atoms. Further calculations reveal that its quasiflat band is partially occupied when spin freedom is disregarded. According to the Stoner criterion, spin splitting and ferromagnetism would be induced if spin freedom is considered. Subsequent calculations indicate that the spin-up channel hosts a nontrivial second-order topological phase with spin-polarized corner states existing in the zero-dimensional nanodisk. It is suggested that the spin-polarized quasiflat band can be effectively preserved around the Fermi level when placed on the h-BN monolayer. Taking into account the experimentally synthesized C 3 N and experimentally achievable fluorination for 2D materials, our work introduces a material for investigating the fascinating properties of flat bands and spin-polarized second-order topological states.},

It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet, established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.},

Throughput analysis of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and the possible magnetic configurations show that most of them look like 2D Ising ferromagnets, while Cr 3 TeF 7 is like an XY ferromagnet. Moreover, Cr 3 TeBr 7 is an ideal candidate to verify the Mermin–Wagner theorem due to its negligible MAE. More interestingly, three neighboring magnetic moments capped by a Te atom in Cr 3 TeCl 7 are ferromagnetically coupled with each other, and then these trimers will form an inverse in-plane triangular spin configuration at an angle of 120° with S eff = 9/2. For Cr 3 XY 7 , their flatbands show very weak dispersion, and the Dirac cones will open a gap due to the breaking anisotropy. However, van Hove singularities at M point still remain intact. In addition, Berry curvatures of single isolated Dirac bands show the opposite and identical symbols at K and K′ points for Cr 3 SCl 7 and Cr 3 XCl 7 (X = Se and Te), respectively, further indicating that they are very promising candidates for valleytronics.},

Improving their ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and photoelectric properties is essential for expanding their functional scope. In this work, we report the application of ultrathin self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) for effective surface defect passivation in PZT film. By introducing [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)] phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz) as a SAM on the surface of PZT films, both Pb 0 surface states and oxygen vacancy defects are efficiently passivated. As a result, the remanent polarization ( P r ) is enhanced from 26 to 31 μ C/cm 2 , while the piezoelectric coefficient ( d 33 ) increases significantly from 100–150 to 200–250 pm/V. Furthermore, the favorable energy level alignment between Me-4PACz and PZT contributes to improved polarization performance under illumination. These results underscore the potential of SAM-based strategies to enhance the functional performance of perovskite ferroelectric films and offer a promising route for integrating perovskite ferroelectric films into lightweight and portable electronic devices.},

A characteristic Δ T ∝ E 2 / 3 dependence of the caloric temperature change is found right at the phase transition, which rapidly evolves to a complex field dependence within less than 1 K above the phase transition. An analytical expression for this complex field dependence is derived from the Landau–Devonshire theory which accurately describes the observed Δ T ( E ) ⁠ . In the ferroelectric phase below the phase transition, a linear field dependence is observed. Bipolar electric driving fields lead to additional dips to negative values of the temperature change here, which can enhance the overall electrocaloric effect in this regime.},

This is achieved by locally heating the ferroelectric recording medium for a very short time at the data reading position using laser irradiation. We discuss the relationship between the maximum number of laser irradiation cycles and the heating duration for a LiTaO 3 medium. We also conduct a basic experiment and confirm that laser pulse irradiation greatly increases SNDM signal strength. Furthermore, we experimentally confirm that high-speed SNDM signal amplification occurs with nanosecond-order light irradiation.

  abstract     = {Local dipoles significantly influence the properties of paraelectric perovskites. Potassium tantalate niobate (KTa 1− x Nb x O 3 , abbreviated as KTN) is a perovskite with excellent electro-optic and piezoelectric properties. Manipulating dipoles via electric fields in paraelectric KTN demonstrates significant application potential. Therefore, such dipole dynamics under electric fields are essential to research. In this work, we investigated dipole reorientation under electric fields in paraelectric KTN crystals. We found that, under an electric field of 10 kV/cm, local polarization opposing the direction of the applied field still exists in the KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 ( T C = 13 °C) crystal. Additionally, a macroscopic piezoelectric coefficient of ∼40 pC/N was achieved in the paraelectric KTa 0.62 Nb 0.38 O 3 crystal by applying a 12.5 kV/cm electric field for 24 h. This phenomenon is attributed to the maintainable field-induced reorientation state of the dipoles after the removal of the electric field. Furthermore, since complete dipole reorientation requires strong fields, in the case of a KTa 0.61 Nb 0.39 O 3 crystal with a T C (23 °C) approaching room temperature, a field-induced phase transition (at 2.1 kV/cm) occurs prior to the complete switching of dipoles in the paraelectric phase. This results in a multi-domain state in the recently phase-transformed crystal. Our findings help in understanding the performance exhibited under electric fields and can facilitate the optimization of paraelectric perovskites.},

This observation indicates that the previously considered domain wall can be a local object. Its occurrence is associated with the competition of polar and antipolar arrangements.

The electron–phonon coupling constant is independent of the external magnetic field, while the spin–lattice dynamics are strongly influenced by the applied field. We demonstrate that the magnetic-field-induced modification of the spin–lattice interaction originates from a reduction in the magnetic entropy.

Currently, it is established that valley polarization in altermagnetism remains largely insensitive to spin–orbit coupling and spin. We select monolayer Cr 2 S 2 as a model altermagnetic system to investigate the mechanism through which an external field modulates valley polarization in altermagnetism. This effect arises from breaking the diagonal mirror symmetry M x y under uniaxial strain, which lifts the degeneracy of the X and Y valleys, inducing significant valley polarization. Crucially, biaxial strain preserves M x y symmetry and fails to induce polarization. Uniaxial strain simultaneously induces valley polarization and a nearly uniform Zeeman-like field in the reciprocal lattice space, reaching up to 118.39 T under 5% uniaxial strain. Moreover, the symmetry breaking in the monolayer Cr 2 S 2 leads to strong piezomagnetic effects, merging piezomagnetic and altermagnetic characteristics in two-dimensional materials.},

A synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free layer configuration has been proposed to enhance the robustness of these devices against external magnetic field disturbance. Here, we systematically investigate the stochastic properties of SAF-based s-MTJs, with a particular focus on their size dependence. We demonstrate that decreasing the junction size from approximately 100 nm to around 40 nm reduces the relaxation time. Importantly, smaller junctions show markedly enhanced robustness against external magnetic fields, achieving susceptibility values below 0.1 mT −1 for sizes under 80 nm. Furthermore, we observe that smaller junctions exhibit enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage, with sensitivity values of around 0.5 V −1 at device sizes of approximately 40 nm, which is 100 times lower than that of conventional s-MTJs. These quantitative results provide clear guidelines for designing robust and scalable s-MTJ devices, essential for advancing spintronic probabilistic computing toward practical implementation.},

Interestingly, as tensile strain is progressively applied, RuICl transforms from the initial PMA to in-plane magnetic anisotropy, which leads to the evolution of spin texture through a sequence of transitions, progressing from a single-domain state to stripe domains, followed by a mixed state of domain walls and skyrmions, and ultimately transitioning to in-plane stripe domains. Furthermore, the synergistic application of tensile strain and an external magnetic field effectively induces skyrmions states. Spin texture modulation strongly depends on the magnetic field orientation. In addition, tensile strain significantly modulates the vertical polarization in the Janus RuICl monolayer. Our findings highlight the potential of the RuICl monolayer as a promising candidate for spintronic devices based on topological spin textures.},

Such advancements can significantly enhance logical operation capabilities, functional diversity, signal processing prowess, stability, and integration density while reducing power consumption. However, it remains challenging. In this study, using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the spin-FET based on the altermagnetic monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 with spin–layer coupling can achieve perfect and controllable spin filtering depending on the transport direction. Notably, at zero gate voltage, the spin-FET exhibits a remarkable 100% spin-filtering efficiency (SFE) for spin-up and spin-down electrons along the [100] and [010] transport directions, respectively. Interestingly, due to the spin–layer coupling inherent in the monolayer Ca(CoN) 2 , the application of gate voltage can effectively modulate the SFE and improve the current in the [110] transport direction. Specifically, a positive (or negative) gate voltage enhances the SFE to 100% of spin-down (or spin-up) currents.

After HPT processing, the unit cell volume was reduced, and the inserted strain promoted the appearance of ferromagnetic domains. Thus, HPT processing provides a platform for exploring the strain-induced magnetic behavior of NiO.},

  abstract     = {Thermal imaging technology has significantly advanced the fields of thermal engineering and fundamental physics by enabling precise and non-contact temperature measurements. In the field of spin caloritronics, an active infrared emission microscopy approach based on lock-in thermography (LIT) has significantly advanced the study of thermoelectric and thermal transport phenomena in magnetic materials and their hybrid structures; however, its measurements have been largely limited to room temperature and above. Here, we report on the measurements of transverse thermoelectric conversion in a magnetic material, the anomalous Ettingshausen effect (AEE), below room temperature using the LIT technique. Although the infrared emission decreases with decreasing temperature, the high temperature resolution of LIT allows to observe the AEE-induced temperature modulation in a ferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co 2 MnGa slab down to 200 K and reliably quantify the anomalous Nernst coefficient down to around 240 K. The methodology demonstrated in this work will pave the way for further developments in both fundamental research and practical applications in spin caloritronics.},

  abstract     = {Lead chalcogenides crystallizing in NaCl-type structure are known as excellent thermoelectric materials. Yet, they have suffered the long-standing issue of performance imbalance between n -type and p -type thermoelectric devices. In this work, we have explored a highly stable low-energy allotrope of those lead chalcogenides, namely rockseline phase. This phase is energetically close to the stable NaCl-type phase with a hull distance of only 50 meV/atom. It can be potentially realized by applying elevated pressure on an existing experimental phase. Compared with the NaCl-type structure containing solely octahedron units with an isotropic bonding network, the rockseline structure has alternatively stacked octahedron and triangular prism units, thus exhibiting the appealing feature of hierarchical bonds. This causes the lattice thermal conductivity in the rockseline structure being few times smaller than its NaCl-type counterpart, thanks to the softened phonon modes and concurrently enhanced anharmonicity. In addition, the rockseline structure favors superior electrical conductivity at n -type doping and an appealing valence band convergence feature, being beneficial for the pronounced Seebeck coefficient at p -type doping, causing balanced thermoelectric performances under different doping conditions. As an outstanding representative of the rockseline family, rockseline PbTe exhibits an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.8 W / ( m · K ) at room temperature and an excellent yet balanced figure of merit approaching 2 at both n -type and p -type doping and high temperatures. This work highlights the important role of crystal structure engineering in the design of thermoelectric materials with superior thermoelectric performances.},

  abstract     = {The ultrawide-bandgap gallium oxide (Ga 2 O 3 ) polymorphs have opened frontiers in high-power electronics and multifunctional devices. Among these, the orthorhombic phase (commonly referred to as κ-Ga 2 O 3 or ε-Ga 2 O 3 , hereafter denoted as ε-Ga 2 O 3 in this work) stands out with its exceptional spontaneous polarization and large piezoelectric coefficients, positioning it as a prime candidate for next-generation high-electron mobility transistors and radio frequency resonators. However, the epitaxial growth of high-quality ε-Ga 2 O 3 films remains challenging due to interfacial transition layers and limited crystallographic control. Herein, we demonstrate a pioneering Sn-assisted low-pressure mist chemical vapor deposition technique that enables the growth of single-phase ε-Ga 2 O 3 films on c-plane sapphire substrates with unprecedented crystalline quality. The resulting films exhibit a remarkably narrow x-ray diffraction rocking curve (full width at half maximum, FWHM = 0.08°) while achieving atomically smooth surfaces (root mean square, RMS roughness = 1.51 nm). Key innovations include the complete suppression of interfacial transition layers through Sn-mediated nucleation and the realization of true layer-by-layer growth under optimized low-pressure conditions. This synergistic approach combines the inherent cost-effectiveness of Mist-CVD with enhanced crystallographic precision, establishing a viable pathway for industrial-scale production of ε-Ga 2 O 3 -based quantum well devices and polarization-engineered heterostructures.},

Activation energy (E a ) of 0.74 eV confirms the temperature-dependent nature of the trapping mechanisms. Furthermore, partial V TH recovery after stress removal highlights the presence of deep-level sidewall traps with a slow detrapping process. Additionally, by extrapolating time-dependent gate dielectric breakdown (TDDB) data across high-temperature stress conditions, the device demonstrates a 10-year lifetime at 150 °C under an operating voltage of approximately 8.22 V. Furthermore, the extracted E a ranging from 0.59 to 0.63 eV confirms the presence of deep-level traps within the AlGaN barrier layer, which contributes to the electron trapping during degradation, leading to the point-level defect generation, ultimately driving TDDB.},

Two electron emission signals have been detected in DLTS spectra of all Al x Ga 1− x N samples and the activation energy for electron emission relative to the conduction band edge ( E C ) from the first level shifts from E C –0.25 to E C –0.34 eV and that for the second level shifts from E C –0.6 to E C –0.68 eV upon changes of x from 0 to 0.063. In the L-DLTS spectra of the Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N samples, the electron emission signals associated with the E C –0.34 eV donor and E C –0.68 eV acceptor levels split into individual components due to aluminum fluctuations in the nearest neighbor (NN) shells. The splitting patterns are nearly identical for both signals and the ratios of peak magnitudes are consistent with calculated probabilities of finding a given number of aluminum atoms in the second NN shell around a Ga lattice site. These findings provide strong evidence that the E C –0.34 and E C –0.68 eV trap states in Al 0.063 Ga 0.937 N are related to point defects in the Ga sub-lattice. Finally, a comprehensive scan of possible impurities and defect levels in GaN and Al x Ga 1−x N using first-principles calculations suggests that the E C –(0.25–0.34) eV electron trap in Al x Ga 1− x N (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.063) is most likely related to carbon or molybdenum donor states, specifically, C Ga (0/+) or Mo Ga (0/+).},

This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxy growth and transport properties of lattice-matched single- and multichannel AlScN/GaN heterostructures. A two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forms at the AlScN–GaN interface with a lattice-matched AlScN barrier as thin as 2.5 nm and increases with AlScN thickness, exceeding 2.5 × 10 13 /cm 2 for a 10 nm barrier. Stacking of lattice-matched AlScN/GaN multilayers produces parallel 2DEGs whose total density scales linearly with the number of AlScN/GaN periods, reaching 1 × 10 14 /cm 2 for five-period structures, with moderate average electron mobility of 583 cm 2 /V.s and sheet resistance of 106 Ω / □ at 300 K. Structural analyses reveal that coherently strained epilayers with sub-nm surface roughness were achieved. The electron mobility in the lattice-matched AlScN/GaN single- and multichannel heterostructures is limited by alloy disorder and interface roughness scattering. Temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements confirm the presence of multiple conducting 2D carrier sheets with less than 15% carrier freeze out, carrier mobility of 851 cm 2 /V.s, and sheet resistance of 78 Ω / □ at 10 K.

  abstract     = {This work demonstrates an in situ etching technique for β-Ga 2 O 3 using solid-source metallic gallium (Ga) in a low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) system, enabling clean, anisotropic, plasma damage-free etching. Etching behavior was systematically studied on ( ⁠ 2 ¯ 01) β-Ga 2 O 3 films and patterned (010) β-Ga 2 O 3 substrates as a function of temperature (1000–1100 °C), Ar carrier gas flow (80–400 sccm) and Ga source-to-substrate distance (1–5 cm). The process exhibits vapor transport- and surface-reaction-limited behavior, with etch rates reaching a maximum of ∼2.25 µm/h on (010) substrates at 1050 °C and 2 cm spacing. Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate distance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures enhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide formation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using radial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most stable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal lateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast, orientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit pronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation progressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution is observed between (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02), where stepped sidewalls composed of alternating (100) and ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) segments progressively transition into a single inclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or ( ⁠ 1 ¯ 02) depending on the trench orientation. The (100)-aligned fins exhibit minimal bottom curvature, while (201)-aligned structures display increased under-etching and trench rounding. Collectively, these findings establish LPCVD-based in situ etching as a scalable, damage-free, and orientation-selective technique for fabricating high-aspect-ratio β-Ga 2 O 3 3D structures in next-generation power devices.},

This study investigates the relaxation characteristics of the high-resistance state collected from a 2 Kb RRAM array which was fabricated in 28 nm commercial foundry. Three distinct drift behaviors of the RRAM resistance states were observed: (1) transient conductance drift, (2) stair-stepping conductance drift, and (3) reversible conductance drift. A programming strategy based on electron release was proposed to identify unstable devices efficiently. The amplitude and width modulation of the release pulse reveals that amplitude modulation has a more significant effect due to a certain barrier height for trapped electrons to be released. A physical model based on the trap-assisted tunneling mechanism is proposed to fit the cumulative distribution function of unstable bits under different pulse amplitudes and widths. Compared to existing long pulse and delay verify programming strategies, the release verify method significantly reduces the impact of RRAM relaxation while maintaining programming efficiency.},

In this work, the thermal conductivity ( ⁠ κ l ⁠ ) of the BiOCl monolayer was studied using first-principles calculations and the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, in which four-phonon scattering processes are explicitly considered. Our results indicate that the predicted κ l is reduced from 7.1 to 5.2 W/(mK) after including four-phonon scattering (a 27% reduction). When introducing a tensile strain of 3%, the room temperature κ l can be further reduced by 77% as compared to that of the strain-free case. Such a huge reduction primarily arises from the flattening transverse acoustic branch and the densified low-frequency phonons in the strained BiOCl monolayer, which enables qualitative changes in the dominant mechanism of phonon scattering: from three-phonon scattering to four-phonon scattering. These findings provide deeper insights into the thermal transport behavior of the BiOCl monolayer and underscore the significant potential of strain engineering as a power tool to tailor high-order anharmonic effects for symmetry-breaking 2D materials.},

Two trap states were observed consistently and uniformly, with their trapping parameters quantified. Consistent with the high performance of these 1.55 μ m photodetectors, total trap concentrations were very low, in the order of 10 12 cm −3 . The activation energies of the two detected states were found to be E C - 0.21 eV and E C - 0.40 eV. The near mid-gap position of the E C - 0.40 eV state implies a role as an efficient recombination-generation center and could be an important lifetime-limiting defect for MBE-grown GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 . A comparison was made with an inferior performing GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodiode. DLTS measurements revealed the same defect states and spectra, implying that the sources of these defects are the same. However, trap concentrations were found to be substantially higher for the poorer-performing device. This correlation was further supported by comparing the minority carrier lifetimes of the two samples, measured using transient microwave reflectance (TMR). A significantly lower minority carrier lifetime was extracted for the lower performance device, consistent with higher trap concentrations. It was suggested that the near mid-gap trap detected at E C - 0.40 eV could be an important contributor to limiting the minority carrier lifetime within 1.55 μ m GaAs 0.51 Sb 0.49 photodetectors grown by MBE.},

The ZnSnN 2 layer in ZnSnN 2 \Cu is bulk inhomogeneous with one smaller work function from the minor phase resulting from Cu in-diffusion and suppressed oxygen out-diffusion besides the larger one from the original major phase, while the Cu layer is also bulk inhomogeneous, resulting from the higher chemical activity of Cu, which leads to the observed barrier height inhomogeneity and quenches the photovoltaic effect.},

The decrease in the plasmon resonance frequencies (redshift) with the increase in the lateral current was observed for both types of structures. We show that the change of the electron concentration profile and Joule heating are the main phenomena responsible for the shift of the plasma resonant frequency. These results are important for designing plasmonic resonance-based filters, detectors, and emitters operating under voltage bias conditions.},

The RFSS acts as a strong absorption layer, while dual 3D MSs (3D MS-I/II) with low loss characteristics synergistically broaden absorption bandwidth. Multi-interface exploitation optimizes angular stability, featuring resistive patch integration in 3D MS-II for compensation absorption under TE polarization and strategically positioned vertical metal patches in 3D MS-I extending the propagation distance of electromagnetic waves in 3D MS-I under TM polarization. Benefiting from the hybrid absorbing mechanism, the proposed absorbing material demonstrates over 90% absorptivity from 6.3 to 27.2 GHz with angular stability below 60°, covering full X/Ku bands (−20 dB bandwidth). Notably, 80% wideband absorption persists even at 70° oblique incidence.},

However, the growth of atomically flat polar oxide MgO films with arbitrary thickness has been hindered by polarity issues. In this study, we analyze the interfacial structure and band alignment of MgO (111) thin films deposited on 6h-SiC (0001) by the molecular beam epitaxy method. An epitaxial growth of the MgO (111) thin film on SiC is demonstrated. We show that the interface is O-terminated by atomic-scale scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements. The insulating characteristics are preserved in the vicinity of the interface according to electronic structure calculations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements show that the valence band offset is approximately 1.6 eV. Electronic structure calculations for a realistic model constructed using the atomically resolved electron microscopy images show an excellent agreement between the calculated and measured valence band offsets, further confirming the validity of the developed atomic interface model. These findings pave the way for further advancements in MgO-based electronic devices, considering the ability to tailor the interface atomic structure, which could be employed to engineer the overall electronic properties at the interface, including the valence band offset.},

SrFeO 2.5 films were grown on (001) oriented Nb:SrTiO 3 to enable high-quality interfaces and future integration with Si CMOS technologies. Post-growth vacuum annealing and growth pressure were used to control film orientations, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction measurements. Films grown with diffusion planes oriented in-plane had oxygen-rich, perovskite-like nanodomains spread throughout the film, and fabricated devices exhibited worse switching consistency and more stochasticity. In contrast, films grown with diffusion planes oriented out-of-plane had a more uniform oxygen-rich perovskite interfacial layer above the bottom electrode, and devices built from this film orientation showed significant statistical improvements in switching voltages and cycling consistency.},

For samples without the AlN interlayer, the defects in the GaN channel layer near the heterointerface were induced by the strain from the Al 1−x Ga x N barrier depending on the AlN mol fraction. The density of strain-induced defects was markedly increased near the conduction band minimum to 1 × 10 18 cm −3 peaked at a depth of ∼10 nm from the heterointerface for the Al 0.24 Ga 0.76 N/GaN sample. The AlN interlayer was confirmed to suppress the formation of strain-induced defects. The carrier mobility evaluated by magneto transport measurements was also improved clearly in samples with the AlN layer because of the reduction in the density of strain-induced defects leading to remote 2DEG scattering. We have clarified the correlation between the density of strain-induced defects and the 2DEG mobility for a comprehensive understanding of the carrier transport in strained heterostructures.},

In our experiments, femtosecond second harmonic generation (SHG) signals were temporally broadened to the nanosecond scale through an absorption-and-remission process facilitated by a highly efficient quantum dot material positioned in front of a photomultiplier tube. This process yielded a 77% increase in SHG SI, along with improved image quality. Furthermore, the enhancement in both SI and SBR was consistently observed throughout the full imaging depth of three-dimensional collagen fiber samples. This method not only boosts signal strength and SBR simultaneously but also reduces the risk of photodamage and enables faster imaging. Owing to its simplicity, compatibility with other intensity-enhancing techniques, and ease of integration, the proposed time-stretching strategy holds significant potential for advancing both fundamental research and industrial applications in NLM.},

The impedance mismatch effects that cause issues for VOETs are shown to be absent in LOETs as the medium impedance appears as an element parallel to the photoconductor impedance instead of being in series. Results from the model are found to be in good agreement with electric field results obtained from full-wave numerical solvers.

  abstract     = {Collimating high-current-density sheet electron beams using external magnetic fields presents significant challenges, particularly due to complications such as diocotron instability. To address these issues, we introduce a non-magnetic, plasma-assisted planar collimator in this Letter. In this study, a plasma-assisted planar collimator was developed, and its performance was analyzed by utilizing a pulsed electron beam source to propagate a transient sheet electron beam through it for 50 ns duration. A collimated beam of dimensions 7.1 mm × 0.75 mm was captured near the collimating region, exhibiting notable compression along the beam height compared to its width. This uneven compression highlights the need for a detailed understanding of particle dynamics within the collimator. However, experimental diagnostics using traditional probes inside a planar collimator are constrained due to spatial limitations. To overcome this, a 3D Particle-In-Cell simulation study was conducted using VSim Multiphysics to model the interaction of the electron beam with neutral gas, resulting in impact ionization within the collimator. The simulation results reveal the role of the temporal and spatial ionization profiles that drive beam compression and shaping. A good correlation of compression factor between experimental and simulated results was observed, with the simulated beam size measuring 6.75 mm × 0.65 mm. This work offers valuable insights into the design of collimators for high-current-density sheet electron beams, with applications in high-power, compact microwave and THz sources.},

The joint measurement is possible only with prior knowledge of the target's location, which is unknown in many cases. The technique described in this article overcomes this limitation by using optical entanglement and quantum cross-correlated homodyne measurement. This technique offers the following additional advantages in comparison with QI implementation through joint measurement: (1) quantum storage and prior knowledge about the target's distance are not required, (2) it adds ranging capability, and (3) it adds anti-stealth mechanism to suppress the low-reflectivity of the target. As the detection is at optical frequencies, the environment is considered as a stray laser, which could be a decoy, a jamming field, a probe field from another ranging application, or a field used to mask the actual probe. Thus, the environment considered in this Letter is suitable for ranging applications like lidar.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of aqueous polymer-based supercapacitors is significantly hampered by issues such as limited operating potential windows and low energy density. To address these challenges, this study introduces a straightforward and rapid approach involving the incorporation of an active metal, copper (Cu), into a conductive polymer matrix, poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor configuration (CP//AC). This strategy aims to broaden the potential window of individual cells within aqueous electrolytes, thereby enhancing energy density. The synthesized polymer composite (CP) features a layered nanoflake morphology that facilitates conduction pathways, substantially boosting electron transfer and ion mobility rates. Notably, the CP electrode (CP-2) achieves a specific capacity of 935 mAh g −1 at 3 A g −1 and demonstrates cycling stability with negligible capacity loss over 10 000 cycles at 20 A g −1 in a three-electrode system, corresponding to a maximum power density of 8249 W kg −1 and energy density of 189 Wh kg −1 . Upon fabrication of a flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor using CP-2//AC, an 80.3% capacity retention is observed after 1500 charge–discharge cycles at 15 A g −1 . This research highlights the potential of polymeric materials for energy storage and demonstrates their feasibility in flexible aqueous supercapacitor technologies.},

  abstract     = {O3-type layered oxides, as high-capacity cathode materials for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), face practical limitations due to poor structural stability, high Na + diffusion barriers, and inadequate rate performance. This work proposes a Ca/Cu/Ti co-doping strategy and systematically regulates the crystal phase among 24 types of layered oxides, from P2-, mixed P2/O3- to O3-type phase, by precisely controlling the Na content and adjusting the transition metal layer microenvironment. The optimum O3-type Na 0.80 Ca 0.06 Ni 0.48 Mn 0.40 Cu 0.06 Ti 0.06 O 2 delivers a high initial capacity of 151.37 mAh g −1 at 1 C (120 mA g −1 ) with 102.56 mAh g −1 retained after 200 cycles, while maintaining 80.67% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 0.1 C. Mechanistic studies and theoretical calculations demonstrate that an optimal Ca/Cu/Ti doping improves the Na + diffusion kinetics, where Na vacancies activate Cu/Ni redox activity to sustain capacity under Na + -deficient conditions, and effectively suppresses Mn activity, thereby simultaneously enhancing the cycling stability of cathodes. This work provides a wide range of component-phase regulation, achieving highly stable Na-deficient O3-type layered oxides through a multi-cation trace doping strategy for SIBs.},

  abstract     = {Fluorite-structured antiferroelectric (AFE) dielectric capacitors have emerged as promising candidates in energy storage applications. The AFE behaviors of dielectrics generally stem from an electric field-induced phase transition. Thus, the initial phase composition in the AFE film plays an important role in determining the performance of energy storage. This work systematically investigates the impact of oxygen plasma pulse time (OPPT) on the AFE properties of atomic-layer-deposited ZrO 2 films. As the OPPT increases from 3 to 5 s, the as-deposited ZrO 2 film changes from an amorphous to polycrystalline state. The ratio of cubic/tetragonal phase (C/T) in the polycrystalline ZrO 2 film gradually rises with increasing the OPPT from 5 to 15 s, accompanied by a gradual decrease in defect oxygen. To improve the performance of the as-deposited ZrO 2 capacitors, post-annealing is performed at 450 °C for 30 min in the forming gas. It is found that the post-annealing increases the concentration of the T phase in the ZrO 2 films, which reduces gradually with prolonging the OPPT. For the amorphous as-deposited ZrO 2 film under an OPPT of 3 s, the post-annealing generates the largest maximum polarization ( P max ) and energy storage density, corresponding to 19.7 μ C/cm 2 and 34.7 J/cm 3 , respectively. The results indicate that the AFE properties of the ZrO 2 film are determined by the T phase content, which can be modulated by the oxygen plasma dosing duration and post-annealing. Our findings provide a different perspective for improving the energy storage performance of AFE capacitors.},

Here, we introduce a PEDOT:PSS/NiO x bilayer hole transport layer (HTL) that optimizes energy-level alignment, achieving a threefold enhanced hole extraction rate ( k H = 1.17 × 10 8 s −1 ). Comprehensive microscopic analyses reveal that the optimized bilayer HTL effectively reduces localized charge accumulation, kinetically suppressing ion migration and phase separation. Consequently, the perovskite film retains compositional homogeneity under prolonged illumination, substantially enhancing both photovoltaic performance and operational stability.

However, obtaining excellent morphology of the active layer is an important challenge for achieving efficient all-PSCs. In this work, a ternary-assisted layer-by-layer (LbL) strategy is used to optimize the morphology of all-PSCs. The polymers PM6, PM1, and PY-IT are selected as host donor, guest donor, and acceptor to fabricate a series of LbL all-PSCs, respectively. The high compatibility between PM6 and PM1 promotes the formation of an alloy state within the active layer, which enhances molecular arrangement orderliness and crystallinity, and vertical structural phase distribution. The ternary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6:PM1/PY-IT exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.10% and better stability compared to the binary LbL all-PSCs based on PM6/PY-IT with a PCE of 16.96%. The optimized ternary LbL all-PSCs retain over 82% of their initial PCE after 790 h of storage in a glovebox.

Here, we demonstrate a carbazole-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM), [4-(3,6-dimethyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me-4PACz), as an efficient electron-selective layer in [poly(3,4 ethylenedi oxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)]/Si solar cells. The Me-4PACz SAM introduces a directional dipole moment at the c-Si/Al interface, generating a built-in electric field that enhances electron extraction. This interface modification leads to a linear Ohmic contact, reducing the contact resistivity between n-Si and the metal electrode interface to 4.12 mΩ cm 2 . Consequently, the optimized device achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.75% with a high open-circuit voltage ( V OC ) of 651 mV and fill factor of 78.03%, representing a ∼14% relative PCE improvement over the control device (PCE = 14.75%).

  abstract     = {We report a method of engineering a reversible change in interlayer bonding between layers of exfoliated thin films of MoS 2 by means of hydrogen intercalation through forming gas annealing. Interlayer bonding strength is probed through the behavior of MoS 2 under process-induced strain engineering, where two-dimensional (2D) flakes are encapsulated with a deposited stressed thin film layer to transfer strain into the underlying 2D materials. It is shown that after forming gas annealing, the depth of the strain transferred into multilayer MoS 2 is enhanced as determined through layer-thickness-dependent Raman spectroscopic mapping. This change represents a transition from a 2D van der Waals-bonded material in the as-exfoliated samples to a more three-dimensional (3D)-bonded system in the annealed samples. We demonstrate the reversibility of this effect by means of vacuum annealing of previously forming gas annealed samples. The process of forming gas annealing itself also imparts strain into MoS 2 due to a combination of 2D-to-3D bonding transition with differential thermal mismatch between the MoS 2 and the substrate. These strains are shown to be retained after the vacuum annealing process, despite the transition back to 2D bonding. Since forming gas annealing is a common technical process in engineering 2D electronic devices, these results represent an important consideration in understanding non-intentionally applied strains due to changes in the mechanical properties of 2D materials.},

By applying synchronized voltage stress (SVS) with optimized pulse parameters, the proposed method significantly suppresses channel temperature buildup and reduces device degradation. A predictive thermal model, rigorously validated through coupled simulations and experimental measurements, enables precise control of temperature dynamics under diverse operating conditions. Experimental demonstrations using light-emitting diode-integrated driver circuits reveal substantially improved operational stability under SVS, in sharp contrast to the rapid performance degradation observed with continuous stress. This purely electrical approach requires no structural modifications and offers a practical and cost-effective solution to enhance the reliability of advanced display technologies.},

However, most existing strain-engineering approaches face critical limitations: (i) incompatibility with real-time nanoscale characterization, (ii) restricted maximum strain, and (iii) discontinuous strain application. To overcome these challenges, we develop NanoGap, a piezoelectric-driven strain platform that achieves full compatibility with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques while enabling continuous strain in multilayer vdW crystals. Applying this methodology to hexagonal boron nitride flakes (20–50 nm thickness), we achieve 1.2% uniaxial tensile strain, as quantified through in situ atomic force microscopy measurements. Moreover, our strain-SPM integration reveals the direct correlation between progressive lattice deformation and phonon polariton dispersion alterations, as demonstrated through photo-induced force microscopy. This synergistic methodology establishes a paradigm for strain engineering by enabling simultaneous real-time nanoscale characterization and continuous strain manipulation.},

In this work, amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 films were grown by magnetron sputtering, and the effect of H 2 thermal annealing on the changes of microstructure and macroscopic physical properties of the materials was systematically investigated. The passivation of oxygen vacancy after H 2 annealing allows the photodetector (PD) constructed by the amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 film to be highly sensitive to 228 nm deep ultraviolet illumination with exceptional photoresponse behaviors. Under the deep UV light with 29.38 μ W/cm 2 irradiation at 228 nm, the photo-to-dark current ratio ( PDCR ), responsivity ( R ), detectivity ( D * ), response speed, and UV-visible rejection ratio ( R peak / R 400 nm ) were as high as 2.37 × 10 6 , 15.15 A/W, 2.35 × 10 13 Jones, 0.20/0.21 s, and 2.46 × 10 6 , respectively. In addition, the PD based on H 2 -annealed ZnGa 2 O 4 still exhibits a high PDCR of ∼10 3 under extremely minimal light intensity irradiation. This PD can sensitively record a brief “FJ” image generated by deep UV light. This work provides a feasible method for the construction of high-performance optoelectronic devices and systems based on amorphous ZnGa 2 O 4 .},

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) field-effect transistors (FETs) demonstrate notable enhancements in their performance after electron beam irradiation (EBI) of the contact regions. Systematic studies revealed an optimal relationship between EBI dose and MoS 2 layer thickness, with field-effect mobility ( μ EF ) as a key metric. Under an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and an irradiation dose of 600 µC/cm 2 , 7 nm thick MoS 2 FETs achieved a μ FE exceeding 150 cm 2 /V s, representing a tenfold improvement over untreated devices, while contact resistance decreased significantly to 1.4 kΩ µm, an order of magnitude reduction. The observed performance improvement is attributed to EBI-induced sulfur vacancies, which narrow the Schottky barrier width by approximately 45% and enhance electron injection efficiency. The results highlight that EBI-induced defect engineering is a promising method for optimizing electrical performance in 2D-based FETs.},

However, due to the large thermal expansion coefficient difference between perovskite and inorganic substrate, such heterostructure faces the challenge of thermal stress induced mechanical instability. This problem will be extremely severe for the thick perovskite film for radiation detection because the thermal strain energy accumulates with film thickness. Here, first by theoretical analysis, we quantized the thermal stress instability and found that a temperature variation of only 20 °C around room temperature will suffice to delaminate a 100 µm thick perovskite film from the substrate, which prediction agrees with experiments. We then proposed to promote the heterostructure's mechanical stability by increasing the perovskite nucleation rate on inorganic substrate to enhance the interface adhesive energy. Based on a sacrificial seeding layer, we realized stable interface between the thick perovskite film and the typical inorganic substrate, including indium tin oxide, silicon, and gallium nitride that can withstand at least 100 cycles of temperature variation between 25 and 150 °C and then fabricated high performance radiation detectors based on such heterostructures.},

This study reveals that the addition of Al 3+ can concurrently augment both the luminescence and photosensitization abilities of glutathione-protected gold nanoclusters. Time-resolved spectroscopic investigations indicate that Al 3+ induces intermolecular aggregation of gold nanoclusters, thereby promoting the radiative transition of the excited triplet state and enhancing the energy transfer efficiency to molecular oxygen.

  abstract     = {Lead-free Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 perovskite memristors have emerged as promising candidates for nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing due to their environmental friendliness and stability. However, their practical applications are hindered by severe endurance degradation during repetitive resistive switching (RS) cycles, attributed to incomplete RESET of conductive filaments (CFs) at grain boundaries (GBs). Herein, we systematically investigate this degradation mechanism and propose two innovative strategies to enhance device endurance: (1) grain engineering via thermal annealing to reduce GB density and (2) GB passivation using polyethylene glycol (PEG) additives. By optimizing annealing temperatures (100–250 °C), Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 films exhibit progressively larger grain sizes (158.6–295.2 nm), which delays high resistance state degradation by minimizing CF nucleation sites. However, residual GBs still permit partial Ag accumulation. To address this, PEG incorporation chemically passivates GBs, effectively blocking ion migration and trapping. The optimized PEG-passivated Ag/Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 :PEG/ITO memristor achieves remarkable improvements: endurance is extended from 100 to 1000 cycles, and the switching window expands from 6 to 176 times. Furthermore, the optimized device demonstrates continuous conductance modulation for multilevel storage and synaptic function emulation, enabling a 784–100–10 fully connected neural network to achieve 92.2% recognition accuracy on the MNIST dataset after 100 training epochs. This study elucidates the GB-mediated degradation mechanism and demonstrates that combining grain size optimization with GB passivation provides a universal framework for high-performance RS devices in neuromorphic computing and nonvolatile memory.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) material-based devices hold significant promise for next-generation electronics, yet their performance is often compromised by interfacial defects, material degradation, and electrode incompatibility. In this work, we report a transistor featuring a MoS 2 /graphite heterojunction with a platinum (Pt) bottom source and a mechanically transferred graphite top drain electrode. This architecture preserves the structural integrity of MoS 2 while optimizing interfacial properties. The device, fabricated via pre-patterned Pt deposition and sequential dry transfer of MoS 2 and graphite, exhibits exceptional performance metrics: a rectification ratio exceeding 10 6 , an ideality factor of ∼1.47, and a switching ratio of about 6 × 10 6 at room temperature. Energy band analysis reveals that rectification originates from asymmetric Schottky barriers at the MoS 2 /electrode interfaces, where negative drain–source bias enables carrier conduction, while positive bias blocks current via channel depletion. We demonstrate that Pt electrodes outperform Ag counterparts due to strategically engineered potential barriers that suppress electron leakage. Dynamic rectification measurements confirm reliability under switching cycles, enabling dual-mode functionality as a reconfigurable AND logic gate and an optoelectronic ternary-state output unit. This work establishes a scalable framework for high-frequency, energy-efficient nanoelectronics, effectively bridging the gap between the theoretical promise of 2D materials and their multifunctional practical applications.},

Mn 3 Ga possesses the highest Néel temperature among this family, providing huge potential for realistic spintronic device application. However, the small anomalous Hall conductivity of Mn 3 Ga makes it lack competitiveness. In this paper, c axis oriented Mn 3 Ga thin films with D0 19 hexagonal structure were prepared by optimizing the MgO(111) substrate temperature. Large anomalous Hall resistivity up to 1.53 μ Ω cm at 300 K is observed for (0002) oriented Mn 3 Ga film grown at 450 °C, corresponding to a Hall conductivity of about 30 Ω −1 cm −1 . Further analysis indicates that the skew-scattering mechanism, which is attributable to the presence of a small amount of the D0 22 -Mn 3 Ga phase, is the main source for the large Hall conductivity observed here. These results raise the intriguing prospect of Mn 3 Ga films as a key component in antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {This study micromagnetically investigates the intricate interplay among threshold current, constriction geometry-induced demagnetizing fields, and applied out-of-plane (OOP) magnetic fields in nano-constriction spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs). While the threshold current scales linearly with magnetic damping at a fixed OOP field, a distinct non-monotonic behavior emerges with varying OOP field strength, giving rise to a tunable current–field minimum. This phenomenon is consistently observed across constriction widths ranging from 20 to 150 nm and is particularly pronounced in narrower constrictions. As the OOP angle decreases, the current–field minimum shifts toward lower field values, reflecting changes in spin-wave localization and spin-transfer torque efficiency. Analysis with an extended macrospin model reveals that the observed behavior results from transitions between distinct spin-wave localization regimes, each associated with varying degrees of radiation losses, driven by geometry-induced demagnetizing fields under different OOP field strengths. These findings provide key insight into the complex auto-oscillation dynamics of nano-constriction SHNOs and establish a strategic pathway to optimize current–field conditions, paving the way for energy-efficient and scalable SHNO networks in neuromorphic and unconventional computing applications.},

The well-known 2D ferromagnets, such as CrI 3 , Cr 2 Ge 2 Te 6 , and Fe 3 GeTe 2 monolayers, are characterized by centrosymmetric crystal structures. In contrast, ferromagnetic ordering in 2D noncentrosymmetric materials remains an underexplored area. Here, we report a Janus ferromagnet, Cr 2 Ge 2 Se 3 Te 3 with inversion symmetry breaking, through first-principles calculations. This monolayer can undergo a ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic transformation and a metal–semiconductor transition under different strains. Additionally, the strength of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) can be modulated by electric field or strain. In particular, the magnetization easy axis can be altered from in-plane to out-of-plane under strain. We find that Te 3 atoms play a key role in determining the MAE, where contributions are primarily from p z / p y and p x / p y orbitals. This study of Janus ferromagnetic materials has provided a promising platform for the research on the control of magnetism by strain or electric field.},

Among them, CaSnO 3 possesses the widest bandgap, yet reported mobilities vary widely and are highly sample-dependent, leaving its intrinsic limit unclear. Here, we present ab initio calculations of electron mobility in CaSnO 3 across a range of temperatures and doping levels, using state-of-the-art methods that explicitly account for free-carrier screening in electron-phonon interactions. We identify the dominant limiting mechanism to be the long-range longitudinal optical phonon scattering, which is significantly suppressed at high doping due to free-carrier screening, leading to enhanced phonon-limited mobility. While ionized impurity scattering emerges as a competing mechanism at carrier concentrations up to ∼ 10 20 cm −3 , the phonon scattering reduction dominates, yielding a net mobility increase with predicted room-temperature values reaching about twice the highest experimental report. Our work highlights the substantial untapped conductivity in CaSnO 3 , establishing it as a compelling ultrawide bandgap semiconductor for transparent and high-power electronic applications.},

The sensor demonstrates a rapid response time of 80 ms and a linear electrical output in response to gentle airflow ranging from 0.5 to 3 m/s under bending conditions.

In this study, we investigate the temporal coherence properties of excitons in cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O) using interferometric Fourier spectroscopy. We reveal a coherence time of approximately 24 ps and a homogeneous linewidth of 0.017 nm (55 μ eV) at 4.7 K under non-resonant two-photon excitation. We also analyze the impact of relaxation, scattering, and the experimental setup on the decrease in coherence time. The 1S orthoexciton shows robust photoluminescence intensity and negligible spectral diffusion over 120 min. These results suggest that Cu 2 O presents itself as an exceptional material for generating indistinguishable single photons, demonstrating considerable potential for advanced applications in quantum photonics.},

  abstract     = {Chemically robust III-nitrides (III-N) with bandgaps in the visible spectral range are critical for advancing emerging technologies such as solar-driven photocatalysis and optoelectronics. Conventional methods for bandgap reduction of GaN, such as increasing indium content in InGaN alloys, are limited by lattice mismatch strain-induced defects that compromise device performance. Incorporating small number of anions like arsenic (As) or antimony (Sb) offers an alternative through significant band bowing in GaN; however, achieving high visible emission efficiency remains challenging for in situ epitaxial incorporation due to thermodynamic barriers of limited solubility. This study demonstrates high-temperature (550 and 1000 °C) ion implantation as an effective strategy to tailor the spectral response of various GaN semiconductor structures into the visible range, achieving bright room-temperature photoluminescence at ∼485 and ∼550 nm for As- and Sb-related emissions, respectively. Notably, the implanted impurity concentration is only at the ∼1 × 10 19 cm −3 level and localized at a depth of ∼30 nm below the surface. Based on density functional theory calculations, the observed As-related emission arises from a combined effect of valence band edge shifting by As replacing N isoelectronically and an Arsenic interstitial (As i 3+ ) defect level formation. The Sb-related emission was attributed only to the substitutional Sb in N site (Sb N 0 ) related band energy shift, as previously reported for epitaxial incorporation. This work establishes high-temperature ion implantation as a viable technique to enable effective concurrent impurity activation and crystal damage repair, opening pathways for deep-level defect and bandgap engineering in GaN for energy conversion and photonic and quantum applications.},

To address this challenge, we employ swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation—516 MeV Xe ions—on Pt/SrTiO 3 /Nb:SrTiO 3 devices, introducing controlled ion track defects that guide filament formation. The irradiated memristors demonstrate remarkable performance improvements, achieving a lower SET voltage of 0.65 V (compared to 0.85 V for unirradiated devices), extended retention (>10 6 s vs <10 5 s), and superior stability (σ/μ = 0.06/0.06 vs 0.14/0.04). Moreover, these devices reliably emulate synaptic plasticity with minimal cycle-to-cycle variations (<7.2%), enabling high-fidelity neuromorphic applications. When deployed in simulated neural networks for handwritten digit recognition, the irradiated memristors attain a recognition accuracy of 91.6%, showcasing their robustness in real-time computing tasks.

Unlike conventional TMDs, Janus TMDs lack mirror symmetry and exhibit a built-in in-plane dipole due to their asymmetric atomic configuration. A larger electronegativity gradient across the Janus TMDs leads to enhanced charge redistribution at the vdWH interface and a stronger in-plane dipole, resulting in unusual Fermi-level pinning (FLP). The calculated pinning factors for 1T-TMDs/MoSTe and 1T-TMDs/WSTe vdWHs are particularly low, reflecting a strong FLP effect. Despite the wide variation in work functions among the 1T-TMDs, their Fermi levels are consistently pinned near the band edges of MoSTe and WSTe, enabling quasi-Ohmic or Ohmic p -type and n -type contacts. Furthermore, the vdWHs exhibit low tunneling-specific resistivity, confirming their potential for ultra-low contact resistance applications in next-generation single-layer transistors.},

  abstract     = {The development of ultraviolet (UV) heterojunction photodetectors plays a critical role in a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, biomedical imaging, and secure communications. In this study, we present self-powered solar-blind UV photodetectors based on a vanadium dioxide (VO 2 )/silicon carbide (SiC) heterojunction. The integration of the narrow-bandgap VO 2 film with the wide-bandgap SiC creates a Z-type heterojunction, which significantly enhances photocurrent due to the built-in electric field at the interface. Furthermore, a notable increase in photocurrent is achieved by the deposition of gold nanoparticles on the device's surface. This modification enhances the local electric field via the plasmonic effects, thereby further improving photocurrent. The synergistic effect of the plasmonic field enhancement effect and the built-in electric field of the heterojunction enhances the generation, separation, and transport efficiency of photogenerated carriers, ultimately resulting in a superior photocurrent response. The self-powered UV heterojunction photodetector offers a promising strategy for the advancement of SiC-based optoelectronic devices.},

Revealing the dynamics of octahedral distortion and ion migration during these transitions is vital to understanding their exceptional characteristics. This study reveals the atomic-scale dynamics of phase transitions induced by ion migration in mixed halide perovskites CsPbBrCl 2 using an integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscope. Unlike pure perovskites, the orthorhombic-to-cubic transition in mixed halide perovskites involves octahedral distortions and halogen migration. This ion migration facilitates a uniform halogen distribution within the structure, correcting the initially uneven arrangement. The dynamics of octahedral distortions are also examined, with accurate changes in Pb-X bond lengths and distortion angles identified throughout the transition. This cubic phase helps suppress ion migration, as supported by first-principles calculations. These in situ observations enhance the fundamental understanding of octahedral distortions and ion migration in halide perovskites, providing valuable insights for the design of stable perovskite materials.},

  abstract     = {The in situ exsolution process for metallic Co is crucial for developing low-cost and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on perovskite materials. However, traditional exsolution methods normally require working in a hydrogen-reducing atmosphere. To address these limitations, by introducing nanodiamond (ND) into La 0.7 Sr 0.2 Fe 0.8 Co 0.2 O 3 (LSFC), Co nanoparticles (NPs) were exsolved on the surface after thermal treatment. Owing to the unique sp 2 /sp 3 hybrid structure of ND, the electron transfer at high temperature enhances the electron density on the ND surface, creating a reducing environment for the exsolution of Co NPs. The electrocatalyst exhibits significantly reduced overpotentials (265 mV at 10 mA cm −2 and 327 mV at 100 mA cm −2 ), a small Tafel slope of 52.14 mV dec −1 , and good stability (88.9% of initial current density after a chronoamperometric durability test). This enhancement primarily results from the exsolution of Co NPs, which increases the number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations explain the role of ND in improving OER performance. This approach holds great promise for innovating various energy storage and conversion technologies.},

In contrast, the EuSe film grown on the BLG substrate has various in-plane rotational domains. The electronic band structures of the EuSe films are experimentally characterized by in situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, showing a semiconductive nature with the Eu 4 f band as the top of the valence band. The bandgap size of EuSe grown on BLG is further determined as about 2.8 eV via low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

The ZrTe 3 interconnects fabricated with a conventional photolithography process show high contact resistance, low breakdown current density, and electromigration-dominated structural breakdown characteristics. By supplementing a reactive ion etching step to reduce contact resistance, the breakdown current density and structural characteristics change significantly. Further contact resistance reduction by adopting a transfer process promotes significantly increased breakdown current density and distinct thermal decomposition-dominated structural characteristics.

The development of metasurfaces offers an approach to overcoming the complexities and bulkiness of conventional zoom systems. Most current tunable zoom metalenses only adjust focus in axial or transverse directions and lack multi-dimensional light field adjustment capabilities. In this study, a dual-polarization responsive three-dimensional zoom metalens based on the Moiré lens effect was designed. The metalens can provide continuous three-dimensional control of the focal point by adjusting the rotation angles of the three metasurfaces, achieving micrometer-level positioning accuracy across the entire spatial range. Furthermore, the metalens exhibits phase modulation characteristics associated with chirality. Specifically, when the incident light is excited in different circular polarization states (right-handed and left-handed), it produces a focal field distribution that depends on the polarization state. This is important for acquiring multi-dimensional information and enhancing target features in complex scenes. The metalens achieves axial zoom ranges of 1–6.5× for right handed circularly polarized light and 1–5.7× for left-handed circularly polarized light, with lateral deflection angles of ±12.5° and ±15.4°, respectively. The focusing efficiencies reach 65.2% and 67.1% for right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. This dual-polarization three-dimensional zoom metalens shows great promise for machine vision, microscopic imaging, and dynamic three-dimensional tracking, advancing multifunctional integrated optical systems.},

The disks act as perfect reflectors at the resonance frequency, and the energy becomes perfectly trapped between the disks, forming an FP-BIC when the distance between them satisfies the Fabry–Pérot quantization condition. We investigate the system both theoretically and experimentally, revealing how the total and radiative quality ( Q ) factor depends on the inter-disk distance. We gain valuable insights into the Fano features observed in the transmission spectra using the quasi-normal mode technique and temporal coupled-mode theory. Notably, we find that as the system approaches the BICs, the Fano asymmetry parameters diverge, resulting in a Lorentzian peak in the transmission spectrum. The experimentally measured radiative Q factor is on the order of 10 5 ⁠ , while the total Q factor, limited by material losses, remains around 10 3 ⁠ . These results open up new possibilities for utilizing BICs in microwave technology, with the potential to significantly enhance the performance of microwave devices.},

Results showed a clear dependence on metal type, with charge polarity and magnitude following a descending trend from positive to negative: Pb > Al > Fe > Cu > Sn. The observed trends correspond strongly with the triboelectric series, indicating that triboelectric charging is the primary charge generation mechanism. Other factors, such as electrochemical reactions, thermoelectric effects, wettability, and pre-existing droplet charge, showed limited influence.

Owing to diamond's high laser-induced damage threshold and exceptional thermal stability, the SC exhibits significant potential for long-term stable operation at high pump energies. Furthermore, simulations effectively corroborate experimental observations, indicating that longer crystals and smaller pump numerical apertures facilitate broader SC generation.

With this design, zeroth-, first-, and second-order differentiations are spatially separated, and the local linear polarization always orients toward the normal of optical edges for linearly polarized incidence. Thereby, selective edge subtractions can be carried out through simply rotating a polarizer. The design is verified in a photopatterned liquid crystal, whose electro-optical tunability enables a broadband operation across the entire visible spectrum. Rotating a polarizer confirms omnidirectional edge extraction in first- and second-order differentiations while preserving the zeroth-order bright field imaging.

Simulations reveal that synchronously displacing the first two defect layers toward the third layer significantly enhances the central defect mode's density of states (DOS), particularly in asymmetric configurations near the third defect layer. This asymmetry-induced DOS enhancement boosts dye emission efficiency. Experimentally, we use wedge-shaped LC films to continuously tune defect positions and observe that asymmetric structures near the third defect layer exhibit higher lasing intensity and a lower threshold. The threshold of the asymmetric structure could be reduced by a factor of 3.4 compared to the symmetric structure.

  abstract     = {Perovskite memristors have attracted considerable attention for their potential in emulating artificial synapses. However, the widespread use of the toxic lead-based perovskites poses significant challenges to futural application. In this work, we developed a lead-free memristor with an Ag/PMMA/Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 /ITO architecture, in which the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 halide perovskites functional layer was fabricated by physical vapor deposition. The memristor demonstrated a data retention time of 10 4 s and stable resistive switching behavior over 100 cycles under electrical pulses stimulation. Furthermore, it emulated a range of biologically relevant synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation, short-term plasticity, long-term plasticity, spike-amplitude-dependent plasticity, spike-number-dependent plasticity, and spike-duration-dependent plasticity. Capitalizing on its nonlinear dynamics and short-term memory characteristics, the device was further integrated into a reservoir computing (RC) system. The RC system demonstrated strong recognition performance and robustness when tested with distorted digital image datasets. These results suggest that the Cs 3 Cu 2 I 5 -based memristor provides a promising, environmentally friendly platform for next-generation artificial intelligence hardware.},
