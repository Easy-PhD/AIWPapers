  abstract     = {Jungle cats ( Felis chaus ) are one of the least studied felids with a widespread presence throughout the southern districts of West Bengal. During a survey through camera traps to document fishing cats ( Prionailurus viverrinus ), we recorded bycatch data of camera trap captured images of Jungle cats with their prey. Although the diet of Jungle cats has been extensively studied using genetic methods globally, this paper presents evidence of its prey items through camera trap data. We obtained 196 independent images of Jungle cats, with 31 showing them with prey. Our data indicates that rodents are its primary prey. The images also reveal that Jungle cats’ prey on domestic duck and other birds. We recommend organizing awareness camps among locals to reduce retaliation and ensure the safe coexistence of jungle cats in human settlement areas.},

  abstract     = {Predation is one of the most powerful selective forces driving evolution among animals, and one common form of defense against it is aposematism. The Mutillidae (Hymenoptera Aculeata), commonly known as velvet ants, are solitary parasitoid wasps that exhibit a range of colors, including shades of white, yellow, orange-red, and black. In some Hymenoptera, a distinct color pattern consisting of a black head, an orange or red mesosoma, and a black metasoma – referred to as the Black-Orange-Black (BOB) pattern – may function as an aposematic signal to deter predators, particularly in smaller species. To investigate the presence of this pattern in Mutillidae and its potential association with body size, we tested the hypothesis that the BOB pattern is more prevalent in smaller species. The total body length of the individuals was measured in millimeters (mm), and they were categorized as either displaying the BOB pattern or not (non-BOB, NBOB). A total of 448 individuals from various genera were analyzed, of which 79 exhibited the BOB pattern. The BOB pattern was more frequently observed among individuals measuring between 4.5 and 7.5 mm in body size, indicating that these individuals tended to be smaller compared to those with the NBOB pattern. A significant difference in body size was detected between the two patterns. These findings suggest that aposematism may serve as an effective defensive strategy, particularly concentrated in smaller body sizes, within this group already recognized for its diverse array of anti-predator adaptations.},

  abstract     = {Mimicry, particularly chromatic adaptation, is a defining characteristic of leaf and stick insects, which comprise phasmids (Insecta Phasmatodea). This study investigates substrate-induced color changes in three phasmid species: Extatosoma tiaratum, Hesperophasma sp. “La Ciénaga”, and Phyllium gantungense “Rizal”. For each species, two experimental groups were exposed to a grey-green lichen ( Evernia prunastri ) as a substrate, while two cages were set up with an artificial pink material. Control groups were reared on elmleaf blackberry ( Rubus ulmifolius ) alone; all groups were composed of at least 20 individuals. Using digital pictures, the RGB color channels of juveniles and adults were analyzed to quantify color variations. We revealed significant species-specific variations in color development responses related to substrates. In E. tiaratum , we did not observe a significant difference between adults reared over different substrates. However, digital image analyses revealed that E. tiaratum exhibited significant chromatic changes during development, especially among 11 juvenile females, suggesting a potential genetic predisposition for substrate-specific color adaptation. In the species P. gantungense , we did not find color changes during the experiment, indicating a lack of phenotypic plasticity in response to substrate variation. Hesperophasma sp. “La Ciénaga” showed minimal color changes; however, untreated juveniles naturally darkened as they matured, a trend that was inhibited in substrate-treated groups, indicating a potential influence of the substrate on natural color development. These findings highlight the species-specific nature of substrate-induced color variation in stick insects. Investigating the genetic and physiological mechanisms underlying these changes is essential for understanding the evolutionary dynamics and ecological adaptations of these insects. Further research in this area could reveal insights into the broader implications of phenotypic plasticity and environmental adaptation in phasmids.},

  abstract     = {Human disturbances are being increasingly recognized for their impact on the behavior of urban wildlife during the Anthropocene. This study was conducted to gain insights into the changes in population density of House sparrows ( Passer domesticus ) to different degrees of human disturbance during various stages of COVID-19. A “disturbance score” was computed by considering four variables: human movement, number of vehicles plying, number of shops opened, and ambient noise level. Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) was used to understand the influence of the disturbance variables on the House sparrows’ density among different phases of lockdown and across different sites. Our findings revealed that the second COVID wave exhibited the highest population density (number/ha) at 4.64 ± 0.941, followed by the first wave at 3.73 ± 1.21. In addition, our results suggest that lockdown phases and disturbance variables significantly influenced the sparrow population density. Furthermore, there were notable variations in sparrow population densities across the different lockdown phases. Similarly, the disturbance variables seem to influence the sparrow population density across the lockdown phases, except for the before-lockdown and first-wave lockdowns, possibly indicating a lag in the sparrows’ adaptive response to the changing urban environment. The findings have unveiled a significant pattern in the behavioral responses of sparrows to human disruptions. The decline in the presence of sparrows in areas with higher anthropogenic disturbances, following the relaxation of lockdown regulations indicates a potential shift of these birds to quieter sites. The capacity of sparrows to adjust their behavior has enabled them to take advantage of decreased disruptions, which could impact their documented population density. Thus, this study emphasizes the need to incorporate wildlife behavioral responses to human disturbances into urban planning and management strategies.},

  abstract     = {Aphids that infest cereal crops employ diverse survival strategies, including behavioral defenses to avoid parasitism. The Aphidiinae subfamily, particularly Aphidius platensis , plays an important role as a parasitoid in controlling cereal aphids. There is a lack of information on the behavioral aspects associated with aphids and parasitoids, along with their influence on parasitism rates. This study aimed to observe the apterous adult’s behavior of Rhopalosiphum padi , Schizaphis graminum , Metopolophium dirhodum , and Sitobion avenae and its parasitoid ( Aphidius platensis ) when exposed to each other and evaluate how these interactions reflect on parasitism rates. The behaviors were recorded (5 min) and analyzed using BORIS software. Parasitism rates were assessed by examining the presence of larvae and mummies. Schizaphis graminum was the highest recognized and accepted aphid species by A. platensis , with 95% of parasitism, followed by R. padi (68.3%), despite its ability to escape (walking), and S. avenae (13.2%), despite its kick behavior. Metopolophium dirhodum , with minimal kicking, was not parasitized. Our results showed that the parasitoid tends to be more aggressive (mainly probing and parasitizing) toward the host with which it has greatest parasitism ( S. graminum ). Aphid defensive behaviors were not sufficient to defend themselves, as parasitoid attacks were similar in those that walked and kicked more often. We observed that the parasitoid A. platensis behaved similarly on suitable and unsuitable hosts. This finding provides new information that can contribute to a better understanding of host–parasitoid interactions, which has implications for biological control strategies targeting aphids in winter cereals.},

  abstract     = {In many organisms, changes in environmental conditions trigger modifications in physiology and signaling for reproduction. In males, sexual maturation often prompts signaling that can convey information on fighting ability and mate quality, allowing adaptative sexual selection to act. Because predation can drive the evolution of sexual signals, insights from organisms exposed to low predation pressure will benefit sexual selection theory. Here, we exposed males and females of Microsternarchus sp. nov. “Ducke” (Gymnotiformes Hypopomidae) to simulate environmental conditions of the breeding season to investigate changes in electric signaling in a species that occurs in environments with low or absent predation pressure from electroreceptive predators. We induced sexual maturation, which was confirmed by visual inspection of female gonads. After sexual maturation, both sexes underwent major changes in Electric Organ Discharges (EOD), suggesting mutual signaling in electric communication before breeding pair formation. EOD parameters related to body length were intensified in sexually mature males and, as such, changes in male electric discharges observed after gonadal maturation exaggerate information on fighting ability and mate quality, as suggested for other electric fishes. Because polarity imbalance was high in both sexes and reproductive stages, our results support the hypothesis that predation pressure did not constrain the evolution of conspicuous EODs in this species, in favor of other adaptive mechanisms of mate choice.},

  abstract     = {Severe environments, characterized by high temperatures and scarce rainfall, challenge organisms and may lead them to display behavioral adaptations to live in such areas. While there is a significant amount of research on behavioral adaptations to severe environments on land, aquatic habitats remain relatively understudied. In this study, we selected a population of Sylviocarcinus pictus crabs from the semiarid region of Brazil to investigate, describe, and quantify the behavioral repertoire of adult crabs in a laboratory setting. In the laboratory, we filmed ( n = 10) adult crabs individually (five males and five females), for 72 consecutive hours. Subsequently, we analyzed and recorded their behaviors every 20 min, totaling ( n = 240) videos analyzed. Based on the observations, we then constructed an ethogram with nine behaviors grouped into four categories: quiescence, environmental exploration, feeding, and self-cleaning. Our results indicate that, regardless of sex ( P = 0.39), S. pictus individuals remained more quiescent during the light period ( P < 0.05), with males spending 82.71% of the time quiescent and females spending 91.96% of their time quiescent. Additionally, individuals showed a substantial increase in the frequencies of activity-related behaviors during the dark period ( P < 0.05), with no significant differences between sexes. Compared to other species, S. pictus proved to be even more quiescent, especially during the day, possibly in response to the harsh environmental conditions. In the natural environment, we observed crabs seeking shelter under rocks during the day, possibly as a response to high temperatures. These findings suggest that the crabs have developed behavioral strategies to optimize energy use in severe aquatic environments.},
