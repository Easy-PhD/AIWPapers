  abstract     = {Due to advent of sensors with less in weight, tiny in size and low power, it designates as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). However in recent times, the key issue is noted in WSN is reducing the lifetime of the system. Hence in this paper, an advanced selection of Cluster Head (CH) and optimal routing is implemented by utilizing the improved heuristic algorithm. The developed Hybrid Walrus and Chameleon Swarm Algorithm (HWCSA) is performed by optimally select the CH and the multi-objective functions with constraints like residual energy, distance, and delay are derived in the CH selection approach. Moreover, the same HWCSA is used for performing the routing process to provide better communication between Base Station (BS) and sensor nodes. Here, multi-objective function with constraints like throughput, distance, packet delivery ratio, and hop count are optimally derived by optimizing the shortest path. In the end, the designed HWCSA approach is estimated with several performance metrics. Validating cost function analysis, the proposed model achieves 4%, 7.6%, 9.4%, and 8.5% better than BMO, OOA, WOA, and CSA algorithms. Throughout the empirical analysis, the designed model attains effective performance than state-of-the-art-methods.},

  abstract     = {Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), an proactive risk management approach, has been widely applied in a variety of industries, especially in aircraft industry. In the process of implementation, the influence and uncertainty among different experts is inevitable. In order to handle the uncertainty in the assessments of FMEA experts, Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was introduced to FMEA for its flexibility and superiority in coping with uncertain and subjective assessments. However, traditional Dempster combination rule have difficulty in dealing with highly conflicting evidence that given from FMEA experts’ assessments. Moreover, experts themselves may influence each other though process such as chatting, judging, decision-making and voting. In this paper, we explore the problem of conflict evidence fusion from a correlation perspective among FMEA experts. We use ambiguity measure and Gaussian distribution to deal with the highly conflicting evidence. We use ambiguity measure to calculate the variance of Gaussian distribution. Then, we use Gaussian model to generalize expert assessments. After that, we use Dempster combination rule to fuze assessments from different experts. Finally, we calculate the risk priority number to rank the risk level of the FMEA items. The experiment results in the air system of an aircraft turbofan engine shows the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Heart disease remains a major global cause of mortality, underscoring the need for advancements in early detection and prognosis to enhance patient recovery. This study proposes an innovative framework integrating deep learning (DL) models and optimal resource allocation strategies to improve heart disease detection and prognosis. The framework begins with rigorous preprocessing of the Internet of Things (IoT) captured Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, employing min–max normalization, and advanced median filtering techniques for noise reduction and baseline wander correction. Statistical features are extracted from the preprocessed data, while features such Improved Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), RR interval, R peak, and PR interval are derived from ECG signals. These features are then augmented using a min–max technique to enhance dataset diversity and model robustness. Furthermore, the study introduces a hybrid model combining a Deep Residual Network (DRN) and an Improved Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit for severity classification heart disease detection, leveraging augmented features. Optimal resource allocation is facilitated by the Improved Walrus Optimization Algorithm (WaOA), optimizing ventilator, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed, medical staff, and medication allocation based on predicted disease severity. Evaluation with real-world datasets demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and resource utilization efficiency, highlighting the transformative potential of IoT and AI-driven approaches in cardiovascular healthcare.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) consists of a massive count of connected devices with different sensing support, particularly in medical health constraints sensing. In these summaries, secure communication and data collection to centralized servers is rather difficult for preventing the occurrence of diverse attacks for illegal data access. To tackle these problems, this task plans to design and implement the FoG-based secure data management system in IoT-WSN using adaptive encryption and decryption processes. As the FoG server is away from the corresponding aggregator node, it is transmitted via the other nodes using the proposed modified Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)-based encryption process. For secured data transmission the designed method undergoes two main stages as message receiving stage, and the message-extraction stage. The hybridized meta-heuristic algorithm termed Jaya-Galactic Swarm Optimization (J-GSO) is used for modifying the ECC with an optimized key. From the simulation findings, the performance of the suggested scheme at the data size of three bytes is 3.08%, 3.22%, 3.65%, and 3.33% better than the MFO-m-ECC, PSO-m-ECC, GSO-m-ECC, and JA-m-ECC at the ECC curve variation of “secp192r1”. Experimental results reveal the superiority of the designed method when tested with baseline schemes regarding time complexity, space complexity, and cost function.},
