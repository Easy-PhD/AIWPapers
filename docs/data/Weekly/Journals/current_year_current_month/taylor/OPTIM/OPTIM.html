To ensure global convergence of the two new algorithms, we assume only that the mapping is continuous and the solution set of its dual variational inequality is nonempty. In particular, we do not need to assume any generalized monotonicity of the mapping. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.},

In this work, we investigate a bilevel optimization problem where the upper-level and the lower-level constraints incorporate uncertainty. Reducing the problem into a single-level nonlinear and nonsmooth program, necessary optimality conditions are then developed in terms of Clarke subdifferentials. Our approach consists of using the optimal value reformulation together with a partial calmness condition for the robust counterpart of the initial problem. To aid in the detection of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) multipliers, an appropriate nonsmooth Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification is introduced. There are examples highlighting both our results and the limits of certain past studies.},

At first, some theoretical results are provided on the relation between (weakly) efficient solutions of an MOP and optimal solutions of the related numerical method. Moreover, we consider some deficiencies in different scalarization approaches given in the literature and try to fill some gaps in these works. Hence, by considering appropriate limitations, we provide sufficient conditions for ( ε -)properly efficient and ( ε -)efficient solutions of an MOP via scalarization techniques. Then, an algorithm for approximating the Pareto front of MOPs is presented. The main purpose of this algorithm is to generate efficient points on the Pareto front with a uniform distribution. One advantage of this algorithm, compared to some other algorithms, is that in each iteration of the algorithm, more than one efficient point located on the Pareto border can be generated. The new algorithm is implemented by applying the modified Pascoletti–Serafini, the unified direction, and the modified normal boundary intersection scalarization techniques, and then the procedures are considered on different test problems including (non-)convex and discrete Pareto fronts. The capability of the numerical method is shown by comparing the results with the algorithms in the literature. To compare the algorithms, measures of coverage and spacing metric indicators are used.},

To remedy this problem, a new continuously differentiable filled function with an easily adjustable parameter is constructed. According to the theoretical analysis of the filled function, a new easy-to-implement filled function algorithm is designed utilizing the efficient local search algorithm based on gradient information.
