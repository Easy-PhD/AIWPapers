  abstract     = {In statistical learning for survival data, survival trees are favored for their capacity to detect complex relationships beyond parametric and semiparametric models. Despite this, their prediction accuracy is often suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a new method based on super learning to improve the within-node estimation and overall survival prediction accuracy, while preserving the interpretability of the survival tree. Simulation studies reveal the proposed method's superior finite sample performance compared to conventional approaches for within-node estimation in survival trees. Furthermore, we apply this method to analyze the North Central Cancer Treatment Group Lung Cancer Data, cardiovascular medical records from the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology, and the integrated genomic data of ovarian carcinoma with The Cancer Genome Atlas project.},

  abstract     = {Spatiotemporal point process models have a rich history of effectively modeling event data in space and time. However, they are sometimes neglected due to the difficulty of implementing them. There is a lack of packages with the ability to perform inference for these models, particularly in python. Thus we present BSTPP a python package for Bayesian inference on spatiotemporal point processes. It offers three different kinds of models: space-time separable Log Gaussian Cox, Hawkes, and Cox Hawkes. Users may employ the predefined trigger parameterizations for the Hawkes models, or they may implement their own trigger functions with the extendable Trigger module. For the Cox models, posterior inference on the Gaussian processes is sped up with a pre-trained Variational Auto Encoder (VAE). The package includes a new flexible pre-trained VAE. We validate the model through simulation studies and then explore it by applying it to shooting data in Chicago.},

  abstract     = {In statistical diagnosis and sensitivity analysis, the local influence method plays a crucial role and is sometimes more advantageous than other methods. The mixed Poisson integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (INGARCH) model is built on a flexible family of mixed Poisson distributions. It not only encompasses the negative binomial INGARCH model but also allows for the introduction of the Poisson-inverse Gaussian INGARCH model and the Poisson generalized hyperbolic secant INGARCH model. This paper applies the local influence analysis method to count time series data within the framework of the mixed Poisson INGARCH model. For parameter estimation, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is utilized. In the context of local influence analysis, two global influence methods (generalized Cook distance and Q-distance) and four perturbations–case weights perturbation, data perturbation, additive perturbation, and scale perturbation–are considered to identify influential points. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulations and analysis of a real data set.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we revisit the problem of decomposing a signal into a tendency and a residual. The tendency describes an executive summary of a signal that encapsulates its notable characteristics while disregarding seemingly random, less interesting aspects. Building upon the Intrinsic Time Decomposition (ITD) and information-theoretical analysis, we introduce two alternative procedures for selecting the tendency from the ITD baselines. The first is based on the maximum extrema prominence, namely the maximum difference between extrema within each baseline. Specifically this method selects the tendency as the baseline from which an ITD step would produce the largest decline of the maximum prominence. The second method uses the rotations from the ITD and selects the tendency as the last baseline for which the associated rotation is statistically stationary. We delve into a comparative analysis of the information content and interpretability of the tendencies obtained by our proposed methods and those obtained through conventional low-pass filtering schemes, particularly the Hodrik–Prescott (HP) filter. Our findings underscore a fundamental distinction in the nature and interpretability of these tendencies, highlighting their context-dependent utility with emphasis in multi-scale signals. Through a series of real-world applications, we demonstrate the computational robustness and practical utility of our proposed tendencies, emphasizing their adaptability and relevance in diverse time series contexts.},

The simulated censoring times of the competing events are generated with a multiple imputation technique and the survival function of right censoring times. The performance of suggested methods is evaluated by comparing with the result of a simple imputation method under several distributions and sample sizes.

The Heckman selection model is a key econometric tool for estimating relationships while addressing selection bias. Relying on the EM-type algorithm, we develop global and local influence analyses based on the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function, exploring four perturbation schemes for local influence analysis. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostic measures in identifying influential observations, we conducted a simulation study, complemented by two real-data applications that demonstrate how these techniques can effectively identify influential points.

This study proposes an objective Bayesian trend filtering method based on model selection. The procedure followed in this study estimates the functions based on adaptive piecewise polynomial regression models with two components. First, we determine the intervals with varying trends using Bayesian binary segmentation and then evaluate the most reasonable trend via Bayesian model selection at these intervals. This trend filtering procedure follows Bayesian model selection that uses intrinsic priors, which eliminated any subjective input. Additionally, we prove that the proposed method using these intrinsic priors was consistent when applied to large sample sizes. The behavior of the proposed Bayesian trend filtering procedure is compared with the trend filtering using a simulation study and real examples. Finally, we apply the proposed method to detect the variance change points under mean changes, whereas the existing methods yielded inaccurate estimates of the variance change points when the mean varied smoothly, as the sudden-change assumption was violated in such cases.},
