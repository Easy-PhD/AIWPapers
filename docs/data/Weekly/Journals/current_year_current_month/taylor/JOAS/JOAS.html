  abstract     = {We conduct gene mutation rate estimations via developing mutual information and Ewens sampling based convolutional neural network (CNN) and machine learning algorithms. More precisely, we develop a systematic methodology through constructing a CNN. Meanwhile, we develop two machine learning algorithms to study protein production with target gene sequences and protein structures. The core of the CNN and machine learning approach is to address a two-stage optimization problem to balance gene mutation rates during protein production. To wit, we try to optimally coordinate the consistency between the given input DNA sequences and the given (or optimally computed) target ones through controlling their intermediate gene mutation rates. The purposes in doing so are aimed to conduct gene editing and protein structure prediction. For example, after the gene mutation rates are estimated, the computing complexity of protein structure prediction will be reduced to a reasonable degree. Our developed CNN numerical optimization scheme consists of two newly designed machine learning algorithms. The stochastic gradients for the two algorithms are designed according to the Kuhn-Tucker conditions with boundary constraints and with the support of Ewens sampling, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) mutual information, and codon optimization techniques. The associated learning rate bounds are explicitly derived from the method and the two algorithms are numerically implemented. The convergence and optimality of the algorithms are mathematically proved. To illustrate the usage of our study, we also conduct a real-world data implementation.},

  abstract     = {Overdispersion is a common phenomenon in genetic data, such as gene expression count data. In genetic association studies, it is important to investigate the association between a gene expression and a set of genetic variants from a pathway. However, existing approaches for pathway analysis are primarily designed for continuous and binary outcomes and are not applicable to overdispersed count data. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to analyze the association between an overdispersed count response and a set of low-frequency genetic variants in negative binomial regression. We derive score-type test statistics for both fixed and random effects of genetic variants, and further introduce a novel procedure for efficiently combining these two statistics for global testing. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method tends to be more powerful than existing methods under a wide range of scenarios. Additionally, we apply the proposed method to a colorectal cancer study, demonstrating its power in identifying associations between gene expression and somatic mutations.},

In the current investigation, under an adaptive cluster sampling approach, we propose a ratio-product-logarithmic type estimator employing a single auxiliary variable for the estimation of finite population variance. The bias and mean square error of the proposed estimator are developed by using simulation as well as real data sets. The study results show that for estimating the finite population variance, the proposed estimator outperforms the competing estimators.},

  abstract     = {When analyzing real data sets, statisticians often face the question that the data are heterogeneous and it may not necessarily be possible to model this heterogeneity directly. One natural option in this case is to use the methods based on finite mixtures. The key question in these techniques often is what is the best number of mixtures or, depending on the focus of the analysis, the best number of sub-populations when the model is otherwise fixed. Moreover, when the distribution of the response variable deviates from meeting the assumptions, it's common to employ an appropriate transformation to align the distribution with the model's requirements. To solve the problem in the mixture regression context we propose a technique based on the scaled Box-Cox transformation for normal mixtures. The specific focus here is on mixture regression for longitudinal data, the so-called trajectory analysis. We present interesting practical results as well as simulation experiments to demonstrate that our method yields reasonable results. Associated R-programs are also provided.},

  abstract     = {The paper first highlights important drawbacks and biases related to the common use of time-rescaling to assess the goodness-of-fit (Gof) of self-exciting temporal point process (SETPP) models. Then it presents a new predictive time-rescaling approach leading to an asymptotically unbiased Gof framework for general SETPPs in the case of single observed trajectories. The predictive approach focuses on forecasting accuracy and addresses the bias problem resulting from the plugged-in estimated parameters. Dawid's prequential approach is used and the models' checking is mainly based on the forecasting accuracy of arrival times. These times are transformed, using sequentially estimated parameters, into random vectors which are proved to converge in probability under the null hypothesis and standard regulatory conditions to vectors of iid Exponential(1) rv's. Numerical experiments are used to compare the performances of the standard and predictive time-rescaling for Gof assessment of non-homogeneous Poisson and Hawkes self-exciting temporal processes. Data of Japanese seismic events are also used to illustrate the dynamic aspect of the proposed model-checking approach.},

  abstract     = {Inequality (concentration) curves such as Lorenz, Bonferroni, Zenga curves, as well as a new inequality curve – the D curve, are broadly used to analyse inequalities in wealth and income distribution in certain populations. Quantile versions of these inequality curves are more robust to outliers. We discuss several parametric estimators of quantile versions of the Zenga and D curves. A minimum distance (MD) estimator is proposed for these two curves and the indices related to them. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the MD estimator is proved. The MD estimator can also be used to estimate the inequality measures corresponding to the quantile versions of the inequality curves. The estimation methods considered are illustrated in the case of the Weibull model, which has many applications in life sciences, for example, to fit the precipitation data. In econometrics it is also considered to fit incomes, especially in the case when a significant share of population have low incomes, for example, in less developed countries or among low-paid jobs.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a causal inference estimation method for longitudinal observational studies with multiple outcomes. The method uses marginal structural models with inverse probability treatment weights (MSM-IPTWs). In developing the proposed method, we re-define the weights as a product of inverse weights at each time point, accounting for time-varying confounders and treatment exposures and possible correlation between and within (serial) the multiple outcomes. The proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and with an application to estimate the effect of HIV positivity awareness on condom use and multiple sexual partners using the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health (MLSFH) data. The simulation study shows that the joint MSM-IPTW performs well with coverage within the expected 95% level for a large sample size ( n = 1000) and moderate to strong between and within outcome correlation strength ( ρ j = 0.3 , 0.75, ρ k = 0.4 , 0.8) when the effects are similar. The joint MSM-IPTW performed relatively the same as the adjusted standard joint model when the treatment effect estimate was the same for the outcomes. In the application, HIV positivity awareness increased the usage of condoms and did not affect the number of sexual partners. We recommend using the proposed MSM-IPTWs to correctly control for time-varying treatment and confounders when estimating causal effects for longitudinal observational studies with multiple outcomes.},
