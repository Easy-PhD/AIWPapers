  abstract     = {This paper presents a compact atomic force microscope (AFM) model based on a singular perturbation approach tailored for systems with relatively high cantilever stiffness. This method simplifies the model, allowing for a faster response to the Van der Waals interaction forces between the measurement sample and the cantilever tip. For scenarios where the tip-sample interaction force is unknown, the proposed model serves as the basis for designing a nonlinear, near-optimal feedback control technique. This control approach guides the cantilever tip along a desired trajectory while maintaining it vertically aligned at the balance point of attraction and repulsion forces. Additionally, a cascaded high-gain observer is designed to estimate AFM dynamics using only the measured piezo tube position. Combined with the near-optimal feedback control, this observer addresses the output feedback control problem. The proposed controller is validated through a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {The controllability of complex temporal networks is an area of research focused on understanding how to guide or influence the behaviour of dynamic. Structural controllability is considered as one of the most prominent network controllability methods. Structural controllability uses the maximum matching algorithm to find the minimum set of control nodes. The maximum matching algorithm on temporal networks is a class of NP-hard problems. In this paper, a novel method based on temporal ACO algorithm is proposed to solve the maximum matching problem in structural controllability. The ACO algorithm has been adapted to temporal networks. The results of implementing the proposed method on real-world datasets demonstrate that the ACO algorithm has a good performance and has converged to the optimal solution with high speed. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher efficiency in finding driver nodes and algorithm execution speed compared to the basic structural controllability.},

Most existing results, however, only consider weak stability, where the bounds only decay with time. In this paper, we provide a method for calculating the maximum overshoot and the decay rate for strong global uniform exponential stability for nonlinear switched impulsive systems. We consider mode constrained switching, where not all transitions between subsystems are allowed, and where subsystems may exhibit unstable dynamics in the flow and/or jump maps. Based on direct and reverse mode-dependent average dwell-time and activation-time constraints, we derive stability bounds that can be improved by considering longer switching sequences. We provide an example that shows how to ensure the stability robustness of nonlinear systems with a global state weak linearisation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the problem of anti-windup compensator (AWC) design for implementation in the autonomous guidance and control of quadrotors is addressed. The flight environment contains obstacles with no prior knowledge of their locations. Instead, obstacles location are determined in real time, and the locations are used by a guidance algorithm for avoidance. Wind disturbances are also considered since their presence can potentially result in saturation of the propellers. When this occurs, the flight can become unstable, leading to a crash. Designing an AWC to mitigate the effects of saturation in the control system of a quadrotor can be a challenging task due to the heavy couplings and complex nonlinear dynamics. For this reason, we propose a new structure to design a static AWC-based control system to solve this problem. The effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results are verified by comparing results from simulation experiments.},

We also consider the insurer's ambiguity towards the external source. Specifically, the intensity of the number of events from the external stochastic source cannot be estimated accurately, and hence is treated as a random variable following the insurer's prior distribution. We investigate the mean-variance optimisation problem under smooth ambiguity, which aims to search the optimal strategies in average case. By solving the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(HJB) equations and using the Lagrange multiplier method, we derive the closed-form expressions for the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies. The results suggest that reinsurance may take two different forms, and that reinsurance strategies and investment strategies are influenced by each other. Finally, we analyse the property of strategies under one single factor and the interaction between thinning dependence and smooth ambiguity.},

This combined ORCA-DWA approach effectively combines the speed of DWA planning with the preferred speed of the ORCA algorithm, it not only solves the problem of the ORCA algorithm's difficulty in determining the preferred speed, but also does not deviate from its optimal trajectory while avoiding obstacles. Additionally, an improved dynamic windowing method is proposed to enhance the adaptability to the environment. As a result, the mobile robot can not only use the DWA algorithm to achieve global path optimisation during navigation, but also achieve obstacle avoidance with the shortest time and path while following the robot's own constraints and considering the robot's radius. Simulation results prove that the method can greatly reduce the length and time of path planning and show that this new algorithm can make the robot's speed smoother.},

Since only weak solutions of the NSEs exist globally while global existence of their strong/smooth solutions is a millennium problem, point-wise fluid forces and moments acting on the ocean vehicle are not able to bound. This difficulty is overcome by an appropriate design of control laws and stability analysis of the closed-loop system including the NSEs using a proper extension of the vehicle body. The proposed control design ensures existence of a weak solution and practical exponential stability of the closed-loop system.

It has been proved that the K-L divergence between innovations in presence and absence of the attack will intrude the detection threshold if the secret coding matrix is designed appropriately. Sufficient conditions for the detection threshold to be intruded are provided, which essentially provide clues on how the coding matrix should be designed.

A new approach is introduced to study the consensus tracking problem with a dynamic leader. The proposed strategy utilises a resilient event-triggered consensus tracking control framework, which comprises an event-triggered controller (ETC) and an event-triggering mechanism (ETM). By establishing matrix inequalities and considering parameters associated with DoS attacks and average dwell time, sufficient conditions for solving H ‚àû consensus tracking problem are derived. One characteristic of the designed ETM is that events only occur at the triggering or switching time, preventing Zeno behaviour. Furthermore, a resilient event-triggered control strategy is suggested to tackle the containment problem with multiple dynamic leaders.

Second, each oscillator uses information received from its neighbours to estimate the frequency of leader oscillator and its neighbours' states. Based on estimated frequencies and states, we design an adaptive synchronisation algorithm for CHOs to solve synchronisation problem. We prove that CHOs, under proposed synchronisation algorithm, reach state synchronisation, and there is no Zeno behaviour. In the end, a simulation is presented to check proposed synchronisation algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Recently proposed monotone tube boundaries enhance performance but exacerbate the challenge of the entry capture problem (ECP). This article addresses the ECP under monotone tube boundaries and employs optimal control strategies combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance performance in unknown state situations. By utilising error scaling functions (ESF), the proposed method effectively confines the error to a predefined neighbourhood in a specified time, without knowing the specific value of the initial error. Furthermore, this article innovatively incorporates the actor-critic structure into the monotone tube boundaries, significantly enhancing system performance. Due to the condition of state immeasurability, a neural network (NN)-based state observer is designed to estimate the states of the system. Additionally, command filters are used to simplify the multiple derivative calculations in traditional backstepping methods, addressing the ‚Äòexplosion of complexity‚Äô problem. Mathematical derivations and simulation confirm its ability to meet predefined performance criteria.},

Based on the Bounded Real lemma (BRL) of these systems, a simple Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) condition is obtained for the nominal case. The same condition is reshaped to solve the control problem for systems with polytopic-type uncertainties. The paper also addresses the stochastic H 2 counterpart of the H ‚àû control problem for both nominal and uncertain polytopic cases. The approach proposed in the paper offers a simple and efficient solution to the H ‚àû and H 2 control problems, especially for systems with uncertainties, and is expected to have practical applications in control engineering. The paper includes a numerical example that demonstrates the results of the various solution methods in this study.},

A novel data-driven control approach is developed in this paper based on low-gain technique, output regulation, differential game theory, and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). Unlike existing approaches to the data-driven optimal synchronisation problem, our method eliminates the need for an initially admissible stabilising control policy, and the proposed distributed control law ensures asymptotic tracking even in the presence of both modelling disturbances and unmodeled disturbances.},

  abstract     = {This paper concentrates on dealing with two problems of 8/6-type Multi-phase Switched Reluctance Machines (MSRMs). Two problems are the stabilisation of rotational speed and minimising the output torque ripple for this machine. For the first issue, the output torque of 8/6 MSRMs is stabilised by determining an optimal holding time for the switching process. Minimising the total output torque ripple facilitates the 8/6 MSRMs operating more smoothly and counteracts¬†the mechanical vibrations. For the second issue, this paper proposed a new synchronisation of high-order harmonic eradication mechanisms (HF-HEM) based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network and a hyperbolic-secant-like-function hierarchical method. The proposed scheme not only eliminates the high-frequency harmonics but also stabilises the rotational speed of 8/6 MSRMs at the desired values. Finally, the mathematical analyses are given by theorems. All the stable performance and impressive effectiveness of the proposals will be validated in the simulation section.},

First, an adaptive disturbance observer is presented for accurately estimating the lumped disturbances within predefined time. Second, a predefined-time estimator is constructed to obtain estimations of the tracking errors. Finally, a novel event-triggered fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to realise consensus tracking within a predefined time. The Lyapunov method is used to demonstrate that MAS can realise the practical predefined-time leader‚Äìfollower consensus and rule out Zeno behaviour completely. Furthermore, in contrast to existing findings, the settling time of the presented predefined-time control scheme is determined entirely by a preset value, which benefits the construction of the control scheme based on convergence time requirements. Finally, the presented scheme is applied to the attitude of cooperative control of multi-spacecraft systems, and numerical simulations confirm their effectiveness and superiority.},

  abstract     = {This paper utilises the disturbance rejection technique to address a category of Bouc‚ÄìWen (BW) hysteresis systems, employing the equivalent input disturbance (EID) method. A novel output feedback hysteresis state estimator is formulated to estimate the virtual hysteresis state. Additionally, a constructed EID estimator is utilised to estimate the impact of the exogenous disturbances on the proposed system. It is necessary to construct a novel control law that integrates the EID estimation to provide adequate disturbance rejection performance. Utilising both a Lyapunov approach and the EID technique, we derive a collection of adequate conditions to guarantee the stability of the BW hysteresis systems. The representation of these conditions takes the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example illustrating the efficacy and practicality of the devised control strategy is used in conjunction with a real-world application called a piezo-positioning mechanical system.},
