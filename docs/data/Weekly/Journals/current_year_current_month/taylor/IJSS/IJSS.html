  abstract     = {This paper studies the finite-time synchronisation problem of discrete-time delayed positive neural networks under false data injection attacks. A master–slave networked control framework is constructed which is under dual-channel attacks, that is, the channel from sensor to controller and the channel from controller to actuator. False data injection attacks can destroy easily the positivity of positive neural networks, by injecting large negative data into the sampled signals, for instance. In this case, assuming a non-negative synchronisation error, as in previous work, to maintain the positivity of the slave system is inadequate. A newly designed regulator-based switching control method is proposed to synchronise the master–slave system decreasing the influence of dual-channel attacks. The positivity constraint in synchronisation error system is removed. To further reduce the turbulence caused by the switching of variable control inputs, a bumpless transfer strategy is considered. By using the Lyapunov theorem, some sufficient delay-dependent conditions for finite-time synchronisation of master–slave positive neural networks are proposed in the form of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example and a water management system are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Firstly, leveraging the properties of d -simplices and link-dependent topology, an equivalent adjacency matrix is introduced to model D -simplicial complexes as a linear system. Secondly, a delayed event-triggered mechanism is developed to ensure efficient resource utilisation while preventing the Zeno phenomenon through a delayed waiting time. The proposed control strategy framework combines an event-triggered mechanism with topology-dependent impulsive control, where impulsive instants are dynamically determined. Additionally, the impact of hybrid attacks is modelled by incorporating DoS and deception attacks that follow a Bernoulli distribution. Thirdly, sufficient conditions for mean-square exponential synchronisation of simplicial complexes under attacks are derived using Lyapunov functions and inequality recursion techniques.

A novel observer structure is devised to estimate states and disturbances by predicting the actual output of the system. Moreover, the disturbance constraint is broadened to encompass wider types such as unbounded finite derivatives. Based on the obtained estimation of disturbance and state, a resilient controller is proposed to compensate for the impact caused by controller parameter perturbations. In particular, a new class of Lyapunov-like functionals is constructed to extend the sampling interval associated with exponential convergence. By employing matrix analysis and integration techniques, sufficient criteria are established to guarantee the exponential convergence of the networked aperiodic sampled-data closed-loop dynamics. The obtained criteria reveal that the estimation error of the disturbance depends only on the errors of the predictor and state observation, benefiting from the novel structure of the devised observer. The parameter gains of the observer and controller are readily determined by solving a set of convex optimisation constraints. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed observer-based control algorithm are confirmed through developed examples.},

Firstly, an event-triggering mechanism is proposed to reduce the communication resource consumption by determining when agents need to communicate with their neighbours, thereby avoiding continuous information transmission. Considering the effect of actuation delays, a distributed delayed impulsive controller is designed. An impulse-switching error system is then constructed, which transforms the original system with time delays into one without. Furthermore, sufficient consensus criteria is derived, imposing constraints on event-triggering parameters. The design of impulsive gain matrix is also presented.

Subsequently, the chordal decomposition theorem was employed to establish a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) over maximal cliques, with the objective of ensuring the mean-square asymptotic stability of LSNSs with input saturation constraints. Additionally, a design methodology was proposed for the design of the H ∞ scalable controllers, which ensures that the controllers of the maximal clique to which it belongs and the controllers of neighbouring maximal cliques are updated only when plugging-in or plugging-out subsystems. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers significant advantages in terms of reduced computational complexity and increased privacy.

A transformed Poisson process model is introduced to describe the energy collected by each sensor, with particular consideration given to the minimum energy collected. In contrast to previous research on distributed state estimation over energy harvesting sensor networks, which solely considered the energy costs associated with transmission and assumed knowledge of the statistical properties of harvested energy, we consider a more comprehensive scenario. Specifically, we account for the energy costs associated with both sensor sensing and data transmission to neighbouring sensors, while only the parameters of the minimum harvested energy are known. Subsequently, a novel energy allocation strategy is proposed to provide energy for each sensor sensing and transmission based on a predetermined fixed circular order, which determines a maximum time interval for each sensor sensing and transmission. Then, local measurement output predictors and prior state predictors are constructed to handle interruptions in sensor sensing and communication caused by the energy harvesting mechanism. Furthermore, we derive sufficient conditions for the existence of a distributed moving horizon estimator, ensuring H ∞ consensus. To illustrate the proposed method's effectiveness, a single-machine infinite-bus power system is presented.},

  abstract     = {In model predictive control (MPC), the control input is determined at each instance by formulating and solving an optimisation problem that incorporates real-time measurement updates. Applications characterised by rapid process dynamics often necessitate shorter sampling intervals, which impose stringent requirements on computational consistency. Also, implementing MPC on hardware with constrained computational resources remains a significant challenge. Consequently, the realisation of MPC for such scenarios mandates an appropriate choice of an optimisation algorithm that exhibits consistency in terms of iteration numbers, ensuring optimised solutions within a sampling period in real-time environments. This study introduces the application of an infeasible interior-point barrier algorithm tailored for MPC. The MPC is formulated for linear systems in the condensed framework so that the number of decision variables in the optimisation problem is reduced. The solution algorithm of the optimisation problem is formulated on primal-dual conditions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in real-time on a coupled tank system. Both the state and output feedback MPC are implemented that demonstrate consistent iteration count throughout its runtime. Comparative performance analyses with other methodologies are conducted elucidating the trade-offs inherent in different approaches.},

  abstract     = {Given the critical role of data decomposition in managing complex datasets across various fields, addressing the challenge of noise is essential, as it can significantly degrade decomposition performance. This study emphasises the importance of noise-robust data decomposition and proposes a novel online method designed for efficient and reliable decomposition under noisy conditions. To address this challenge, we define an optimisation objective that simultaneously suppresses noise while satisfying physical constraints. To mitigate the sensitivity of gradient descent-based methods to initial conditions, which can often lead to local optima, we simplify the optimisation objective propose and advanced techniques. This approach eliminates irrelevant variables, fully exploits the efficiency of sparse matrices, and quickly solves for both spatial and temporal modes, significantly improving overall performance. Theoretical derivations and analyses are provided to elucidate the optimisation process and its impact on noise robustness. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively avoids local optima and outperforms traditional methods in terms of noise robustness. Specifically, in real-world data experiments, the proposed method achieves an 89.6% reduction in the root mean square error of reconstructed data, compared to a 68.06% reduction achieved by existing methods, representing a 31.6% relative improvement. These results highlight the superior reliability and robustness of the proposed method in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the fast formation control problem of the multi-agent system (MAS) subject to practical input constraints and mismatched disturbances. An improved terminal sliding mode (TSM) control scheme, which incorporates finite-time disturbance observers (FTDOs) and a saturation level detecting system (SLDS), is proposed for a class of second-order MAS. More specifically, FTDOs effectively estimate both matched and mismatched disturbances in the motion equation of each agent, while the novel SLDS analyses the effect of input saturations and makes different dynamic modifications on both TSM surface and control law with respect to two (light or deep) saturation levels. The proposed two-level anti-windup TSM control theoretically guarantees the finite-time stability of MAS despite the presence of unknown mismatched disturbances and deep input saturations, which is practically applied to the formation control of unmanned ground vehicles with numerical simulations and physical experiments.},

The method of backstepping is employed in designing the stabilising control function together with the Lyapunov stability theory.

  abstract     = {In this paper, semiglobal and global finite/fixed-time stability of a class of semilinear stochastic systems in Hilbert spaces are studied. By employing the stopping time technique and applying the infinite-dimensional Itô formula, a unified Lyapunov criterion is established under which global finite-time, global fixed-time, semiglobal finite-time and semiglobal fixed-time stability can all be obtained. This fills the research gaps in the finite/fixed-time stability of stochastic distributed parameter systems and the semiglobal finite/fixed-time stability of stochastic systems. Moreover, compared to existing results on finite/fixed-time stability for stochastic systems, our Lyapunov criterion can still work well under more stringent conditions. This is done by adding a term which can reflect the stabilising effect of the diffusion term and replacing original fractional power functions with a class of piecewise continuous fractional power functions that are no longer required to be increasing. Finally, illustrative examples are given and the obtained theoretical results are verified by numerical simulations.},

  abstract     = {This note considers the issue of the asymptotic tracking control for a class of pure-feedback systems (PFSs) with disturbances. During the controller construction, the mean value theorem (MVT) is utilised to tackle the non-affine structure of the original systems. Then, we employ radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) to dispose the difficulty of the uncertain nonlinear functions. An improved Lyapunov function which relaxes the restrictions on design parameters is designed through introducing the lower bounds. By utilising the backstepping algorithm and the stability theory of Lyapunov function, an adaptive neural asymptotic tracking control strategy is designed. The control scheme can ensure all the states in the considered system are bounded and the tracking error inclines to zero asymptotically. Finally, simulation examples verify the validity of the designed strategy.},
