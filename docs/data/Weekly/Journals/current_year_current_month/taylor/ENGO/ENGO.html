  abstract     = {With the rapid development of deep learning technology, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has garnered considerable acclaim within the realm of structural optimization owing to its excellent exploration mechanism. However, the widespread application of RL in this field is limited owing to the excessive number of iterations required to converge and the expensive computational cost it brings. To address these challenges, this article presents a novel RL framework for structural optimization, combining Monte Carlo tree search with the proximal policy optimization method, called LMPOM. The key contributions of LMPOM encompass: (1) an enhanced Monte Carlo tree search strategy for partitioning the hybrid design space; (2) a strategy for adaptively updating surrogate models to reduce simulation costs; and (3) the introduction of a novel termination condition for the RL algorithms. Through tests on three benchmark problems, compared with previous RL algorithms, LMPOM consistently shows fewer iterations and better optimization results.},

Many quantum algorithms, such as the Harrow–Hassidim–Lloyd algorithm and the box algorithm, have been proposed for solving such systems. The focus of this article is on improving the efficiency of the box algorithm. The basic principle behind this algorithm is to transform the linear system into a series of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems, which are then solved on annealing machines. The computational efficiency of the box algorithm is entirely determined by the number of iterations, which, in turn, depends on the box contraction ratio, typically set to 0.5. Here, it is shown through theoretical analysis that a contraction ratio of 0.5 is sub-optimal and that a computational speed-up can be achieved with a contraction ratio of 0.2. This is confirmed through numerical experiments where a computational speed-up between 20 % to 60 % is observed when the optimal contraction ratio is used.},

Tuning for the control algorithm is achieved through the application of Harris's hawks optimization. An objective function is designed by imposing constraints on performance metrics such as integral square error, integral absolute error, integral time absolute error, and closed-loop gain, which are then solved using Harris's hawks optimization. Further, the robust behaviour of the system is exhibited using μ -analysis to assess its stability. Simulation studies confirm the control algorithm's effectiveness, showing superior performance in reducing settling-time and minimizing overshoot.

Emphasizing the importance of fatigue life considerations, the research focuses on key components of roller coasters: the wheel assemblies. By integrating stress–life fatigue constraints, such an approach can lead to longer lasting and more efficiently designed roller coaster components. Multiaxial fatigue topology optimization using the method of moving asymptotes gradient-based optimization is examined to address the complex loading experienced by these bogies given a substantial load-time history in the high-cycle fatigue region. Using a validated optimization methodology, this study aims to reduce the bogie volume in selected domains while ensuring structural integrity and potentially extending service life. The optimization process successfully reduces the number of designable elements, resulting in decreased global volume and mass, and the results quantifiably demonstrate the impact of applying high-cycle fatigue constraints on the bogie’s performance.},

Then, a modified genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize discrete variables. To enhance convergence stationarity, the concept of ‘adjacent individuals’ is proposed to control the degree of difference in topology configuration between initial population members and the current optimal. Additionally, adjustments to the sequence-based crossover process ensure compliance with damper quantity constraints. Examples demonstrate that the introduction of adjacent individuals is beneficial to convergence stationarity, and the shape change of the truss increases the mode damping ratio by more than 20%.

  abstract     = {Topology optimization is a widely adopted structural optimization approach that aims to maximize desired performance based on mathematical and physical principles. Gradient-based methods are common for obtaining optimal configurations; however, they struggle with problems involving numerous local optima and non-differentiable problems, which prevent the derivation of design sensitivity. To address these issues, this study explores the application of the Success History-Based Differential Evolution with Linear Population Size Reduction and Semi-Parameter Adaptation, which is regarded as LSHADE-SPA algorithm, known for its strong search capabilities. Nevertheless, its computational cost makes it impractical for topology optimization, especially as the number of design variables increases. To overcome this challenge, a novel structure representation method utilizing the Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansion is constructed. Applying truncated KL expansion instead of conventional density methods to represent structural configurations reduces the number of design variables. This article introduces a differential evolution-based topology optimization method utilizing truncated KL expansion and validates its effectiveness through applications in various structural and fluid problems. The method is particularly suited to highly nonlinear problems, such as negative Poisson's ratio structures and micro-mixer designs. The findings here indicate that differential evolution with truncated KL expansion can serve as an efficient and robust topology optimization method, proving particularly effective for solving optimization problems that are challenging for conventional gradient-based approaches. Notably, the proposed methodology not only delivers superior results but also alleviates computational burdens, thereby advancing the prospects of topology optimization in various engineering applications.},
