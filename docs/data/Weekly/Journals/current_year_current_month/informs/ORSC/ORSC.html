  abstract     = {This piece distills lessons for increasing the impact of social science research based on our work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Applied Cooperation Initiative, which facilitates collaborations between social scientists and practitioners to promote real-world prosocial behaviors. We describe an iterative model of collaboration—intervention, randomized trial, publication, and press—that has sustained a robust research pipeline, broadening the dissemination and application of findings. We highlight two promising directions for future research in organizational contexts: (i) adapting interventions to intraorganizational dynamics, in which norms and incentives differ from public settings, and (ii) developing strategies for establishing or reforming counterproductive norms that may hinder organizational performance. We conclude with recommendations for supporting translational research: introducing article types dedicated to translation, removing barriers to publishing practitioner-relevant review articles, streamlining institutional review board and legal processes, and funding cross-institutional collaborations.

  abstract     = {The business world has much to gain from the direct application of research findings to daily business operations. Nevertheless, a large gap remains between the work of business academics and that of business practitioners. With an eye toward closing that gap in applied science, medical publishing has three important lessons for business journals and scholars. First, borrow selectively from medical publishing’s best practices—most notably, by emphasizing evidence over discursive prose; seeing application of research findings as intrinsic to the very purpose of research; elevating the prominence of expert opinions on how and why to implement research; and accelerating research-publication timelines while maintaining rigor. Second, make novel innovations in publishing, such as academic–practitioner coauthorship, recruitment of carefully vetted practitioners to be on industry advisory boards to journals, and journal sponsorship of conferences where academics and practitioners freely exchange ideas. Third, explicitly encourage business researchers to see their published work as actually intending to influence business practices and societal well-being. Just as medical publishing aims, at its core, to improve people’s lives, business research should seek to make a concrete difference in people’s lived experiences.},

  abstract     = {Organizational researchers increasingly call for applied impact, yet institutional structures continue to privilege theoretical novelty over practical relevance. In contrast, engineering fields have built mechanisms that legitimize rigorously validated, usable contributions—often publishing proven solutions before fully developed theories. Drawing on our experiences in both engineering and organizational research, we examine how institutional design—not just individual motivation—shapes what counts as legitimate scholarship. We identify structural levers that support applied impact across three institutional pillars: cognitive (what counts as knowledge), normative (what confers prestige), and regulative (what gets published and rewarded). By analyzing how engineering disciplines use diverse publication formats, evaluation rubrics, and inclusive authorship norms, we outline feasible reforms for organizational research. We propose a framework for institutional redesign that expands the definition of scholarly value while preserving rigor.

  abstract     = {Numerous calls over decades have urged scholars to pursue research that is more relevant to problems faced by organizations and their members. Yet the relevance and impact of our field remains limited compared with other applied sciences. Whereas individual aspects of our research practice, such as expectations about methods, theoretical novelty, and motivating a study, are frequently discussed in our field, less attention is paid to the publication system. Our perspective is that to bring about a field-wide change would require us to identify and address the systemic sources of the issue. Accordingly, we compare publication systems across applied sciences, contrasting organization research with those of impactful applied sciences, such as health sciences, engineering, economics, and design science. We focus on four fundamental elements of publication systems: balance between evidence and theory, diversity of research types accommodated, system responsiveness to real-world challenges, and relationship between exploration and replication. These elements are interdependent, and understanding them together reveals how publication systems can enable or constrain what gets published and its impact, enabling us to identify pathways to reorient publication systems in our field to become a more impactful applied science.

  abstract     = {Women are consistently underrepresented in leadership roles. One contributor may be that women are generally less willing than equally-qualified men to enter competitions (e.g., for jobs or promotions). We draw from research on “stereotype reactance”—the idea that telling people about stereotyped expectations can encourage defiance—to propose and test whether telling women about the gender gap in competition entry can increase their willingness to compete. Our prediction contrasts with prior work on stereotype threat and descriptive norms suggesting that highlighting the gender competition gap might lead women to refrain from competing. In two incentive-compatible, preregistered online experiments, we find that informing women about the gender competition gap increases their likelihood of competing for higher pay, and this effect is mediated by stereotype reactance, consistent with our theorizing. Moreover, exposing both men and women to information about the gender competition gap closes the gap. We then test this informational intervention in a large-scale field experiment on an executive job search platform ( n = 4,245), examining whether telling women about the gender competition gap increases their willingness to compete for leadership roles relative to a control message that tells them about an identity-irrelevant competition gap. We find that relative to our control message, informing women about the gender gap in willingness to compete increases submitted job applications by over 20% on the day of condition assignment. This suggests that women’s willingness to compete is affected not just by confidence, but also by cultural expectations and motivation to defy stereotypical norms.

  abstract     = {This study investigates how market actors legitimize new categories that challenge the foundational understandings of established ones while simultaneously seeking to compete in the same market space. We analyze the development of the U.S. plant-based meat category from 2012 to 2019, focusing on how plant-based meat producers positioned their products as legitimate competitors within the meat category despite their nonanimal origins. We identify three key legitimation strategies used by entrepreneurs: reconfiguring the category basis by reframing the core attributes of meat from animal origin to shared biochemical components; creating experiential congruence by replicating the sensory qualities and social practices associated with traditional meat; and instilling value superiority by emphasizing health, environmental, and ethical benefits along with forward-thinking innovation. Our observations also lead us to theorize what we term category transmutation —a construct for understanding how the successful legitimation of a new category might reshape the meaning and boundaries of an existing one. We envision category transmutation as a process through which an existing category evolves to incorporate both traditional and new subcategories, thereby vertically modifying the category structure. This study advances our understanding of category dynamics and extends the role of cultural entrepreneurship beyond gaining legitimacy to reshaping category systems and market structures, with the potential to drive positive societal changes.},

  abstract     = {Effective strategy development, evaluation, and implementation starts with a comprehensive understanding of strategic problems. However, developing such an understanding is often challenging due to the complexity of such problems and because how they can be solved is not yet known. Managers often oversimplify these problems by focusing on a few symptoms and obvious causes. Research indicates that big picture, abstract thinking helps managers explore underlying causes more flexibly, but it can also lead to overlooking key symptoms that do not fit existing frameworks. Instead, concrete thinking is likely essential for individuals to identify the full range of symptoms characterizing strategic problems. Because symptoms are essential for fully understanding strategic problems—they are the building blocks for managers to build theories about causes—both concrete and abstract thinking may be necessary. Drawing on construal level theory, we propose a construal level shift model. The central claim of our model is that managers benefit from first adopting a low construal level (concrete) thinking when framing strategic problems to identify all relevant symptoms. The benefit of a high construal level (abstract) thinking lies in combining these symptoms more flexibly to theorize more comprehensively about the underlying causes. Two experimental studies and one correlational study, involving samples of working individuals, managers, and experienced executives, support our model. Our findings contribute to the behavioral and knowledge-based views of the firm, the theory-based view of strategy, and managerial cognition research.

  abstract     = {When an organization’s environment changes, communication between its members is essential for a timely response. However, past observational studies suggest that communication declines when an organization is exposed to an adverse environmental event. To understand why this might happen, I examine the effects of competition and scarcity—two common features of adverse events—on information sharing and seeking—the microfoundations of organizational communication. In the present study, interactive groups of experimental participants play a novel n -armed bandit game where they work as salespeople for companies that offer a lot of different products (The Sales Game). Some groups experience stable customer demand, while others are exposed to negative or positive demand shifts. Participants earn variable rewards based on their individual performance, and competition is induced in half of the groups through a small bonus based on relative performance. Participants can choose to exchange information with their peers throughout the task. When participants freely exchange information, the increase in individual performance-based rewards is larger than the tiny competitive bonus. But, participants exposed to this competition share information significantly less often than those who are not. This produces a pattern of communication network contraction consistent with prior observational studies of organizations exposed to adverse events. In contrast to prior research, scarcity (negative demand shifts) has no effect on information exchange. These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between competition, scarcity, and interpersonal communication in organizations. They also have important implications for the design of incentive schemes in modern firms.

For members of these organizations, such political dynamics might create new barriers to their ability to carry out collaborative activities. In a historical case study of the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project—an unprecedented partnership between the space programs of the United States and the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War—we identify how organizational members navigated the turbulent geopolitical environment. We found that collaborative meetings between organizational members were limited to a supervised space that ensured government oversight but created interactional barriers. Organizational members realized that their ability to overcome these challenges would require them to develop practices outside of the organization, using boundary work to carve out free space outside the purview of political supervision. The free space served as a laboratory in which they reconciled informational, techno-cultural, and ideological differences and created solutions to the challenges they faced in the supervised space through translation work. Our study theorizes how geopolitics complicates the interactional processes of cross-border partnerships and underscores the importance of free space for fostering collaboration amid geopolitical rivalry.

  abstract     = {Despite recent theorizing on the power of rhetorical histories, scholars have yet to consider the dynamics of organizational generations (i.e., collectives defined by temporally proximal organizational entry and shared experiences and memories of organizational events) involved in their creation and long-term effects. Based on a comparative case study of two union organizations that participated in failed initiatives, we produce a parallel process model of cross-generational historical branching explaining the divergent and long-term influences of using history strategically across generational lines. Our model unpacks how theoretically distinct forms of what has been deemed “historical myth” offered by senior generations, while harboring similar utility in building cross-generational support, underlie divergent outcomes regarding how members across generations respond to subsequent failure and, in turn, historically position the initiative. We further suggest these processes have a lingering impact on an organization’s willingness to engage in a subsequent initiative. Our theory sheds light on the ways in which historical myths shared across generational divides, in tandem with the cross-generational mnemonic communities they create, engender divergent, long-term, and potentially unexpected consequences.

  abstract     = {We explore how decision makers utilize external and internal knowledge in problems characterized by temporal complexity where there is a separation between action and outcome. Many strategic and organizational decisions have longer-term consequences, yet behavioral models of learning have underexplored this class of problems. Consequently, we do not know much about the role of external knowledge in tackling temporally complex problems, let alone how it interacts with internal knowledge from experiential learning processes. Our computational analyses show that, although having a greater level of external knowledge is generally advantageous, its positive impact diminishes notably or can even become negative when external knowledge is limited. Surprisingly, decision makers operating with limited external knowledge can perform worse than those without any external guidance at all. In a temporally complex problem, knowing what to do at any given point is not sufficient as one still needs to undertake a long sequence of actions before reaching the goal. In other words, external knowledge does not guarantee that optimal actions will be chosen in subsequent decision-making situations. This dynamic may lead the decision makers to overvalue actions that serve as stepping stones to the available external knowledge and undervalue alternative actions that may provide more desirable paths toward the goal.

  abstract     = {Knowledge workers are increasingly overworked, with negative consequences for both individuals and organizations. Pressures for long hours often come from clients, and the quantification of work has, in many cases, amplified these pressures. We examine when and how workers might rely upon quantification to limit overwork. We draw on data from a 21-month ethnography of information technology worker teams that develop software for clients in finance. We find that although these workers faced overwork pressures, they managed this tension through a process we label “concerted quantification.” This process has three steps. First, team members constructed quantified units based on disparate work tasks to coordinate on a specific set of tasks that would likely limit overwork. Second, workers leveraged these quantified units to create flexibility in when specific work tasks were performed, allowing workers to limit overwork when facing fluctuating work demands. Third, workers promoted quantified units to clients as a standard measure of performance, establishing the completion of these units as a key criterion for work success. Particular substantiations of common characteristics of knowledge work—team autonomy, task expertise, and shared quality norms—are conditions for concerted quantification. Overall, we find that quantifying processes (a) help teams determine an appropriate amount of work to take on without engaging in overwork and (b) set clients’ expectations for the amount of work to be completed. We contribute to research on overwork and quantification by highlighting how quantification can, under certain conditions, support workers in limiting overwork.},

  abstract     = {Humanitarian organizations assisting victims of armed conflict face fragmented and potentially conflicting temporal demands on strategy making. Annual donor funding requires detailed planning, unpredictable outbreaks of war and violence demand quick and flexible decisions, and long-term societal challenges must be addressed over the next decades. Few studies have examined how organizations can achieve temporal fit in such temporally complex environments without accepting internal fragmentation or decoupling from certain temporal demands. We draw on a longitudinal case study of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), a humanitarian organization with the mandate to aid victims of armed conflict, to explore this gap. We find that the ICRC has developed a repertoire of multiple distinct strategy processes tailored to the fragmented temporal demands. These processes include emergency responses, strategic planning, and long-term strategizing. Although each strategy process retained its distinctiveness, their loose coupling ensured a sufficient alignment of resource allocation in pursuit of the organization’s humanitarian mandate. Strong shared principles and an episodic activation of strategy processes helped to manage the inherent complexity of loose coupling. Thus, strategy process repertoires may form a capability supporting strategic decision making in temporally complex environments. Our study contributes to strategy process research by introducing loose coupling as a mechanism for integrating multiple strategy processes with different temporalities, complementing previous studies on strategy processes as a tightly coupled structural context. Furthermore, we advance theorizing on ambitemporality by analyzing how the loose coupling of internal temporal structures may help organizations cope with temporal complexity.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the relationship between the adoption of algorithmic recommendation tools and experiential learning. We argue that the adoption of an algorithmic recommendation tool will harm experiential learning in organizations by limiting knowledge retention and retrieval. We further argue that the adverse relationship between algorithmic tool adoption and experiential learning will be stronger in organizations operating in low-task-difficulty environments than those in high-task-difficulty ones because organizational members in such organizations are likely to rely more on algorithmic recommendations, experiencing higher skill erosion. In addition, the relationship will be stronger in organizations facing low task variety than in those with high task variety, as these organizations are likely to have more rigid routines and in turn experience higher routine disruption after adopting an algorithmic tool. We utilize data on the adoption of an algorithmic tool called a clinical decision support system (CDSS) in a sample of emergency departments in California and utilize a fixed-effects panel regression with control function to test our arguments. We find that the relationship between cumulative experience and mortality becomes significantly weaker after CDSS adoption, suggesting flatter learning curves. We also find evidence that the effect is moderated by task difficulty and task variety. Supplemental Material: The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.2022.16738 .},

  abstract     = {We propose a theoretical framework and provide empirical evidence on how resource complementarity or substitutability between entrepreneurs and seed investors drives selection and value creation in the context of high-tech startups. Specifically, we argue that seed investors specialized in training programs—startup accelerators—are the ideal match for entrepreneurial teams equipped with strong technological competencies but lacking business knowledge. On the other hand, when entrepreneurs with extensive business knowledge pair up with accelerators, the value created is typically less. Combining information from Crunchbase and LinkedIn, we provide robust empirical evidence based on the assortative matching of start-ups and investors and the ex- post analysis of joint value creation.

  abstract     = {In their efforts to foster diversity and talent, organizations, banks, and venture capitalists utilize the expertise of reviewers to evaluate applications from a broad range of applicants. Reviewers make decisions under different types of cognitive load, such as the necessity to aggregate complex information and workload pressure. To cope with the stress, reviewers might use automatic biases to make decisions faster, which can result in lower organizational diversity. We explore the characteristics of reviewers in a particular setting—patent applications at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). We leverage quasi-exogenous variation from the random assignment of patent examiners, allowing us to find the causal impact of applicant gender and examiner characteristics on the application success rate. We find evidence that applicants with more female-sounding names have a 3.6-percentage-point lower likelihood of patent approval. We find that a high workload of the examiner leads to a decrease in the likelihood that the patent application of a female inventor would be approved, consistent with theories on coping strategies when experiencing cognitive load. Our results extend to applications filed by teams of inventors. These results suggest that it is essential to manage the stress related to reviewers’ workloads to guarantee a variety of successful candidates.

  abstract     = {Corporate executives often use metaphors, particularly those derived from war imagery, when communicating their strategic intentions. This study examines the influence of metaphorical framing in corporate communication, particularly its effect on analyst reactions to firms’ acquisition announcements. We theorize and analyze the impact of metaphor families that either emphasize or downplay competition while considering the diverse source domains from which these metaphors originate. We propose a theoretical framework that integrates conceptual metaphor theory with the risk-as-feelings perspective, suggesting that certain metaphors can evoke visceral perceptions of danger. Our findings reveal that using metaphors in acquisition announcements generally elicits negative reactions. Notably, metaphors from the competition family, especially war-related ones signifying competitive aggression, evoke stronger adverse reactions. The detrimental impact of war language substantially diminishes in contexts where aggressive competition is expected. We contribute to strategic communication research by highlighting the contingent influence of metaphorical framing on audience reactions, emphasizing the importance of metaphor families, source domains, and contextual factors.

  abstract     = {Consumers and other audiences often penalize products that combine unrelated elements. In this paper, we document the consequences of that penalty for the evaluation of the elements being combined. Building on the idea that audiences cannot fully disentangle the quality of “fit” between elements from the quality of the elements individually, we argue that audiences are likely to direct their dislike of a misfit product to the individual elements being combined. Using an archival study of the music industry and an online experiment with photographic galleries, we find that evaluations of individual elements (songs, photographs) are influenced by product-level fit (albums, galleries). Elements of misfit products are evaluated less favorably than they would have been otherwise. Moreover, this bias is exacerbated when the evaluation of the whole product is emphasized. We discuss the implications of this “misfit bias” for the innovation, entrepreneurship, and categories literatures.

  abstract     = {Entrepreneurs often skillfully leverage symbolic actions to manage impressions and gain acceptance for their innovations. Impression management can generate interest but also heighten expectations beyond an innovation’s capabilities, creating a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and an innovation’s performance. To convince critical audiences, entrepreneurs need to not just manage impressions but also show how their innovations will integrate and work in situ. Yet, little research explains what happens when symbolic actions meet their limits. How do entrepreneurs respond when critical audiences challenge their symbolic actions? We examine how 28 digital health start-ups were challenged by a critical audience (buyers), revealing a gap between entrepreneurs’ symbolic presentations and the performance of their innovations. We examine how entrepreneurs managed this gap with buyers at 13 organizations and identify three pathways. Continuing to manage impressions obfuscated the discovery of integration work, widening the gap. Iterating with substantive adaptations did not sufficiently narrow the gap. Only entrepreneurs who recalibrated expectations were able to enlist buyers in the mutual discovery of integration work. These entrepreneurs shared the costs of narrowing the gap with buyers, despite earlier symbolic promises. We contribute to an emerging appreciation of the duality of symbolic actions by explaining what happens when entrepreneurs’ symbolic actions are challenged and how their responses can exacerbate or eradicate that challenge.
