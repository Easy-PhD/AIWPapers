  abstract     = {Distributed ledgers (DLs) are modern decentralized databases where trusted network members can transparently update data while maintaining security. IOTA is an exemplar alternative to the well-known Bitcoin protocol, and such alternatives, which aim to overcome shortcomings, have gained increasing attention recently. These systems warrant deeper theoretical analysis using directed acyclic graph (DAG) models. One essential property of a properly functioning DL is that all network members holding a copy of the database agree on the sequence of information added, which is referred to as consensus and is known to be related to a structural property of DAGs called one-endedness. In this paper, we consider a model of a DL with sequential stochastic arrivals that mimic IOTA’s attachment rules. Although the resulting DAG model is more complex than Bitcoin, we demonstrate that as time goes to infinity, the IOTA DAG almost surely achieves one-endedness.},

  abstract     = {Consider a Markovian tandem line with finite intermediate buffers and an equal number of stations and servers. Servers are flexible but noncollaborative, so that a job can be processed by at most one server at any time. When a job is being processed, it can be damaged and wasted depending on the proficiency of the server. We identify the dynamic server assignment policy that maximizes the long-run average throughput of the system with two stations and two servers. We find that the optimal policy is either a single or a double threshold policy on the number of jobs in the buffer, where the thresholds depend on the service rates and defect probabilities of the two servers at the two stations. For larger systems, we show that the optimal policy may involve server idling and that improving the service rate at any station is always beneficial. Finally, we propose heuristic server assignment policies motivated by experimentation for small systems with finite buffers and analysis of larger systems with infinite buffers. Numerical results suggest that our heuristics yield near-optimal performance. Funding: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation [Grants CMMI-1536990 and CMMI-2127778]. S.

  abstract     = {Queueing systems present many opportunities for applying machine learning predictions, such as estimated service times, to improve system performance. This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely large language model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems. Funding: M.
