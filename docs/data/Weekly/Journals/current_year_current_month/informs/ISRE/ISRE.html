  abstract     = {An integral component of user participation in community-based platforms is giving “likes” to content posted by others. At the same time, online social participation differs from offline social participation in that online users are often allowed to create a virtual identity unrelated to their real-world identity. The objective of this study is to identify the motivations behind users’ giving “likes” when their virtual identity (i.e., username) is hidden or shown. Specifically, we leverage a natural experiment to examine the effect of virtual identity disclosure on users’ “liking” behavior. Our identification strategy relies on an exogenous policy change in an online community-based platform, where likers’ username was not visible before but publicly shown after the change. Our results show that users “liked” fewer but higher-quality articles after the policy change, consistent with their protective self-presentation motivation. This study emphasizes the significance of virtual identity, arguing that a virtual identity devoid of real-world information should not be equated with anonymity. It also underscores the importance of protective self-presentation over acquisitive self-presentation, suggesting that research should focus not only on the actions users take but also on those they intentionally avoid taking. Furthermore, our study identifies “liking” as a key channel of self-presentation, complementing the focus on posting behaviors in the extant literature. Practically, platforms can refine their policies on virtual identity disclosure to enhance content engagement, whereas content creators should tailor their offerings to meet the self-presentation needs of their audience.

  abstract     = {The rapid advancement of mobile internet technologies, such as 4G and 5 G, has greatly enhanced the accessibility and convenience of mobile shopping. However, along with these benefits, mobile data usage has introduced a novel form of search cost in consumers’ purchasing decisions compared with Wi-Fi. This arises from the perception that mobile data are more costly because of additional charges incurred when exceeding the fixed data quota, which contributes to the increase of mental cost during the search process. To examine the influence of mobile data cost on consumer price sensitivity, we conduct empirical research utilizing hotel search data obtained from a prominent hotel booking app. Our findings reveal that consumers exhibit approximately twice the level of price sensitivity when utilizing mobile data instead of Wi-Fi, resulting in an average US$17 less in revenue per hotel booking. To assess the causal relations between mobile data cost and consumer price sensitivity, we utilize an approach similar to difference-in-differences and observe that this impact is more pronounced when consumers book hotels at the end of the month (versus the beginning of the month). We further find that consumer search effort decreases when using mobile data (versus Wi-Fi) across decision stages of the search process, supporting the mechanism that mobile data cost drives consumers into the satisficing rather than maximizing search mode. Our research offers practical implications for businesses operating in mobile shopping environments and contributes to policy development in this field.

  abstract     = {With the rapid development of mobile technology and consumers’ increasing demand for portability, the mobile gaming market has experienced huge growth. To ensure the success of mobile games, game publishers need to keep their players engaged and, at the same time, seek monetization strategies that do not interrupt players’ engagement. This paper examines how in-game challenge-related factors (i.e., perceived challenge and fluctuation of perceived challenge) and a novel mobile game monetization strategy—reward ads—affect players’ engagement. Reward ads, a popular in-app advertising monetization model in which players can voluntarily watch an ad in exchange for a reward within the game, can help publishers generate revenue without breaking the flow of the game. We develop a Hidden Markov Model and employ detailed tap-stream data from a mobile game app to study how challenge-related factors and reward ads affect players’ dynamic engagement state evolution. First, we find that players’ perceived challenge level has a positive, but diminishing, marginal effect on players’ engagement state transitions. Second, a higher fluctuation of perceived challenge increases the probability that players move to a higher engagement state. Third, the scaffolding earned by watching reward ads can help players transition to a higher engagement level. Furthermore, we study the moderating effect of perceived challenge on reward ads, and we find that reward ads are more helpful in engaging players when the perceived challenge is higher. The findings enhance the understanding of players’ engagement with mobile games and provide design guidance for mobile game publishers.

  abstract     = {With the rapid prevalence and massive user growth of social media platforms, efficiently targeting potential customers on these platforms has grown in importance for companies. Enhancing the likelihood that a social media user will engage with brand posts holds profound implications for online marketing strategy design. However, predicting customer engagement on social media comes with its own set of challenges. In this work, we design a graph neural network model called the graph neural network with attention mechanism for customer engagement (GACE) to predict customer engagement (like/comment/share) of brand posts. We exploit large-scale content consumption information from the perspective of heterogeneous networks and learn latent customer representation by developing a graph neural network model. We examine GACE using a large-scale Facebook data set, and the comprehensive results show significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an interpretability analysis, which sheds some light on the explanation of the proposed model. To illustrate the practical significance of our work, we provide examples to quantify the economic value of improved predictive power using a cost-revenue analysis in the context of targeted marketing.

In doing this, the basic idea of scientific contribution in IS research is expanded from (a) the typical contribution of theory to the phenomenon (more than 80% of IS research articles from 2018 to 2021 from Information Systems Research, Journal of the Association for Information Systems, and MIS Quarterly ) to (b) include the less common contribution to theory, especially reference discipline theory, thus creating the opportunity for IS research to be more impactful and IS to grow as a reference discipline.

  abstract     = {Firms strive to improve their products over time to compete effectively in the market. Typically, firms update their products by adding novel or differentiating features or by imitating competitors. With the ubiquity of social media, there is also the opportunity to obtain customer input on their preferred features for a product. In the case of mobile apps, user feedback in the form of reviews may include suggestions of novel features or those that are already present in competing apps but not in the focal app. Leveraging the information contained in reviews and version release notes of iOS apps, we develop a deep learning–based natural language processing approach to identify four types of app features: developer-initiated novel, developer-initiated imitative, user-suggested novel, and user-suggested imitative. We evaluate the impact of these feature categories on app demand. Our results demonstrate that only developer-initiated novel and user-suggested imitative features help increase app demand. We also find that the impact of user-suggested novel features is negative. However, this negative effect is limited to features that are contextually distant from user suggestions, whereas contextually close implementations have a positive effect. Although we observe that the aggregate impact of developer-initiated imitative features is statistically insignificant, features that are slightly modified from the original apps do have a positive effect on demand. The primary contribution of our study is to investigate user reviews as a source of ideas for new features and to evaluate their performance impacts relative to those of developer-initiated features.

  abstract     = {As e-commerce and mobile commerce become prevalent, a notable issue indicating a lack of choice closure is that consumers do not complete their purchases after choosing a product (e.g., shopping cart abandonment). Choice closure refers to the psychological process by which decision makers come to perceive a decision to be complete and settled. To foster choice closure, online interface designs hold promising merits in terms of flexible implementations and practical implications. Drawing upon cognitive dissonance theory and self-justification theory, we examine how interface designs can tackle consumers’ negative cognitions to promote choice closure at the postdecision prepurchase stage, whereas the extant literature focuses mainly on enhancing consumers’ positive cognitions leading to their decision satisfaction. Particularly, we investigate the effects of online interface designs on reducing cognitive dissonance (i.e., a negative cognition as an antecedent of perceived choice closure) and examine the relationships between this construct, perceived choice closure, and decision satisfaction. We conducted a series of controlled experiments in a simulated e-commerce site by designing and presenting interface cues as direct and social decision reinforcements at a postdecision prepurchase stage. Our results attest to (1) the effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement cues for inducing choice closure via reduced cognitive dissonance and (2) the significant role of choice closure for consumers’ satisfaction with their decisions in online settings where product consumption/testing is often unfeasible.

  abstract     = {We analyze how the decline of a technology affects online labor market dynamics. We evaluate the effects of Steve Jobs’ announcement that Apple would no longer support Adobe Flash—a popular set of tools for creating internet applications. Despite a precipitous decline in Flash demand, there is no evidence of a reduction in Flash wages on this platform because the supply response was rapid, particularly among younger developers with readily available “fallback” skills. The key to this rapid adjustment was that the long-run value of the skills that developers expected to acquire on the job acted as a form of nonwage compensation that suddenly fell in its expected value, motivating many developers to switch to other technologies, even though wages themselves did not fall. Our findings underscore how the rise and fall of technologies influences matching in online markets and help to explain (i) why technological obsolescence leaves fewer, older participants in a skill and (ii) why technologies in decline can be contemporaneously characterized by wages that stay flat or even rise in a market setting.

  abstract     = {Many online platforms have utilized information technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to reduce consumers’ information search costs and facilitate their decision-making processes. Given the variety of online information, these technologies are often effective in reducing the search cost for only specific information types: a concept we refer to as search cost reduction for partial information. For rational consumers, this can lead to improved decision making. However, consumers do not always behave rationally and may exhibit behavioral biases in their decision-making process. In this study, we propose that search cost reduction for partial information can induce cognitive miser behavior in consumers, ultimately leading to worse decision-making. To explore this understudied puzzle, we leverage a natural experiment on Yelp to examine the effect of enabling search cost reduction for partial information on the quality of consumers’ decisions regarding restaurants. We constructed a unique panel data set using matched pairs of restaurants across Yelp and TripAdvisor. By applying a difference-in-differences design, we aim to casually infer how consumer decision quality is affected following the introduction of Yelp’s new AI-powered image categorization feature in August 2015, which was designed to reduce the search cost of review images. We find that adding the AI-powered image categorization feature has a negative effect on consumer decision quality. Delving into the text analysis of consumer complaints using deep learning techniques, we further find that the inferior decision quality of consumers postfeature introduction is primarily due to reduced awareness of restaurants’ service quality—information that is readily available in review texts but not in review images. Our findings suggest that reducing search costs for partial information may hurt consumers as it may incentivize cognitive miser behavior. This occurs as consumers disproportionately pay attention to the product information of which the search cost has been reduced, whereas paying less attention to other relevant product information. We discuss the implications of these findings for online platforms. History: Mani Deepa, Senior Editor; Hong Xu, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Previous studies have investigated how various factors influence prosocial microlending decisions under normal circumstances. Nevertheless, a natural disaster may result in a situation where lenders can hardly find appropriate loans from the disaster-affected region. When faced with the mismatch between the supply and demand of microloans, lenders can either simply choose not to make any contributions or divert their prosocial intentions toward a different group of beneficiaries. Drawing on the motivated information processing theory, we show that the outcome-focused nature of prosocial motivation drives lenders to seek alternative loans until they achieve the goal of helping others, and the other-focused psychological process prompts lenders to take the victims’ perspectives when deciding which loans to fund. Moreover, lenders’ attention paid to the surrounding regions is distributed in a gradient fashion associated with their geographical distance to the disaster. Using a natural experiment based on the Ebola outbreak in Africa in 2014, our research shows that a natural disaster increases (over the short-term) the average contribution size and decreases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions closer to the affected region. In contrast, a natural disaster decreases (over the long-term) the average contribution size and increases (over the long-term) the average fundraising time per dollar for prosocial microloans by borrowers from regions farther away from the affected region. This redistribution of prosocial microlending is an unintended consequence of a natural disaster that inflicts long-term economic hardship in some regions. Policymakers and researchers should closely monitor the redistribution of prosocial microlending resulting from a natural disaster so that prompt action can be taken to alleviate potential negative consequences that may arise.

  abstract     = {Virtual teamwork has become a prevalent mode of collaboration. However, scant empirical attention has been given to the impact of virtual teamwork on individual members’ performance beyond the team setting. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying virtual teams in the context of online medical consultation (OMC) platforms. Specifically, we collect data from two OMC platforms during a time period when both platforms offered individual consultations (i.e., one patient connected with one physician) but only one offered team consultations (i.e., one patient connected with a team of physicians). Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences approach, we find that team participation has a robust, positive effect on physicians’ performance in individual consultations. We further explore the potential mechanisms through which team participation improves physicians’ performance. The empirical results indicate that the observed performance improvement is likely driven by peer effects in team settings. In particular, we find that physicians exert more effort in individual consultations after joining a team and that performance improvement is stronger when (1) a physician can easily observe the performance of the physician’s teammates (peers), (2) a physician has teammates (peers) who perform well in individual consultations, (3) a physician has teammates (peers) from the same hospital or the same city, or (4) a physician has a lower performance prior to joining in a team. Our findings shed new light on the boundary-spanning roles of virtual teams and provide timely insights into the ongoing development of OMC platforms.

  abstract     = {Combinatorial auctions offer several economic advantages but also face multiple technical challenges, including bid generation, the need to solve a combinatorial allocation problem, and determining reasonable prices. These challenges are even more pronounced in a combinatorial exchange, where bidders can simultaneously buy and sell combinations of goods. Motivated by truckload transportation markets, we explore new mechanisms for finding linear and anonymous Walrasian equilibrium prices in combinatorial auctions and exchanges where bidders can use a compact-bidding language to express their potentially complex preferences. With the goal of improving economic efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of the trucking industry, we identify significant potential gains by developing a method for integrated allocation and price determination based on an industry-specific bidding language. We also demonstrate our proposed mechanism’s adaptability and flexibility by considering a number of practical constraints. History: Martin Bichler, Senior Editor; Pallab Sanyal, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {In recent years, randomized experiments (or “A/B tests”) have become commonplace in many industrial settings as managers increasingly seek the aid of scientific rigor in their decision making. However, just as this practice has proliferated among firms, the problem of p -hacking—whereby experimenters adjust their sample size or try several statistical analyses until they find one that produces a statistically significant p -value—has emerged as a prevalent concern in the scientific community. Notably, many commentators have highlighted how A/B testing software enables and may even encourage p -hacking behavior. To investigate this phenomenon, we analyze the prevalence of p -hacking in a primary sample of 2,270 experiments conducted by 242 firms on a large U.S.-based e-commerce A/B testing platform. Using multiple statistical techniques—including a novel approach we call the asymmetric caliper test —we analyze the p -values corresponding to each experiment’s designated target metric across multiple significance thresholds. Our findings reveal essentially no evidence for p -hacking in our data. In an extended sample that examines p -hacking across all outcome metrics (encompassing more than 16,000 p -values in total), we similarly observe no evidence of p -hacking behavior. We use simulations to determine that if a modest effect of p -hacking were present in our data set, our methods would have the power to detect it at our current sample size. We contrast our results with the prevalence of p -hacking in academic contexts and discuss a number of possible factors explaining the divergent results, highlighting the potential roles of organizational learning and economic incentives.

  abstract     = {Multisided platforms often pursue growth strategies of expanding participants on one side (e.g., suppliers) and leveraging the cross-side network effect to attract participants on other sides (e.g., consumers). Whereas formal contractual agreements have traditionally been the norm for onboarding suppliers, an emerging trend involves platforms enabling consumers to interact with noncontracted suppliers via third-party enablers with both sharing profits from providing complementary services. This study examines this strategy of increasing market thickness in the context of food delivery platforms, focusing on the platforms’ inclusion of restaurants as “nonpartnered” restaurants. Nonpartnered restaurants do not pay commission fees for being listed on the platforms and do not control their menu or item prices. The platforms collect and transfer consumer orders to the third-party deliverers who place the order, pick it up, and deliver the food to consumers. The strategy has drawn regulatory scrutiny regarding its potential harm to nonpartnered restaurants and consumers. This research empirically investigates the impact of this noncontracted partnership on restaurants, leveraging two natural experiments: (1) a number of nonpartnered restaurants were listed on the platform, and (2) the restaurants were later delisted because of a governmental regulation. Our findings show that being added as a nonpartnered restaurant increases these restaurants’ revenue from takeout orders by about $1,410 per month. Adding nonpartnered restaurants also has a positive spillover effect on the revenue of partnered restaurants already on the platform. Finally, the delisting of nonpartnered restaurants leads to a drop in their takeout orders as well as a negative spillover on the revenue of partnered restaurants. In essence, a nonpartnered contract benefits most restaurants, especially independent restaurants. These insights can inform the design of platform and regulatory policies related to noncontracted growth strategies. History: Hsing Kenneth Cheng, Senior Editor; Gordon Burtch, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {Crowdsourcing contests have become increasingly popular as a means of seeking innovative solutions to business problems. However, the abundance of concurrent contests on platforms can lead to disparities in solvers’ contest awareness, resulting in “lost time”—the time elapsed between the start of a contest and a solver’s first visit. This study investigates how lost time influences solvers’ submission behavior and its subsequent impact on matching inefficacy as measured by solver disqualification, which occurs when a solver fails to produce a submission meeting the seeker’s baseline criteria. Utilizing a proprietary data set from a European crowdsourcing platform, we employ a mediation analysis framework to examine the relationship between lost time and two key dimensions of submission behavior: time to first submission and number of submissions. Our findings reveal that higher levels of lost time are associated with fewer submissions, indicating reduced solver persistence. However, this negative effect is partially mitigated by solvers’ faster initial submissions when facing lost time. Importantly, we demonstrate that changes in submission behavior fully mediate the negative impact of lost time on solver disqualification, highlighting the crucial role of submission behavior in influencing solver disqualification. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting latecomer disadvantage as an important mechanism driving solvers’ behavioral responses to lost time. Our study contributes to the crowdsourcing literature by uncovering the impact of lost time on solvers’ behavior and performance, offering valuable insights for contest design. By understanding and mitigating the effects of latecomer disadvantage, platforms can enhance the effectiveness of crowdsourcing in solving problems.

  abstract     = {Digital advancements have revolutionized customer service by enabling customers to easily express dissatisfaction and request resolutions through online platforms. Customer complaint management platforms are especially unique in facilitating provider-customer interactions, but researchers overlook implications from service provider anonymity. In this article, two randomized field experiments are conducted to examine a customer complaint management platform to identify how disclosure of service provider identity affects service performance, customer satisfaction, and biases in customers. Study 1, a large-scale randomized field experiment involving 75,041 customers and 1,280 service providers across 672 companies, finds that identity disclosure improves provider performance. This improvement is achieved by removing the provider’s dissociative anonymity, mitigating deindividuation, instilling self-awareness, and motivating personal responsibility. This effect is stronger for inexperienced service providers who work with many colleagues and have more discretion in handling complaints. Customers who receive identity details about providers benefit from better service and perceive higher satisfaction with complaint resolution. Study 2, a field experiment involving 2,710 customers, shows that customers report more satisfaction when customers identify that providers belong to the majority ethnic group compared with when they belong to an ethnic minority. Intriguingly, minority customers showed lower satisfaction with same-ethnicity providers, indicating that ethnic cues and identity matching significantly influence customer satisfaction. Four follow-up studies involving 1,211 participants identify the underlying mechanisms that influence customer and provider behaviors. The article concludes with practical implications for firms and platforms dedicated to customer service. History: Indranil Bardhan, Senior Editor; Idris Adjerid, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {On-demand service platforms connect customers with independent service providers (agents) by competitively setting service prices and wages. Mergers between on-demand service platforms have recently become prevalent, resulting in antitrust debates. A merger, although reducing competition, enables the agents on previously separate platforms to serve all the customers. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretical model to analyze the impact of a merger between two platforms. The two platforms compete on prices and wages before the merger, but are managed by a single firm after the merger. We show that a merger not only creates pooling benefits, but also enhances the cross-side network effect (i.e., customers benefit from more agents and vice versa). As a result, it can lead to a win-win-win outcome, where the platforms’ profits, consumer surplus, and labor welfare all improve after a merger. The win-win-win outcome is more probable if the premerger market is less saturated or if the market is more differentiated on the customer/agent side. Interestingly, a stronger within-side congestion effect may either strengthen or weaken a merger’s potential to benefit customers. Additionally, we show that a merger is less likely to improve consumer surplus and labor welfare if there are more multihoming agents in the market and that it is more likely to benefit labor welfare if there is less cross-side price transparency. Our results provide guidelines for antitrust policymakers to evaluate the impact of a merger between on-demand service platforms.

  abstract     = {Online retailers often confront the problem of order cancellation due to customers’ poor satisfaction with their online purchase decision, termed as choice satisfaction in this study. However, very little e-commerce literature has addressed customer choice satisfaction, and none, to our knowledge, has investigated how to design product display interfaces to achieve it. Drawing from choice closure theory and eye and vision research, we examine how product display orientation of an online shopping web page affects customers’ choice satisfaction upon purchase. We propose that a horizontal (versus vertical) display of comparable products on an e-commerce website is more positively related to customer choice satisfaction by promoting a higher level of choice closure (a psychological process by which online customers come to perceive a decision as completed and settled). Through five carefully designed experiments (including one using an eye-tracking device), we find that online customers achieve a higher level of choice satisfaction from an assortment of comparable products displayed horizontally than vertically on e-commerce websites. This effect results from the fact that a horizontal product display increases the amount of comparisons customers make between product options prior to making a purchase decision and consequential sense of choice closure after the decision. We also find that a cue of finality (e.g., adding a textual note “The end” to the product display) can largely attenuate this effect. The implications for online retailers’ product showcase strategies are discussed, along with future research directions. History: Jason Thatcher, Senior Editor; Heng Xu, Associate Editor. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {The threat of opportunistic behavior is an enduring problem in interorganizational information sharing based on sensitive data. The two sides of opportunism in interorganizational information sharing— information poaching by the information recipient and information manipulation by the information provider—may preclude beneficial information sharing relationships altogether. Previously proposed organizational and technical countermeasures against the threat of opportunism either fail to reliably prevent information poaching and manipulation or prevent only one of them at a time. To address these shortcomings, we develop three design principles for an information system that facilitates reliable information sharing based on sensitive data in interorganizational business transactions without revealing the actual data. We instantiate our design principles in a multicompany research consortium for wear-based leasing contracts for machine tools. Through in-depth interview sessions with business and technology experts, we demonstrate the efficacy of our artifact in addressing the two-sided opportunism problem. A survey-based evaluation of the artifact’s utility in the context of machine tool leasing shows that organizations are willing to engage in more interorganizational information sharing, rely more on shared information, and draw on more sensitive data when provided with our solution. The study makes three key contributions. First, it contributes to the literature on interorganizational information sharing by identifying information poaching and information manipulation as two sides of the same problem and by showing empirically that opportunities for beneficial business arise if both forms of opportunism are addressed simultaneously. Second, our design principles constitute a blueprint of a shared information system that enables reliable (i.e., verifiably truthful) information sharing between business partners without revealing the data underlying the shared information. Third, the study contributes to the literature on blockchain systems by recombining specific blockchain technology components, namely, private data collections, smart contracts, and joint governance, in a useful, novel way.

  abstract     = {Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces enable users to mint and trade digital assets, such as collectibles, trading cards, and digital artwork. Many of these platforms accommodate resale royalties, which return a predetermined percentage of the proceeds from future resales of the digital asset to the creator. Although the adoption of resale royalties may seem beneficial for NFT creators by providing a recurring source of income, it could have unintended consequences on the sales price and the liquidity of the underlying NFT, potentially affecting both the platform’s commission revenue and the creator’s short-term return. In this paper, we aim to understand the antecedents and consequences of resale royalties. Specifically, we empirically investigate the impact of minting costs on royalty rates and subsequently, the effects of resale royalties on primary market sales prices and liquidity. Our identification strategy combines a difference-in-differences model that leverages a policy change that eliminated up-front minting fees for creators and an instrumental variables approach. We find that NFT creators reduce royalty rates when they mint an NFT without incurring minting costs. Furthermore, we observe that higher royalty rates lead to reduced sales prices in the primary market, suggesting the presence of a delayed gratification effect as creators hope for future royalty payments. We also investigate the underlying mechanisms, and we find that NFT creators who are more confident about future resales tend to lower their primary sale prices but are unable to recoup those losses in the short term, providing evidence of an overconfidence effect . Surprisingly, we find that the presence of resale royalties also negatively affects market liquidity despite reduced sales prices. Our findings offer immediate implications for creators and platforms regarding resale royalty strategies and whether to enforce royalties.

  abstract     = {Enterprise systems (ESs) can be important for the development and maintenance of professional role identities. Prior work shows that a new ES implementation can trigger significant identity work in individuals and groups if it alters their tasks or responsibilities. What has received less attention is that the introduction of a new ES may affect multiple, interdependent professional groups simultaneously, changing how these professional groups can or must interact based on the system properties. Consequently, the introduction of a new ES may also affect how these groups maintain distinctive professional role identities. This study examines how the introduction of a new ES affects the identity work of interdependent professional groups in an organization. Drawing on a revelatory context, we studied the identity work of management accountants and financial accountants in six cases where a new ES merged traditionally separate financial and management accounting modules into one general accounting module. To understand the emergent identity work, we present the construct of a target identity (i.e., a tentative enhanced professional role identity that professional groups actively strive to achieve) and describe three patterns of identity work. We derive five propositions about the conditions under which interdependent professional groups develop a target identity, about the consequences of (not) achieving a target identity, and about the willingness of interdependent professional groups to renegotiate their role boundaries.

  abstract     = {Large volumes of online impressions are sold daily via real-time auctions to deliver targeted advertisements to consumers. Advertisers use data to learn about user preferences and select the most appropriate ad for each user, which also helps them optimize their bids in an ad auction. Although ad exchanges may provide some user data to advertisers, they are usually limited, and advertisers often acquire data from various sources to improve targeting performance. The acquisition of such data can significantly influence the revenue of the ad exchange, which motivates ad exchanges to take actions that reduce advertisers’ data acquisition costs and encourage them to buy data. Previous studies have examined the impact of ad exchanges revealing their data to advertisers, but little attention has been paid to the impact of ad exchanges subsidizing advertisers to acquire data from third parties. To address this gap, we propose three subsidy frameworks to increase ad exchange revenue by inducing more advertisers to acquire data: all subsidized (AS), winner subsidized (WS), and loser subsidized. Using a stylized model, we analyze the impact of subsidy provisions on the platform’s net revenue. Our results show that WS can be better or worse than AS depending on the cost of data acquisition, its beneficial impact on ad selection, and the distribution of impression values.

  abstract     = {Intensive care units (ICUs) are critical for treating severe health conditions but represent significant hospital expenditures. Accurate prediction of ICU length of stay (LoS) can enhance hospital resource management, reduce readmissions, and improve patient care. In recent years, widespread adoption of electronic health records and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have facilitated accurate predictions of ICU LoS. However, there is a notable gap in the literature on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that identify interactions between model input features to predict patient health outcomes. This gap is especially noteworthy as the medical literature suggests that complex interactions between clinical features are likely to significantly impact patient health outcomes. We propose a novel graph learning-based approach that offers state-of-the-art prediction and greater interpretability for ICU LoS prediction. Specifically, our graph-based XAI model can generate interaction-based explanations supported by evidence-based medicine, which provide rich patient-level insights compared with existing XAI methods. We test the statistical significance of our XAI approach using a distance-based separation index and utilize perturbation analyses to examine the sensitivity of our model explanations to changes in input features. Finally, we validate the explanations of our graph learning model using the conceptual evaluation property (Co-12) framework and a small-scale user study of ICU clinicians. Our approach offers interpretable predictions of ICU LoS grounded in design science research, which can facilitate greater integration of AI-enabled decision support systems in clinical workflows, thereby enabling clinicians to derive greater value.

  abstract     = {Player-versus-player (PvP) games often allow users to purchase superior virtual gears to increase their winning odds in battles against others. This game design, known as “pay to win,” generates substantial revenues from paying players, but it may also adversely affect the gaming experience of nonpaying players and lead to a decline in the game’s popularity. Game developers thus need to strike a balance between revenue and player participation. This paper develops a model to analyze optimal versioning and pricing strategies for PvP games. Building on the classic product line design framework with network effects, we allow a monopolistic game developer to strategically manipulate gameplay (dis-)advantages across different versions, which we refer to as tournament design, and this generates version-specific network effects. We characterize the developer’s optimal strategy and obtain the following insights. First, tournament design improves the developer’s flexibility in pricing and versioning, and it effectively mitigates the extent of product cannibalization. Second, tournament design enables the developer to monetize free players’ participation by offering multiple free versions, and a “freemium” strategy (i.e., the combination of a free-to-play model and a pay-to-win system) can arise in the optimum. Third, tournament design is particularly effective in increasing the developer’s profit when players are willing to play the game but are reluctant to pay. Fourth, tournament design leads to a Pareto improvement for both the developer and all players. The practical implications of these findings are also discussed.

  abstract     = {Data have become an important competitive asset, especially for online advertising platforms, leading to the emergence of a new data broker industry. Platforms can partner with data brokers to acquire external data to enhance their targeting capabilities, but this practice has stoked growing consumer privacy concerns. This study develops a game-theoretic model to examine the economic mechanism underlying the partnership between competing platforms and a data broker in a two-sided market. Interestingly, our analysis shows that increasing consumer privacy concerns caused by the data broker may encourage platforms to partner with the data broker rather than discourage them. The driving force is that, because of negative cross-side network effects from advertisers to consumers, increased privacy concerns can serve as a strategic lever to soften price competition on the advertiser side. However, when both platforms partner with the data broker, a prisoner’s dilemma may arise in equilibrium even when the data broker can greatly improve the targeting capabilities. We find that the platform-data broker partnership hurts consumer surplus when platforms adopt a pure ad-sponsored model without charging consumers, but it may benefit consumer surplus when platforms adopt a mixed model with ad-sponsored and subscription-based revenue. Moreover, our analysis indicates that platforms may not have incentives to adopt high levels of privacy protection and may instead adopt asymmetric privacy protection strategies, with one platform adopting high privacy protection and the other opting for low protection. A series of model extensions confirm the robustness of our key findings. We conclude with a discussion of managerial and policy implications.

  abstract     = {The subscription-based business model is disruptive in the copyright industries. More than a digitalized distribution channel, it fundamentally transforms both supply and demand sides by offering new forms of content creation, provision, and consumption. However, the effects of these business models on the local offline industry are less well understood, especially in the case of the motion picture industry. This study investigates the impact of the subscription-based business model on offline activity consumption in the motion picture industry. Leveraging a unique data set with individuals’ every transaction record and a difference-in-differences approach, we show that Netflix subscription interestingly increases offline movie consumption. Based on the argument that individuals have unmet social and hedonic demands that are imperfectly met by subscription-based services, like Netflix, we show that offline movie consumption actually increases postsubscription, accompanied by social and hedonic activities, like dining and entertainment spending. We also provide evidence that the identified positive effect on offline movie consumption is more pronounced for individuals with higher social and hedonic needs (i.e., lower-income people and younger people). Our work provides clear implications for managers and policymakers who are involved in both subscription-based platforms, like Netflix, and the traditional offline movie industry. In addition, we provide theoretical implications for the study of subscription-based platforms, the imperfect substitution of channels, and the role of social and hedonic value in technology-supported platforms.

  abstract     = {Previous studies have shown great interest in examining the performance impact of platform-based functions (PBFs) used by e-marketplace sellers and the contingent role of salient variables, such as seller reputation, in the e-marketplace. Their findings, however, are fragmented and inconsistent, as they generally focus on the net, separate effect of a single PBF with debatable findings. The theorization of how sellers should configure multiple types of PBFs as a whole to achieve high sales performance lags far behind the booming competition practice. To identify an effective PBF combination, this study takes a configurational perspective to identify appropriate PBF configurations that can achieve high sales performance for sellers with different product positions and reputations. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of a longitudinal data set of over 3,300 apparel sellers in a large e-marketplace yields interesting findings. The configuration results reveal recipes for PBF combinations for achieving high sales performance that vary across different levels of seller reputation and product positioning strategies. Our configuration findings suggest that sellers should configure PBFs according to distinctive product strategies accompanied by seller reputation conditions, where the resulting PBF configurations play an essential and multifaceted role in achieving high sales performances. Interestingly, our configuration analysis uncovers that for reputable sellers offering high-priced products, the utilization of pricing and marketing functions is counterproductive. Additionally, we observe complex interplays between after-sales functions and online reputation, characterized by complementary, substitutive, and independent relationships. Furthermore, our results demonstrate an asymmetry relationship between high and low sales configurations. It contributes to the emergent investigation of causal complexity in competitive strategy studies of e-marketplace sellers and provides specific causal recipes and holistic guidelines for sellers and platform operators.

  abstract     = {Online gig platforms have the potential to influence employment in existing industries. Popular press and academic research offer two competing predictions: First, online gig platforms may reduce the supply of incumbent workers by intensifying competition and obsoleting certain skills of workers; or, second, they may boost the supply of workers by increasing client-worker matching efficiency and creating new employment opportunities for workers. Yet, there has been limited understanding of the labor movements amid the rise of online gig platforms. Extending the skill-biased technical change literature, we study the impact of TaskRabbit—a location-based gig platform that matches freelance workers to local demand for domestic tasks (e.g., cleaning services)—on the local supply of incumbent, work-for-wages housekeeping workers. We also examine the heterogeneous effects across workers at different skill levels. Exploiting the staggered TaskRabbit expansion into U.S. cities, we identify a significant decrease in the number of incumbent housekeeping workers after TaskRabbit entry. Notably, this is mainly driven by a disproportionate decline in the number of middle-skilled workers (i.e., first-line managers, supervisors) whose tasks could easily be automated by TaskRabbit’s matching algorithms, but not low-skilled workers (i.e., janitors, cleaners) who typically perform manual tasks. Interestingly, TaskRabbit entry does not necessarily crowd out middle-skilled housekeeping workers, neither laying them off nor forcing them to other related occupations; rather, TaskRabbit entry supports self-employment within the housekeeping industry. These findings imply that online gig platforms may not naively be viewed as skill biased, especially for low-skilled workers; instead, they redistribute middle-skilled managerial workers whose cognitive tasks are automated by the sorting and matching algorithms to explore new self-employment opportunities for workers, stressing the need to reconsider online gig platforms as a means to reshape existing industries and stimulate entrepreneurial endeavors.

  abstract     = {The existing literature has long assumed that unethical behaviors are fueled by competition. Under this premise, rivalry and competition are often treated interchangeably. This study seeks to challenge this prevailing notion by introducing a conceptual distinction between rivalry and competition. Specifically, we explore the multifaceted relationship between rivalry and unethical behaviors in the context of online review self-injecting behaviors. Drawing on the collective regulatory focus framework and deterrence theory, we posit that rivalry-induced deterrence triggers a shift in mindset from promotion focus to prevention focus, which leads to the formation of mutual forbearance in self-injecting behaviors. Mutual forbearance collapses when one party unilaterally engages in self-injection, prompting the other party to retaliate by increasing their self-injecting activities. Additionally, we propose that firm reputation plays a crucial role in reinforcing the formation of mutual forbearance while mitigating its collapse. Employing an exhaustive data set from Ctrip.com and Qunar.com that comprises 85,939 observations from 3,996 hotels and spans 2018–2020, we found that the presence of an additional rival leads to a 3.2% decrease in self-injecting intensity. Furthermore, self-injecting intensity increases by 0.095% for every 1% rise in that of the rivals and increases by 0.041% for a 1% rise in that of the nonrival competitors. Crucially, our study identifies that firm reputation acts as a significant factor that strengthens the negative relationship between the number of rivals and self-injecting intensity and weakens the positive relationship between a hotel’s self-injecting and its rival’s self-injecting intensity. These empirical findings are supported by a myriad of robust examinations, including the use of a set of subsample analyses, alternative measures of independent variables, alternative instrumental variables, alternative observation time windows, and multiple endogeneity tests. This study contributes to the literature by highlighting the pervasive and potent role of rivalry as an understudied inhibitor of self-injecting behaviors. Our empirical evidence offers critical managerial implications for platforms, sellers, and consumers. History: Juan Feng, Senior Editor; Xitong Li, Associate Editor.

  abstract     = {The abundance of multiple types of consumer digital footprints recorded on e-commerce platforms has fueled the design of personalized recommender systems for decision support. However, capturing consumers’ inherent preferences for effective recommendations based on consumer digital footprints can be challenging because of the multitude of factors driving consumer behaviors. Model training and recommendation outcomes may become biased if other factors are inappropriately recognized as consumers’ inherent preferences in the learning process. Drawing on consumer behavior theories, we tease out various factors that drive consumers’ digital footprints at different consumption stages. We develop a novel recommendation approach, namely, DISC (Disentangling consumers’ Inherent preferences, item Salience effect, and Conformity effect), which leverages disentangled representation learning with a causal graph to derive the effect of each factor driving consumer behaviors. This approach provides personalized and interpretable recommendations based on the inference of consumers’ normative inherent preferences. The DISC model’s identifiability is demonstrated through theoretical analysis, enabling rigorous causal inference based on observational data. To evaluate DISC’s performance, extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data sets with a carefully designed protocol. The results reveal that DISC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly and possesses good interpretability. Moreover, we illustrate the potential impact of different marketing strategies’ by intervening on the disentangled causes through follow-up counterfactual analyses based on the causal graph. Our study contributes to the literature and practice by causally unpacking the behavioral mechanism behind consumers’ digital footprints and designing an interpretable personalized recommendation approach anchored in their inherent preferences.

  abstract     = {Traditionally thought of as “uncomfortable bedfellows,” consumer IT and fashion are becoming increasingly intertwined, which has given rise to a unique phenomenon termed “consumer IT fashion”—the collective enthusiasm in society for consumer technology. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain how IT fashion is perceived by individual consumers and subsequently influences consumer behavior. Our research aims to bridge this gap. By differentiating between societal-level and individual-level perceptions of IT fashion, the paper introduces novel constructs associated with IT fashion and fashionable consumer technology, particularly perceived societal-level IT fashion (PSITF, reflecting a person’s perception of society’s views on a technology) and perceived fashionableness of IT (PFIT, capturing a person’s perception of the technology’s fashionableness). Moreover, we identify drivers underlying PSITF and PFIT: collective adoption and social endorsement are the drivers of PSITF, whereas the novelty of IT and IT-identity congruity are the drivers of PFIT. A research model is developed to illustrate how IT fashion influences consumer behaviors, such as adoption and purchasing decisions. We conducted two empirical studies to assess our research model. In Study 1, we focused on consumers’ adoption decision of fashionable technology. The findings validate our conceptualization of IT fashion-related constructs and suggest that consumers are inclined to adopt fashionable IT when they believe it enhances their sense of belonging to a group (i.e., external symbolic value) and allows for self-expression (i.e., internal symbolic value). In Study 2, we explored consumers’ purchasing behavior, focusing on their willingness to pay (WTP) for a fashionable technology compared with the alternative IT product with identical functionalities. The results indicate that whereas consumers do acknowledge the symbolic values associated with using fashionable IT, these values do not necessarily translate into a greater WTP. Our research opens novel theoretical avenues for the exploration of IT fashion and lays the groundwork for future investigations in this domain. History: Manju K.

  abstract     = {This editorial introduces a conceptual framework that reimagines research on Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) as “digital development,” recognizing the inseparable intertwining of digital and development trajectories. This framing is aimed at the broader information systems (IS) research community, which includes ICT4D researchers, based both in the Global South and the Global North. Digital development encompasses three dimensions: digital in development (institutional use), digital for development (conscious design for outcomes), and development in a digital world (digital entanglement in development practice.). We argue that this reimagination is necessary for three reasons. First, digital technologies are becoming increasingly entangled with many development initiatives, implying the need to be studied as a duality, not a dualism. Second, we are witnessing the rising complexity of contemporary and emergent development challenges, which are not just limited to the Global South, but to the world at large. Third, the IS and ICT4D research fields have long worked in relative isolation from each other, but they need to synergistically create new theories and methods to address the rising complexities inherent in the “digital” and “development.” We provide a brief overview of the existing ICT4D field to identify critical areas for reconceptualization and expansion. This is then illustrated by examples from four empirical domains, namely humanitarian governance, global health, financial inclusion, and digital nomadism, which are representative of contemporary and emerging digital development challenges. This leads to the development of theoretical, policy and practice, and methodological implications, which provide a basis to formulate a research agenda for digital development.},
