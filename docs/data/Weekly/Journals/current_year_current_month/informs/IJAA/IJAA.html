  abstract = {Freight transportation marketplace rates are typically challenging to forecast accurately. However, these forecasted rates impact a company’s overall costs and play a key role in the management of the company’s shipping network and the procurement of supply on the open marketplace. In this work, we develop a novel statistical technique based on signature transforms and build a predictive and adaptive model to forecast these marketplace rates. Our technique is based on two key elements of the signature transform: its universal nonlinearity property, which linearizes the feature space and, hence, translates the forecasting problem into a linear regression, and the signature kernel, which allows for comparing efficiently similarities between time series data. Combined, it allows for efficient feature generation and precise identification of seasonality and regime switching in the forecasting process. An algorithm based on our technique has been deployed by Amazon middle-mile trucking operations with far superior forecast accuracy and better interpretability versus commercially available industry models even during periods of extreme disruption, such as the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in 2020 and the onset of the Ukraine conflict in early 2022. Furthermore, our technique captures the influence of business cycles and the heterogeneity of the marketplace, improving prediction accuracy by more than fivefold with an estimated annualized savings of more than $50 million per year since 2021.

  abstract = {Efficient last-mile logistics is the key underpinning for sustainable e-commerce growth. As the final leg of delivery services, last-mile delivery is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that requires careful operational planning and execution. In this paper, we describe the development of a novel zoning optimization framework that determines the assignment of customer locations to last-mile delivery stations for Ninja Van, a leading logistics service provider in Southeast Asia, to improve operational efficiency and work equity. The main technical development is a data-driven zoning optimization model that integrates the additively weighted Voronoi diagram and vehicle routing problem through a subgradient algorithm. The algorithm exploits the primal-dual formulation of the partitioning problem and is flexible enough to handle practical delivery scenarios with varying vehicle capacities and travel speeds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first zoning optimization model that considers general multivehicle zones with uncertain demand, and these are the main contextual features of Ninja Van and many other logistics companies. The zoning algorithm we develop provides preferable theoretical guarantees. The implementation of the new zoning system at Ninja Van led to an average reduction of 6.6% in the work span for the delivery stations and a 3.5% reduction in driver delivery times. In addition to the monetary benefits from the shortened work hours, the new zoning system contributed to improved worker welfare by balancing workloads and limiting overtime. This zoning optimization also brought transparency and valuable insights into the management of delivery stations and drivers at Ninja Van.

  abstract = {This paper presents data-driven approaches for integrated assortment planning and inventory allocation that significantly improve fulfillment efficiency at JD.com, a leading e-commerce company. JD.com uses a two-level distribution network that includes regional distribution centers (RDCs) and front distribution centers (FDCs). Selecting products to stock at FDCs and then, optimizing daily inventory allocation from RDCs to FDCs are critical to improving fulfillment efficiency, which is crucial for enhancing customer experiences. For assortment planning, we propose efficient algorithms to maximize the number of orders that can be fulfilled by FDCs (local fulfillment). For inventory allocation, we develop a novel end-to-end algorithm that integrates forecasting, optimization, and simulation to minimize lost sales and inventory-transfer costs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform existing approaches, increasing local order fulfillment rates by 0.54%, and our inventory allocation algorithm increases FDC demand satisfaction rates by 1.05%. Considering the high-volume operations of JD.com, with millions of weekly orders per region, these improvements yield substantial benefits beyond the company’s established supply chain system. Implementation across JD.com’s network has reduced costs, improved stock availability, and increased local order fulfillment rates for millions of orders annually.
