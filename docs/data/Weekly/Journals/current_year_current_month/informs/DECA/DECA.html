  abstract     = {Hazen and Sounderpandian (1999) claim to have demonstrated that ordinal equivalence of the buying price and the selling price for information entails that the utility function must have constant risk attitude (i.e., be linear or exponential). However, there is no explicit indication of the scope of the ordinal equivalence assumed—is it within any particular decision problem , or within all decision problems sharing the same utility function ? Here we explore the difference between these two assumptions, providing counterexamples for the constant risk attitude assertion in the first case, and in the second case a proof that buy-sell ordinal equivalence within all decision problems sharing the same utility forces constant risk attitude. In the first case, the simplest counterexample arises from the assertion that more refined information sources have greater information values.},

  abstract     = {In order to improve the energy utilization efficiency of the comprehensive energy park and the proportion of renewable energy grid connection, this paper first proposes to use the hybrid copula theory to construct a wind power and photovoltaics joint output model, reducing the uncertainty of wind power output and photovoltaic output. Secondly, this paper proposes the participation of hydrogen energy storage equipment in the power system scheduling of integrated energy parks. Hydrogen energy storage, as a clean, efficient, and sustainable carbon-free energy storage technology, can be used to mitigate the impact of wind power and photovoltaics output on the power grid. Finally, this paper proposes to construct an optimized scheduling model that considers economic optimization and proves the economic feasibility of the model through case analysis. The calculation results show that the comprehensive energy operating cost has been reduced by 14.15%, the proportion of thermal power output has been reduced by 32.54%, and the proportion of wind solar combined output has increased by 30.9%.},

  abstract     = {In multiobjective decision-making problems, it is common to encounter nondominated alternatives. In these situations, the decision-making process becomes complex, as each alternative offers better outcomes for some objectives and worse outcomes for others simultaneously. However, DMs still must choose a single alternative that provides an acceptable balance between the conflicting objectives, which can become exceedingly challenging. To address this scenario, our work introduces a decision-making framework aimed at supporting such decisions. Our proposed framework draws upon concepts from the field of Multi-Criteria Decision Making, and combines a novel simplex-like weight generation method with expert insights and machine learning data-driven procedures to establish an intuitive methodology that empowers DMs to select a single alternative from a range of alternatives. In this paper, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methodology through an example and two real-world decision cases from the oil and gas industry, each involving 128 alternatives and five distinct objectives.

  abstract     = {This paper provides a comprehensive overview of quantile-parameterized distributions (QPDs) as a tool for capturing expert predictions and parametric judgments. We survey a range of methods for constructing distributions that are parameterized by a set of quantile-probability pairs and describe an approach to generalizing them to enhance their tail flexibility. Furthermore, we explore the extension of QPDs to the multivariate setting, surveying the approaches to construct bivariate distributions, which can be adopted to obtain distributions with quantile-parameterized margins. Through this review and synthesis of the previously proposed methods, we aim to enhance the understanding and utilization of QPDs in various domains. Funding: U.
