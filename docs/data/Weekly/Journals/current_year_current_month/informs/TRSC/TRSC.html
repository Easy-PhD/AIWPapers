  abstract     = {Home repair and installation services require technicians to visit customers and resolve tasks of different complexities. Technicians often have heterogeneous skills. The geographical spread of customers makes achieving only “ideal” matches between technician skills and task requirements impractical. Additionally, technicians are regularly absent, for example, due to sickness. With only nonideal assignments regarding task requirement and technician skill, some tasks may remain unresolved and require a revisit and rework at a later day, leading to delayed service. For this sequential decision problem, every day, we iteratively build tours by adding “important” customers. The importance bases on analytical considerations and is measured by respecting urgency of service, routing efficiency, and risk of rework in an integrated fashion. We propose a state-dependent balance of these factors via reinforcement learning. We rely on proximal policy optimization (PPO) tailored to the problem specifics, analyzing the implications of specific algorithmic augmentations. A comprehensive study shows that taking a few nonideal assignments can be quite beneficial for the overall service quality. Furthermore, in states where a higher number of technicians are sick and many customers have overdue service deadlines, prioritizing service urgency is crucial. Conversely, in states with fewer sick technicians and fewer customers with overdue deadlines, routing efficiency should take precedence. We further demonstrate the value provided by a state-dependent parametrization via PPO. Funding: This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [Grants 413322447 and 444657906].

  abstract     = {Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can support human pickers in warehouse picking operations by reducing picker walking distance and increasing the warehouse’s throughput. AMR-assisted order picking is becoming popular as it can be conveniently implemented in conventional warehouses. This study proposes an integrated optimization model for scheduling the operations in AMR-assisted picker-to-parts warehouse systems. The model aims to minimize the makespan of all picking operations for a batch of orders by assigning batched orders to AMRs, selecting storage racks for AMRs and pickers to visit, and determining the routes of the AMRs and the pickers. A column- and row-generation algorithm is designed to solve the model using synchronization constraints between AMRs and pickers. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the applicability of our proposed algorithm in a warehouse that handles 16,000 orders per day. Our algorithm can solve small-scale instances to optimality. Our algorithm can also obtain better solutions in less time than a column generation (CG)–based method. Extensive experiments are conducted to derive managerial insights.

  abstract     = {A major step in the planning process of passenger railway operators is the assignment of rolling stock, that is, train units, to the trips of the timetable. A wide variety of mathematical optimization models have been proposed to support this task, which we discuss and argue to be justified in order to deal with operational differences between railway operators, and hence different planning requirements, in the best possible way. Our investigation focuses on two commonly used models, the composition model and the hypergraph model, that were developed for Netherlands Railways (NS) and DB Fernverkehr AG (DB), respectively. We compare these models in two distinct problem settings, an NS setting and DB-light setting and consider different model variants to tune the models to these settings. We prove that in both of these settings, the linear programming bounds of the two models are equally strong as long as a number of reasonable assumptions are met. However, through a numerical evaluation on NS and DB-light instances, we show that the numerical performance of the models strongly depends on the instances. Although the composition model is the most compact and fastest model for the NS instances, an adjusted version of this model grows quickly for the DB-light instances and is then outperformed by the considered hypergraph model variants. Moreover, we show that a depot-extended version of the hypergraph model is able to combine strengths of both models and show good performance on both the NS and DB-light instances.

  abstract     = {We study highway-based shipping of preowned automobiles by auto carriers, an important although overlooked problem in the automobile shipping literature. The special structure associated with auto carriers implies many different ways of loading a set of automobiles to an auto carrier with different loading costs. Thus, in addition to vehicle routing decisions, loading decisions are essential in automobile shipping optimization. The objective of our problem is to maximize the total revenue minus the total routing and loading cost subject to time windows and loading constraints among others. Most existing automobile shipping studies treat loading and routing separately; some studies partially address the loading aspect in routing optimization but only check the loading feasibility without evaluating the quality of loading decisions. We, thus, contribute to the literature by fully integrating loading decisions into routing decision making. An integrated machine learning (ML) and optimization approach is proposed to solve the problem. The overall approach follows a column generation–based solution framework, in which an insertion heuristic is proposed to find new routes based on existing routes, and ML is employed to predict the loading feasibility and estimate the minimum loading cost of a given route without solving the complex loading optimization problem. The integration of the ML approach and the insertion heuristic enables us to find high-quality new routes quickly in each column generation iteration. Two variants of this integrated approach are evaluated against a benchmark sequential approach in which routing and loading are tackled separately and another benchmark approach in which routing and loading are optimized jointly without using ML. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed integrated ML and optimization approach generates significantly better solutions than the sequential benchmark approach with only slightly more computation time and similar solutions to the joint optimization benchmark approach but with significantly less computation time. The proposed solution approach can be adopted by automobile shipping companies. It can also be adapted for other joint optimization problems, such as those in aircraft load planning. Funding: Y.

  abstract     = {The load planning problem is a critical challenge in service network design for parcel carriers: it decides how many trailers (or loads), perhaps of different types, to assign for dispatch over time between pairs of terminals. Another key challenge is to determine a flow plan that specifies how parcel volumes are assigned to planned loads. This paper considers the Outbound Load Planning Problem (OLPP) that considers flow and load planning challenges jointly to adjust loads and flows as demand forecast changes over time before the day of terminal operations. The paper develops a decision support tool to inform planners making these decisions at terminals across the network. It formulates the OLPP as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and shows that it admits a large number of symmetries in a network where each commodity can be routed through primary and alternate terminals. As a result, an optimization solver may return fundamentally different solutions to closely related problems (i.e., OLPPs with slightly different inputs), confusing planners and reducing trust in optimization. To remedy this limitation, the first contribution of the paper is to propose a lexicographical optimization approach that eliminates those symmetries by generating optimal solutions while staying close to a reference plan. The second contribution of the paper is the design of an optimization proxy that addresses the computational challenges of the optimization model. The optimization proxy combines a machine learning model and an MIP-based repair procedure to find near-optimal solutions that satisfy real-time constraints imposed by planners in the loop. An extensive computational study on industrial instances shows that the optimization proxy is around 10 times faster than the commercial solver in obtaining solutions of similar quality; the optimization proxy is also orders of magnitude faster for generating solutions that are consistent with each other. The proposed approach also demonstrates the benefits of the OLPP for load consolidation and the significant savings obtained from combining machine learning and optimization.

  abstract     = {The real-time joint optimization of inventory replenishment and vehicle routing is essential for cost-efficiently operating one-warehouse, multiple-retailer systems. This is complex because future demand predictions should capture (auto)correlation and lumpy retailer demand, and based upon such predictions, inventory replenishment and vehicle-routing decisions must be taken. Traditionally, such decisions are made by either making distributional assumptions or using machine-learning-based point forecasts. The former approach ignores nonstationary demand patterns, whereas the latter approach provides only a point forecast ignoring the inherent forecast error. Consequently, in practice, service levels often do not meet their targets, and truck fill rates fall short, harming the efficiency and sustainability of daily operations. We propose Scenario Predict-then-Optimize. This fully data-driven approach for online inventory routing consists of two subsequent steps at each real-time decision epoch. The scenario-predict step exploits neural networks—specifically multi-horizon quantile recurrent neural networks—to predict future demand quantiles, upon which we design a scenario sampling approach. The subsequent scenario-optimize step then solves a scenario-based two-stage stochastic programming approximation. Results show that our approach outperforms a classic sequential learning and (stochastic) optimization approach, distributional approaches, empirical sampling methods, residuals-based sample average approximation, and a state-of-the-art integrated learning and (stochastic) optimization approach. We show this on both synthetic data and large-scale real-life data from our industry partner. Our approach is appealing to practitioners. It is fast, does not rely on any distributional assumption, and does not face the burden of single-scenario forecasts. It also outperforms residuals-based scenario generation techniques. We show that it is robust for various demand and cost parameters, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of daily inventory replenishment and truck-routing decisions. Finally, scenario Predict-then-Optimize is general and can be easily extended to account for other operational constraints, making it a useful tool in practice.

  abstract     = {We explore a novel on-demand delivery mode based on cooperation between trucks and drones. A fleet of trucks, each of which carries several drones, travels along a closed-loop route, and the drones are launched from the trucks to pick up (or deliver) ordered parcels from their origin (or to their destination). The fulfillment of an order (i.e., delivering the parcel from its origin to its destination) includes three steps: pick up by a drone, transport by a truck, and delivery by a drone. We investigate how to fulfill all of the orders in one batch in order to minimize the total operational cost. We build a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model for this new on-demand delivery system in a network of multiple routes with transshipment. For drones, the assignment decision regarding the fulfillment stages for the orders and the location decision regarding the launching from and landing onto trucks are optimized by the proposed MIP model. An exact branch-and-price algorithm is designed to efficiently solve the model on large-scale instances. We validate the advantages of our algorithm in terms of computing time and solution quality through experiments on both artificial and real data. We validate the benefits of both implementing this new delivery mode and allowing transshipments among routes using a drone to serve multiple orders in one flying trip and consolidating orders. We also investigate the influences of the number of drones, speed, endurance time, unit penalty cost, and the geographic distribution of orders on the system’s operational cost.

Probability density functions of four key features—velocity, density, avoidance number, and intrusion number—were analyzed to characterize pedestrian behavior. Velocity–density fundamental diagrams were constructed for each crossing angle and fitted with functional forms from existing literature. Classification attempts using avoidance–intrusion numbers and velocity–density phase spaces revealed significant overlaps, highlighting the limitations of these metrics alone for scenario differentiation. To address this, machine learning models, such as logistic regression and random forest, were employed using all four features. Results showed robust classification performance with velocity and avoidance number emerging as the most influential features. Insights from feature importance metrics and classification accuracy offer practical guidance for managing high-density crowds, optimizing pedestrian flow, and designing safer public spaces.

  abstract     = {Station based and free floating are the two established parking regimes of micromobility systems. The former restricts pickup and drop-off to designated stations, which is less convenient for users but reduces the nuisance of sloppily parked rental bikes and scooters. Free-floating micromobility allows users to use any public parking space within the operating area, which increases user flexibility but creates organizational overhead to deal with improperly parked vehicles. Time-varying parking zones, realized via curbside management software (CMS) and geofencing technology, promise a reasonable compromise in the convenience-clutter trade-off. Based on spatiotemporal information, the city administration can either permanently (e.g., pedestrian zones) or temporarily (e.g., weekly farmers’ market) block certain urban areas in their CMS. The micromobility providers, also having access to the CMS, must ensure that vehicles are not returned to undesignated areas with digital fences during the announced times. This paper introduces an optimization approach for micromobility providers to plan time-varying parking zones, given the dynamic municipal parking limitations. Opening and closing urban areas for parking not only requires a digital reaction (i.e., (un)blocking via geofencing) but also produces costs (e.g., removing the remaining scooters of previous periods from the market square). Hence, our optimization task aims to minimize the total costs associated with dynamic parking zones, whereas representative user trips are guaranteed travel within a given time budget. Based on this setting, we show that most urban stakeholders can profit from time-varying parking zones (compared with a static operating area). Our case study based on Berlin-Mitte shows that dynamic parking zones reduce urban space usage at decreasing service costs and only slight user concessions regarding their convenience.

  abstract     = {When making route decisions, travelers may engage in a certain degree of reasoning about what others will do in the upcoming day, rendering yesterday’s shortest routes less attractive. This phenomenon was manifested in a recent virtual experiment that mimicked travelers’ repeated daily trip-making process. Unfortunately, prevailing day-to-day traffic dynamic models failed to faithfully reproduce the collected flow evolution data therein. To this end, we propose a day-to-day traffic behavior modeling framework based on the cognitive hierarchy theory, in which travelers with different levels of strategic reasoning capabilities form their own beliefs about lower step travelers’ capabilities when choosing their routes. Two widely studied day-to-day models, the network tatonnement process dynamic and the logit dynamic, are extended into the framework and studied as examples. Calibration of the virtual experiment is performed using the extended network tatonnement process dynamic, which fits the experimental data reasonably well. Our analysis reveals that both extended dynamics exhibit multiple equilibria, one of which corresponds to the classic user equilibrium. We further analyze and characterize these nonuser equilibrium states. Whereas analyzing global stability is intractable because of the presence of multiple equilibria, local stability criteria near equilibria are developed analytically. General insights on how key parameters affect the stability of user equilibria are unveiled.

  abstract     = {Passengers and parcels have long been served by separate vehicle fleets in urban areas. This study investigates the integration of parcel delivery and passenger ride services by a single fleet of mobility-on-demand companies. While this integration holds significant promise for enhancing profitability, it poses a challenge for operational sustainability: the detours required for parcel deliveries could adversely affect the passenger experience. We explore the viability of offering compensations as incentives for detours in a dynamic and stochastic environment. In this scenario, service requests are received dynamically, and the passengers’ acceptance of detours remains uncertain. We propose an innovative anticipatory policy, which integrates confirmation, compensation, and routing decisions. The proposed policy is underpinned by a novel regression-tree-based value function approximation. The numerical experiments have validated the efficacy of proposed policy. Moreover, we also explore the advantage of this combined transportation, which could effectively enhance profitability with few marginal costs. The study serves as a valuable reference for mobility-on-demand companies regarding the combined transportation of passengers and parcels.

  abstract     = {This paper seeks to improve an underutilized conventional bus route by converting it into a semiflexible transit system where passengers provide advance notice of their intended stops, allowing buses to skip downstream stops without demand by taking shortcuts. This approach increases stop density, reduces walking distances to and from bus stops, and maintains operational efficiency. To design this system, we develop optimization models that maximize the number of stops while adhering to tour duration and arrival time constraints. A case study in Allegany County, Maryland, demonstrates significant enhancements for routes that were both underutilized (where the probability of a stop lacking demand exceeded 45%) and had layouts conducive to substantial shortcuts. In these instances, the number of stops can be increased by up to 160%, with the actual improvement depending on route configuration, passenger demand, and advance notice requirements.

  abstract     = {Car use restrictions, such as the commonly implemented license plate restriction policy (PRP), are regarded as effective strategies for alleviating traffic congestion in many cities worldwide. Although these regulations help reduce daily vehicle volumes and evenly distribute them, they also limit commuters’ freedom to choose when to drive. A recent flexible car use restriction policy (FRP) allows commuters to select specific days to refrain from using their cars within a restriction cycle, enhancing travelers’ flexibility in urgent situations. Although the original FRP (O-FRP) may incur slightly higher average driving costs compared with the PRP due to uneven car use distribution, it can ultimately lower overall travel costs by accommodating more car uses during emergencies. This study introduces an interlocking FRP (IL-FRP), which groups travelers and assigns them different restriction cycles starting from distinct weekdays. Theoretical analysis reveals that, even under relaxed nonlinear travel cost assumptions, the user equilibrium solution of the IL-FRP, under ideal conditions, converges with the system optimal solution and further reaches the FRP’s theoretical lower bound while minimizing both driving and transit costs. Additionally, we develop two IL-FRP variants that are applicable regardless of the urgency probability distribution: the equally grouped FRP (ILE-FRP) and the arbitrarily grouped FRP (Arb-FRP). To derive equilibrium solutions for all FRPs under different parameter settings, we present a three-step learning algorithm using the mean field game framework. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of this algorithm and demonstrate that IL-FRP, ILE-FRP, and Arb-FRP offer advantages over O-FRP in terms of total travel cost. A series of laboratory experiments was conducted to support our theoretical findings. The results indicate some bounded rationality among individuals but align consistently with our theoretical predictions and learning outcomes.
