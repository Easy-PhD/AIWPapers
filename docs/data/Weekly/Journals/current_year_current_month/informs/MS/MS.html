  abstract     = {The capability of higher-ability managers to acquire and use resources more efficiently than lower-ability managers suggests a positive linear relation between labor investment efficiency (LIE) and managerial ability (MA). However, a puzzle emerges about how the best managers set themselves apart from their peers, calling into question the linearity of the relation between LIE and MA. We explore this puzzle by asking how the highest-ability managers achieve the highest performance levels. We then investigate this puzzle empirically by considering alternatives to a linear relation between LIE and MA. We begin with the distinction that managers achieve the highest performance when they combine efficient exploitation of existing products and services with successful exploration for innovations in products and services. This point is relevant to our puzzle because a firm’s labor needs for exploration are high and unpredictable. Thus, we expect the highest-ability managers to purposefully invest more than predicted by a model of optimal labor investment across firms. In contrast, we expect low-ability managers, who are less able to evaluate, forecast, and make efficient investments, to deviate more from predicted labor investment and vacillate between over- and underinvestment. We present evidence that supports our predictions of nonlinear relations between LIE and MA, with high-ability managers investing more than predicted and low-ability managers over- and underinvesting. We make and test related hypotheses about exploration (investment in research and development), and we probe further by relating future firm performance to over- and underinvestment in labor for different levels of MA.

We find that clear, explicit regulations significantly boost crowdfunding volumes in a global sample of digital finance. Using proxies to measure regulatory detail in three types of countries—countries that sometimes, always, or never had regulation—in a series of difference-in-difference regressions, we show a significant positive relation between regulatory clarity and the level of debt crowdfunding. There is little effect on the level of equity crowdfunding. Clear regulations appear to encourage the creation of new crowdfunding platforms rather than concentrating activity in existing ones.

  abstract     = {We establish the first axiomatic theory for diversification indices using six intuitive axioms: nonnegativity, location invariance, scale invariance, rationality, normalization, and continuity. The unique class of indices satisfying these axioms, called the diversification quotients (DQs), are defined based on a parametric family of risk measures. A further axiom of portfolio convexity pins down DQs based on coherent risk measures. The DQ has many attractive properties, and it can address several theoretical and practical limitations of existing indices. In particular, for the popular risk measures value at risk and expected shortfall, the corresponding DQ admits simple formulas, and it is efficient to optimize in portfolio selection. Moreover, it can properly capture tail heaviness and common shocks, which are neglected by traditional diversification indices. When illustrated with financial data, the DQ is intuitive to interpret, and its performance is competitive against other diversification indices.

However, in experimental settings with one-sided noncompliance extant empirical approaches may not produce the estimands a decision maker needs to solve the problem of interest. For example, these experimental designs are common in digital advertising settings but typical methods do not yield effects that inform the intensive margin: how many consumers should be reached or how much should be spent on a campaign. We propose a solution that combines a novel multicell experimental design with modern estimation techniques that enables decision makers to solve problems with an intensive margin. Our design is straightforward to implement and does not require additional budget. We illustrate our method through simulations calibrated using an advertising experiment at Facebook, demonstrating its superior performance in various scenarios and its advantage over direct optimization approaches.

  abstract     = {The renewed interest among managers and management researchers in stakeholder governance has also underscored the shortage of quantitative methods available for studying business firms as political systems. A critical problem for researchers applying coalition-based theories of organizational politics to observational data is that the units of analysis, coined “subcoalitions,” are often unobservable. This paper introduces subcoalition cluster analysis (SCA) as a new computational framework for analyzing intrafirm conflict that permits researchers to model groups of heterogeneous actors in terms of a smaller set of representative subcoalitions. The SCA approach to identifying latent fault-lines among groups of actors is based on widely held ideas in management research about the structure of intrafirm coalition politics, is computationally practicable in settings with many alternatives or actors, and can be straightforwardly applied to observational settings with incomplete data on actor preferences. We then apply SCA to two cases in which an organization characterized by multiple, partially inconsistent goals and stakeholders with heterogeneous preferences face a politically contested decision. In both cases, we first analyze preference data using SCA to identify the subcoalition structure that best characterizes the set of actors in the organization. We then use the SCA output as a dependent variable in an analysis of the predictors of subcoalition membership in the first case and as an independent variable in an analysis of the changing patterns of social influence in the second.

  abstract     = {We investigate whether and to what extent financial markets value and respond to operations management (OM)-related information in quarterly earnings calls directed toward financial market participants. We develop and use a novel construct called “stated OM focus” (SOMF) to mine the incidence of and emphasis on OM information in the quarterly earnings conference calls for a large cross-section of firms (S&P 1500) over a time frame of 15 years. We empirically establish the value-relevance of OM information as well as summarize and capture both explanatory and predictive aspects of the OM function’s contribution to firm value. We show that OM-related information disclosed by firms systematically, significantly, positively, and persistently affects abnormal stock returns after controlling for known covariates and controls (financial metrics, standard OM metrics, firm and time effects, and lexical-structure related) and after accounting for earnings surprise. Furthermore, we find evidence that firms’ stated OM focus bears significant predictive power in the short term. Long-short portfolios, created using a sorting signal derived solely from stated OM-focus information, predict future abnormal returns consistently over one, two and three months forward from the earnings call event. We show that the OM information metric is reliable and bears internal, external, and predictive validity. These findings offer useful implications for firms, financial market participants, and OM function stakeholders. This paper was accepted by Jayashankar Swaminathan, operations management.

Whereas such leveraged payouts privately benefit shareholders, leverage comes at the social cost of distorting their incentives, thereby lowering productivity and discouraging investment. If leverage is unregulated (for example, because of the presence of a shadow banking system), then the optimal monetary policy seeks to contain such socially costly leveraged payouts by stimulating investment in response to adverse shocks only up to a level below the first best. The optimal monetary policy may even consist of leaning against the wind, that is, not stimulating the economy at all, in order to fully contain leveraged payouts and maintain productive efficiency.

  abstract     = {Generative large language models (GLLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 by OpenAI, are emerging as powerful tools for textual analysis tasks in accounting research. GLLMs can solve any textual analysis task solvable using nongenerative methods as well as tasks previously only solvable using human coding. Whereas GLLMs are new and powerful, they also come with limitations and present new challenges that require care and due diligence. This paper highlights the applications of GLLMs for accounting research and compares them with existing methods. It also provides a framework on how to effectively use GLLMs by addressing key considerations, such as model selection, prompt engineering, and ensuring construct validity. In a case study, I demonstrate the capabilities of GLLMs by detecting nonanswers in earnings conference calls, a traditionally challenging task to automate. The new GPT method achieves an accuracy of 96% and reduces the nonanswer error rate by 70% relative to the existing Gow et al. (2021) method. Finally, I discuss the importance of addressing bias, replicability, and data sharing concerns when using GLLMs. Taken together, this paper provides researchers, reviewers, and editors with the knowledge and tools to effectively use and evaluate GLLMs for academic research.

  abstract     = {Despite utilizing technical prevention methods and enacting copyright protection legislation, digital piracy has remained a persistent problem. We examine policy remedies to digital piracy whereby the policymaker has to balance its budget between fines on detected pirates, subsidies for legal purchases, and restitution to the firm. In our model, users choose whether to subscribe, copy, or not use the good, a firm decides on subscription fee and quality, and a policymaker determines subsidies, fines, and restitution. We find that the firm’s subscription fee is always increasing in subsidies, fines, and restitution under a budget balance constraint. The impact of these policy instruments on the firm’s investment in quality depends on how user marginal utility is influenced by the quality of the good and how the policymaker redistributes fines back to society, if at all. Using two specific functional forms with additive and multiplicative utility, we explain how these factors come into play. With additive utility, fines increase the firm’s investment in quality. However, with multiplicative utility the firm’s investment in quality decreases with fines if fines are used alone or alongside subsidies. In contrast to prior research, findings of our general framework illustrate that imposing fines on detected pirates “can” be socially optimal when accounting for the policymaker’s budget balance. Our specific functional forms also serve as two instances where imposing fines is always welfare maximizing. Finally, we find that although the policymaker’s optimal intervention improves social welfare and mitigates digital piracy, it leads to a reduction in consumer surplus.

  abstract     = {Bankruptcy reforms that improve lenders’ ability to recover claims from financially distressed borrowers can mitigate zombie lending. However, we show that after a 2016 bankruptcy reform in India, lenders are reluctant to recognize zombie credit as nonperforming, impeding reform efficacy. A subsequent complementary regulation targeting lender discretion in recognizing nonperforming assets improves zombie recognition fivefold. The lender disincentive to recognize zombies arises from undercapitalized banks’ reluctance to realize loan losses and political economy frictions at state-owned banks. Resolving zombie credit allows lenders to redirect credit to healthy borrowers, but effects are muted at banks more exposed to zombie borrowers. This paper was accepted by Victoria Ivashina, finance.

  abstract     = {The dynamics of random transitive delegations on a graph are of particular interest when viewed through the lens of an emerging voting paradigm: liquid democracy . This paradigm allows voters to choose between directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters so that those selected cast a vote weighted by the number of delegations that they received. In the epistemic setting, where voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth, previous work showed that a few voters may amass such a large amount of influence that liquid democracy is less likely to identify the ground truth than direct voting. We quantify the amount of permissible concentration of power and examine more realistic delegation models, showing that they behave well by ensuring that (with high probability) there is a permissible limit on the maximum number of delegations received. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the delegation process is similar to well-known processes on random graphs that are sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Along the way, we prove new bounds on the size of the largest component in an infinite Pólya urn process, which may be of independent interest. In addition, we empirically validate the theoretical results, running six experiments (for a total of N = 168 participants, 62 delegation graphs, and over 11,000 votes collected). We find that empirical delegation behaviors meet the conditions for our positive theoretical guarantees. Overall, our work alleviates concerns raised about liquid democracy and bolsters the case for the applicability of this emerging paradigm.

  abstract     = {The Inflation Reduction Act establishes a new 15% corporate minimum tax on the adjusted financial accounting income for large U.S. corporations. Although the minimum tax is estimated to raise $222 billion over 10 years, some fear firms will manipulate their accounting earnings to reduce their tax liabilities, resulting in less revenue raised. Using an event study, we examine the extent to which investors believe this tax will reduce firm value. We examine stock market reactions around key legislative developments leading to the enactment of the book minimum tax. Our findings show targeted firms experience significantly lower stock returns than nontargeted firms during the enactment process (about 1.4%–1.8% of firm value). In aggregate, our findings are consistent with the Joint Committee on Taxation’s revenue estimates. In cross-sectional tests, we fail to find evidence that firms most likely to avoid the tax via earnings management experience more positive returns. We also fail to find less negative returns for firms most likely to pass on the tax to consumers. Overall, our results suggest investors do not expect firms to avoid this tax. Instead, they appear to expect a significant portion of the corporate minimum tax to be remitted by firms and borne by shareholders. This paper was accepted by Ranjani Krishnan, accounting.

  abstract     = {Investors have limited and time-varying attention. These constraints are heterogeneous across investors, which can create asymmetric information and adverse selection problems. We show how firms take these constraints into account: They release harder-to-process news in periods when investor attention is higher. We use an institutional discontinuity within the U.S. corporate filing system to measure these effects. Filings before 5:30 p.m. become available immediately, whereas filings after 5:30 p.m. only become visible the next morning and attract less attention. Firms release longer and more complex news just before the cutoff, giving investors the longest possible period to absorb the information before markets open. Firms experience faster price convergence and more liquidity after precutoff news despite their complexity, which is consistent with the additional attention that they attract. We outline a framework in which the need for investors to spread their attention across different ideas induces firms to file their more complex filings at times when investor attention is higher. Our results are consistent with an equilibrium in which investors pay more attention to complex news and in which firms with complex news time them to target investor attention.

  abstract     = {Decision makers often simultaneously face many related but heterogeneous learning problems. For instance, a large retailer may wish to learn product demand at different stores to solve pricing or inventory problems, making it desirable to learn jointly for stores serving similar customers; alternatively, a hospital network may wish to learn patient risk at different providers to allocate personalized interventions, making it desirable to learn jointly for hospitals serving similar patient populations. Motivated by real data sets, we study a natural setting where the unknown parameter in each learning instance can be decomposed into a shared global parameter plus a sparse instance-specific term. We propose a novel two-stage multitask learning estimator that exploits this structure in a sample-efficient way, using a unique combination of robust statistics (to learn across similar instances) and LASSO regression (to debias the results). Our estimator yields improved sample complexity bounds in the feature dimension d relative to commonly employed estimators; this improvement is exponential for “data-poor” instances, which benefit the most from multitask learning. We illustrate the utility of these results for online learning by embedding our multitask estimator within simultaneous contextual bandit algorithms. We specify a dynamic calibration of our estimator to appropriately balance the bias-variance trade-off over time, improving the resulting regret bounds in the context dimension d . Finally, we illustrate the value of our approach on synthetic and real data sets. This paper was accepted by J. George Shanthikumar, data science.

  abstract     = {We provide strong empirical evidence for time-series predictability of the intraday return on the aggregate market portfolio by exploiting lagged high-frequency cross-sectional returns on the factor zoo. Our results rely on the use of modern machine-learning techniques to regularize the predictive regressions and help tame the signals stemming from the zoo together with techniques from financial econometrics to differentiate between continuous and theoretically nonpredictable discontinuous high-frequency price increments. Using the predictions from the model estimated for the aggregate market portfolio in the formulation of simple intraday trading strategies for a set of highly liquid ETFs results in sizeable out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and alphas after accounting for transaction costs. Further dissecting the abnormal intraday returns, we find that most of the superior performance may be traced to periods of high economic uncertainty and a few key factors related to tail risk and liquidity, pointing to slow-moving capital and the gradual incorporation of new information as the underlying mechanisms at work.

  abstract     = {Satellite images of the parking lots of U.S. retail firms provide information about the firms’ future earnings, and the limited access to these images produces information asymmetry between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors. We construct a cloud-based information risk (CIR) measure to capture this satellite information risk and investigate its asset pricing performance. We find that CIR positively predicts future stock returns of retail firms in the cross-section and that the predictability cannot be explained by weather reasons. We provide evidence that CIR indeed captures the information asymmetry among investors. The profitability of short selling is more pronounced on clear days. The return predictability of CIR is more pronounced in preannouncement periods. During cloudy days, parking lot traffic data from satellite images are harder to obtain, and the retail store sales estimated using parking lot data are noisier. We further show that high CIR is associated with low liquidity and that the decrease in liquidity purchases is greater than the decrease in liquidity sales. Our empirical analyses suggest that information asymmetry is priced and that CIR affects equity premiums through the liquidity channel, which are consistent with the theoretical predictions from a noisy rational expectations equilibrium model under imperfect competition.

By focusing on price-directed search markets, we offer a novel perspective on the application of limited time offers by firms and their implications for social welfare. We build a search model where firms advertise dynamic pricing to influence a consumer’s search order. Across various model settings, we demonstrate that limited time offers serve as the most effective pricing tool for firms to achieve search prominence or implement search discrimination, with their impact on social welfare varying depending on the market context. In particular, although existing literature suggests that limited time offers are anticompetitive in markets where prices are unobservable presearch, our findings show that, in markets with observable prices, limited time offers can enhance social efficiency in certain cases by facilitating a socially optimal search order.

  abstract     = {Two-sided platforms rely on their recommendation algorithms to help visitors successfully find a match. However, on platforms such as VolunteerMatch, which has facilitated millions of connections between volunteers and nonprofits, a sizable fraction of website traffic arrives directly to a nonprofit’s volunteering page via an external link, thus bypassing the platform’s recommendation algorithm. We study how such platforms should account for this external traffic in the design of their recommendation algorithms, given the goal of maximizing successful matches. We model the platform’s problem as a special case of online matching, where (using VolunteerMatch terminology) volunteers arrive sequentially and probabilistically match with one opportunity, each of which has a finite need for volunteers. In our framework, external traffic is interested only in their targeted opportunity; by contrast, internal traffic may be interested in many opportunities, and the platform’s online algorithm selects which opportunity to recommend. In evaluating the performance of different algorithms, we refine the notion of competitive ratio by parameterizing it based on the amount of external traffic. After demonstrating the shortcomings of a commonly used algorithm that is optimal in the absence of external traffic, we propose a new algorithm, adaptive capacity ( AC ), which accounts for matches differently based on whether they originate from internal or external traffic. We provide a lower bound on AC ’s competitive ratio that is increasing in the amount of external traffic and that is close to (and, in some regimes, exactly matches) the parameterized upper bound we establish on the competitive ratio of any online algorithm. We complement our theoretical results with a numerical study motivated by VolunteerMatch data where we demonstrate the strong performance of AC relative to current practice and further our understanding of the difference between AC and other commonly used algorithms.

  abstract     = {This paper studies category captaincy , a vertical relationship where retailers delegate shelf placement and pricing decisions of an entire product category to one of the leading manufacturers within that category. These contracts involve preferential treatment given to certain brands within the retailer. However, they are confidential, and empirical analysis has been limited. To study the prevalence and welfare impact of these contracts, I develop a novel approach to infer the presence of captaincy contracts based on preferential treatment in shelf placement and pricing. I first classify retailers into different captaincy types based on a brand × retailer specific quality of shelf placement inferred from a demand model. I then conduct pricing tests and find that captains, in line with theoretical predictions and industry anecdotes, eliminate double markups from their own products but not from competitor products. Comparative statics show that captaincy relationships increase the market share of the captain, but they can also increase consumer welfare by about 5% due to the elimination of double markups on the captain’s products.

  abstract     = {Urban infrastructure is vital for sustainable cities. In recent years, municipal governments have invested heavily in the expansion of bike lane networks to meet growing demand, promote ridership, and reduce emissions. However, reallocating road capacity to cycling is often contentious because of the risk of amplifying traffic congestion. In this paper, we develop a method for planning bike lanes that accounts for ridership and congestion effects. We first present a procedure for estimating parameters of a traffic equilibrium model, which combines an inverse optimization method for predicting driving times with an instrumental variables method for estimating a commuter mode choice model. We then formulate a prescriptive model that selects paths in a road network for bike lane installation while endogenizing cycling demand and driving travel times. We conduct an empirical study on the City of Chicago that brings together several data sets that describe the urban environment—including the road and bike lane networks, vehicle flows, commuter mode choices, bike share trips, driving and cycling routes, demographic features, and points of interest—with the goal of estimating the impact of expanding Chicago’s bike lane network. We estimate that adding 25 miles of bike lanes as prescribed by our model can lift cycling ridership from 3.6% to 6.1%, with at most a 9.4% increase in driving times. We also find that three intuitive heuristics for bike lane planning can lead to lower ridership and worse congestion outcomes, highlighting the value of a holistic and data-driven approach to urban infrastructure planning.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates how having more White coworkers influences the subsequent retention and promotion of Black women relative to other race-gender groups. Studying 9,037 new hires at a professional services firm, we first document large racial turnover and promotion gaps: Even after controlling for observable characteristics, Black employees are 6.7 percentage points (32%) more likely to turn over within two years and 18.7 percentage points (26%) less likely to be promoted on time than their White counterparts. The largest turnover gap is between Black and White women, at 8.9 percentage points (51%). We argue that initial assignment to project teams is conditionally random based on placebo tests and qualitative evidence. Under this assumption, we show that a one-standard-deviation (20.8 percentage points) increase in the share of White coworkers is associated with a 15.8-percentage-point increase in turnover and an 11.5-percentage-point decrease in promotion for Black women. We refer to these effects as intersectional: Black women are the only race-gender group whose turnover and promotion are negatively impacted by White coworkers. We explore potential causal pathways through which these peer effects may emerge: Black women who were initially assigned to Whiter teams are subsequently more likely to be labeled as low performers and report fewer billable hours, both of which are predictors of higher turnover and lower promotion for all employees. Our findings contribute to the literature on peer effects, intersectionality, and the practice of managing race and gender inequality in organizations.

  abstract     = {A critical governance challenge for on-demand digital platforms is to increase the participation of their service providers. In this research, we design novel incentive structures by taking the unique features of on-demand digital platforms into account. In 12 micro randomized trials conducted in partnership with a major on-demand digital platform, we examine how combining monetary with nonmonetary incentives and providing them within a loss-aversion framework could motivate service providers to increase their participation levels. We show that in on-demand platforms the nonmonetary incentives inhibit the impact of monetary incentives on service provider participation once they are offered together. Furthermore, in contrast to traditional work settings, offering incentives within a loss-aversion framework only increases the effectiveness of nonmonetary incentives. We provide theoretical explanations and empirical examinations for these counterintuitive results. The insights from this research could be used by on-demand digital platforms to effectively mobilize and sustain their service providers’ participation to meet real-time stochastic demand.

  abstract     = {There is evidence that many people do not report their types truthfully in strategy-proof mechanisms. One of the leading explanations is mechanism complexity. We propose a novel way of describing any strategy-proof mechanism with the aim to reduce the ensuing cognitive load on players and, hence, to increase truthful reporting. The description highlights that a player is guaranteed to obtain a most preferred feasible allocation based on her reported type and that feasibility depends only on the other players’ reports. Optimality of truthful reporting should therefore become more “apparent.” We experimentally test this prediction using the top trading cycles mechanism for matching applicants to positions. The proposed description increases truth-telling. This increase positively interacts with subject numeracy. This paper was accepted by Dorothea Kübler, behavioral economics and decision analysis.

  abstract     = {We propose a new performance attribution framework that decomposes a constrained portfolio’s holdings, expected returns, variance, expected utility, and realized returns into components attributable to (1) the unconstrained mean-variance optimal portfolio; (2) individual static constraints; and (3) information, if any, arising from those constraints. A key contribution of our framework is the recognition that constraints may contain information that is correlated with returns, in which case imposing such constraints can affect performance. We extend our framework to accommodate estimation risk in portfolio construction using Bayesian portfolio analysis, which allows one to select constraints that improve—or are least detrimental to—future performance. We provide simulations and empirical examples involving constraints on environmental, social, and governance portfolios. Under certain scenarios, constraints may improve portfolio performance relative to a passive benchmark that does not account for the information contained in these constraints.

  abstract     = {Two-stage screening programs for colorectal cancer (CRC) detection typically involve a first-stage test that evaluates fecal-hemoglobin (f-Hb) concentration in stool samples, with positive results leading to a recommended second-stage diagnostic test (colonoscopy). We explore the design of the first-stage test—specifically the selection of f-Hb cutoffs to report test outcomes—to balance screening effectiveness (CRC and polyp detection) and efficiency (colonoscopy costs), considering that not all individuals follow up with a colonoscopy. We propose an information design model that integrates Bayesian persuasion with information avoidance to address this issue. The model is applied to the design of Singapore’s CRC screening program and calibrated using data from multiple sources, including a nationwide survey of 3,920 respondents in Singapore. Our findings indicate that under certain conditions, using a single cutoff maximizes follow-up adherence, whereas showing exact f-Hb readings optimizes detection effectiveness. Raising the cutoff to 39 μ g / g , as compared with the current practice, could detect 21% more CRC and polyp cases, reduce colonoscopies by 27%, and lower lifetime CRC risk by 11%. This adjustment would reduce public healthcare expenditure by S$20 million and individual spending by S$12 million on average in screening costs. Choosing appropriate cutoffs for the first-stage test can significantly enhance the screening effectiveness while efficiently managing colonoscopy demands. The prevalent practice of using lower cutoffs to achieve high sensitivity may lead to excessive unnecessary colonoscopies and reduced follow-up adherence.

  abstract     = {Businesses across industries, such as food delivery apps and GPS navigation systems, routinely provide customers with time estimates in inherently uncertain contexts. How does the format of these time estimates affect customers’ satisfaction? In particular, should companies provide customers with a point estimate representing the best estimate, or should they communicate the inherent uncertainty in outcomes by providing a range estimate? In eight preregistered experiments ( N = 5,323), participants observed time estimates provided by an app, and we manipulated whether the app presented the time estimates as a point estimate (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 45 minutes.”) or a range (e.g., “Your food will arrive in 40–50 minutes.”). After participants learned about the app’s prediction performance by sampling a set of past outcomes, we measured participants’ evaluation of the app. We find that participants judged the app more positively when it provided a range rather than a point estimate. These results held across different domains, different time durations, different underlying outcome distributions, and an incentive-compatible design. We also find that this preference is not simply due to people’s dislike of late outcomes, as participants also rated ranges more positively than conservative point estimates corresponding to the upper (i.e., later) bound of the range. These findings suggest that companies can increase customer satisfaction with realized time estimates by communicating the uncertainty inherent in these time estimates.

  abstract     = {GAAP’s “Management Approach” to segment reporting (ASC 280) requires firms to report segment profit/loss as the measure managers use when allocating resources internally across segments under the assumption that investors benefit from viewing segment performance through the eyes of management. We examine how segment performance measurement aligns with the way that investors use segment profit/loss measures externally. We first survey professional investors and find that they primarily use segment profit/loss to assess firm value and therefore desire measures focused on persistent income items that help predict future performance. Next, for a sample of public multi-segment firms from 2003 to 2018, we hand-collect details on the construction of firms’ segment profit/loss measures and compare them to the same firms’ valuation-focused measures (i.e., non-GAAP earnings and non-GAAP segment profit/loss). Relative to non-GAAP measures, ASC 280 segment profit/loss is significantly more likely to include less persistent items (e.g., restructuring charges) and exclude more persistent items (e.g., interest expense). ASC 280 segment profit/loss is also less predictive of future performance and less value relevant than non-GAAP measures. These differences are attributable to ASC 280 yielding segment profit/loss measures that focus on the controllability of items by segment managers instead of items’ persistence. Overall, ASC 280’s segment profit/loss exhibits misalignment between its internal use by managers (i.e., internal resource allocation) and its primary external use by investors (i.e., valuation), which limits its usefulness for investors. Our study informs market participants and standard setters considering the usefulness of segment disclosures. This paper was accepted by Suraj Srinivasan, accounting.

  abstract     = {We examine how dimensions of information technology (IT) strategy affect the performance of young businesses, as well as dynamics as they age. Drawing from lifecycle theory and firm boundary research, we derive the relationship between age-based performance differences and IT sourcing decisions. We highlight the dynamic tension between outsourcing’s support for accessing frontier inputs in the short term and ownership’s advantages for developing organization-specific resources and capabilities over time. Leveraging a large panel of Census Bureau microdata from 2006 to 2014, we provide the first systematic evidence that young manufacturing establishments (both startups and new units of existing firms) disproportionately benefit from modern IT outsourcing (ITO). The young also enjoy productivity benefits from owned IT capital (ITK), despite high uncertainty, smaller operational scale, and less complementary organizational capital. Although these returns appear commensurate with those of older producers, they are conditional on survival, which is improved by ITO but harmed by ITK accumulation. Combining flexibility-related gains from ITK with vintage-related advantages in early ITK investment, the young are revealed to have significantly greater IT productivity than older incumbents. A large battery of tests supports a causal interpretation, as well as mechanisms rooted in mitigating the effects of uncertainty (as opposed to size- or cost-related reasons). These findings illuminate an often-overlooked pattern of young-business dynamism relevant to economic trends and management practices in an increasingly digital age.

  abstract     = {Many two-sided marketplaces rely on match recommendations to help customers find suitable service providers at suitable prices. This paper develops a tractable methodology that a platform can use to optimize its match recommendation policy to maximize the total value generated by the platform while accounting for the endogeneity of transaction prices, which are set by the providers based on supply and demand and can depend on the platform’s match recommendation policy. Despite the complications of price endogeneity, an optimal match recommendation policy has a simple structure and can be computed efficiently. In particular, an optimal policy always recommends the providers who deliver the highest conversion rates. Moreover, an optimal policy can be encoded simply in terms of the frequency of recommending each provider to each customer segment, without the need to encode which subsets of providers are to be recommended together. On the other hand, if the platform were to optimize its match recommendations without accounting for price endogeneity, then the resultant policy would be more complex, and the market is likely to get stuck at a strictly suboptimal outcome, even if the platform were to continually reoptimize its match recommendations after prices re-equilibrate.

We developed and estimated a model that provides a new measure of financial literacy and disentangles confidence from knowledge.

  abstract     = {With the increased frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks, policymakers and the private sector search for ways to counter this threat. One of the main initiatives suggested to achieve this goal is sharing cybersecurity-related information. Although the general belief is that information sharing can increase both industry profit and social welfare, it is unclear whether firms would voluntarily share such information. In this paper, we examine the incentives of firms to share cybersecurity-related information, how information sharing impacts investments in cyber resilience, and the aggregate impact on welfare. We find that firms only voluntarily share information in less competitive markets when the impact of the disruption is high. In all other cases, firms elect not to share information, despite potential welfare benefits. To facilitate information sharing, we investigate an exclusionary policy (i.e., sharing must be mutual) and demonstrate market conditions under which this policy incentivizes information sharing. However, when competition is intense, even the exclusionary policy is ineffective because it reduces industry profit. To inform stronger interventions, we examine firms being mandated to disclose their private cyberthreat information. We demonstrate that an opportunity does exist for such disclosure, particularly when the cost of investing in cyber resilience is high. However, policymakers must use caution with such a policy because applying this intervention when investment costs are not high leads to a steep reduction in welfare. This paper was accepted by D. J.

  abstract     = {This study investigates how tie formation shapes the production of user-generated content on social media, offering insights into enhancing user engagement and alleviating social media fatigue. We conceptualize tie formation as a relationship codevelopment process involving a tie initiator and a respondent. Drawing on social psychology literature, we propose a framework that traces how initiators’ social cognition evolves throughout this process—from proactively extending an inviting social tie to receiving a responsive one in return. Central to our framework is a perceptual mechanism we term relational resonance , which fosters intrinsic motivation and prompts initiators to adjust their content creation. Using data from YouTube, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify individual creators’ content adjustments, measured by changes in video volume and viewer engagement. Our results reveal that while initiators tend to reduce content production after receiving a responsive tie, the videos they create generate higher engagement, with “like” and “subscribe” rates increasing by 1.1 and 2.9 percentage points, respectively. Remarkably, the receipt of a responsive tie leads to average weekly increases of 66 likes and 183 subscriptions even after accounting for the decrease in video volume, reinforcing the “quality over quantity” principle in content creation strategies. An online experiment further elucidates the mechanism underlying the observed adjustment behavior, providing robust validation for our proposed framework.

We model the revenue optimization of a publisher that auctions off advertising impressions to intermediary exchanges, which, in turn, run their own internal auctions among the advertisers they represent. We show that the resulting auction-of-auctions market arrangement suffers from a double marginalization problem: the multitier bid shading prompts the publisher to raise the reserve price above the level under the nonintermediated benchmark. The reserve distortion decreases channel efficiency as well as the profits of all channel members. Our findings also demonstrate that, in the auction of auctions, reserve price optimization is both more intricate and more important than in the direct mechanism: optimal reserves depend on the number of both exchanges and advertisers. Moreover, optimizing the reserve price given a fixed number of bidders may be more profitable than keeping the auction absolute and adding more bidders. Interestingly, we find that a simple scheme in which exchanges coordinate to charge their advertisers a fixed percentage commission perfectly coordinates the channel.

  abstract     = {We examine the impact of crowdfunding on venture capital (VC) investments in the presence of competition among VC firms. Our economic model comprises a startup, a crowdfunding platform, and two VC firms, each with its own perception of the startup’s potential. The startup seeks equity funding from the VC firms and decides on the size of its equity offer. If the VC firms decline to invest, the startup pivots to crowdfunding. Following the crowdfunding campaign, all firms update their beliefs about the startup’s likelihood of success based on the crowdfunding outcome, prompting the VC firms to revisit their investment decisions, now with a reduced equity offer if the crowdfunding outcome was positive. This study provides theoretical underpinnings at the firm level for the observed aggregate-level empirical relationships, both positive and negative, between crowdfunding and VC investments. Specifically, based on our model, the positive relationship, where increased crowdfunding activity leads to a rise in subsequent VC investments, is attributed to startups that fail to secure VC funding in the absence of a crowdfunding platform but succeed in attracting VC attention after a successful crowdfunding campaign. In contrast, the negative relationship is attributed to highly valued startups that could have secured VC funding without crowdfunding, but with crowdfunding, VC firms choose to defer their investment decision until after the crowdfunding campaign’s result is known; on the one hand, a successful crowdfunding outcome lowers their post-crowdfunding VC investment demand, and on the other hand, an unsuccessful outcome deters potential VC investors. Besides these relationships, we also identify another dynamic, where the option of accessing crowdfunding raises VC investment, even if the startup does not actually launch a crowdfunding campaign.

  abstract     = {Marketers rely on various online advertising channels to reach customers and are increasingly interested in multi-touch attribution , which evaluates the contribution of each touchpoint to a conversion. However, as the numbers of marketing channels and touchpoints increase, the attribution challenge becomes more intricate because of the complex interplay among different touchpoints within and across channels. Utilizing customer path-to-purchase data, this article addresses this challenge by developing a novel graphical point process framework to investigate the relational structure among various touchpoints. Based on this framework, we propose graphical attribution methods that allocate attribution scores to individual touchpoints or corresponding channels for each customer’s path to purchase. These scores are calculated using a probabilistic definition of removal effects. We evaluate the proposed methods and compare their performance with commonly used attribution models through extensive simulation studies and a real-world attribution application.

  abstract     = {We document the frequent use of stock lockup agreements in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) paid in stock and examine the corporate determinants and consequences of the use and duration of lockups. Lockup agreements prohibit target shareholders from selling shares issued by the acquirer as a means of payment for a prespecified period. We find support for the hypothesis that target shareholders agree to lockups to precommit to hold on to the acquirer’s stock if they believe the merger’s long-term fundamentals are strong. Consistent with our hypothesis, lockups come with larger acquirer announcement returns, particularly when acquirer valuations are high; ex ante, lockup adoption likelihood increases with acquirers’ valuation. Lockups also come with higher deal completion likelihood, shorter merger negotiations, and higher long-term operating performance. We conclude the market interprets lockups as a signal of strong fundamentals, particularly when acquirers’ valuations are high. This paper was accepted by Bo Becker, finance.

  abstract     = {Product drops occur when a retailer releases a limited-edition product line on a specific date for a short period of time. Due to limited inventory of the product and the short sales horizon, a resale market emerges where products may resell at higher prices once the firm stocks out. The firm faces a central tradeoff: pricing too high may lead to a longer stockout time and future markdowns; pricing too low may lead to transfer of profits to resellers. Any firm in this position may ask, “How do resellers impact my profit?” To answer this question, we build a dynamic structural model that captures customer decisions to consume or strategically resell, as well as the firm’s intertemporal pricing decision in the presence of resellers. We estimate our model using a unique data set from a retailer of baby clothing with weekly product drops, where customers engage in a resale marketplace through Facebook groups. We find resale data collection and analysis is valuable to incorporate into pricing as firm profit increases by 8.8%, and reseller presence reduces firm profit by 5.8% even if resale data are used in pricing. These impacts are magnified by resale market growth, demonstrating that managers need to take action as resale markets gain wider adoption.

  abstract     = {This study examines the impact of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on the performance of mobile network operators (MNOs) in the presence of overlapping generations of wireless mobile network technologies (2G and 3 G). MVNOs distribute MNOs’ mobile services to customers without owning any spectrum or network infrastructures, either as a subsidiary (branded MVNOs) or delegated under wholesale agreements with MNOs (third-party MVNOs). We investigate MVNO value chain governance, that is, delegation, in the context of overlapping generations of technologies. Leveraging a proprietary data set, we design a quasi-experiment to analyze the impact of branded and third-party MVNOs in 2G and 3 G market expansion. Using first a difference-in-differences analysis and then dynamic propensity score matching, we find that an MNO’s 2G market share increases if the MNO launches a third-party MVNO, whereas its 3 G market share increases if it launches a branded MVNO. More importantly, the positive effects of branded MVNOs diminish over time, but those of third-party MVNOs become stronger over time. For managers challenged by managing overlapping generations of technologies, it is important to customize value chain governance for market expansion: to create branded MVNOs to explore new mobile technologies, and to delegate to third-party MVNOs to exploit existing technology markets when the technology market is mature.

  abstract     = {This paper examines the impact of the expansion of the U.S. Postal Service in the late 19th century on firm creation and performance. Utilizing newly digitized archival data on historic business establishments, post office locations, and road networks in California, our study identifies a positive relationship between the expansion of the Postal Service and the emergence of new firms. To address endogeneity concerns, we leverage an unexpected change in the Postal Service route network. Our findings suggest that the Postal Service played a significant role in facilitating firm entry by acting as a carrier of specialized knowledge rather than as a financial service or mass communication infrastructure. We further reveal that, although increased competition from new entrants generally exerted downward pressure on incumbent firms, those relying on specialized knowledge and public technology inputs significantly benefited from local Postal Service access. Taken together, our study underscores the critical role played by the Postal Service in knowledge diffusion and local economic development by enabling the sourcing of specialized knowledge and technologies from other geographies. Overall, our results contribute to a broader understanding of how communication and knowledge dissemination infrastructure can drive entrepreneurship and firm growth, carrying important implications for contemporary discussions on infrastructure development, its potential to stimulate entrepreneurial activity, innovation, and foster local economic communities.
