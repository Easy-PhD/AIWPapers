  abstract     = {China’s online retail sales growth rate of men’s plain color shirts had declined because they could not meet customers’ aesthetic value needs. This study aims to determine consumers’ aesthetic value preferences and corresponding design elements. Based on Kansei Engineering, a semantic differential scale questionnaire was conducted with seven crucial Kansei words and styling specimens. Then, researchers validated these Kansei words using principal component analysis. More significantly, this study used partial least squares to construct a relationship between crucial Kansei words and styling design elements. Furthermore, researchers obtained the matching colors corresponding to Kansei words in the color image scale. Thus, Kansei words, styling design elements, and corresponding colors made up the recommendation guidelines. Lastly, questionnaires and interviews were used to verify the effectiveness of these guidelines. These recommendation guidelines were the most important results of this study. Besides, this study also found that the recent popular oversized fit appeared in distinctive and casual styles, but the audience is relatively small. Purchasers preferred a one-button square cuff, and the separate left-side pocket is more popular than both-side pockets. Purchasers liked the wide-spread collar compared with the classical pointed collar because it appeared most frequently in recommendation guidelines. Classic fit was still the mainstream, but its popularity would decline. In addition, modern fit and slim fit would become increasingly popular. Funding: B.

  abstract     = {We investigate a setting in which two rivals, an airline and railways, create value through a new joint service that reduces the cancellation-risk of waitlisted passengers. This setting is motivated by a recent collaboration between a railway company and two low-cost airlines in India. Under this arrangement, the railways offers train ticket holders whose reservations are not confirmed the option to upgrade to a flight ticket on the same route for an additional fee. The airline sets the price for the upgrade while the railways charges the airline a referral commission. The new service creates value for waitlisted passengers and thereby stimulates additional demand for the railways and the airline. We analyze the strategic interactions that arise from this collaboration, derive the equilibrium upgrade prices and commission, and compare the outcomes to those under centralized decision-making. Our findings demonstrate that cooperation between two competing service providers can create a mutually beneficial outcome for both firms as well as for consumers. Notably, the airline and the railways can generate profit from the collaboration only if they engage in a sequential game; a simultaneous-move game fails to generate any value. Furthermore, we identify scenarios in which increasing railway capacity also benefits the airline by stimulating additional demand. Finally, we analyze the case of strategic consumers who reduce the value created from the collaboration, and we show that the price difference between early and late booking mitigates such strategic behavior.

  abstract     = {Employees and consumers have varying preferences between human and algorithmic advisors. Drawing on construal level theory, I hypothesize that individual differences in algorithm aversion can be explained by the perception that algorithms are psychologically farther away than human advisors. The first set of studies ( n = 266) shows that algorithms are viewed as abstract and distant compared with humans, even when their outputs are perceived at a low-level construal, challenging prior research. Leveraging construal congruency, the second set of studies ( n = 1,148) shows that farther within-task psychological distance generally increases preference for algorithmic advisors due to differences in advisor confidence. Specifically, I contribute to the literature by showing that a far psychological distance within a task reduces confidence in human advisors. In contrast, confidence in algorithms remains stable, increasing algorithm appreciation at farther within-task distances.
