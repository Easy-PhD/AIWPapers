  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study advance selling and upgrading in a priority queue setting that emerges in the amusement park industry. Customers choose to buy fast-track or regular tickets depending on their heterogeneous waiting costs. At the park entrance, customers can choose tickets based on the observed congestion levels. Customers who purchase tickets in advance suffer from congestion uncertainty. Upgrading options allow customers to purchase regular tickets in advance and upgrade on-site if the congestion turns out to be high. The seller’s objective is to find the optimal pricing scheme to maximize revenue. Methodology/results : We analyze a two-stage model in a queueing game framework. Under full coverage and fixed regular ticket prices, the seller sets the priority ticket prices to maximize the revenue. We investigate two pricing schemes, both with and without upgrading options, under different scenarios depending on the proportion of customers who have access to advance ticket purchasing. When all customers have access to advance ticket purchasing, our findings indicate that the advance-and-spot selling scheme yields the same maximum revenue as the scheme that includes the upgrading option if the spot regular ticket price is not too large; thus, the upgrading option becomes unnecessary. Otherwise, allowing upgrading generates more revenue (and social welfare). Interestingly, although upgrading options offer consumers greater flexibility, they reduce consumer surplus in scenarios where upgrading increases revenue. When some customers only purchase tickets on the spot, our numerical analysis shows that allowing upgrading results in higher revenue when the probability of high system congestion is large and highlights cases when the revenue gap is significant. Finally, we extend our analysis to account for customers’ balking behavior and the additional waiting time incurred when purchasing tickets on the spot, providing a robust check on scheme comparison. Managerial implications : Our paper is one of the first to investigate—in the context of queueing economics—the advance selling strategy together with upgrading option, taking into account arrival rate uncertainty. Our results offer guidance on selling scheme design for ticket sellers and provide one economic explanation for the various pricing policies seen in the amusement park industry.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We consider the dynamic pricing problem of multiple products under (asymmetric) reference effects over an infinite horizon. Unlike existing literature, which is mostly focused on the single-product setting, our multiproduct setting takes into account the cross-product effects among substitutes and incorporates the memory-based reference prices into the multinomial logit (MNL) demand model. Even with the single-product logit demand, the structure of the optimal pricing policy is intractable. Therefore, we focus on the long-run patterns of the optimal pricing policy and also discuss the performance of the myopic pricing policy. Methodology/results : We first provide a comprehensive characterization of the myopic pricing policy, including its solution, long-run convergence behavior, and optimality gap. For the optimal pricing policy, we show an intricate connection between its long-run dynamics and types of reference effects. We demonstrate that the presence of any gain-seeking product renders a long-run constant pricing policy suboptimal. Conversely, the constant policy (or optimal steady state) can exist in both loss-neutral and loss-averse scenarios, where we provide a sufficient condition for such existence and give the analytical expression for the optimal steady state. We further show that when pricing perfect substitutes, the true optimal policy under the multiproduct framework is more likely to yield a long-run cyclic pattern than the policy derived from the single-product framework, a phenomenon that aligns well with the periodic discounts in real-world markets. Managerial implications : This discrepancy in the long-run behaviors between multi- and single-product-based policies highlights the importance of employing the multiproduct framework and addressing the cross-product effects, as sticking to the single-product framework while managing multiple substitutes can misrepresent long-run dynamics and result in suboptimality. In the multiproduct domain, our model suggests that retailers are more likely to benefit from appropriate price variations than maintaining a constant pricing policy. Funding: H.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Most of the world’s population relies on coastal aquifers for freshwater supplies. Groundwater is experiencing substantial overdrafts and facing ever-mounting freshwater demand. Existing groundwater management strategies are myopic and fail to coordinate production and the operation of protection approaches, including seawater intrusion barriers (SWIBs) and managed aquifer recharge (MAR). Motivated by the urgency of sustainable groundwater management, we investigate how to optimize the joint operations of groundwater production, protection (by injecting fresh water through SWIBs), and replenishment (via MAR). Methodology/results : We model a central planner’s decision on groundwater production, freshwater injection quantities, and artificial replenishment using stochastic dynamic models and identify that the optimal groundwater management policies follow a threshold-type structure. We find that SWIBs and MAR are strategic complements, except in cases with very high groundwater levels, when they turn into strategic substitutes. When the penalty for low groundwater levels decreases, the planner should use SWIBs more aggressively if groundwater levels are low and more conservatively if they are high. A similar pattern holds when natural recharge becomes more abundant, assuming that the natural recharge quantity has no impact on the purchasing cost of imported water. Moreover, we calibrate our model using real data sets in Orange County, California and find that the joint operations of SWIBs and MAR expand groundwater operational flexibility. In contrast, employing SWIBs alone comes at the expense of a lower groundwater level. Managerial implications : Our analysis offers strategic guidance on when to use SWIBs and MAR as complements or substitutes based on groundwater levels. It highlights the value of their joint operation in stabilizing groundwater, especially amid worsening droughts.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : To generate more sales, retailers are incentivized to open large stores. However, large store formats can carry negative environmental externalities. Entry of large stores in a community may stimulate mass consumption through its impact on consumer behaviors and local competition. In this study, we examine the local impact on the amount of consumer waste generated following an expansion of retail Supercenters. Methodology/results : We leverage the staggered expansion of Walmart Supercenters and adopt a difference-in-differences approach to investigate the impact of Supercenter entry on consumer waste. Our difference-in-differences estimates suggest that Supercenter entry results in up to a 6.97% increase in consumer waste in the affected counties. The increase is larger for new Supercenter launches compared with Supercenter conversions. In addition, we examine the roles of convenience stores and circular economy channels in mitigating the impact of Supercenter expansion. Managerial implications : For policymakers, our results also highlight a silver lining: the negative environmental effect of Supercenter entry can be mitigated through a balanced retail strategy that includes both convenience stores and Supercenters. Furthermore, we show that developing and promoting local circular economy channels may also mitigate the Supercenter effect.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : This paper investigates the effectiveness of emission permits policies with varying levels of temporal flexibility, including different compliance periods and the allowance/prohibition of intertemporal banking and borrowing. We also explore advanced policy designs aimed at improving social welfare. Methodology/results : Our analysis reveals that extreme policies, such as fully flexible or fully nonflexible permits, are generally suboptimal from a welfare perspective. Restricting temporal flexibility can be beneficial, particularly when pollution damage is severe or production costs are highly volatile. This finding arises from the tradeoff between the positive industrial impacts and the negative environmental consequences of temporal flexibility. We further demonstrate that partially flexible permits—such as transfer cap/discount and permits-tax hybrid—can achieve a better balance between industrial efficiency and environmental protection, even surpassing the classic welfare bound associated with fully flexible permits. Additionally, we find that temporal flexibility may reduce overall industrial profits by intensifying market competition, and allocating additional permits can widen profit gaps among firms. Managerial implications : This study provides actionable insights for regulators aiming to enhance emission permits policies and offers a deeper understanding of their impacts on firms’ profitability and operations.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by the behavior of drivers on ride-hailing platforms (individual drivers decide whether to work based on the offered wage and where to locate themselves in anticipation of future fares), we examine how the introduction of autonomous vehicles impacts the strategic behavior of human drivers and driver welfare. Specifically, we consider a setting in which a ride-hailing platform deploys a mixed fleet of conventional vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The CVs are operated by human drivers who make independent decisions about whether to work for the platform and where to position themselves when they become idle. The AVs are under the control of the platform. The platform decides on the wage it pays the drivers, the size of the AV fleet, and how the AVs are positioned spatially when they are idle. The platform can also make decisions on whether to prioritize the AVs or the CVs in assigning vehicles to customer requests. Methodology/results : We use a fluid model to characterize the optimal decisions of the platform and contrast those with the optimal decisions in the absence of AVs. We examine the impact of automation on strategic drivers and the ride-hailing platform. We show that, although the introduction of AVs can displace drivers and depress effective wages, there are settings in which the introduction of AVs leads to higher effective wages and more drivers being hired. We discuss how these results can, in part, be explained by the interplay of two counteracting effects: (i) the introduction of AVs provides the platform with an additional source of supply and renders human driver substitutable (displacement effect), and (ii) having access to and control over AVs enables the platform to influence the strategic behavior of CVs, thereby reducing the inefficiency from self-interested behavior (incentive effect). The relative strength of these two effects depends on the cost of AVs and the vehicle dispatching policy. Managerial implications : Our results uncover a new effect through which the introduction of AVs affects the welfare of human drivers (the incentive effect) and another mechanism to mitigate inefficiencies because of human drivers acting strategically. Our results have potentially broader applications to other areas in which automation is introduced and workers are strategic.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We empirically study the market for ride-hailing services. In particular, we explore the following questions: (i) How do the two-sided market and prices jointly form in ride-hailing marketplaces? (ii) Does surge pricing create value, and for whom? How can its efficiency be improved? (iii) Can platforms’ strategy on revenue sharing with drivers be improved? (iv) What is the value generated by ride-hailing services, including hosting rival taxi services on ride-hailing apps? Methodology/results : We develop a discrete choice model for the formation of mutually dependent demand (customer side) and supply (driver side) that jointly determine pricing. Using this model and a comprehensive data set obtained from the largest mobile ride platform in China, we estimate customer and driver price elasticities and other factors that affect market participation for the company’s two main markets, namely, basic ride-hailing and taxi services. Based on these estimation results and counterfactual analysis, we demonstrate that surge pricing improves customer and driver welfare as well as platform revenues while counterintuitively reducing taxi revenues on the platform. However, surge pricing should be avoided during nonpeak hours because it can hurt both customer and platform surplus. We show that platform revenues can be improved by increasing drivers’ revenue share from the current levels. Finally, we estimate that the platform’s basic ride-hailing services generated customer value equivalent to $13.25 billion in China in 2024, and hosting rival taxi services on the platform boosted customer surplus by $3.6 billion. Managerial implications : Our empirical framework provides ride-hailing companies a way to estimate demand and supply functions, which can help with optimization of multiple aspects of their operations. Our findings suggest that ride-hailing platforms can improve profits by containing surge-pricing to peak hours only and boosting supply by increasing driver compensation. Finally, our results demonstrate that restricting ride-hailing services create significant welfare losses, whereas including taxi services on ride-hail platforms generates substantial economic value.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study two-sided markets in which competing platforms enforce service standards to control access of providers with heterogeneous service quality and employ pricing strategies to balance supply and demand. We further investigate the effectiveness of launching regulations, aimed to maximize social welfare, in enhancing quality, and we examine multihoming to yield additional insights. Methodology/results : We build a game-theoretic model wherein two platforms enforce service standards and prices, based on which heterogeneous providers and consumers decide whether and which platform to enroll. The transaction revenue from service matches is shared between the platform and the providers according to a pricing scheme, which comprises a service fee and a commission rate. Our results reveal that platforms’ strategies for balancing supply and demand depend on the consumer-to-provider ratio (termed as consumer size) and the value of high-quality service relative to that of low-quality service (termed as service value). Managerial implications : The standards enforced by platforms are not always monotone with respect to consumer size or service value. A large influx of consumers prompts platforms to enforce a high standard when service value is sufficiently high. Platforms can enforce different service standards, albeit only when they compete to balance providers and consumers. Platform competition can be a substitute for regulation in upholding and enhancing quality, especially when the commission rate is high. Regulation is more effective in enhancing quality on a monopolistic platform than on competing platforms. Relative to single homing, multihoming has inconsequential effects on the pattern for the enforcement of service standards, whereas it may lead platforms to raise prices. We alert regulators to consumer size, service value, and pricing scheme in addressing quality concerns in two-sided markets. Fostering competition can be more effective than launching regulations to enhance quality on platforms. Funding: The research of L.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Ride-hailing platforms face a supply-demand imbalance. During peak periods, the demand from passengers far exceeds the supply of drivers, whereas during off-peak periods, there is an abundance of supply but weak demand. The well-studied surge pricing can be challenging to implement in markets where prices are subject to regulation and are inflexible to adjust. We study an alternative operational approach that shifts the supply of drivers from off-peak to peak periods to address the supply-demand imbalance. Methodology/results : We propose two novel incentive schemes: the qualification scheme and the prioritization scheme. Specifically, the platform sets a work target for the peak period. Under the qualification scheme, the platform assigns off-peak service requests only to drivers who meet the peak period target. Under the prioritization scheme, the platform prioritizes off-peak requests for drivers who meet the peak period target. We analyze the effectiveness of these schemes, considering the openness of the platform’s supply system. For platforms with a closed system that only allows full-time drivers to provide service, the qualification scheme improves the total matching volume to a greater extent but hurts full-time drivers more than the prioritization scheme. For platforms with an open system that also allows the abundant part-time drivers to serve off-peak requests, the prioritization scheme outperforms the qualification scheme in improving total matching volume. Furthermore, the implementation of an incentive scheme in an open system may benefit both the platform and full-time drivers. Managerial implications : Our study suggests an alternative to surge pricing for on-demand platforms to address the supply-demand imbalance when prices are inflexible. It provides insights for platforms with varying levels of supply system openness in choosing appropriate incentive schemes. The welfare results offer guidance for platforms and policymakers regarding both matching volume and worker welfare.

This is true even if the additional demand class has a higher reservation price than existing ones. Managerial implications : This result highlights the importance for companies to address and mitigate biases in decision makers before embarking on market expansion initiatives through promotions and advertising campaigns.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Inventory management problems with periodic and controllable resets occur in the context of managing water storage in the developing world and dynamically optimizing endcap promotion duration in retail outlets. In this paper, we consider a set of sequential decision problems in which the decision maker must not only balance holding and shortage costs but discard all inventory before a fixed number of decision epochs with the option for an early inventory reset. Methodology/results : Finding optimal policies for these problems through dynamic programming presents unique challenges because of the nonconvex nature of the resulting value functions. Moreover, this structure cannot be readily analyzed even with extended convexity definitions, such as K -convexity. Managerial implications : Our key contribution is to present sufficient conditions that ensure the optimal policy has an easily interpretable structure, which generalizes the well-known ( s , S ) policy from the operations management literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, under these rather mild conditions, the optimal policy exhibits a four-threshold structure. We then conclude with computational experiments, thereby illustrating the policy structures that can be extracted in various inventory management scenarios.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Omnichannel retailers interact with customers both online and offline. So far, they have used the richer information available—gathered from customer interactions across digital and physical channels—to optimize the sales process by designing the right channel and supply chain structures and by personalizing offers, pricing, and promotions. We advance an additional dimension of omnichannel value: retailers can use online clickstreams to better understand customer needs and optimize store layouts to maximize webrooming conversion , which we define as the ratio of sales to webrooming activity. Methodology/results : We develop a model in which in-store purchases depend on the customer’s shopping list and the effort required to locate and reach the products within the store. Category location in the store thus drives the likelihood of a sale. We then apply our model to a large home improvement retailer and find that shoppers’ preferences are revealed by nearby online traffic and hard-to-reach locations lead to lower webrooming conversion. Finally, we optimize category location assignments using our demand model and find that putting higher-interest and higher-price items in the most effective locations can increase revenues by about 2%–5% in comparison with models that ignore online clicks. Managerial implications : We show how using online clickstream information for optimizing offline operations can create significant value. More fundamentally, our results provide a word of caution that in some retailing segments such as home improvement, longer in-store paths might not necessarily be better. Funding: V.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : We study how people with present bias make choices when they face multiple projects. Each project consists of a starting and a finishing stage, both requiring costly effort to complete but yield rewards only after project completion. Methodology/results : We derive people’s perception-perfect strategies for project scheduling. Naifs may start a project, but never finish it. They may multitask; that is, start a new project before finishing an old project. They may not prioritize projects by NPV. Sophisticates do not start a project but not finish it. However, like naifs, they may multitask and not prioritize projects by NPV. What happens if people can choose the cost structure endogenously? If people multitask when the cost structure is exogenously given, then when the cost structure can be chosen by them, naifs delay the costs to the finishing stages as much as possible, resulting in either multitasking or procrastination. If, in addition, the project with a higher NPV has a lower total cost, then naifs prioritize projects by NPV. Sophisticates, however, may not always delay the costs to finishing stages when given a choice because delaying the costs may lead to multitasking, which decreases the utility and they, unlike naifs, are fully aware of. Therefore, under endogenous cost structure, sophisticates may or may not multitask or prioritize projects by NPV. Managerial implications : Enhancing individuals’ awareness of their present bias makes them less likely to behave sub-optimally. Increasing load can also, though not always, alleviate procrastination and reduce the possibility of multitasking and not prioritizing projects based on NPV. When project portfolios are predetermined, increasing awareness of present bias always improves people’s long-run utility. However, when project portfolios are selected endogenously, sophistication does not always pay because naifs may either complete more projects or complete a more profitable project than sophisticates.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by technological advances in real-time data collection about customers location in service systems, we study the effect of partial visibility of customers on waiting time prediction. We consider systems where the predictor observes only a subset of the customers interacting with the system while serving all customers indiscriminately. Methodology/results : We formulate a novel model of a partially visible queue and analyze the waiting time prediction problem, deriving a closed-form expression for the optimal prediction. This facilitates quantifying the performance loss of arbitrary prediction methods because of partial visibility and their inherent limitations (i.e., bias and variance). We compare the performance of a wide range of commonly used predictive methods and examine how partial visibility along with other system parameters affects their performance. We further extend these numerical analyses to queueing systems that exhibit characteristics that are common in practice and that were studied in the service operations literature. Managerial implications : Our analysis shows that the phenomenon of invisible customers profoundly impacts the ability to accurately predict waiting times and should, therefore, be considered an important factor in the development of prediction tools. Such tools cannot be effectively deployed if technological barriers or operational limitations prevent a sufficiently high level of data integrity. This work provides specific insights into the effectiveness of various commonly used prediction methods, some of which are shown to be highly sensitive to partial visibility and other queueing systems characteristics. Our findings suggest that machine learning methods that use carefully chosen features offer the most effective generic solution for waiting time prediction in the presence of invisible customers and explain the mechanisms through which partial visibility deteriorates the performance of prediction methods.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The drug development process has historically lacked transparency, leading to selective reporting of clinical trial results. Although clinical trial transparency aims to address this issue, increased public scrutiny may make managers more risk averse, potentially stifling novel research and development (R&D) initiatives. This raises the following question. Does transparency hinder technologically novel R&D? Methodology/results : Using data from nearly 10,000 clinical trials from 2000 to 2014, we examine how a 2005 policy to increase transparency affects drug novelty. Using a continuous difference-in-differences approach, we find that transparency prompts firms to rely more on previously used technologies (i.e., exploitative R&D) without reducing their pursuit of never-before-tested technologies (i.e., exploratory R&D). We identify negative informational spillovers as a mechanism; technology failures that are now more visible because of transparency could erode confidence in related trials, prompting firms toward familiar technologies to avoid reputational damage. Consistent with this mechanism, the impact of transparency is strongest among firms with less-diversified portfolios that are the most exposed to negative informational spillovers. Managerial implications : Our primary theoretical contribution is in demonstrating the unintended negative impact of transparency on novelty. For managers, we highlight diversification as a mitigation strategy. We urge policymakers to create incentives to support novel R&D despite transparency pressures.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Care units are the facilities where admitted hospital patients receive treatment and monitoring services. This paper studies the problem of deciding which patients to place into the various available care units at any time. To determine placements in practice, hospitals rely on clinicians to discern a patient’s care needs and appropriately trade-off between future demand and limited bed availability. Making the right decisions remains challenging because patients are heterogeneous, and demand is uncertain. Methodology/results : We develop a dynamic resource allocation algorithm to decide unit placements by learning the care needs of different patient types. We model hospital beds as reusable resources and assume decision feedback is not immediately available, but rather delayed for an unknown and random length of time. Lastly, we consider the demand to be unknown and allow patient arrivals to be arbitrarily sequenced for robustness. The applicability of our algorithm is demonstrated with real-patient data from a hospital collaboration, where we evaluate our proposed approach using unplanned readmission rates as the performance metric. From extensive simulations, our results suggest the proposed algorithm tends to outperform several greedy benchmarks as well as a hospital benchmark model. A theoretical performance guarantee for our algorithm is provided to complement the case study. Managerial implications : This paper contributes new insights into designing dynamic decision-making models for hospital admissions operations. Our work presents a simple but effective data-driven support tool to help clinicians trade-off between available bed capacity and a patient’s care needs when making care unit placements. We also demonstrate how our algorithm can support the reduction of unplanned readmissions through improved placement decisions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : The adoption of online services, such as telemedicine, has increased rapidly over the last few years. To better manage online services and effectively integrate them with in-person services, we need to better understand customer behaviors under the two service modalities. Utilizing data from two large internal medicine outpatient clinics, we take an empirical approach to study service incompletion, which can be because of either patient no-show or leaving without being seen. Methodology/results : We focus on estimating the causal effect of whether the provider has cleared prior appointments—used as a proxy of intraday delay—on service incompletion for in-person and telemedicine appointments, respectively. When providers have not cleared prior appointments, patients may have to wait, making them more likely to leave without being seen, leading to a higher service incompletion rate. We introduce a multivariate probit model with instrumental variables to handle estimation challenges because of endogeneity, sample selection, and measurement error. We also conduct a numerical analysis of the intraday sequencing rule when having both telemedicine and in-person patients. Our estimation results show that intraday delay increases the telemedicine service incompletion rate by 7.40%, but it does not have a significant effect on the in-person service incompletion rate. Managerial implications : Our study suggests that telemedicine patients may leave without being seen, whereas in-person patients are not sensitive to intraday delay. More importantly, failing to properly distinguish between incompletions caused by intraday delays and those resulting from no-shows can lead to highly inferior patient sequencing decisions.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Motivated by the persistent lack of testing capacity in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we study the question “who should be tested?” when there are general costs and rewards, testing capacity is strictly limited, tests have errors, and patients differ in their prior probability of being infected. We specifically study how the answer to that question changes when pooled testing, a method of grouping samples to conserve tests, is an option. Methodology/results : We use a two-stage stochastic optimization model with recourse, incorporating costs and rewards for different test outcomes, under a conservative capacity constraint that reflects severe shortages of tests or high uncertainty about future test availability. This setting reflects the situation decision makers faced at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Although health officials might intuitively prioritize testing patients who are highly likely to be infected, we find that it may be better to focus on patients who are less likely to be infected, particularly when the test has low sensitivity (i.e., the false-negative rate is substantial). Moreover, it may be optimal to test two groups of individuals: those who are very unlikely to be infected (in pools) and those who are very likely to be infected (individually). Managerial implications : We develop a heuristic policy supported by the analysis, which indicates when pooling should be used and which type of samples should be tested. In some settings, the decision may be characterized simply by understanding the costs and rewards involved. In more complex testing settings, the characteristics of the test and the size of the pool affect the desirability of pooling: Lower specificity, higher sensitivity, and larger pool sizes all result in testing environments that are more favorable to pooling. Managers and policymakers should understand how characteristics of the test and the setting impact whether it is optimal to test patients who are deemed likely to test positive or those who are likely to test negative. Incorporating pooling as a test strategy may change which patients should be prioritized for a test. Our results can inform both public health policy and healthcare operations management in settings where testing capacity is strictly limited.

  abstract     = {Problem definition : Family engagement (FE) is an ongoing partnership between health professionals and patients’ families to enhance healthcare quality, safety, and delivery. Although FE is increasingly considered an essential component of patient-centered care, its importance in influencing healthcare delivery outcomes is unclear. This study examines the impact of FE on patient care outcomes (PCOs)—specifically, patient satisfaction (PS) and readmission (Readm)—in the context of varying severity of illness (SOI). Methodology/results : Using secondary data from South Korea, this study develops an integrated framework to examine the relationships between FE, SOI, and PCOs. The methodology involves a two-stage treatment effects model to address endogeneity in FE, supplemented by instrumental variable estimations for SOI. The findings reveal that patients with FE exhibit improved PS and lower Readm. Additionally, FE lessens the negative impact of SOI on these outcomes. The study also explores how the benefits of FE vary depending on the nature of the patient’s relationship with their family, distinguishing between family members living together and separately. We also conduct structured interviews to validate the mechanisms supporting these relationships and identify implications for practice. Managerial implications : The findings have significant implications for healthcare operations management (HOM). Hospitals can develop family-centered policies and training programs, emphasizing the importance of FE in patient care, especially for severely ill patients. Healthcare professionals can benefit from understanding the dynamics between FE, SOI, and PCOs, guiding the development of curricula that focus on family-centered care. Overall, the study underscores the importance of integrating FE into HOM to enhance the quality of patient care.
