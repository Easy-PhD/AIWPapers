  abstract     = {In e-commerce, product returns have become a costly and escalating issue for retailers. Beyond the financial implications for businesses, product returns also lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and the squandering of natural resources. Traditional approaches, such as charging customers for returns, have proven largely ineffective in curbing returns, thus calling for more nuanced strategies to tackle this issue. This paper investigates the effectiveness of informing consumers about the negative environmental consequences of product returns (“green nudging”) to curtail product returns through a large-scale randomized field experiment ( n = 117,304) conducted with a leading European fashion retailer’s online store. Our findings indicate that implementing green nudging can decrease product returns by 2.6% without negatively impacting sales. We then develop and assess a causal machine learning model designed to identify treatment heterogeneities and personalize green nudging (i.e., make nudging “smart”). Our off-policy evaluation indicates that this personalization can approximately double the success of green nudging. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of both subtle marketing interventions and personalization using causal machine learning in mitigating environmentally and economically harmful product returns, thus highlighting the feasibility of employing “Better Marketing for a Better World” approaches in a digital setting.

  abstract     = {Banning of books has become increasingly prevalent and politically polarizing in the United States. Although the primary goal of these bans is to restrict access to books, conversations about the bans have garnered attention on a wider scale. This increased attention to bans can either have a chilling effect or can influence consumers to read the banned books. In this study, we use a novel, large-scale data set of U.S. library book circulations and evaluate the impact of high-profile book bans on the consumption of banned books. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that the circulations of banned books increased by 12%, on average, compared with comparable nonbanned titles after the ban. We also find that banning a book in a state leads to increased circulation in states without bans. We show that the increase in consumption is driven by books from lesser-known authors, suggesting that new and unknown authors stand to gain from the increasing consumer support. Additionally, our results demonstrate that books with higher visibility on social media following the ban see an increase in consumption, suggesting a pivotal role played by social media. Using patron-level data from the Seattle Public Library that include the borrower’s age, we provide suggestive evidence that the increase in readership in the aggregate data is driven, in part, by children reading a book more once it is banned. Using data on campaign emails sent to potential donors subscribed to politicians’ mailing lists, we show a significant increase in mentions of book ban-related topics in fundraising emails sent by Republican candidates. We also provide suggestive evidence on the impact of the rhetoric around these events on donations received by politicians. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {We study the effect of video game live streaming on the popularity of broadcasted games. To this end, we collect novel high-frequency data from Twitch.tv , a major video game streaming platform, by monitoring live streams of 60,000 popular streamers every 10 minutes for eight months. To estimate the effect of live streaming, we leverage these high-frequency data and isolate plausibly exogenous within-day variation in the broadcast hours of top influencers. We find that the number of people watching a game in live streams increases the concurrent number of people playing it with an elasticity of 0.027, a moderate effect that dissipates within a few hours. Investigating the mechanisms behind live streaming effects, we find evidence that live streams make consumers aware of games by lesser-known publishers and reveal the quality and match value of games to consumers. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that, despite the general excitement about live stream promotions in this industry, only about one sixth of all games profit from sponsored live streams.

We study video games, the largest entertainment product category comprising one third of YouTube traffic, using a large daily panel data set on thousands of video games. Leveraging a supply shock on YouTube called the “Adpocalypse,” we measure the impact of influencer videos on purchase and usage of games. We provide plausibly causal evidence that, on average, influencer video posts substitute to video games for purchases but complement for usage.

  abstract     = {Policymakers have mandated food labeling standards, for example, through the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act. However, many claims made by firms are voluntary, such as when they label products as containing “low calories” and “no high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).” This paper examines whether the use of voluntary labels can help consumers make more informed choices, or if labels lead consumers to ignore other relevant product characteristics, resulting in choices that can be harmful. With theory providing both types of predictions, we empirically analyze firm- and consumer-side behavior, focusing on the specific case of the “no HFCS” label and the corresponding sugar content—an increasingly policy-relevant product characteristic—of such products. We first document common firm practices in the industry across various product categories where the use of the label is prevalent. We then examine consumer search and purchase behavior through an incentive-aligned experiment. We find that products with the “no HFCS” label are less healthy, containing more sugars, than others, and that certain subsets of consumers search less and buy nutritionally worse products in the presence of voluntary labels. Our findings inform both managers and policymakers about whether and how voluntary labels should be displayed. History: Tat Chan served as the senior editor.

  abstract     = {If a buying firm employs an agent to conduct a procurement process, then sellers might be tempted to bribe the agent in order to win the contract. As a consequence, the procurement outcome can be inefficient (i.e., a low-quality product is purchased). This paper shows under which conditions sellers’ delegation to stooges mitigates or aggravates the inefficiency problem. Delegation will be efficiency-enhancing if the stooge’s and the delegating seller’s joint loss from detected corruption is sufficiently large compared with the respective loss of a non-delegating seller. Intuitively, the probability of inefficient procurement increases with the intensity of the bribing competition, and large losses mitigate this intensity. If all parties on the sell side that are involved in corruption suffer similar losses under delegation and nondelegation, then the condition for an efficiency-enhancing effect of stooges is clearly satisfied. The theoretical analysis also shows that, in contrast to the strategic-delegation literature, overall delegation is not an equilibrium outcome because bribing is a hidden action and sellers dislike leaving positive rents to stooges who are protected by limited liability. Finally, this paper derives the buying firm’s optimal reserve price and incentive pay for its agent to prevent an inefficient procurement outcome for sure.

  abstract     = {What are the causal effects of the closure of a store on a retail chain’s overall, offline, and online sales? We address this central research question using sales, shopper transaction, and mobile app usage data from a large retail chain that closed 34 stores across states in a month. We use the difference-in-differences approach, creating propensity score-matched control counties and controlling for selection. We examine potential moderators of these effects and underlying mechanisms using individual shopper-level and mobile app user-level data, including analyzing app engagement through topic modeling. Our findings reveal that closing a store opens a Pandora’s box in that it triggers significant net monthly sales loss of $209,317 (more than the average monthly sales of the closed store), representing 18.7% of the retailer’s net sales in the county with the closed store because of spillover effects on other channel purchases by the retailer’s customers in that county. The numbers of the retailer’s active customers, new customers, active app users, new app users, and their mobile app engagement all decline postclosure. Store closure has a negative spillover effect on even nearby shoppers who never shopped at the closed store. Loyal shoppers among nonvisitors to the closed store and app users are more tolerant of store closure than other shoppers. To mitigate adverse effects, retail chains can strategically choose stores closer to other stores in the chain, with a high percentage of in-store discounts and online sales, and a low value of product returns to close. Additionally, they can redirect shoppers in affected counties to the chain’s nearby stores and online (in particular, the mobile app) by offering discounts and promoting store and product information in the app. History: Catherine Tucker served as the senior editor.

We show that the net result of these forces may lead to either shorter or longer product lines and higher or lower prices and profits depending on the distribution of product valuations across consumers. In the case of full market participation/coverage and many firms, we provide a simple function of value distribution (and discuss its relation to the hazard rate) that can guide managers in understanding the directional impact of consumer search costs on firms’ product line length. Lower search costs lead to longer product lines if the value distribution has a nonincreasing hazard rate (e.g., Exponential or Pareto distributions) but are a force toward shorter product lines under Normal, Logistic, or Gumbel-Minimum distributions. Gumbel-Maximum is the borderline case resulting in a net zero effect. Under Uniform distribution, prices and product lines are inverted-U shaped in the search costs. We separately consider the implications of consumers’ market participation decisions for firms’ product line strategy. History: Anthony Dukes served as the senior editor.

Taking the context of a French car-sharing platform for which we have historical data, we lay out a random coefficient logit model of spatial demand combined with a Bertrand model of price competition between providers. Sparsity brings challenges in demand estimation; we resolve them through an approximation that brings new insights on a recent model with Poisson consumer arrivals. We then perform counterfactuals to evaluate the incremental value brought by existing potential providers to the platform. The results show that ignoring externalities between providers leads to large biases: provider incremental values are overestimated by 40% on average, and customer scorings are substantially impacted, resulting in suboptimal reward allocation. We also evaluate the potential impact of an advertising campaign to illustrate how our approach can be used to target acquisitions in specific locations, and we study the impact of activities that may increase the value of existing providers through price and/or location changes.

However, managers often worry that this supply relationship may give their competitor valuable knowledge about new product innovations. We develop a two-period model in which a firm can buy an input from a competitor or a third party in each period. In order to innovate, the firm must invest in improving the input, which results in its supplier learning to produce a higher quality input. We show that buying from the competitor: (i) increases short-term profits by softening price competition and (ii) may reduce long-term profits by preventing investment in innovation. Our results imply that the classic holdup problem, which leads to underinvestment in innovation, becomes more severe when a firm buys from its competitor who benefits from knowledge spillover.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of online news aggregators has intensified the debate over whether they should compensate news publishers for redistributing news content. Regulators worldwide are working to develop policies that balance the interests of both parties. However, there is limited understanding of the impact of carrying news on news aggregators, especially on their non-news content. Our research fills this gap by examining the impact of news on non-news user engagement and content generation on Facebook. We utilize a natural experiment—the Facebook Australia news shutdown in 2021—and apply a difference-in-differences approach to quantify these effects. We find that, in the short run, both user engagement and content generation of non-news content on Facebook decreased after the news shutdown. Moreover, the effects were more pronounced for non-news posts with negative sentiment and higher popularity as well as for non-news accounts that are more socially active, experienced, and verified. These results highlight the positive spillover effects of news on non-news content and provide timely and relevant insights for regulators, news publishers, social media platforms that carry news, and content creators on social media platforms.

  abstract     = {We study the effectiveness of personalized video advertisements created using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). We run a mobile ad targeting field experiment on WhatsApp in partnership with a leading direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand that sells eco-friendly sustainable products. We randomize users into receiving ads from one of three targeting conditions: (1) GenAI-based personalized video ads, (2) personalized image ads, and (3) generic nonpersonalized video ads. The first group is our main treatment, and the latter two serve as baselines. In the personalized treatment conditions, ad content is tailored to individual purchase histories, whereas in the generic treatment condition, a uniform brand message is delivered to all users. Our results show that GenAI-based personalized video ads increase engagement by six to nine percentage points over the baselines. These gains are robust across consumer demographics such as gender and location. We use back-of-the-envelope calculations to highlight substantial cost savings and productivity benefits of GenAI-based personalized ad campaigns. We discuss the implications of our findings for businesses and policymakers while noting the potential variation in effectiveness and generalizability of GenAI applications across marketing contexts.
