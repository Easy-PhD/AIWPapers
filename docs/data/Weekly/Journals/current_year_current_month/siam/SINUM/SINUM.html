  abstract     = {Abstract. The formulation of finite difference approximations is a classical problem in numerical analysis. In this article, we consider difference approximations that are based on a series expansion in powers of the second undivided difference. Each additional term in the series increases the order of accuracy by two. These expansions are useful in a variety of contexts such as in the development of modified equation schemes, the design of high-order accurate energy stable discretizations, and error analysis of certain finite element or finite difference schemes. Here, we provide closed form expressions for the coefficients in the series expansions for derivatives of all orders. We also provide some short recursions defining the series coefficients, and formulae for the stencil coefficients in standard difference approximations. The series expansions are used to show some useful properties of the Fourier symbols of difference approximations and to derive rules of thumb for the number of points-per-wavelength needed to achieve a given error tolerance when solving wave propagation problems involving higher spatial derivatives.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider finite element approximations of unique continuation problems subject to elliptic equations in the case where the normal derivative of the exact solution is known to reside in some finite dimensional space. To give quantitative error estimates we prove Lipschitz stability of the unique continuation problem in the global -norm. This stability is then leveraged to derive optimal a posteriori and a priori error estimates for a primal-dual stabilized finite element method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we address the challenge of solving elliptic equations with quasiperiodic coefficients. To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multilevel block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The numerical analysis of closures and stabilizations for reduced order models (ROMs) of convection-dominated flows is relatively scarce. In this paper, we take a step in this direction and conduct numerical analysis of the recently introduced time-relaxation ROM (TR-ROM), which uses spatial filtering to stabilize ROMs for convection-dominated flows. Specifically, we prove stability, show an a priori error bound, and show parameter scalings for the TR-ROM. Our numerical investigation shows that the theoretical convergence rate and the parameter scalings with respect to the ROM dimension and filter radius are recovered numerically. In addition, the parameter scaling can be used to extrapolate the time-relaxation parameter to other ROM dimensions and filter radii. Moreover, the parameter scaling with respect to the filter radius is also observed in the predictive regime.},
