  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of Koopman operator which faithfully encodes the dynamics of controlled systems by leveraging the tools of set-valued analysis. In this context, we propose generalizations of the Liouville and Perron–Frobenius operators and show that they respectively coincide with proper set-valued analogues of the infinitesimal generator and dual operator of the Koopman semigroup. We also give meaning to the spectra of these set-valued maps and prove an adapted version of the classical spectral mapping theorem relating the eigenvalues of a semigroup with those of its generator. Our approach provides theoretical justifications for existing practical methods in the Koopman community that study control systems by bundling together the Koopman and Liouville operators associated with different control inputs.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the derivation of necessary conditions for the optimal shape of a design problem governed by a nonsmooth PDE. The main particularity thereof is the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity in the state equation, which, at the same time, is solved on an unknown domain. We follow the functional variational approach introduced in [D. Tiba, Atti Accad. Peloritana Pericolanti Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur., 96 (2018)], where the set of admissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. It has been recently established [L. Betz, SIAM J. Control Optim., 63 (2025), pp. 1826–1851] that each parametrization associated to an optimal shape is the limit of a sequence of global optima of minimization problems with a convex admissible set consisting of functions. For the latter, optimality systems have been recently derived in [L. Betz, Math. Control Relat. Fields, early access, (2025)]. In the present manuscript we let the approximation parameter vanish therein. The final necessary conditions for the nonsmooth shape optimization problem consist of an adjoint equation, a limit gradient equation that features a measure concentrated on the boundary of the optimal shape, and, because of the nonsmoothness, an inclusion that involves its Clarke subdifferential. Moreover, due to indispensable assumptions that are needed for the approximation technique [L. Betz, SIAM J. Control Optim., 63 (2025), pp. 1826–1851], we are able to provide sign conditions for the optimal state and adjoint state.},

One special feature, compared with the well-studied graphon mean field games, is that the states of agents are described by the dynamic systems with the idiosyncratic noises and common noise. The limit LQ-GMFGs with common noise are formulated based on the assumption that these graphs lie in a sequence converging to a limit graphon. By applying the spectral decomposition method, the existence of Nash equilibrium for the formulated limit LQ-GMFGs is derived. Moreover, based on the adequate convergence assumptions, a set of -Nash equilibrium strategies for the finite large population problem is constructed. Finally, an application is given for network security to illustrate our theoretical results.},

Given an unstable hybrid stochastic differential equation (SDE) , we can design a feedback control so that the controlled SDE becomes stable, where and is the integer part of . Noting that the control is based on the state observations at discrete times , we see that this stabilization problem is significantly different from the classical one where the feedback control is based on continuous-time state observations. This stabilization problem was initiated by Mao in 2013 and has been intensively studied by many authors for the past ten years. In this paper, we will further develop an event-triggered control based on a trajectory of the state or output observations at discrete times. This is significantly different from most of the existing papers where an event-triggered mechanism for SDEs is designed based on a criterion in terms of the mathematical expectation of the system state. The novel approach in this paper is to relate the stability of the event-triggered controlled SDE to the stability of the corresponding uncertain SDE.},

Our approach is novel and completely different from the existing results for the one-dimensional case. Using these and other delicate tools, we then construct solutions to coupled two-dimensional stochastic Riccati equation with jumps in both standard and singular cases. In the end, these results are applied to solve a cone-constrained stochastic linear-quadratic control problem and a mean-variance portfolio selection problem with jumps. Different from no-jump problems, the optimal (relative) state processes may change their signs, which is of course due to the presence of jumps.},

We apply a model-free approach that relies neither on knowledge of model parameters nor on their estimations, and devise an RL algorithm to learn the optimal policy parameter directly. Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of up to a logarithmic factor, where is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm.

They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.},

The contributions of this work consist of two parts. The first one is that we set up a convergence analysis framework for the direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm, which can show the deep connections between these two methods. They are different formulations of solving the robust DMZ equation by reducing it to solve the Yau–Yau PDE [B. Balaji, PMC Phys. A, 3 (2009), pp. 1–28]. The second one is that we prove the explicit convergence rates of the Yau–Yau algorithm with the spectral method and the direct method with Gaussian approximation, in terms of the numbers of spectral basis and time steps.},

This paper explores discretization and its convergence rates for stochastic linear quadratic optimal control problems governed by stochastic heat equations with control-dependent noise. To achieve the optimal rates while maintaining computational performance, a mixed strategy is proposed, in combining the open-loop approach for spatial discretization with the closed-loop approach for temporal discretization. The open-loop approach is employed to achieve optimal spatial convergence rates, while the Riccati-based closed-loop approach enhances temporal convergence rates and reduces the computational complexity. Relying on this mixed strategy, the proposed algorithm, which requires solving only deterministic equations and forward stochastic heat equations, demonstrates significant advantages in both accuracy and computational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a -Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to -player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behavior as the number of agents, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash certainty equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the -player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an -Nash equilibrium for the -player game in Hilbert spaces. This property is established by showing that the mean field approximates the empirical average state within when agents follow these strategies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is customary to design a control system in such a way that, whatever the chosen control satisfying the constraints, the system does not enter so-called unsafe regions. This work introduces a general computer-assisted methodology to prove that a given linear control system with compact constraints avoids a chosen unsafe set at a chosen final time . Relying on support hyperplanes, we devise a functional such that the property of interest is equivalent to finding a point at which the functional is negative. Actually evaluating the functional first requires time discretization. We thus provide explicit, fine discretization estimates for various types of matrices underlying the control problem. Second, computations lead to roundoff errors, which are dealt with by means of interval arithmetic. The control of both error types then leads to rigorous, computer-assisted proofs of nonreachability of the unsafe set. We illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our method in different contexts featuring various control constraints, unsafe sets, types of matrices, and problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i) as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii) as a benchmark setting for multiagent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. [Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst., 34 (2021), pp. 2949–2964] showed that an -Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite-horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free natural policy gradient algorithms with poly sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested zeroth-order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main result is twofold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish an sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the implicit regularization property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents’ Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.},

This paper proposes to parameterize open loop controls in stochastic optimal control problems via suitable classes of functionals depending on the driver’s path signature, a concept adopted from rough path integration theory. We rigorously prove that these controls are dense in the class of progressively measurable controls and use rough path methods to establish suitable conditions for stability of the controlled dynamics and target functional. These results pave the way for Monte Carlo methods to stochastic optimal control for generic target functionals and dynamics. We discuss the rather versatile numerical algorithms for computing approximately optimal controls and verify their accurateness in benchmark problems from Mathematical Finance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Switching among affine systems under dwell-time constraints in order to steer the state as close as possible to a desired point involves the consideration of a nontrivial region into which the state is eventually driven and maintained. Suitable regions for this aim have the following property: For every point within the region, a switching law satisfying the dwell-time constraint exists so that the trajectory beginning at that point remains within the region for all future times. This paper focuses on addressing and characterizing the latter property, which is here called switching-controlled invariance (SCI) with dwell time, through a convexity-based approach. It is shown that SCI of a set is equivalent to the existence of some cover of , where each subset in the cover can be selected to share specific properties of : convexity, closedness, boundedness, and, most important, polytopic structure. Our theoretically most important result is to establish that if an SCI with dwell time set is a (closed and convex) polytope and the switched affine system has subsystems, then can be covered by subpolytopes so that the state trajectories beginning within each subpolytope are kept within during at least one dwell time without switching. This result is highly nontrivial, is not true for other geometric structures such as ellipsoids, and further motivates the consideration of polytopic sets in the control of switched affine systems with dwell time.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by the concepts of volumetric controllability score (VCS) and average energy controllability score (AECS) proposed for linear time-invariant systems, we consider the generalization of such concepts to switched linear systems in this paper. The key step of the generalization is to build a similar link between the controllability scores and the optimization objects as in the time-invariant case. Through the link, two families of convex optimization problems, corresponding to the concepts of generalized VCS (GVCS) and generalized AECS (GAECS), respectively, are proposed. Then, we show the uniqueness of the solutions to these problems. These unique solutions are exactly the finite-time controllability scores we want, which provide a quantitative measure of the importance of each state node on controllability during each switching interval. Besides, an algorithm is provided to calculate the GVCS and GAECS based on the projected gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the generalized scores to evaluate the importance of each state node on controllability under a switched network structure.},

This work investigates the optimal control problem for reflected McKean–Vlasov SDEs and the viscosity solutions to Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations on the Wasserstein space in terms of intrinsic derivative. It follows from the flow property of reflected McKean–Vlasov SDEs that the dynamic programming principle holds. Applying the decoupling method and the heat kernel estimates for parabolic equations, we show that the value function is a viscosity solution to an appropriate HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, where the characterization of absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein space by the continuity equations plays an important role. To establish the uniqueness of the viscosity solution, we generalize the construction of a distance-like function initiated in Burzoni et al. [SIAM J. Control Optim., 58 (2020), pp. 1676–1699] to the Wasserstein space over multidimensional space and show its effectiveness for coping with HJB equations in terms of intrinsic derivative on the Wasserstein space.},
