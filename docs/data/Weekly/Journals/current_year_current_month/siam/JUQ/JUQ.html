  abstract     = {Abstract. Sampling from a target distribution is a fundamental problem with wide-ranging applications in scientific computing and machine learning. Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), derived from the overdamped Langevin dynamics, have been extensively studied. From an optimization perspective, the Kolmogorov forward equation of the overdamped Langevin dynamics can be treated as the gradient flow of the relative entropy in the space of probability densities embedded with Wasserstein-2 metrics. Several efforts have also been devoted to including momentum-based methods, such as underdamped Langevin dynamics, for faster convergence of sampling algorithms. Recent advances in optimization have demonstrated the effectiveness of primal-dual damping and Hessian-driven damping dynamics in achieving faster convergence when solving optimization problems. Motivated by these developments, we introduce a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) called gradient-adjusted underdamped Langevin dynamics (GAUL), which add stochastic perturbations in primal-dual damping dynamics and Hessian-driven damping dynamics from optimization. We prove that GAUL admits the correct invariant distribution, whose marginal is the target distribution. The proposed method outperforms overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics regarding convergence speed in the total variation distance for Gaussian target distributions. Moreover, using the Euler–Maruyama discretization, we show that the mixing time toward a biased target distribution only depends on the square root of the condition number of the target covariance matrix. In addition, we propose another discretization scheme based on the splitting method, which yields a smaller first-order asymptotic bias than the Euler–Maruyama scheme when sampling a Gaussian distribution. Numerical experiments for non-Gaussian target distributions, such as Bayesian regression problems and Bayesian neural networks, further illustrate the advantages of our approach over classical methods based on overdamped or underdamped Langevin dynamics. We also compare with the randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, showing that it achieves competitive performance.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used for inferring functions from noisy data. GPR crucially relies on the choice of a kernel, which might be specified in terms of a collection of hyperparameters that must be chosen or learned. Fully Bayesian GPR seeks to infer these kernel hyperparameters in a Bayesian sense, and the key computational challenge in sampling from their posterior distribution is the need for frequent determinant evaluations of large kernel matrices. This paper introduces a gradient-based, determinant-free approach for fully Bayesian GPR that combines a Gaussian integration trick for avoiding the determinant with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Our framework permits a matrix-free formulation and reduces the difficulty of dealing with hyperparameter gradients to a simple automatic differentiation. Our implementation is highly flexible and leverages GPU acceleration with linear-scaling memory footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method’s ability to scale gracefully to both high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces and large kernel matrices.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper discusses the control of coherent structures in turbulent flows, which has broad applications among complex systems in science and technology. Mean field games have been proved a powerful tool and are proposed here to control the stochastic Lagrangian particles as players tracking the flow and tracer fields. We derive optimal control solutions for general nonlinear fluid systems using mean-field game models and develop computational algorithms to efficiently solve the resulting coupled forward and backward mean-field system. A precise link is established for the control of passive tracer density and the scalar vorticity field based on the functional Hamilton–Jacobi equations derived from the mean field models. A new iterative numerical strategy is then constructed to compute the optimal solution with fast convergence. We verify the skill of the mean-field control models and illustrate their practical efficiency on a prototype model modified from the viscous Burgers equation under various cost functions in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. The good model performance implies potential effectiveness of the strategy for more general high-dimensional turbulent systems.},
