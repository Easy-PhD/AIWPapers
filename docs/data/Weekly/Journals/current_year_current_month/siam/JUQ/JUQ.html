  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper discusses the control of coherent structures in turbulent flows, which has broad applications among complex systems in science and technology. Mean field games have been proved a powerful tool and are proposed here to control the stochastic Lagrangian particles as players tracking the flow and tracer fields. We derive optimal control solutions for general nonlinear fluid systems using mean-field game models and develop computational algorithms to efficiently solve the resulting coupled forward and backward mean-field system. A precise link is established for the control of passive tracer density and the scalar vorticity field based on the functional Hamiltonâ€“Jacobi equations derived from the mean field models. A new iterative numerical strategy is then constructed to compute the optimal solution with fast convergence. We verify the skill of the mean-field control models and illustrate their practical efficiency on a prototype model modified from the viscous Burgers equation under various cost functions in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. The good model performance implies potential effectiveness of the strategy for more general high-dimensional turbulent systems.},
