  abstract     = {Abstract. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used for inferring functions from noisy data. GPR crucially relies on the choice of a kernel, which might be specified in terms of a collection of hyperparameters that must be chosen or learned. Fully Bayesian GPR seeks to infer these kernel hyperparameters in a Bayesian sense, and the key computational challenge in sampling from their posterior distribution is the need for frequent determinant evaluations of large kernel matrices. This paper introduces a gradient-based, determinant-free approach for fully Bayesian GPR that combines a Gaussian integration trick for avoiding the determinant with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Our framework permits a matrix-free formulation and reduces the difficulty of dealing with hyperparameter gradients to a simple automatic differentiation. Our implementation is highly flexible and leverages GPU acceleration with linear-scaling memory footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method’s ability to scale gracefully to both high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces and large kernel matrices.},

Mean field games have been proved a powerful tool and are proposed here to control the stochastic Lagrangian particles as players tracking the flow and tracer fields. We derive optimal control solutions for general nonlinear fluid systems using mean-field game models and develop computational algorithms to efficiently solve the resulting coupled forward and backward mean-field system. A precise link is established for the control of passive tracer density and the scalar vorticity field based on the functional Hamilton–Jacobi equations derived from the mean field models. A new iterative numerical strategy is then constructed to compute the optimal solution with fast convergence. We verify the skill of the mean-field control models and illustrate their practical efficiency on a prototype model modified from the viscous Burgers equation under various cost functions in both deterministic and stochastic formulations. The good model performance implies potential effectiveness of the strategy for more general high-dimensional turbulent systems.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When auditing a redistricting plan, a persuasive method is to compare the plan with an ensemble of neutrally drawn redistricting plans. Ensembles are generated via algorithms that sample distributions on balanced graph partitions. To audit the partisan difference between the ensemble and a given plan, one must ensure that the nonpartisan criteria are matched so that we may conclude that partisan differences come from bias rather than, for example, levels of compactness or differences in community preservation. Certain sampling algorithms allow one to explicitly state the policy-based probability distribution on plans; however, these algorithms have shown poor mixing times for large graphs (i.e., redistricting spaces) for all but a few specialized measures. In this work, we generate a multiscale parallel tempering approach that makes local moves at each scale. The local moves allow us to adopt a wide variety of policy-based measures. We examine our method in the state of Connecticut and succeed at achieving fast mixing on a policy-based distribution that has never before been sampled at this scale. Our algorithm shows promise to expand to a significantly wider class of measures that will (i) allow for more principled and situation-based comparisons and (ii) probe for the typical partisan impact that policy can have on redistricting.},

We then prove that the operator learning problem is well-posed for a family of one-dimensional models.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present a graph random walk (GRW) method for the study of charge transport properties of complex molecular materials in the time-of-flight regime. The molecules forming the material are represented by the vertices of a directed weighted graph, and the charge carriers are random walkers. The edge weights are rates for elementary jumping processes for a charge carrier to move along the edge and are determined from a combination of the energies of the involved vertices and interaction strength. Exclusions are built into the random walk to account for the Pauli exclusion principle. In time-of-flight experiments, charge carriers are injected into the material, and the time until they reach a collecting electrode is recorded. In this setting, our GRW approach allows direct evaluation of the expected hitting time of the collecting nodes in the graph in terms of a typically sparse linear system, thereby avoiding numerically cumbersome and potentially fluctuations-prone methods based on explicit time evolution from solutions of a high-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations (the master equation) or from kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). We validate the GRW approach by conducting numerical studies on charge dynamics of single and multiple carriers in diffusive and drift-diffusive (due to an external electric field) regimes using a surrogate lattice model of a realistic material whose properties have been simulated within a multiscale model framework combining quantum-mechanical and molecular-mechanics methods. The surrogate model allows varying types and strengths of energetic disorder from the reference baseline. A comparison with results from the master equation confirms the theoretical equivalence of both approaches also in numerical implementations. We further show that KMC results indicate substantial deviations due to inadequate sampling. All in all, we find that the GRW method provides a powerful alternative to the more commonly used methods without sampling issues and with the benefit of using sparse matrix methods.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we study a prototypical system of reaction-diffusion equations in which the diffusivities are widely separated. We report on the discovery of families of spatially periodic canard solutions that emerge from singular Turing bifurcations. We show that the small-amplitude, spatially periodic solutions that emerge from the Turing bifurcations form families of spatially periodic canards that oscillate about the homogeneous equilibrium. The emergence of these spatially periodic canards asymptotically close to the Turing bifurcations, which are reversible 1:1 resonant Hopf bifurcations in the spatial ODE system, is an analog in spatial dynamics of the emergence of limit cycle canards in the canard explosions that occur asymptotically close to Hopf bifurcations in time-dependent ODEs. We also find families of large-amplitude, spatially periodic canards. These have a “fast-slow” spatial structure, with segments of steep gradients and segments of gradual variation. In this prototypical PDE, we also show that for most parameter values under study the Turing bifurcation is sub-critical, and we present the results of numerical simulations showing that several types of spatial canard patterns are attractors in the PDE. To support the main numerical discoveries, we use the method of geometric desingularization and geometric singular perturbation theory on the spatial ODE system to demonstrate the existence of these families of spatially periodic canards. Crucially, in the singular limit, we study a novel class of reversible folded singularities of the spatial ODE system. In particular, there are two reversible folded saddle-node bifurcations of type II (RFSN-II), each occurring asymptotically close to a Turing bifurcation. We derive analytical formulas for these singularities and show that their canards play key roles in the observed families of small-amplitude and large-amplitude spatially periodic canard solutions. Then, for an interval of values of the bifurcation parameter further below the Turing bifurcation and RFSN-II point, the spatial ODE system also has spatially periodic canard patterns; however, these are created by a reversible folded saddle (instead of the RFSN-II). It also turns out that there is an interesting scale invariance, so that some components of some spatial canards exhibit nearly self-similar dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the numerical study of dynamical systems, there are applications where equations or good initial guesses are not available, and a data-driven approach based on a set of observations of the system is useful. These observations take the form of a cloud of points in phase space. The observations lie on a smooth manifold in several important situations like stable invariant manifolds, some attractors, and parts of bifurcation surfaces. This paper describes an algorithm, based on multiparameter continuation methods, for finding a smooth manifold from a cloud of points that samples the manifold. The algorithm represents the manifold as an atlas of charts, with the distance between chart centers controlled by a local length scale. It is iterative, selecting a point from the boundary of the atlas at each step to add a new chart. Three variations are described, which use different definitions of the boundary of a set of points: nearest neighbor continuation, which is used by most manifold learning algorithms; shell continuation; and polyhedral continuation. Part of the result is chart adjacency information, which can be used to construct a mesh on the manifold with the chart centers as mesh. The results are also in a form that allows traditional manifold learning techniques for constructing low dimensional embeddings to be applied. There are many parallels between continuation and machine learning. This viewpoint provides a context for thinking about manifold learning.},

In response to climate change caused largely by the industrial development of humans, a lot of species may have to change their residential habitats and living habits to survive. Meanwhile, it has been well known that networks (like roads, rivers, and seismic lines, etc.) have deep impacts on the spread of pandemics, invasive species, plant pathogens, and so on. Motivated by the recent work of Berestycki and his research group, in this paper, we study the joint influence of a road-field diffusive system coupled with climate changes on the dynamical behaviors of two competitive populations in the case of one of which is assumed to be home territory. Viewed as one of the most important phenomena in propagation dynamics, forced traveling wave solution (TWS) is first investigated and we find that its existence is relevant to the values of the shift speed with which the climate changes. When and only when ( is a threshold shifting speed and its value is related to the ratio of the two diffusion coefficients—on the road and in the field), one can establish the forced TWS for the system. Moreover, we show that the forced TWS is locally stable by using a squeezing result. Finally, to draw a complete figure of the propagation dynamics, we investigate the global spreading behaviors in the case . In such a case, the spatial domain for the extinction of both populations are established, and can be interpreted as gap formation for the two biological species.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. There is a well-established understanding of maximizing and minimizing local stretching associated with a map; this can be couched in terms of an eigenproblem associated with the Cauchy–Green tensor. The local eigenvalues correspond to stretching rates, while the eigenvector directions identify maximal and minimal stretching directions. Generating hyperstreamlines of these eigenvector fields has been popular; however various claims that these collections of curves correspond to global optimizers of stretching remain unsubstantiated. In this paper, a formulation in terms of restricted foliations is presented, for which these curves form a well-defined solution as the most and least unstable objects, with respect to a global definition. The theory works for any map in -dimensions, derived, for example, from repeated applications of a discrete dynamical system, or from a finite-time flow of a continuous one. Further insight is obtained into the two-dimensional situation via an elementary approach, including a simple singularity classification criterion and an understanding of numerical artifacts in foliation computations (e.g., special curves along which hyperstreamlines veer and/or do not cross). Illustrations and validations of the results to the Hénon map, the double-gyre flow, and the standard (Chirikov) map are provided.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the last decade, some algebraic tools have been successfully applied to phylogenetic reconstruction. These tools are mainly based on the knowledge of equations describing algebraic varieties associated to Markov processes of molecular substitution on phylogenetic trees, the so called phylogenetic invariants. Although the theory involved allows for the explicit determination of these equations for all equivariant models (which include some of the most popular nucleotide substitution models), practical uses of these algebraic tools have been restricted to the case of the general Markov model. Arguably, one of the reasons for this restriction is that knowledge of linear representation theory is required before making these equations explicit. With the aim of enlarging the practical uses of algebraic phylogenetics, in this paper we prove that phylogenetic invariants for equivariant models can be derived from phylogenetic invariants for the general Markov model without the need of representation theory. Our main result states that the algebraic variety corresponding to an equivariant model on a phylogenetic tree is an irreducible component of the variety corresponding to the general Markov model on intersected with the linear space defined by the model. We also prove that for any equivariant model, those phylogenetic invariants that are relevant for practical uses (e.g., tree reconstruction) can be simply deduced from a single rank constraint on the matrices obtained by flattening the joint distribution at the leaves of the tree. This condition can be easily tested from singular values of the matrices, and it allows us to extend our results from trees to phylogenetic networks.},

Rank-metric codes have been a central topic in coding theory due to their theoretical and practical significance, with applications in network coding, distributed storage, crisscross error correction, and post-quantum cryptography. Recent research has focused on constructing new families of rank-metric codes with distinct algebraic structures, emphasizing the importance of invariants for distinguishing these codes from known families and from random ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric invariant for linear rank-metric codes, inspired by the Schur product used in the Hamming metric. By examining the sequence of dimensions of Schur powers of the extended Hamming code associated with a linear code, we demonstrate its ability to differentiate Gabidulin codes from random ones. From a geometric perspective, this approach investigates the vanishing ideal of the linear set corresponding to the rank-metric code.},

The algorithm can compute that all Gaussian graphical models on five vertices that are not initially toric cannot be made toric by any linear change of coordinates. The same holds for all Gaussian conditional independence ideals of undirected graphs on six vertices.},

Accurately modeling the evolution of the borehole surface around the bit plays a crucial role in understanding the mechanism of self-excited vibrations in drilling processes. This paper studies the evolution of the bottom-hole surface under given axial-torsional-lateral bit motions. It is shown that the evolution of the bottom-hole surface geometry is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) in the form of a conservation law with source terms. Scaling of the PDE is conducted to determine the dominant parameters influencing the evolution of the borehole surface. The scaled PDE is solved numerically using a finite-volume algorithm. A study of typical drilling modes demonstrates that the PDE model not only predicts the depth of cut ahead of cutting blades more accurately than classical time delay models but also reconstructs wellbore surface comparable to published simulation and experimental results. This PDE formulation shows a promising potential for the modeling of drill bit vibrations, especially bit whirl.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recreational fisheries, often recognized as fishing activities undertaken by individuals for sport and leisure, can be conceptualized as integrated systems where changes in human activities have significant implications for the interconnected components of the fishery ecosystems. These systems often exhibit nonlinear dynamics and are susceptible to abrupt and irreversible shifts in function and structure, referred to as critical transitions. Most existing studies on critical transitions in fishery ecosystems focus on the magnitude of changes in fishing practices. In this study, we examine a recreational fishery model that incorporates the prey and its predators, both of which are subject to fishing by anglers. Our analysis demonstrates that the fishery ecosystem is sensitive not only to the magnitude of changes in fishing pressure but also to the rate at which these changes are implemented. Surprisingly, for fixed fishing pressure of predators, a slow increase in fishing pressure of the prey, even when aiming at a relatively high fishing target, can sustain the prey fish stock at a sustainable biomass level, while a fast increase in fishing pressure can lead to the collapse of prey population. Additionally, we identify critical thresholds for the rate of increase in fishing pressure for different initial population sizes and accordingly assign warning levels to these values. Furthermore, to evaluate the risk of rate-induced tipping, we introduce two key notions of tipping time and rate-tipping probability. Interestingly, we find that as the rate of change of fishing pressure increases, the tipping probability first increases rapidly, then slowly, and finally saturates, while tipping time decreases gradually, that is, the increase of accelerates the collapse of prey population. The scenario in which the fishing pressures of the prey and predators vary synchronously is also considered. Our study offers valuable insights for fisheries management decision-making, not only emphasizing the importance of considering the magnitude of management adjustments but also highlighting the temporal dynamics of implementing these changes to achieve desired outcomes.},

This problem models the nondestructive testing for a partially buried object from electrostatic measurements on the accessible part of the boundary. The main novelty is the extension of the linear sampling and factorization methods to an electrostatic problem with partial measurements. These methods so far have only mainly applied to recovering interior defects, which is a simpler problem. Another important aspect of this paper is in our numerics, where we derive a system of boundary integral equations to recover the mixed Green’s function needed for our inversion. With this, we are able to analytically and numerically solve the inverse shape problem. For the inverse parameter problem, we prove uniqueness and Lipschitz-stability (in a finite dimensional function space) assuming that one has the associated Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator on the accessible part of the boundary.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Understanding the mechanisms that drive biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world requires a deeper investigation into behavioral diversity among individuals. Consistent individual differences in behavior, often referred to as animal personality, play a crucial role in shaping ecological and evolutionary dynamics, particularly in foraging behavior. Traditional approaches in behavioral and evolutionary ecology typically focus on average behavior, neglecting the significance of individual variability. This study explores the influence of consumer personality on ecological dynamics, specifically examining how variations in food availability affect behavioral strategies and ecosystem functioning. We develop a consumer-resource model that incorporates personality-dependent saturating attack rates based on the mean-field ratio of resources to consumers. The well-posedness of the model is established, and we analyze the existence and stability of all steady-state solutions. Through bifurcation analysis, we identify critical transition parameters and describe the nonlinear phenomena induced by personality-dependent attack rates. Our findings demonstrate that boldness in consumers enhances their persistence, particularly under low levels of boldness, where populations can survive even with moderate or high food supply, which was not captured in classical frameworks.},

In this paper, a model where microscopic organisms carry out the dweller-wanderer conversion is considered; the conversion occurs at microscopic time scale and is based solely on the chemical concentrations. Cells in the dweller state are modeled with zero diffusivity, while those in the wanderer state are assigned positive diffusivity, resulting in a coupled system of an ODE and a PDE.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many scientific questions can be framed as asking for a first passage time (FPT), which generically describes the time it takes a random “searcher” to find a “target.” The important timescale in a variety of biophysical systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) to find a target out of many searchers. Previous work on such fastest FPTs assumes that all searchers are initially present in the domain, which makes the problem amenable to extreme value theory. In this paper, we consider an alternative model in which searchers progressively enter the domain at a constant “immigration” rate. In the fast immigration rate limit, we determine the probability distribution and moments of the th fastest FPT. Our rigorous theory applies to many models of stochastic motion, including random walks on discrete networks and diffusion on continuous state spaces. Mathematically, our analysis involves studying the extrema of an infinite sequence of random variables which are both not independent and not identically distributed. Our results constitute a rare instance in which extreme value statistics can be determined exactly for strongly correlated random variables.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper we use singular perturbation theory to solve the 2D narrow capture problem for a set of partially accessible targets , in a bounded domain . In contrast to previous models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a target by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface it does not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior. Instead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time , after which it either gains access to the resources within (surface absorption) or detaches and continues its search process (surface desorption). We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios – either the particle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns to its initial search position. In applications to animal foraging, the latter would correspond to an animal returning to its home base whereas the resources within a target could represent food or shelter. We formulate the narrow capture problem in terms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and target flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for irreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together successive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption event, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating non-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios following desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages. First, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible adsorption by solving a Robin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target limit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the BVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for non-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series expansions of the corresponding target fluxes. Finally, the latter are used to determine the corresponding splitting probabilities and conditional mean FPTs for absorption.},

The quadratic autocatalytic reaction, a pivotal step in many reaction systems, is closely monitored by the complexing agent, which tracks the reaction process and locates the position of the reaction front, underscoring its significance. Thus, it is interesting to study how the complexation reaction affects traveling waves in the quadratic autocatalytic system. Two critical questions on traveling waves of a system are (1) does there exist a such that a traveling wave with speed exists if and only if and (2) if such a exists, is the minimum wave speed derived from the linearization of the system at the unstable steady state? For the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system without complexation reactions, the answers to these two questions are affirmative. However, in the presence of a complexing agent, we give sufficient conditions for linear and nonlinear minimal speed selection mechanisms in different parameter regimes. Our findings reveal that the complex agent, far from being a passive observer, plays a dynamic and active role in the wave propagation of the quadratic autocatalytic reaction system, significantly impacting its behavior.},

In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic functions and linear diffusion. Our general problem is known to be NP-hard and that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we can greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor.

However, most functional elements of chromatin are not located at the chain ends, raising questions about analytical scaling relationships for non-end-to-end MFETs. Through the asymptotic expansion of the principal eigenvalue of the Fokker–Planck equation with absorbing boundary, we reveal a mixed scaling law between the MFET of monomer pairs deep within the polymer interior and their linear distance, and propose an approximate formula for the MFET of monomer pairs near the chain ends. Brownian simulations validate our analytical approximations. Our theoretical results highlight the differences in looping dynamics between the interior and exterior regions of polymer chains.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. When a fluid carrying a passive solute flows quickly through porous media, three key macroscale transport mechanisms occur. These mechanisms are diffusion, advection, and dispersion, all of which depend on the microstructure of the porous medium; however, this dependence remains poorly understood. For idealized microstructures, one can use the mathematical framework of homogenization to examine this dependence, but heterogeneous materials are more challenging. Here, we consider sorption of a solute by a two-dimensional microstructure comprising an array of adsorbent obstacles of smooth but arbitrary shape, the size and spacing of which can vary along the length of the porous medium. We use homogenization via the method of multiple scales to systematically upscale a microscale problem involving nonperiodic cells of varying area to obtain effective continuum equations for macroscale transport and sorption. The equations are characterized by the local porosity, an effective local adsorption rate, and an effective local anisotropic solute diffusivity. All of these macroscale properties depend nontrivially on the two degrees of microstructural geometric freedom in our problem; obstacle size, and obstacle spacing. Further, the coefficient of effective diffusivity comprises the molecular diffusivity, the suppressive effect of the presence of obstacles, and the enhancing effect of dispersion. To illustrate the mathematical model, we focus on a simple example geometry comprising circular obstacles on a hexagonal lattice, for which we numerically determine the macroscale permeability and effective diffusivity. We find a power law for the dispersive component of solute transport, consistent with classical Taylor dispersion.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this study, we obtain the exact switching time distributions between the free and bound gene states for a detailed stochastic model of an autoregulatory feedback loop with transcription, translation, mRNA, and protein decay, as well as protein-gene interactions. The analytical solution generalizes and corrects the previous ones obtained in [P. Visco, R. J. Allen, and M. R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett., 101 (2008), 118104] and [Z. Cao and R. Grima, Nat. Commun., 9 (2018), 3305] for a reduced model of an autoregulatory loop that ignores the mRNA dynamics. We find that when the mRNA dynamics is modelled explicitly, the holding time in the free gene state can produce three shapes of steady-state distributions (decaying, bell-shaped, and bimodal). In particular, the detailed model with both mRNA and protein descriptions can produce a distribution shape that the reduced model fails to capture—the detailed model of a negative (positive) feedback loop can display a bimodal (bell-shaped) holding time distribution, while the reduced model cannot. Interestingly, we find that an autoregulatory loop can produce a heavy-tailed holding time distribution and the origin of this phenomenon is clarified using our analytical solution. We also investigate how the distribution shape is affected by the type of feedback, the binding and unbinding rates, and the transcription rates. Finally, based on the distribution shape, we have developed a new method of inferring autoregulation using single-cell time-trace gene expression data.},

In this work, we investigate the generalized bathtub model, a nonlocal transport equation for describing network trip flows served by privately operated vehicles inside a road network. First, we establish the well-posedness of the mathematical model for both classical and weak solutions. Then we consider an inverse source problem of the model with model parameters embodying particular traffic situations. We establish a conditional Lipschitz stability of the inverse problem under a suitable a priori regularity assumption on the problem data, using a Volterra integral formulation of the problem. Inspired by the analysis, we develop an easy-to-implement numerical method for reconstructing the flow rates, and we provide the error analysis of the method. Further we present several numerical experiments to complement the theoretical analysis.},

Similarly, the electric field produced by a dielectric nano-particle (with positive but high permittivity) is given as a polarization of the incident magnetic field. In this work, we demonstrate that a hybrid dimer—composed of two closely coupled nano-particles, one plasmonic and the other dielectric—can polarize both the incident electric and the magnetic fields. Consequently, such hybrid dimers have the potential to modify both the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium. However, this dual modification occurs only when the two nano-particles share common resonant frequencies. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the fields generated by these hybrid dimers in the subwavelength regime for incident frequencies near their shared resonant frequencies.},

We settle the complexity of computing an equilibrium in atomic splittable congestion games with player-specific affine cost functions as we show that the computation is -complete. To prove that the problem is contained in , we develop a homotopy method that traces an equilibrium for varying flow demands of the players. A key technique for this method is to describe the evolution of the equilibrium locally by a novel block Laplacian matrix where each entry of the Laplacian is a Laplacian again. Using the properties of this matrix allows us to recompute efficiently the Laplacian after the support of the equilibrium changes by matrix pivot operations. These insights give rise to a path following formulation for computing an equilibrium where states correspond to supports that are feasible for some demands and neighboring supports are feasible for increased or decreased flow demands. A closer investigation of the block Laplacian system further allows us to orient the states giving rise to unique predecessor and successor states, thus putting the problem into . For the -hardness, we reduce from computing an approximate equilibrium of a bimatrix win-lose game. As a byproduct of our reduction we further show that computing a multiclass Wardrop equilibrium with class-dependent affine cost functions is -complete as well. As another byproduct of our -completeness proof, we obtain an algorithm that computes a continuum of equilibria parametrized by the players’ flow demand. For player-specific costs, the continuum may involve several increases and decreases of the demand and yields an algorithm that runs in polynomial space. For games with player-independent costs, only demand increases are necessary, yielding an algorithm computing all equilibria as a function of the flow demand that runs in time polynomial in the output.},

[Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson Super-logarithmic depth lower bounds via direct sum in communication complexity, in Proceedings of the Sixth Annual Structure in Complexity Theory Conference, IEEE Computer Society, Chicago, 1991, pp. 299–304] suggested approaching this problem by proving that the depth complexity of a composition of functions is roughly the sum of the depth complexities of and . They showed that the validity of this conjecture would imply that . The intuition that underlies the Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson (KRW) conjecture is that the composition should behave like a “direct-sum problem”, in a certain sense, and, therefore, the depth complexity of should be the sum of the individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum of the individual complexities. In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion called “strong composition”, which is the same as except that it is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle. This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general techniques that might be of independent interest.},

We also give meaning to the spectra of these set-valued maps and prove an adapted version of the classical spectral mapping theorem relating the eigenvalues of a semigroup with those of its generator.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the derivation of necessary conditions for the optimal shape of a design problem governed by a nonsmooth PDE. The main particularity thereof is the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity in the state equation, which, at the same time, is solved on an unknown domain. We follow the functional variational approach introduced in [D. Tiba, Atti Accad. Peloritana Pericolanti Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur., 96 (2018)], where the set of admissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. It has been recently established [L. Betz, SIAM J. Control Optim., 63 (2025), pp. 1826–1851] that each parametrization associated to an optimal shape is the limit of a sequence of global optima of minimization problems with a convex admissible set consisting of functions. For the latter, optimality systems have been recently derived in [L. Betz, Math. Control Relat. Fields, early access, (2025)]. In the present manuscript we let the approximation parameter vanish therein. The final necessary conditions for the nonsmooth shape optimization problem consist of an adjoint equation, a limit gradient equation that features a measure concentrated on the boundary of the optimal shape, and, because of the nonsmoothness, an inclusion that involves its Clarke subdifferential. Moreover, due to indispensable assumptions that are needed for the approximation technique [L. Betz, SIAM J. Control Optim., 63 (2025), pp. 1826–1851], we are able to provide sign conditions for the optimal state and adjoint state.},

One special feature, compared with the well-studied graphon mean field games, is that the states of agents are described by the dynamic systems with the idiosyncratic noises and common noise. The limit LQ-GMFGs with common noise are formulated based on the assumption that these graphs lie in a sequence converging to a limit graphon. By applying the spectral decomposition method, the existence of Nash equilibrium for the formulated limit LQ-GMFGs is derived. Moreover, based on the adequate convergence assumptions, a set of -Nash equilibrium strategies for the finite large population problem is constructed. Finally, an application is given for network security to illustrate our theoretical results.},

Noting that the control is based on the state observations at discrete times , we see that this stabilization problem is significantly different from the classical one where the feedback control is based on continuous-time state observations. This stabilization problem was initiated by Mao in 2013 and has been intensively studied by many authors for the past ten years. In this paper, we will further develop an event-triggered control based on a trajectory of the state or output observations at discrete times. This is significantly different from most of the existing papers where an event-triggered mechanism for SDEs is designed based on a criterion in terms of the mathematical expectation of the system state. The novel approach in this paper is to relate the stability of the event-triggered controlled SDE to the stability of the corresponding uncertain SDE.},

Our main contributions include the introduction of an exploration schedule and a regret analysis of the proposed algorithm. We provide the convergence rate of the policy parameter to the optimal one and prove that the algorithm achieves a regret bound of up to a logarithmic factor, where is the number of learning episodes. We conduct a simulation study to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithm.

In contrast with previously known results, the convex hull of the control set contains the origin but is not assumed to be a neighborhood of the origin. Part of the results, in particular those on global controllability, are specific to systems where all solutions with zero control are periodic. The associated conditions are expressed by means of pushforwards along the flow of the drift, rather than in terms of Lie brackets. It turns out that they amount to local controllability of a time-varying linear approximation with constrained controls. Global and local results are given, as well as a few illustrative examples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In a recent paper by Chen et al. [SIAM J. Control Optim., 59 (2021), pp. 749–776], the authors initiated the control-theoretic study of a class of discrete-time multilinear time-invariant (MLTI) control systems, where system states, inputs, and outputs are all tensors endowed with the Einstein product. They established criteria for fundamental system-theoretic notions such as stability, reachability, and observability through tensor decomposition. Building on this new research direction, the purpose of our paper is to extend the study to continuous-time MLTI control systems. Specifically, we define Hamiltonian tensors and symplectic tensors, and we establish the Schur-Hamiltonian tensor decomposition and the symplectic tensor singular value decomposition (SVD). Based on these concepts, we propose the algebraic Riccati tensor equation (ARTE) and demonstrate that it has a unique positive semidefinite solution if the system is stabilizable and detectable. To find numerical solutions to the ARTE, we introduce a tensor-based Newton method. Additionally, we establish the tensor versions of the bounded real lemma and the small gain theorem. A first-order robustness analysis of the ARTE is also conducted. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed theory and algorithms.},

The contributions of this work consist of two parts. The first one is that we set up a convergence analysis framework for the direct method and the Yau–Yau algorithm, which can show the deep connections between these two methods. They are different formulations of solving the robust DMZ equation by reducing it to solve the Yau–Yau PDE [B. Balaji, PMC Phys. A, 3 (2009), pp. 1–28]. The second one is that we prove the explicit convergence rates of the Yau–Yau algorithm with the spectral method and the direct method with Gaussian approximation, in terms of the numbers of spectral basis and time steps.},

The open-loop approach is employed to achieve optimal spatial convergence rates, while the Riccati-based closed-loop approach enhances temporal convergence rates and reduces the computational complexity.

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a -Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to -player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behavior as the number of agents, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash certainty equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the -player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an -Nash equilibrium for the -player game in Hilbert spaces. This property is established by showing that the mean field approximates the empirical average state within when agents follow these strategies.},

This work introduces a general computer-assisted methodology to prove that a given linear control system with compact constraints avoids a chosen unsafe set at a chosen final time . Relying on support hyperplanes, we devise a functional such that the property of interest is equivalent to finding a point at which the functional is negative. Actually evaluating the functional first requires time discretization. We thus provide explicit, fine discretization estimates for various types of matrices underlying the control problem. Second, computations lead to roundoff errors, which are dealt with by means of interval arithmetic. The control of both error types then leads to rigorous, computer-assisted proofs of nonreachability of the unsafe set. We illustrate the applicability and flexibility of our method in different contexts featuring various control constraints, unsafe sets, types of matrices, and problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i) as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii) as a benchmark setting for multiagent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. [Adv. Neural Inf. Process. Syst., 34 (2021), pp. 2949–2964] showed that an -Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite-horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free natural policy gradient algorithms with poly sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested zeroth-order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main result is twofold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish an sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the implicit regularization property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.},

We present a new family of logit-Q dynamics for efficient learning in stochastic games by combining the log-linear learning (also known as logit dynamics) for the repeated play of normal-form games with Q-learning for unknown Markov decision processes within the auxiliary stage-game framework. In this framework, we view stochastic games as agents repeatedly playing some stage game associated with the current state of the underlying game while the agents’ Q-functions determine the payoffs of these stage games. We show that the logit-Q dynamics presented reach (near) efficient equilibrium in stochastic teams with unknown dynamics and quantify the approximation error. We also show the rationality of the logit-Q dynamics against agents following pure stationary strategies. The key idea is to approximate the dynamics with a fictional scenario where the Q-function estimates are stationary over epochs whose lengths grow at a sufficiently slow rate. We then couple the dynamics in the main and fictional scenarios to show that these two scenarios become more and more similar across epochs due to the vanishing step size and growing epoch lengths.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Switching among affine systems under dwell-time constraints in order to steer the state as close as possible to a desired point involves the consideration of a nontrivial region into which the state is eventually driven and maintained. Suitable regions for this aim have the following property: For every point within the region, a switching law satisfying the dwell-time constraint exists so that the trajectory beginning at that point remains within the region for all future times. This paper focuses on addressing and characterizing the latter property, which is here called switching-controlled invariance (SCI) with dwell time, through a convexity-based approach. It is shown that SCI of a set is equivalent to the existence of some cover of , where each subset in the cover can be selected to share specific properties of : convexity, closedness, boundedness, and, most important, polytopic structure. Our theoretically most important result is to establish that if an SCI with dwell time set is a (closed and convex) polytope and the switched affine system has subsystems, then can be covered by subpolytopes so that the state trajectories beginning within each subpolytope are kept within during at least one dwell time without switching. This result is highly nontrivial, is not true for other geometric structures such as ellipsoids, and further motivates the consideration of polytopic sets in the control of switched affine systems with dwell time.},

Motivated by the concepts of volumetric controllability score (VCS) and average energy controllability score (AECS) proposed for linear time-invariant systems, we consider the generalization of such concepts to switched linear systems in this paper. The key step of the generalization is to build a similar link between the controllability scores and the optimization objects as in the time-invariant case. Through the link, two families of convex optimization problems, corresponding to the concepts of generalized VCS (GVCS) and generalized AECS (GAECS), respectively, are proposed. Then, we show the uniqueness of the solutions to these problems. These unique solutions are exactly the finite-time controllability scores we want, which provide a quantitative measure of the importance of each state node on controllability during each switching interval. Besides, an algorithm is provided to calculate the GVCS and GAECS based on the projected gradient method. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the generalized scores to evaluate the importance of each state node on controllability under a switched network structure.},

It follows from the flow property of reflected McKean–Vlasov SDEs that the dynamic programming principle holds. Applying the decoupling method and the heat kernel estimates for parabolic equations, we show that the value function is a viscosity solution to an appropriate HJB equation on the Wasserstein space, where the characterization of absolutely continuous curves on the Wasserstein space by the continuity equations plays an important role. To establish the uniqueness of the viscosity solution, we generalize the construction of a distance-like function initiated in Burzoni et al. [SIAM J.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We investigate a stochastic control problem with regime switching, which arises in the context of an optimal liquidation problem involving dark pools and multiple regimes. A novel aspect of this model is the introduction of a system of backward stochastic differential equations with jumps and singular terminal values, appearing for the first time in the literature. We establish the existence result for this system, thereby solving the stochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, we also achieve a uniqueness result for this system, which contrasts with the minimal solutions typically found in most related literature.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Local certification is a distributed mechanism enabling the nodes of a network to check the correctness of the current configuration, thanks to small pieces of information called certificates. For many classic global properties, like checking the acyclicity of the network, the optimal size of the certificates depends on the size of the network, . In this paper, we focus on properties for which the size of the certificates does not depend on but on other parameters. We focus on three such important properties and prove tight bounds for all of them. Namely, we prove that the optimal certification size is the following: for -colorability (and even exactly bits in the anonymous model while previous works had only proved a 2-bit lower bound); for dominating sets at distance (an unexpected and tighter-than-usual bound); and for perfect matching in graphs of maximum degree (the first nontrivial bound parameterized by ). We also prove some surprising upper bounds; for example, certifying the existence of a perfect matching in a planar graph can be done with only two bits. In addition, we explore various specific cases for these properties, in particular improving our understanding of the trade-off between locality of the verification and certificate size.},

Jenssen and Keevash investigated in depth Cartesian powers of cycles of fixed even lengths far beyond counting independent sets. They wonder to which extent their results extend to cycles of odd length, where not even the easiest case, counting independent sets in Cartesian powers of the triangle, is known. In this paper, we make progress on their question by providing a lower bound, which we believe to be tight. We also obtain a less precise lower bound for the number of independent sets in Cartesian powers of arbitrary odd cycles and show how to approach this question both with the cluster expansion method as well as more directly with isoperimetric inequalities.},

Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (see, e.g., [Hoos and Stützle, J. Autom. Reason., 24 (2000), pp. 421–481]). In the present article, we analyze the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SIAM J.

The dynamics of the underlying asset is modeled by the Euler scheme of a Brownian diffusion with affine drift, and convex volatility. We prove that the value function associated to the stochastic optimal control problem is a convex function of the underlying asset price. We also introduce a domination criterion offering insights into the functional monotonicity of the value function with respect to parameters of the underlying dynamics. We particularly focus on the one-dimensional setting where, by means of Stein’s formula and regularization techniques, we show that the convexity assumption for the volatility dynamics can be relaxed with a semiconvexity assumption. Finally, to validate our results, we also conduct numerical illustrations.},

In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, non-negative implicit neural representation factorization, based on low rank matrix factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative matrix factorization with continuous functions, and we propose using implicit neural representations to connect matrix with continuous functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases. Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods while giving continuous representations for object’s detailed geometric features and regional concentration variation.},

In this paper, we propose a new data assimilation approach based on iterative filtering and smoothing in the expectation-maximization fashion, incorporating optical flow prediction models for dynamic state estimation. The concept is suitable for applications where state estimation relies on two-dimensional images and where no natural physical prediction model is available. We apply the proposed approach to dynamic X-ray images and both real and synthetic satellite data, demonstrating that iterative filtering and smoothing with optical flow models yields improved results compared to using an identity model approach. The quality of the state estimates improves both visually and in terms of the root mean squared error, typically after a couple of iterations. However, in some cases, continued iterations may lead to deteriorating results. Therefore, monitoring the quality of both optical flow and state estimates is crucial in the iterative approach.},

A novel efficient orthogonal decomposition with automatic basis extraction (EOD-ABE) is proposed to compute the optimal low-rank matrix approximation with adaptive identification of the optimal rank. By introducing a randomized basis extraction mechanism, EOD-ABE eliminates the need for additional rank determination steps and can compute a rank-revealing approximation to a low-rank matrix. With a computational complexity of , where and are the dimensions of the matrix and is its computed numerical rank, EOD-ABE achieves significant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superior speed, accuracy, and robustness of EOD-ABE and indicate that EOD-ABE is a powerful tool for fast image compression and reconstruction and hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction in large-scale applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The primal-dual splitting algorithm (PDSA) by Chambolle and the PDSA by Chambolle and Pock are efficient for solving structured convex optimization problems. They adopt an extrapolation step and achieve convergence under certain step size conditions. Chang and Yang recently proposed a modified PDSA for bilinear saddle point problems, integrating a convex combination step to enable convergence with extended step sizes. In this paper, we focus on composite monotone inclusion problems (CMIPs), a generalization of convex optimization problems. While Vũ extended PDSA to CMIPs, whether the modified PDSA can be directly adapted to CMIPs remains an open question. This paper introduces a new PDSA for CMIPs, featuring the inclusion of both an extrapolation step and a convex combination step. The proposed algorithm is reformulated as a fixed-point iteration by leveraging an extended firmly nonexpansive operator. Under a significantly relaxed step size condition, both its convergence and sublinear convergence rate results are rigorously established. For a structured convex optimization problem, we establish its sublinear convergence rate results measured by a function value gap and constraint violations. Moreover, we show through a concrete example that our condition on the involved parameters cannot be relaxed. Numerical experiments on image denoising, inpainting, matrix games, and LASSO problems are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art counterparts, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm for computing the parameterization of simply connected open surfaces that achieves an optimal balance between angle and area distortions. We rigorously prove the global convergence of the iteration in our algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting mappings are bijective and effectively balance angular and area accuracy across various triangular meshes.

A key step in the proof is the use of the Delort–Majda concentration-compactness argument to exclude formation of atoms in the vorticity measure, which in particular implies that the limiting velocity is an admissible weak solution to Euler. This is the first result proving absence of dissipation in a class of solutions in which the velocity kinematically fails to be strongly compact in , putting two-dimensional turbulence in sharp contrast with respect to that in three dimensions. Moreover, our proof reveals that the amount of energy dissipation can be bounded by the vorticity measure of a disk of size , matching the two-dimensional Kolmogorov dissipative length scale which is expected to be sharp.},

In different regions of the -parameter plane, maximality is conjectured for the ball, the vertices of a regular simplex, or the endpoints of an interval. These cases are separated by a symmetry-breaking transition region where the shape of maximizers remains unclear. On the boundary of -parameter space, one encounters existing theorems and conjectures, including Watanabe’s theorem minimizing Riesz capacity for given volume, the classical isodiametric theorem that maximizes volume for given diameter, Szegő’s isodiametric theorem maximizing Newtonian capacity for given diameter, and the still-open isodiametric conjecture for Riesz capacity. The first quadrant of parameter space contains Pólya and Szegő’s conjecture on maximizing Newtonian over logarithmic capacity for planar sets. The maximal shape for each of these scenarios is known or conjectured to be the ball. Maximizers are quite different in the third quadrant where and are both negative. On the outer boundary of the quadrant, where one of or equals and the other is suitably negative, maximality is proved to occur when consists of the endpoints of an interval or else the vertices of a regular simplex. Considerably stronger results are shown in dimensions 1 and 2, where intervals, endpoints of intervals, and vertices of equilateral triangles provide the maximizers in large regions of the third quadrant.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Motivated by recent interest in elastic problems in which the target space is non-Euclidean, we study a limit where local rest distances within an elastic body are incompatible, yet close to, distances within the ambient space. Specifically, we obtain, via -convergence, a limit elastic model for a sequence of elastic bodies in an ambient space , for Riemannian metrics and such that . Furthermore, we relate the minimum of the limit problem to a linearized curvature discrepancy between and , using recent results of Kupferman and Leder [Forum Math. Sigma, 13 (2025), e51]. This relation confirms a linearized version of a long-standing conjecture in elasticity regarding the relation between the elastic energy and the curvature of the underlying space. The main technical challenge, compared to other linearization results in elasticity, is obtaining the correct notion of displacement for manifold-valued configurations, using Sobolev truncations and parallel transport. We show that the associated compactness result is obtained if satisfies a quantitative rigidity property, analogous to the Friesecke–James–Müller rigidity estimate in Euclidean space, and show that this property holds when is a round sphere.},

Consequently, the diffuse interface is located in an neighborhood of the sharp interface, and becomes nearly flat at infinity. This generalizes all the results for the triple junction solution with symmetry hypotheses to the nonsymmetric case. The proof relies on refined sharp energy lower and upper bounds, alongside a precise estimate of the diffuse interface location.},

Degenerate mean field type control problems are rarely studied in the literature. Our method is based on a lifting approach which embeds the control problem and the associated FBSDEs in Wasserstein spaces into certain Hilbert spaces. We use a continuation method to establish the solvability of the FBSDEs and that of the Gâteaux derivatives of these FBSDEs. We then explore the regularity of the value function in time and in measure argument, and we also show that it is the unique classical solution of the associated Bellman equation. We also study the higher regularity of the linear functional derivative of the value function, and thereby, we obtain the classical solution of the mean field type master equation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We prove exponential instability properties for the fractional Calderón problem and the conductivity formulation of the fractional Calderón problem in the regime of fractional powers . We particularly focus on two settings: First, we discuss instability properties in general domain geometries with scaling critical potentials and constant background metrics. Second, we investigate instability properties in general geometries with potentials and low regularity, variable coefficient, possibly anisotropic background metrics. In both settings, we make use of the methods introduced in Koch, Rüland, and Salo [Ars Inveniendi Anal., (2021), 7], and we deduce strong compression estimates for the forward problem. In the first setting, this is based on analytic smoothing estimates for a suitable comparison operator, while in the second setting, involving low regularity metrics, this is based on an iterated compression gain. We thus generalize the results from Rüland and Salo [Inverse Problems, 34 (2018), 045003] to generic geometries and variable coefficients and also further discuss the setting of fractional conductivity equations. In particular, this proves that the logarithmic stability estimates for the fractional Calderón problem from Rüland and Salo [Nonlinear Anal., 193 (2020), 111529] are optimal.},

The underlying partial differential equation system has cross-diffusion and density-dependent degenerate diffusion coefficient and involves the interactions of three quantities: tumor tissue density, acid concentration, and normal tissue density. The most challenging and interesting issue for the analysis of the current model is the existence of the traveling wave solution which signifies the invasion of tumor tissue into normal tissue. Because the diffusion of tumor tissue is influenced by the density of normal cells (cross-diffusion) and the diffusion coefficient is zero when normal cells are at the carrying capacity, this causes the diffusion coefficient of tumor tissue to be degenerate, a hallmark of the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) system. A rigorous proof of existence of traveling wave is proved for one-dimensional case.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Mean field Game (MFG) Partial Differential Inclusions (PDI) are generalizations of the system of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) of Lasry and Lions to situations where players in the game may have possibly nonunique optimal controls, and the resulting Hamiltonian is not required to be differentiable. We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable, Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the -norm and of the densities in -norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We study formally determined inverse problems with passive measurements for one dimensional (1D) evolution equations where the goal is to simultaneously determine both the initial data as well as the variable coefficients in such an equation from the measurement of its solution at a fixed spatial point for a certain amount of time. This can be considered as a 1D model of widely open inverse problems in photo-acoustic and thermo-acoustic tomography. We provide global uniqueness results for wave and heat equations stated on bounded or unbounded spatial intervals. Contrary to all previous related results on the subject, we do not impose any genericity assumptions on the coefficients or initial data. Our proofs are based on creating suitable links to the well understood spectral theory for 1D Schrödinger operators. In particular, in the more challenging case of a bounded spatial domain, our proof for the inverse problem partly relies on the following two key ingredients, namely (i) Paley–Wiener type theorems due to Kahane [Annales de l’Institut Fourier, 7 (1957), pp. 293–314] and Remling [J. Funct. Anal., 196 (2002), pp. 323–394] that together provide a quantifiable link between support of a compactly supported function and the upper density of its vanishing Schrödinger spectral modes and (ii) a result of Gesztesy and Simon [Trans.

Soc., 352 (1999), pp. 2765–2787] on partial data inverse spectral problems for reconstructing an unknown potential in a 1D Schrödinger operator from the knowledge of only a fraction of its spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. New developments of optical trapping techniques make it possible to confine atoms independently of their spin orientation in experiments and thus result in spinor condensates. As a continuation of our previous work [M. Li, X. Luo, J. Wei, and M. Zhen, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 56 (2024), pp. 4375–4414], we investigate physical states as well as qualitative properties describing the aggregation and extinction of atoms, of spin-1 Bose–Einstein condensate in an Ioffe–Pritchard magnetic field, through two conserved quantities, the number of atoms and the total magnetization. Unlike the related free case which is well studied in [Y. Z. Kong, Q. X. Wang, and D. Zhao, Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations, 60 (2021), 152] and our previous work, the presence of the Ioffe–Pritchard magnetic field, which competes dramatically with the harmonic trapping, requires new ideas to capture the physical states and analyze their qualitative properties.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiphase poromechanics describes the evolution of multiphase flow in deformable porous media. Mathematical models for such multiphysics systems are inherently nonlinear, potentially degenerate, and fully coupled systems of partial differential equations. In this work, we present a thermodynamically consistent multiphase poromechanics model falling into the category of Biot equations and obeying a generalized gradient flow structure. It involves capillarity effects, degenerate relative permeabilities, and gravity effects. In addition to established models, it introduces a Lagrange multiplier associated to a bound constraint on the effective porosity in particular ensuring its positivity. We establish existence of global weak solutions under the assumption of a weak coupling strength, implicitly utilizing the gradient flow structure, as well as a twofold regularization, first, relaxing the porosity constraint to provide strong monotonicity of the underlying energy, and second, adding coercivity by mitigating the degeneracy in the relative permeability through uniform positivity. This finally enables a Faedo–Galerkin approach and compactness arguments including vanishing regularization. This comprises the first global existence result for multiphase poromechanics accounting for degeneracies that are consistent with the multiphase nature of the flow.},

In the framework of general relativity, the motion of the fluid is coupled to the Einstein equations which describe the structure of the underlying spacetime. This model with free boundary admits a 1-parameter family of steady states with spherical symmetry. In this work, for perturbations within spherical symmetry, we study the stability and instability of this family. We prove that the linearized operator around steady states with large central densities admits a growing mode, while such growing modes do not exist for steady states with small central densities. Based on the linear analysis, we further demonstrate a dynamical nonlinear instability for steady states with large central densities. The proof relies on a spectral analysis of the linearized operator and an a priori estimate on the full nonlinear free boundary problem.},

We present an energy method to prove finite speed of propagation (“FSOP”) for energy-dissipating solutions to stochastic thin-film equations with conservative nonlinear multiplicative noise under periodic boundary conditions. Physically, the equations under consideration correspond to weak slippage, i.e., the case of mobility exponents . Analytically, our approach relies on a new weighted decay estimate for appropriate powers of the solution which is set up in combination with Bernis inequalities and energy estimates. An intricacy related to this estimate are multiple power-type nonlinearities on the right-hand side —not occurring in previous studies for finite speed of propagation of stochastic versions of degenerate parabolic equations. They result from the different scaling behavior of the thin-film operator and the specific porous-medium operator which comes up as a correction term for Stratonovich or for Hänggi–Klimontovich noise. Combining this decay estimate with tailored filtering techniques, a qualitative result on finite speed of propagation is established.},

The governing equations for the fluid flow are the stationary incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We establish precise upper bounds for the gradients and second-order derivatives of the fluid velocity as the distance between particles approaches zero, in dimensions two and three. The optimality of these blow-up rates of the gradients is demonstrated by deriving corresponding lower bounds. New difficulties arising from the nonlinear term in the Navier–Stokes equations is overcome. Consequently, the blow-up rates of the Cauchy stress are studied as well.},

On the quantum many-body level, the quintic nonlinearity corresponds to a three-body interaction. This is a continuation of our previous work [A. Rout and V. Sohinger, Comm. Partial Differential Equations, 48 (2023), pp. 1008–1055]. In the aforementioned work, we studied the cubic problem, which corresponds to a two-body interaction on the quantum many-body level. In our setup, we truncate the mass of the classical free field in the classical setting and the rescaled particle number in the quantum setting. Our methods are based on a perturbative expansion previously developed in the work of Fröhlich, Knowles, Schlein, and the second author [Comm. Math. Phys., 356 (2017), pp. 883–980]. We prove results in both the time-independent and the time-dependent setting.},

We show that the particle method converges as the number of particles goes to infinity towards weak measure solutions to the nonlocal equation. Such a results is proven under the assumption of initial data in the space of probability measures with finite second moment. In particular, our method is able to capture a measure-to- smoothing effect of the limit equation. Moreover, as the Morse potential is rescaled to approach a Dirac delta, corresponding to strongly localized repulsive interactions, the scheme becomes a particle approximation for the quadratic porous medium equation. We show that in the joint limit (localized repulsion and increasing number of particles) the reconstructed density converges to a weak solution of the porous medium equation. The strategy relies on various estimates performed at the particle level, including estimates and an entropy dissipation estimate, which benefit from the particular structure of our particle scheme and from the absolutely continuous reconstruction of the density from the particle locations.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The efficient solution of large-scale multiterm linear matrix equations is a challenging task in numerical linear algebra, and it is a largely open problem. We propose a new iterative scheme for symmetric and positive definite operators, significantly advancing methods such as truncated matrix-oriented conjugate gradients (cg). The new algorithm capitalizes on the low-rank matrix format of its iterates by fully exploiting the subspace information of the factors as iterations proceed. The approach implicitly relies on orthogonality conditions imposed over much larger subspaces than in cg, unveiling insightful connections with subspace projection methods. The new method is also equipped with memory-saving strategies. In particular, we show that for a given matrix , the action in low-rank format may not be evaluated exactly due to memory constraints. This problem is often underestimated, though it will eventually produce out-of-memory breakdowns for a sufficiently large number of terms. We propose an ad hoc randomized range-finding strategy that appears to fully resolve this shortcoming. Experimental results with typical application problems illustrate the potential of our approach over various methods developed in the recent literature. Reproducibility of computational results.

Inevitable noise in real measurements motivates the challenging problem of continuously quantifying the similarity between rigid objects such as periodic time series and 1-dimensional materials considered under isometry maintaining interpoint distances. The past work developed many Hausdorff-like distances, which have slow or approximate algorithms due to minimizations over infinitely many isometries. For all finite and 1-periodic sequences under isometry and rigid motion in any high-dimensional Euclidean space, we introduce complete invariants and Lipschitz continuous metrics whose time complexities are polynomial in both input size and ambient dimension. The key novelty in the periodic case is the Lipschitz continuity under perturbations that discontinuously change a minimum period. The proven continuity is practically important for maintaining scientific integrity by real-time detection of near-duplicate structures in experimental and simulated materials datasets.},

A technique for determining this augmentation parameter is proposed, and the loss-reduction and convergence properties of the bSQH algorithm are analyzed theoretically and validated numerically.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Many recent theoretical works on meta-learning aim to achieve guarantees in leveraging similar representational structures from related tasks towards simplifying a target task. The main aim of theoretical guarantees on the subject is to establish the extent to which convergence rates—in learning a common representation—may scale with the number of tasks (as well as the number of samples per task). First steps in this setting demonstrate this property when both the shared representation amongst tasks and task-specific regression functions are linear. This linear setting readily reveals the benefits of aggregating tasks, e.g., via averaging arguments. In practice, however, the representation is often highly nonlinear, introducing nontrivial biases in each task that cannot easily be averaged out as in the linear case. In the present work, we derive theoretical guarantees for meta-learning with nonlinear representations. In particular, assuming the shared nonlinearity maps to an infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we show that additional biases can be mitigated with careful regularization that leverages the smoothness of task-specific regression functions, yielding improved rates that scale with the number of tasks as desired.},

Adversarial attacks are usually expressed in terms of a gradient-based operation on the input data and model; this results in heavy computations every time an attack is generated. Recent empirical works exhibit attacks that can be approximated by neural networks. This work provides a general theoretical framework to represent adversarial attacks as a trainable function without further gradient computation. We first motivate that the theoretical best attacks, under proper conditions, can be represented as smooth piecewise functions (piecewise Hölder functions). Then we obtain an approximation result of such functions by a neural network. Subsequently, we emulate the ideal attack process by a neural network and reduce the adversarial training to a mathematical game between an attack network and a training model (a defense network). We also obtain convergence rates of adversarial loss in terms of the sample size for adversarial training in such a setting.},

It is well known that when numerically simulating solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs), achieving a strong convergence rate better than (where is the step-size) usually requires the use of certain iterated integrals of Brownian motion, commonly referred to as its “Lévy areas,” However, these stochastic integrals are difficult to simulate due to their non-Gaussian nature. and for a -dimensional Brownian motion with , no fast almost-exact sampling algorithm is known. In this paper, we propose LévyGAN, a deep-learning-based model for generating approximate samples of Lévy area conditional on a Brownian increment. Due to our “bridge-flipping” operation, the output samples match all joint and conditional odd moments exactly. Our generator employs a tailored graph neural network (GNN)-inspired architecture, which enforces the correct dependency structure between the output distribution and the conditioning variable. Furthermore, we incorporate a mathematically principled characteristic-function-based discriminator. Lastly, we introduce a novel training mechanism, termed “Chen-training,” which circumvents the need for expensive-to-generate training data-sets. This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main theoretical results. For four-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that LévyGAN exhibits state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that a high-quality synthetic Lévy area can lead to high order weak convergence and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).},

This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carathéodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the implicit function theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fréchet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The formulation of finite difference approximations is a classical problem in numerical analysis. In this article, we consider difference approximations that are based on a series expansion in powers of the second undivided difference. Each additional term in the series increases the order of accuracy by two. These expansions are useful in a variety of contexts such as in the development of modified equation schemes, the design of high-order accurate energy stable discretizations, and error analysis of certain finite element or finite difference schemes. Here, we provide closed form expressions for the coefficients in the series expansions for derivatives of all orders. We also provide some short recursions defining the series coefficients, and formulae for the stencil coefficients in standard difference approximations. The series expansions are used to show some useful properties of the Fourier symbols of difference approximations and to derive rules of thumb for the number of points-per-wavelength needed to achieve a given error tolerance when solving wave propagation problems involving higher spatial derivatives.},

To achieve accurate and efficient computation, we introduce the projection method, which enables the embedding of quasiperiodic systems into higher-dimensional periodic systems. To enhance the computational efficiency, we propose a compressed storage strategy for the stiffness matrix by its multilevel block circulant structure, significantly reducing memory requirements. Furthermore, we design a diagonal preconditioner to efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional linear system by reducing the condition number of the stiffness matrix. These techniques collectively contribute to the computational effectiveness of our proposed approach. Convergence analysis shows the polynomial accuracy of the proposed method. We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach through a series of numerical examples. Moreover, we apply our method to achieve a highly accurate computation of the homogenized coefficients for a quasiperiodic multiscale elliptic equation.},

In this paper, we take a step in this direction and conduct numerical analysis of the recently introduced time-relaxation ROM (TR-ROM), which uses spatial filtering to stabilize ROMs for convection-dominated flows. Specifically, we prove stability, show an a priori error bound, and show parameter scalings for the TR-ROM. Our numerical investigation shows that the theoretical convergence rate and the parameter scalings with respect to the ROM dimension and filter radius are recovered numerically. In addition, the parameter scaling can be used to extrapolate the time-relaxation parameter to other ROM dimensions and filter radii. Moreover, the parameter scaling with respect to the filter radius is also observed in the predictive regime.},

Invoking tools of variational analysis and generalized differentiation, we introduce new robust notions of relative contingent coderivatives. The novel machinery of variational analysis leads us to establishing complete characterizations of the relative well-posedness properties and developing basic rules of variational calculus interrelated with the obtained characterizations of well-posedness.

  abstract     = {Abstract. The use of quantum computing to accelerate complex optimization problems is a burgeoning research field. This paper applies Quantum Linear System Algorithms (QLSAs) to Newton systems within Interior Point Methods (IPMs) to take advantage of quantum speedup in solving Linear Optimization (LO) problems. Due to their inexact nature, QLSAs can be applied only to inexact variants of IPMs. Existing IPMs with inexact Newton directions are infeasible methods due to the inexact nature of their computations. This paper proposes an Inexact-Feasible IPM (IF-IPM) for LO problems, using a novel linear system to generate inexact but feasible steps. We show that this method has iteration complexity, analogous to the best exact IPMs, where is the number of variables and is the binary length of the input data. Moreover, we examine how QLSAs can efficiently solve the proposed system in an iterative refinement (IR) scheme to find the exact solution without excessive calls to QLSAs. We show that the proposed IR-IF-IPM can also be helpful to mitigate the impact of the condition number when a classical iterative method, such as a Conjugate Gradient method or a quantum solver is used at iterations of IPMs. After applying the proposed IF-IPM to the self-dual embedding formulation, we implement it and present illustrative numerical results.},

Diffusion models currently offer state-of-the-art performance in GAI for images. They also form a key component in more general tools, including text-to-image generators and large language models. Diffusion models work by adding noise to the available training data and then learning how to reverse the process. The reverse operation may then be applied to new random data in order to produce new outputs. We provide a brief introduction to diffusion models for applied mathematicians and statisticians. Our key aims are to (a) present illustrative computational examples, (b) give a careful derivation of the underlying mathematical formulas involved, and (c) draw a connection with partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion models. We provide code for the computational experiments. We hope that this topic will be of interest to advanced undergraduate and postgraduate students. Portions of the material may also provide useful motivational examples for those who teach courses in stochastic processes, inference, machine learning, PDEs, or scientific computing.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Diffusive flows, and their discrete counterparts, are ubiquitous in the physical and engineering sciences. In many important examples, the total mass is not preserved and therefore standard probabilistic models are not suitable. Examples include electrons which may be absorbed by the medium in which they travel. In population genetics, some individuals may “disappear” due to their genotype. In traffic flows over a network, some vehicles might simply exit the circulation and park. In this more general situation, where some of the mass may be lost, it is of particular interest to reconcile the observed initial and final marginal distributions with a given prior. In the case when the two marginals are probability distributions, and thus of equal mass, this problem was posed and, to a considerable extent, solved by E. Schrödinger in 1931/32. It is now known as the Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP). It turns out that Schrödinger’s problem can be viewed as both a modeling and a control problem. Due to the fundamental significance of this problem, interest in the SBP and in its deterministic (zero-noise limit) counterpart of optimal mass transport (OMT) has in recent years enticed scientists from a broad spectrum of disciplines, including physics, stochastic control, computer science, probability theory, and geometry. Yet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP/OMT have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention. The problem of interpolating between “unbalanced” marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms into the transport equations in an ad hoc manner, chiefly driven by applications in image registration. Nevertheless, as hinted at above, losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrödinger’s quest, that is, to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated evolution represents the most likely way that particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for diffusive evolution with losses, whereupon particles are “killed” (jump into a coffin/extinction state) according to a probabilistic law, and thereby mass is gradually lost along their stochastically driven flow. Through a suitable embedding, which appears to be novel, we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism in the style of E. Schrödinger, given a prior law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving a Feynman–Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure. The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrödinger’s quest. An iterative scheme, generalizing the celebrated Fortet–IPF–Sinkhorn algorithm, permits the computation of the new drift and the new killing rate of the path-space solution measure. We also formulate and solve a related fluid-dynamic control problem for the flow of one-time marginals where both the drift and the new killing rate play the role of control variable. A numerical example illustrating the new theoretical results is also presented.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The committor function is a central object for quantifying transitions between metastable states in randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Recently, effective methods based on deep learning have been proposed to compute the committor function in high-dimensional systems. However, sampling training data in these methods remains a challenging task, particularly for systems with small noise. In this work, we propose a deep learning method in which the data are sampled from the equilibrium distribution of a modified potential. We introduce two such modified potentials: the first (scheme I) incorporates a bias formed by localized Gaussian functions along a one-dimensional variable constructed from the learned committor function; the second (scheme II) uses a bias involving the free energy associated with the learned committor function. We analyze the distribution of the sampled data and show that, in both schemes, the data are well spread out and effectively cover the transition tube. Both schemes enable adaptive learning of the committor function without requiring prior knowledge of the transition pathways. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated using high-dimensional examples, including the alanine dipeptide and a solvated dimer system.

In this work, we propose a balanced multicomponent and multilayer neural network (MMNN) structure to accurately and efficiently approximate functions with complex features in terms of both degrees of freedom and computational cost. The main idea is inspired by a multicomponent approach in which each component can be effectively approximated by a single-layer network, combined with a multilayer decomposition strategy to capture the complexity of the target function. Although MMNNs can be viewed as a simple modification of fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) by introducing balanced multicomponent structures, they achieve a significant reduction in training parameters, a much more efficient training process, and improved accuracy compared to FCNNs or MLPs. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MMNNs in approximating highly oscillatory functions and their ability to automatically adapt to localized features.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. While those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these issues, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initializing a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modeling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% fewer parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present an efficient and scalable algorithm for performing matrix-vector multiplications (matvecs) for block Toeplitz matrices. Such matrices, which are shift-invariant with respect to their blocks, arise in the context of solving inverse problems governed by autonomous systems, and time-invariant systems in particular. In this article, we consider inverse problems that infer unknown parameters from observational data of a linear time-invariant dynamical system given in the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). Matrix-free Newton-conjugate-gradient methods are often the gold standard for solving these inverse problems, but they require numerous actions of the Hessian on a vector. Matrix-free adjoint-based Hessian matvecs require solution of a pair of linearized forward/adjoint PDE solves per Hessian action, which may be prohibitive for large-scale inverse problems. Time invariance of the forward PDE problem leads to a block Toeplitz structure of the discretized parameter-to-observable (p2o) map defining the mapping from inputs (parameters) to outputs (observables) of the PDEs. This block Toeplitz structure enables us to exploit two key properties: (1) compact storage of the p2o map and its adjoint, and (2) efficient fast Fourier transform–based Hessian matvecs. The proposed algorithm is mapped onto large multi-GPU clusters and achieves more than 80% of peak bandwidth on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Excellent weak scaling is shown for up to 48 A100 GPUs. For the targeted problems, the implementation executes Hessian matvecs within fractions of a second, which is orders of magnitude faster than can be achieved by conventional matrix-free Hessian matvecs via forward/adjoint PDE solves.

Even though there is no nested property, the nonnested augmented subspace method can transfer the solution of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation on the finest mesh to solving a linear equation on the same mesh and a small scale semilinear problem on a low-dimensional augmented subspace.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We present the implementation of a trust-region Newton algorithm ExaTron for bound-constrained nonlinear programming problems, fully running on multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). Without data transfers between a CPU and GPU, our implementation has achieved the elimination of a major performance bottleneck under a memory-bound situation, particularly when solving many small problems in batch. We discuss the design principles and implementation details for our kernel function and core operations. Different design choices are justified by numerical experiments. By using the application of distributed control of alternating current optimal power flow, where a large problem is decomposed into many smaller nonlinear programs using a Lagrangian approach, we demonstrate computational performance of ExaTron on the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this work, we develop a second-order modified ghost fluid method (2nd-MGFM) to simulate two-dimensional (2D) planar and axisymmetric compressible multimedium flow with an immiscible interface. To treat the material interface with higher-order accuracy, we develop the balanced conditions related to spatial derivatives at material interfaces for 2D planar and axisymmetric compressible multimedium flows. We then employ these balanced conditions to describe the interfacial physical properties and disclose that these conditions cannot be satisfied for the current ghost fluid methods, resulting in a first-order temporal error occurring in the region of the interface. To fix this difficulty, a multimedium generalized Riemann problem is proposed to predict the states and the spatial derivatives along the normal direction at the interface, in which the balanced conditions are imposed. Theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the proposed 2nd-MGFM can satisfy these balanced conditions, effectively eliminate the first-order major error term, suppress numerical overheating, and improve mass conservation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose high-order compact splitting Fourier spectral methods to compute the dynamics of dipolar Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) with arbitrary-angle rotation. The Hamiltonian is split into a linear part that consists of the Laplace and rotation and a nonlinear part that includes all the remaining terms. For the linear subproblem, we factorize the linear operator into a product of simple suboperators using the exact classical-quantum correspondence and semigroups decomposition, and these suboperators are integrated exactly in either physical or phase space. Importantly, we first derive explicit formulas for the splitting coefficients originally obtained by numerically solving a nonlinear system. The nonlinear part is solved exactly in physical space, and the convolution-type nonlocal potential with a singular kernel is computed via the Far-field Smooth Approximation (FSA) method with spectral accuracy. This “compact” splitting, involving only two operators, significantly simplifies the design of high-order schemes. Our method achieves high-order temporal precision and spectral spatial accuracy with near-optimal efficiency, and it is explicit, easy to implement and unconditionally stable. In addition, we derive some dynamical properties and conduct a comprehensive investigation, including accuracy confirmation, property verification, interaction of quantized vortices, and dynamics under honeycomb potential.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a model order reduction approach to speed up the computation of seismograms, i.e., the solution of the seismic wave equation evaluated at a receiver location, for different model parameters. This is highly relevant for seismic applications, such as full waveform inversion, seismic tomography, or monitoring tools of seismicity, that are computationally challenging, as the discretized (forward) model often has a huge number of unknowns and needs to be solved many times for different model parameters. Our approach achieves a reduction of the unknowns by a factor of approximately 1000 for various numerical experiments for a two-dimensional subsurface model of Groningen, the Netherlands (a region known for its seismic activity), even if the (known) wave speeds of the subsurface are relatively varied. Moreover, when using multiple cores to construct the reduced model, we can approximate the (time domain) seismogram in a lower wall-clock time than an implicit Newmark-beta method. To realize this reduction, we exploit the fact that seismograms are low-pass filtered for the observed seismic events. We thus consider the Laplace-transformed problem in the frequency domain and implicitly restrict ourselves to the frequency range of interest by adjusting the parameters of a source function, which is a popular model in computational seismology for the temporal response of an earthquake. Therefore, we can avoid the high frequencies that would require many reduced basis functions to reach the desired accuracy and generally make the reduced order approximation of wave problems challenging. Instead, we can prove for our ansatz that for a fixed subsurface model, the reduced order approximation converges exponentially fast in the frequency range of interest in the Laplace domain. We build the reduced model from solutions of the Laplace-transformed problem via a (proper orthogonal decomposition-)greedy algorithm targeting the construction of the reduced model to the time domain seismograms; the latter is achieved by using an a posteriori error estimator that does not require computing any time domain counterparts. Finally, we show that we obtain a stable reduced model, thus overcoming the challenge that standard model reduction approaches do not necessarily yield a stable reduced model for wave problems.

The phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) is the most appropriate model for extracting thermal properties of semiconductors from state-of-the-art frequency-domain thermo-reflectance (FDTR) experimental data. However, solving the BTE is computationally expensive because of its high-dimensionality, resulting in prohibitive time-to-solution. Scalable parallelization of the BTE solver that can avail supercomputing resources is desirable. We developed an adaptive parallelization strategy for the implicit solution of the multidimensional phonon BTE in the time domain. This adaptive method minimizes load imbalance and unnecessary computations in previously used band and cell-based partitioning schemes, achieved an average speedup of compared to the nonadaptive counterpart, and maintained strong scalability at cores. This new solver was used to simulate an FDTR experiment. The results (phase lag between the probe and pulse laser signals) are validated against experimental measurements and show good agreement. Our developed strategies can be applied to other computationally challenging problems constrained by limited parallelism.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In the past decade, tensors have shown their potential as valuable tools for various tasks in numerical linear algebra. While most of the research has been focusing on how to compress a given tensor in order to maintain information as well as reducing the storage demand for its allocation, the solution of linear tensor equations is a less explored venue. Even if many of the routines available in the literature are based on alternating minimization schemes (ALS), we pursue a different path and utilize Krylov methods instead. The use of Krylov methods in the tensor realm is not new. However, these routines often turn out to be rather expensive in terms of computational cost, and ALS procedures are preferred in practice. We enhance Krylov methods for linear tensor equations with a panel of diverse randomization-based strategies which remarkably increase the efficiency of these solvers, making them competitive with state-of-the-art ALS schemes. The up-to-date randomized approaches we employ range from sketched Krylov methods with incomplete orthogonalization and structured sketching transformations to streaming algorithms for tensor rounding. The promising performance of our new solver for linear tensor equations is demonstrated by many numerical results. Reproducibility of computational results.

Inspired by the well-known equivalence of 1-Wasserstein distance and minimum cost flows on standard graphs, we consider two versions of this problem: a minimum norm vector-valued flow problem with divergence constraints reflective of the connection structure of the graph, and a modified version which incorporates both quadratic regularization and a relaxation of the divergence constraint. Our theoretical contributions include conditions for feasibility and computation of the Lagrangian dual problem for both problems and duality correspondence for the relaxed-regularized version. Example applications of the model including transport between color images, vector field interpolation, and unsupervised clustering of vector field-valued data (in this case hurricane trajectory data) are also considered.},

A Taylor method for solving an ordinary differential equation initial-value problem , computes the Taylor series (TS) of the solution at the current point, truncated to some order, and then advances to the next point by summing the TS with a suitable stepsize. A standard ODE method (e.g., Runge–Kutta) treats function as a black box, but a Taylor solver requires to be preprocessed into a code-list of elementary operations that it interprets as operations on (truncated) TS. The trade-off for this extra work includes arbitrary order, typically enabling much larger stepsizes. For a standard function, such as , this means evaluating , where are TS. The sub-ODE method applies the ODE , obeyed by , to in-line this operation as . This gives economy of implementation: each function that satisfies a simple ODE goes into the “Taylor library” with a few lines of code—not needing a separate recurrence relation, which is the typical approach. Mathematically, however, the use of sub-ODEs generally transforms the original ODE into a differential-algebraic system, making it nontrivial to ensure a sound system of recurrences for Taylor coefficients. We prove that, regardless of how many sub-ODEs are incorporated into , this approach guarantees a sound system.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Recent years have witnessed the introduction and development of extremely fast rational function algorithms. Many ideas in this realm arose from polynomial-based linear-algebraic algorithms. However, polynomial approximation is occasionally ill-suited to specific challenging tasks arising in several situations. Some occasions require maximal efficiency in the number of encoding parameters while retaining the renowned accuracy of polynomial-based approximation. One application comes from promoting empirical pointwise functions to sparse matrix operators. Another is the robust representation of noisy data without overfitting. Rational function approximations provide a simple but flexible alternative (actually a superset), allowing one to capture complex nonlinearities without oscillatory artifacts. However, these come with extra challenges: i) coping with singularities and near singularities arising from a vanishing denominator, and ii) a nonuniqueness owing to the simultaneous renormalization of both numerator and denominator. We, therefore, introduce a new rational function framework using manifestly positive and normalized Bernstein polynomials for the denominator and any traditional polynomial basis (e.g., Chebyshev) for the numerator. While an expressly nonsingular approximation slightly reduces the maximum degree of compression, it keeps all the benefits of rational functions while maintaining the flexibility and robustness of polynomials, especially in noisy data scenarios. We illustrate the relevant aspects of this approach with a series of derivations and computational examples. Reproducibility of computational results.

In this paper, we propose a novel accuracy-preserved tensor-train (APTT) method to efficiently solve the Boltzmann-BGK equation. A second-order finite difference scheme is applied to discretize the Boltzmann-BGK equation, resulting in a tensor algebraic system at each time step. Based on the low-rank TT representation, the tensor algebraic system is then approximated as a TT-based low-rank system, which is efficiently solved using the TT-modified alternating least-squares (TT-MALS) solver. Thanks to the low-rank TT representation, the APTT method can significantly reduce the computational and memory costs compared to traditional numerical methods. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the APTT method maintains the same convergence rate as that of the finite difference scheme. The convergence rate and efficiency of the APTT method are validated by several benchmark test cases.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper is concerned with the approximation of probability distributions known up to normalization constants, with a focus on Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in scientific computing. In this context, key challenges include costly repeated evaluations of forward models, multimodality, and inaccessible gradients for the forward model. To address them, we develop a variational inference framework that combines the Fisher–Rao natural gradient with specialized quadrature rules to enable derivative free updates of Gaussian mixture variational families. The resulting method, termed derivative free Gaussian mixture variational inference (DF-GMVI), guarantees covariance positivity and affine invariance, offering a stable and efficient framework for approximating complex posterior distributions. The effectiveness of DF-GMVI is demonstrated through numerical experiments on challenging scenarios, including distributions with multiple modes, infinitely many modes, and curved modes in spaces with up to 100 dimensions. The method’s practicality is further demonstrated in a large-scale application, where it successfully recovers the initial conditions of the Navier–Stokes equations from solution data at positive times.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a novel sliding interface formulation for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between a rotating rigid structure and incompressible fluid, improving existing methodologies with a skew-symmetric Nitsche’s stabilization term applied on an artificial sliding interface alongside a rotational arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian framework. This innovative approach not only preserves the energy-dissipating property at the continuous level but also provides a robust foundation for further advancements in FSI modeling. Our methodology includes a first-order full discretization that maintains these critical energy-dissipating properties at the discrete level, ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. While prior contributions such as the original sliding interface method introduced by Bazilevs and Hughes (Comput. Mech., 43(1):143–150, 2008) have been significant, theoretical analyses such as the inf-sup condition on nonmatching meshes have gone largely unaddressed. We fill this gap by proving the inf-sup condition within the context of the isoparametric finite element method (FEM), where meshes are not only nonmatching but also overlapping, thus extending the applicability and robustness of our approach. Leveraging this inf-sup condition along with the inherent energy-dissipating properties, we establish the unique solvability of the fully discrete scheme. Through extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate the convergence, efficiency, and energy-dissipating property of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We consider the numerical solution of discrete Oseen problems. We focus on the recently proposed transform-then-solve approach, which amounts to first applying a specific algebraic transformation to the linear system of equations arising from the discretization and then solving the transformed system with an algebraic multigrid method. Promising results have been previously obtained with a two-grid variant, and here we bring two key improvements to make the approach robust in a multilevel setting. For a model problem with a constant convection field, it is shown, in a local Fourier analysis setting, that the two-grid method is convergent at any level of the hierarchy, with bounds that are independent of both the mesh size and the Reynolds number. Numerical results with a K-cycle multigrid scheme confirm the theoretical expectations for constant coefficient problems. For problems with variable convective flow, the method appears also robust with grid independence convergence, although a mild dependency with respect to the Reynolds number shows up at very low viscosity in driven cavity problems. The method is based on point coarsening and therefore, besides the system matrix, requires knowing, for each discrete unknown, which grid point it is associated with.},

Employing density functional theory, a gradient flow model is built upon the energy functional to obtain the ground state Wigner function representing the entire many-body system. Numerically, a parallelizable algorithm is developed using the operator splitting method and the Fourier spectral collocation method, whose numerical complexity of a single iteration is . Numerical experiments demonstrate the anticipated accuracy, encompassing the one-dimensional system with up to particles and the three-dimensional system with defect, showcasing the potential of our approach to large-scale simulations and computations of systems with defect.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce a new method to jointly reduce the dimension of the input and output space of a function between high-dimensional spaces. Choosing a reduced input subspace influences which output subspace is relevant and vice versa. Conventional methods focus on reducing either the input or output space, even though both are often reduced simultaneously in practice. Our coupled approach naturally supports goal-oriented dimension reduction, where either an input or output quantity of interest is prescribed. We consider, in particular, goal-oriented sensor placement and goal-oriented sensitivity analysis, which can be viewed as dimension reduction where the most important output or, respectively, input components are chosen. Both applications present difficult combinatorial optimization problems with expensive objectives such as the expected information gain and Sobol’ indices. By optimizing gradient-based bounds, we can determine the most informative sensors and most influential parameters as the largest diagonal entries of some diagnostic matrices, thus bypassing the combinatorial optimization and objective evaluation.

In the first part of the paper, the first $N$ Fourier modes of the solution are observed continuously over a finite time interval $[0, T ]$. The explicit upper bounds for the Wasserstein distance for the central limit theorem (CLT) of the MLE are provided as $N \to \infty$ and/or $T \to \infty$. In the second part of the paper, the $N$ Fourier modes are observed at uniform time grid, $t_i = i (T/M)$, $i=0,\dots,M,$ where $M$ is the number of time grid points. The consistency and asymptotic normality are studied as $T,M,N \to +\infty$ in addition to the rate of convergence in law in the CLT.},

This result substantially extends and improves some existing related results, such as Theorem 2.1 of Yang and Wang [Extremes, 16 (2013), pp. 55--74]. We also provide some concrete examples, some interesting properties, and a construction method of a conditional dependent random vector. Finally, we apply the above Breiman's theorem to risk theory and obtain two asymptotic estimates of the finite-time ruin probability and the infinite-time ruin probability of a discrete-time risk model, in which the corresponding net loss and random discount are conditionally dependent.},

  abstract     = {Motivated by the multilevel Monte Carlo method introduced by Giles [Oper. Res., 56 (2008), pp. 607--617], we study the asymptotic behavior of the normalized error process $u_{n,m}(X^n-X^{nm})$ where $X^n$ and $X^{nm}$ are, respectively, Euler approximations with time steps $1/n$ and $1/nm$ of a given stochastic differential equation driven by a pure jump Lévy process. In this paper, we prove that this normalized multilevel error converges to different nontrivial limiting processes with various sharp rates $u_{n,m}$ depending on the behavior of the Lévy measure around zero. Our results are consistent with those of Jacod [Ann. Probab., 32 (2004), pp. 1830--1872] obtained for the normalized error $u_n(X^n-X)$, as when letting $m$ tends to infinity, we recover the same limiting processes. For the multilevel error, the proofs of the current paper are challenging since, unlike Jacod's paper, we need to deal with $m$ dependent triangular arrays instead of one.},

  abstract     = {In the white Gaussian noise (WGN) model on the half-line, $dV(x)=f(x)\,dx+\varepsilon \, dW(x)$, $x>0$, minimax linear estimators of the functional $x^{1/2}_0f(x_0)$ are sought for a given $x_0>0$. Here, $f$ is an unknown signal satisfying a certain restriction $f\in\mathfrak{F}$, $\varepsilon>0$ is a given parameter, and $W(\,{\cdot}\,)$ is the standard Wiener process. With the use of the Mellin transform, it is shown that the above problem is equivalent to a similar (but better known) WGN model on the whole line, $dY(u)=g(u)\,du+\varepsilon \, dW(u)$, $-\infty<u<\infty$, where minimax linear estimators of the functional $g(u_0)$ are sought under a matching restriction $g\in \mathfrak{F}_0$, for $u_0=\log x_0.$ This demonstrates a close connection between the two models, which permits one to translate results on minimax linear estimation easily from one model to the other. In particular, it leads to minimax linear estimators on the half-line for a variety of ellipsoidal and cuboidal function classes $\mathfrak{F}$.},

  abstract     = {We propose new versions of the weak law of large numbers (LLN) for weakly dependent (nonidentically distributed, in general) summands, either assuming that each summand has finite expectation or without this assumption. One of the main conditions in the first of the three cases we consider (this case develops the ideas of Y. S. Chow [Ann. Math. Statist., 42 (1971), pp. 393--394]) is the Cesàro uniform integrability of the summands in the spirit of T. K. Chandra's studies of 1989--2012 on LLNs for pairwise independent random variables. In this result, the pairwise dependence conditions are replaced by quite different weak dependence type conditions in the spirit of A.N. Kolmogorov's paper [Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Rend. (6), 9 (1929), pp. 470--474]; the only difference is that, in the present paper, we impose conditions only on the first moments of some conditional expectations, rather than on their second moments. In the second case, which is based on a slightly different weak dependence condition, we use the method of telescopic expansion and the fact that the convergence in probability to a constant can be interpreted as weak convergence. In the third case, we establish an LLN for summands without finite expectations, assuming, again, that they are not necessarily identically distributed.},
