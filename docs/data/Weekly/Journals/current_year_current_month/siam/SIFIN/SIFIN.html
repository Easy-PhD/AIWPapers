  abstract     = {Abstract. This paper studies an optimal dividend problem for a company that aims to maximize the mean-variance (MV) objective of the accumulated discounted dividend payments up to its ruin time. The MV objective involves an integral form over a random horizon that depends endogenously on the company’s dividend strategy, and these features lead to a novel time-inconsistent control problem. To address the time inconsistency, we seek a time-consistent equilibrium dividend rate strategy. We first develop and prove a new verification lemma that characterizes the value function and equilibrium strategy by an extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman system. Next, we apply the verification lemma to obtain the equilibrium strategy and show that it is a barrier strategy for small levels of risk aversion.},

Attainment and duality of the aforementioned problems are provided. As an application, we study a matching problem in a dynamic setting where agent types evolve over time.

  abstract     = {Abstract. We analyze the impact of carbon dioxide regulation on a system of polluting, heterogeneous companies. We consider two compliance frameworks: one based on an emission trading system (ETS) mechanism and the other relying only on abatement efforts. The shocks in the economy are spanned by a multivariate Brownian motion, and the companies’ emissions are modeled as general diffusions. Firms must match their projected emission imbalance with their reduction effort at the compliance date in both frameworks. Under the ETS program, to do so firms can both abate and trade carbon permits in the ETS permits exchange. Existence and uniqueness of the optimal abatement and trade, together with the equilibrium carbon price, are proven under mild necessary and sufficient conditions. The optimizers and the carbon price are explicit, and their analytic expressions provide an instance of classic economic principles. Numerical examples illustrate the flexibility of the model in the study of the effect of significant allocation policies. Under the net-zero framework, firms can only rely on abatement, which is also provided in closed-form.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We introduce an efficient computational framework for solving a class of multimarginal martingale optimal transport problems, which includes many robust pricing problems of large financial interest. Such problems are typically computationally challenging due to the martingale constraint; however, by extending the state space we can identify them with problems that exhibit a certain sequential martingale structure. Our method exploits such structures in combination with entropic regularization, enabling fast computation of optimal solutions and allowing us to solve problems with a large number of marginals. We demonstrate the method by using it for computing robust price bounds for different options, such as lookback options and Asian options.},

It employs the sparse Hermite polynomial expansion as a surrogate model for the continuation value function, and essentially exploits the fast evaluation of gradients. The expansion coefficients are computed by solving a linear least squares problem that is enhanced by gradient information of simulated paths. We analyze the convergence of the proposed method, and establish an error estimate in terms of the best approximation error in the weighted space, the statistical error of solving discrete least squares problems, and the time step size. We present comprehensive numerical experiments to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art least squares Monte Carlo method with more accurate price, Greeks, and optimal exercise strategies in high dimensions but with nearly identical computational cost, and it can deliver comparable results with recent neural-network-based methods up to dimension 100.},

This paper investigates the optimal retirement decision, investment, and consumption strategies in a market with jump diffusion, taking into account habit persistence and stock-wage correlation. Our analysis considers multiple stocks and a finite time framework, intending to determine the retirement boundary of the “wealth-habit-wage” triplet . To achieve this, we use the habit reduction method and a duality approach to obtain the retirement boundary of the primal variables and feedback forms of optimal strategies. When dealing with the dual problem, we address technical challenges in the proof of integral equation characterization of optimal retirement boundary using a version of It’s formula. Our results show that when the so-called de facto wealth exceeds a critical proportion of wage, an immediate retirement is the optimal choice for the agent. Additionally, we find that the introduction of jump risks allows for the possibility of discontinuous investment strategies within the working region, which is a novel and insightful finding. Our numerical results effectively illustrate these findings by varying the parameters.},

The aim of this work is to propose an extension of the deep solver by Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) to the case of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) with jumps. As in the aforementioned solver, starting from a discretized version of the FBSDE and parametrizing the (high-dimensional) control processes by means of a family of artificial neural networks (ANNs), the FBSDE is viewed as a model-based reinforcement learning problem, and the ANN parameters are fitted so as to minimize a prescribed loss function. We take into account both finite and infinite jump activity by introducing, in the latter case, an approximation with finitely many jumps of the forward process. We successfully apply our algorithm to option pricing problems in low and high dimensions and discuss the applicability in the context of counterparty credit risk.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We extend the discrete-time construction of [J. Guyon, Risk, April (2020)] and explain how to build a continuous-time stochastic volatility (SV) model which jointly and exactly calibrates S&P 500 (SPX) smiles, VIX futures, and VIX smiles at discrete dates, via minimum-entropy. The Schrödinger problem approach of [J. Guyon, Risk, April (2020)] is now formulated in continuous time: among all the (arbitrage-free) jointly calibrated semimartingale models, we aim to build the one that minimizes the relative entropy with respect to a reference SV model. This naturally leads to dispersion-constrained martingale Schrödinger bridges, a new type of Schrödinger bridges which is constrained by the martingality of the SPX and by the prices of VIX derivatives. A dual problem is derived heuristically and gives rise to a candidate model, which is then jointly calibrated provided a number of conditions are met. The dual problem consists of solving Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman PDEs and maximizing a concave functional of those solutions over SPX and VIX payoffs. The candidate model is identical to the reference model, but for an extra drift in the SV which explicitly depends on the solution to the dual HJB PDE. Focusing on the practical case where we calibrate to a finite number of vanilla options, we show that the gradient of the dual functional simply reads as the difference between model and market prices and is therefore easily computed using classical finite difference methods, such as the alternating-direction implicit scheme. The dual maximization is then performed by classical least squares techniques and is shown to yield a jointly calibrated model. Interestingly, the extra drift in SV is path-dependent in both the SPX and the instantaneous volatility. Numerical results on model-generated data illustrate the accuracy of the method.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We propose a fully explicit and empirically sound option pricing model based on additive processes. The model yields analytic closed formulae for pricing vanilla options, is easy to calibrate and simulate, and it fits very well the market implied volatility at an extremely low computational cost. The explicit expressions for commonly traded products imply that both large and small maturity leading orders of the implied volatility level and skew—as well as large strike asymptotics—can be determined exactly. A plethora of implied volatility shapes can thus be reproduced by just supplying appropriate term functions, leading to nearly complete control of the implied volatility surface. The methodological implication of our study is that, in contrast to widespread belief, realistic continuous-time models allowing explicit option pricing do exist. We finally argue that explicit additive models need not be only of the proposed Beta type, but by taking into account skew generation mechanisms, analyticity of vanilla prices can be potentially determined by other kinds of distributions.},
