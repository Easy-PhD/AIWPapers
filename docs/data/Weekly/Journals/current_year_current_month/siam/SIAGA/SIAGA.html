For , the cone of positive semidefinite (PSD) -ary -ic forms (i.e., homogeneous polynomials with real coefficients in variables of degree ) contain the cone of those that are representable as finite sums of squares (SOS) of -ary -ic forms. Hilbert’s 1888 theorem states that exactly in the Hilbert cases with or or (3,4). For the non-Hilbert cases, we examined in a preceeding paper a specific cone filtration along projective varieties containing the Veronese variety via the Gram matrix method. Here, was the dimension of the real vector space of -ary -ic forms. In particular, we computed the number of strictly separating intermediate cones (i.e., such that ) for the cases (3,6) and . In this paper, first, we generalize these findings to any non-Hilbert case by identifying each strict inclusion in the above specific cone filtration. This allows us to give a refinement of Hilbert’s 1888 theorem by computing in any non-Hilbert case. The cone filtration thus reduces to a specific cone subfiltration in which each inclusion is strict. Second, we show that each , and hence each strictly separating , fails to be a spectrahedral shadow.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is shown that the correct decoding probability of an eavesdropper and error probability of a legitimate receiver in a Rayleigh fading wiretap channel with lattice coset coding are both bounded above by the theta function in the -norm of the dual code lattices. Motivated by this, we investigate the -norm theta functions of sublattices of and their duals and prove that the lattice minimizes the theta function among all scalings of along the coordinate axes. In the small -range, the -norm theta function of a lattice is governed by the cross-polytope packing density. Thus, a method is developed to algorithmically find locally critical lattice packings of the -dimensional cross-polytope. Using this method, we are able to construct a four-dimensional lattice having a cross-polytope packing density of and kissing number 30, improving on the best known translational packing density of the cross-polytope in dimension four.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. We show how certain everywhere-regular real rational function solutions of the KP1 equation (“multilumps”) can be constructed via the polynomial analogs of theta-functions from singular rational curves with only cuspidal singularities. The method we use can be understood in two ways: either directly or via degenerations of soliton solutions. From the second point of view, ithe method can be seen as a variation on the long-wave limit technique of Ablowitz and Satsuma, as developed by Zhang, Yang, Li, Guo, and Stepanyants. Our main explicit example is a three-lump solution constructed via the polynomial analog of the theta-function from a rational curve with two cuspidal singular points, each with semigroup ( double points). We show that there are similar six-lump solutions from a rational curve with two cusps, each with semigroup ( double points). We conjecture that these ideas will generalize to give similar -lump solutions with for starting from rational curves with two singular points with semigroup ( double points). Finally, we present a five-lump solution constructed from a rational curve with two cusps, each with semigroup . Similar solutions have been constructed previously using other methods; our contribution is to show how they arise from the algebraic-geometric setting by considering singular curves with several cusps, as in work of Agostini, Çelik, and the current author.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. For each , let denote the Kneser graph, whose vertices are labeled by -element subsets of and whose edges indicate that the corresponding subsets are disjoint. Fixing and allowing to vary, one obtains a family of nested graphs, each equipped with a natural action by a symmetric group such that these actions are compatible. Collections of graphs of this type are common in algebraic combinatorics and include families such as Johnson graphs, crown graphs, and rook graphs. In previous work [RW], the authors systematically studied families of this type using the language of representation stability and -modules. In that work, it is shown that such families of graphs exhibit a large variety of asymptotic regular behaviors. The present work applies the theory developed in [RW], later refined in [RSW], to study random walks on the graphs of such families. We show that the moments of hitting times exhibit rational function behavior asymptotically. By consequence, we conclude similar facts about the entries of the discrete Green’s functions, as considered by Chung and Yau [CY]. Finally, we illustrate how the algebro-combinatorial structure of the graphs in these families give bounds on the mixing times of random walks on those graphs. We suggest some possible directions for future study, including of the appearance (or not) of the cutoff phenomenon, originally presented by Aldous and Diaconis [AD] and Diaconis [D].},

  abstract     = {Abstract. One of the most animated themes of multidimensional persistence is the comparison of invariants. The matching distance between persistent Betti numbers functions (or rank invariants) is among the most studied metrics in this context, particularly in 2-parameter persistence. The main reason for this interest is that, in the 2-parameter case, the foliation method allows for an effective computation of the matching distance, based on filtering the space along lines of positive slope. Our work provides a qualitative analysis, based on a construction called extended Pareto grid, of the filtering lines that contribute to the computation of the matching distance. Under certain genericity assumptions, we show that these lines must either have slope 1 or belong to a collection of special lines associated with discontinuity phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. A theory of finite presentations and resolutions is developed for modules over an arbitrary poset to parallel the theory for finitely generated modules over polynomial rings. Since the Noetherian hypothesis fails, an alternative finiteness condition is introduced: the notion of a tame -module, which captures the hypothesis that, as a family of vector spaces indexed by , the module should be constant on finitely many regions, each marked by a single vector space of finite dimension. Four characterizations of tameness are provided: the initial topological definition in terms of constant regions; a combinatorial version by poset encoding; an algebraic version by fringe presentation that combines poset analogues of free presentation and injective copresentation; and a homological version culminating in a syzygy theorem, in analogy with the Hilbert syzygy theorem for modules over polynomial rings. Data structures for tame modules are introduced using monomial matrices to serve both theoretical and computational purposes. In the context of persistent homology of filtered topological spaces, especially with multiple real parameters, monomial matrices for tame modules yield topologically interpretable data structures in terms of birth and death of homology classes.},
