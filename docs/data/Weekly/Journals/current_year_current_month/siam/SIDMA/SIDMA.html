  abstract     = {Abstract. Set-valued standard Young tableaux (Young tableaux in which the cells are filled with nonempty sets of positive integers) are a generalization of standard Young tableaux due to Buch (2002) with applications in algebraic geometry. The enumeration of set-valued SYT is significantly more complicated than in the ordinary case, although product formulas are known in certain special cases. In this work, we study the case of two-rowed set-valued SYT with a fixed number of entries. These tableaux are a new combinatorial model for the Catalan, Narayana, and Kreweras numbers and can be shown to be in correspondence with both 321-avoiding permutations and a certain class of bicolored Motzkin paths. We also introduce a generalization of the set-valued comajor index studied by Hopkins, Lazar, and Linusson (2023) and use this statistic to find seemingly new -analogs of the Catalan and Narayana numbers.},

Specifically, we present a bound on the number of incidences between points and polynomials of bounded degree in . Our approach employs a singular value decomposition of the incidence matrix between points and polynomials and an analysis of the related group algebras. This bound is then applied to coding theory, specifically to the problem of average-radius list decoding of Reed–Solomon (RS) codes. We demonstrate that RS codes of certain lengths are average-radius list-decodable with a constant list size that depends only on the code rate and the distance from the Johnson radius. While a constant list size for list-decoding of RS codes in this regime was previously established, its existence for the stronger notion of average-radius list-decoding was not known to exist.},

For this problem, which is a common generalization of several well-studied graph augmentation problems, no approximation algorithm has previously been known for . Our main algorithmic result is a 5-approximation algorithm in the case. We achieve this by proving numerous new structural results on rigid graphs and globally linked vertex pairs. In particular, we show that every rigid graph in has a tree-like structure, which conveys all the information regarding its globally rigid augmentations. Our results also yield a new, simple solution to the minimum cardinality version (where the cost function is uniform) for rigid input graphs, a problem which is known to be solvable in polynomial time.},

The canonical Ramsey theorem of Erdős and Rado implies that for any graph , any edge-coloring (with an arbitrary number of colors) of a sufficiently large complete graph contains a monochromatic, lexicographic, or rainbow copy of . The least such is called the Erdős–Rado number of , denoted by . Erdős–Rado numbers of cliques have received considerable attention, and in this paper we extend this line of research by studying Erdős–Rado numbers of sparse graphs. For example, we prove that if has bounded degree, then is polynomial in if is bipartite but exponential in general. We also study the closely related problem of constrained Ramsey numbers. For a given tree and given path , we study the minimum such that every edge-coloring of contains a monochromatic copy of or a rainbow copy of . We prove a nearly optimal upper bound for this problem, which differs from the best known lower bound by a function of inverse Ackermann type.},

Weaver’s discrepancy for a list of vectors is defined as the minimum operator norm of the signed sum of the vectors’ outer products among all possible sign choices. First, we establish that when , with probability at least 0.99, Weaver’s discrepancy is . Second, we demonstrate that for , Weaver’s discrepancy is , and for , the discrepancy is , both with high probability; these two bounds match when . Our proofs mainly utilize the first- and second-moment methods.
