  abstract     = {Abstract. Twin-width is a structural width parameter introduced by Bonnet, Kim, Thomassé and Watrigant [FOCS 2020] and has interesting applications in the areas of logic on graphs and in parameterized algorithmics. Very briefly, the essence of twin-width is in a gradual reduction (a contraction sequence) of the given graph down to a single vertex while maintaining limited difference in the neighborhoods of the vertices, and it can be seen as widely generalizing several other traditional structural parameters. While for many natural graph classes, it is known that their twin-width is bounded, and published upper bounds on the twin-width in nontrivial cases are very often “astronomically large,” We focus on planar graphs, which are known to already have bounded twin-width since its introduction, but it took some time for the first explicit “nonastronomical” upper bounds to come. Namely, in the order of preprint appearance, the bound was at most 183 by Jacob and Pilipczuk [arXiv, January 2022], and 583 by Bonnet, Kwon and Wood [arXiv, February 2022]. Subsequent arXiv manuscripts in 2022 improved the bound down to 37 (Bekos et al.) and 11 and 9 (both by Hliněný). We further elaborate on the approach used in the latter manuscripts, proving that the twin-width of every planar graph is at most 8 and construct a witnessing contraction sequence in linear time. Note that the currently best lower-bound planar example is of twin-width 7 by Král’ and Lamaison [arXiv, September 2022]. We also prove small explicit upper bounds on the twin-width of bipartite planar and 1-planar graphs (6 and 16) and of map graphs (38). The common denominator of all these results is the use of a novel specially crafted recursive decomposition of planar graphs, which may be found useful also in other areas.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Local certification is a distributed mechanism enabling the nodes of a network to check the correctness of the current configuration, thanks to small pieces of information called certificates. For many classic global properties, like checking the acyclicity of the network, the optimal size of the certificates depends on the size of the network, . In this paper, we focus on properties for which the size of the certificates does not depend on but on other parameters. We focus on three such important properties and prove tight bounds for all of them. Namely, we prove that the optimal certification size is the following: for -colorability (and even exactly bits in the anonymous model while previous works had only proved a 2-bit lower bound); for dominating sets at distance (an unexpected and tighter-than-usual bound); and for perfect matching in graphs of maximum degree (the first nontrivial bound parameterized by ). We also prove some surprising upper bounds; for example, certifying the existence of a perfect matching in a planar graph can be done with only two bits. In addition, we explore various specific cases for these properties, in particular improving our understanding of the trade-off between locality of the verification and certificate size.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. It is a well known result due to Korshunov and Sapozhenko that the hypercube in dimensions has independent sets. Jenssen and Keevash investigated in depth Cartesian powers of cycles of fixed even lengths far beyond counting independent sets. They wonder to which extent their results extend to cycles of odd length, where not even the easiest case, counting independent sets in Cartesian powers of the triangle, is known. In this paper, we make progress on their question by providing a lower bound, which we believe to be tight. We also obtain a less precise lower bound for the number of independent sets in Cartesian powers of arbitrary odd cycles and show how to approach this question both with the cluster expansion method as well as more directly with isoperimetric inequalities.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In an influential article, Papadimitriou [On selecting a satisfying truth assignment, in Proceedings of the 32nd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 1991, pp. 163–169] proved that a local search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable 2-CNF with variables in expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (see, e.g., [Hoos and Stützle, J. Autom. Reason., 24 (2000), pp. 421–481]). In the present article, we analyze the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SIAM J. Comput., 36 (2007) pp. 1248–1263], we show that WalkSAT runs in linear expected time for all clause/variable densities up to the random 2-SAT satisfiability threshold.},
