Seminal theoretical results towards understanding this phase in MATBG have shown that Hartree–Fock ground states (with a positive single-particle excitation gap) can be exact many-body ground states of an idealized flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. We prove that in the absence of spin and valley degrees of freedom, the only Hartree–Fock ground states of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG are two ferromagnetic Slater determinants. Incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we provide a complete characterization of the Hartree–Fock ground state manifold, which is generated by a hidden symmetry group acting on five elements. We also introduce new tools for ruling out translation symmetry breaking in the Hartree–Fock ground state manifold, which may be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Blind image deconvolution is a challenging, highly ill-posed nonlinear inverse problem. We introduce a Multiscale Hierarchical Decomposition Method (MHDM) that iteratively solves variational problems with adaptive data and regularization parameters, towards obtaining finer and finer details of the unknown kernel and image. We establish convergence of the residual in the noise-free data case, and then in the noisy data case when the algorithm is stopped early by means of a discrepancy principle. Fractional Sobolev norms are employed as regularizers for both kernel and image, with the advantage of computing the minimizers explicitly in a pointwise manner. In order to break the notorious symmetry occurring during each minimization step, we enforce a positivity constraint on the Fourier transform of the kernels. Numerical comparisons with a single-step variational method and a nonblind MHDM show that our approach produces comparable results, while less laborious parameter tuning is necessary at the price of more computations. Additionally, the scale decomposition of both reconstructed kernel and image provides a meaningful interpretation of the involved iteration steps.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Noise-induced transitions between multistable states happen in a multitude of systems, such as species extinction in biology, protein folding, or tipping points in climate science. Large deviation theory is the rigorous language to describe such transitions for nonequilibrium systems in the small noise limit. At its core, it requires the computation of the most likely transition pathway, solution to a PDE constrained optimization problem. Standard methods struggle to compute the minimizer in the particular coexistence of (1) multistability, i.e., coexistence of multiple long-lived states, and (2) degenerate noise, i.e., stochastic forcing acting only on a small subset of the system’s degrees of freedom. In this paper, we demonstrate how to adapt existing methods to compute the large deviation minimizer in this setting by combining ideas from optimal control, large deviation theory, and numerical optimization. We show the efficiency of the introduced method in various applications in biology, medicine, and fluid dynamics, including the transition to turbulence in subcritical pipe flow.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this article, we extend the study of embedded corrector problems, that we have previously introduced in the context of the homogenization of scalar diffusive equations, to the context of homogenized elastic properties of materials. This extension is nontrivial and requires mathematical arguments specific to the elasticity case. Starting from a linear elasticity model with highly oscillatory coefficients, we introduce several effective approximations of the homogenized tensor. These approximations are based on the solution to an embedded corrector problem, where a finite-size domain made of the linear elastic heterogeneous material is embedded in a linear elastic homogeneous infinite medium, the constant elasticity tensor of which has to be appropriately determined. The approximations we provide are proven to converge to the homogenized elasticity tensor when the size of the embedded domain tends to infinity. One of the approximations we propose is based on a self-consistent formulation, for which proving, in the general case, the existence of a solution is challenging. We show that, by restricting ourselves to a class of heterogeneous isotropic materials for which the homogenized elasticity tensor is known to be isotropic, it is possible to introduce a weaker self-consistent formulation for which both existence of a solution and convergence of that approximation to the homogenized tensor can be shown.},

Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the Itô–Schrödinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. This is done via Duhamel expansions, under the assumption that the random medium has Gaussian statistics. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [G. Bal and A.

A strongly coupled nonlinear system of a time-fractional equation and a time-fractional Hamilton–Jacobi equation is derived based on the first-order optimality condition. After changing of variables, we reformulate the nonlocal SBP as a related minimization problem constrained by a time-fractional transport equation. The corresponding cost function introduces an additional intricate term involving the time-fractional derivative compared with its classical analogue, and this reformulation again yields a coupled nonlinear system equivalent to the original system. The widely used general-proximal primal-dual hybrid gradient (G-prox PDHG) algorithm is extended to solve the nonlocal SBP, and we apply a preconditioner induced by the discretization scheme of the time-fractional model to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm. Numerical experiments between Gaussian distributions are performed to investigate the performance of the nonlocal SBP, which demonstrate the reliability, efficiency, and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the multiscale feature of the nonlocal SBP.},

The two-scale cell correctors were introduced and analyzed qualitatively by Allaire in the early 90’s [G. Allaire, Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Cl. Sci., 18 (1991), pp. 475–499]. Thanks to our layer potential approach, we also provide a novel explanation of the conductivity matrix in Darcy’s model, of the Brinkman term in Brinkman’s model, and explain the special behavior for . Finally, we also prove quantitative homogenization error estimates in various regimes of ratios between the size of the perforating holes and the typical distance between holes.

  abstract     = {Abstract. Multiscale flow in heterogeneous porous media finds application across numerous fields of science and engineering. In this work, we first review the well-known averaged-parameter and distributed microstructure modeling frameworks for simulating diffusive transport phenomena in a porous (binary) medium comprised of a connected phase surrounding disconnected inclusions. We show that while the averaged-parameter model performs well when the diffusivity ratio of the inclusion to that of the surrounding phase is large, it fails to describe the diffusive transport phenomena for small diffusivity ratios. The distributed microstructure model, on the other hand, produces a more realistic representation of the transport behavior over all diffusivity ratios. However, this class of models is computationally demanding because of the need to compute over the macroscopic and microscopic scales concurrently. By representing the integral exchange term appearing in the macroscopic averaged equation as a convolution integral with a kernel describing the fading memory effects, it is well known that the fully coupled dual-scale model reduces to a single implicit evolution equation. We explore a connection between the dual-scale modeling framework and fractional calculus through the choice of two specific kernel functions. The first is a power-law function used with good success in the modeling of subsurface hydrology, and the second is the ubiquitous Mittag-Leffler function. Both choices produce implicit evolution equations involving time-fractional operators; however, it is only the generalized Mittag-Leffler function kernel that is capable of capturing the evolution of the average concentration over the inclusion across a wide range of diffusivities for the associated microcell problem. We measure the accuracy of this new fractional model against a semianalytical solution and make comparisons with the full dual-scale model to highlight not only its predictive capability but also its superior computational performance.},
