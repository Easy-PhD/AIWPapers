  abstract     = {Abstract. The reconstruction of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images from noisy projection data is a significant but challenging problem. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach, non-negative implicit neural representation factorization, based on low rank matrix factorization of unknown images and employing neural networks to represent both coefficients and bases. Mathematically, we demonstrate that if a sequence of dynamic PET images satisfies a generalized non-negative low-rank property, it can be decomposed into a set of non-negative continuous functions varying in the temporal-spatial domain. This bridges the well-established non-negative matrix factorization with continuous functions, and we propose using implicit neural representations to connect matrix with continuous functions. The neural network parameters are obtained by minimizing the KL divergence, with additional sparsity regularization on coefficients and bases. Extensive experiments on dynamic PET reconstruction with Poisson noise demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to other methods while giving continuous representations for object’s detailed geometric features and regional concentration variation.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. In this paper, we propose a new data assimilation approach based on iterative filtering and smoothing in the expectation-maximization fashion, incorporating optical flow prediction models for dynamic state estimation. The concept is suitable for applications where state estimation relies on two-dimensional images and where no natural physical prediction model is available. We apply the proposed approach to dynamic X-ray images and both real and synthetic satellite data, demonstrating that iterative filtering and smoothing with optical flow models yields improved results compared to using an identity model approach. The quality of the state estimates improves both visually and in terms of the root mean squared error, typically after a couple of iterations. However, in some cases, continued iterations may lead to deteriorating results. Therefore, monitoring the quality of both optical flow and state estimates is crucial in the iterative approach.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Low-rank matrix approximation plays an important role in various applications such as image processing, signal processing, and data analysis. The existing methods require a guess of the ranks of matrices that represent images or involve additional costs to determine the ranks. A novel efficient orthogonal decomposition with automatic basis extraction (EOD-ABE) is proposed to compute the optimal low-rank matrix approximation with adaptive identification of the optimal rank. By introducing a randomized basis extraction mechanism, EOD-ABE eliminates the need for additional rank determination steps and can compute a rank-revealing approximation to a low-rank matrix. With a computational complexity of , where and are the dimensions of the matrix and is its computed numerical rank, EOD-ABE achieves significant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superior speed, accuracy, and robustness of EOD-ABE and indicate that EOD-ABE is a powerful tool for fast image compression and reconstruction and hyperspectral image dimensionality reduction in large-scale applications.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. The primal-dual splitting algorithm (PDSA) by Chambolle and the PDSA by Chambolle and Pock are efficient for solving structured convex optimization problems. They adopt an extrapolation step and achieve convergence under certain step size conditions. Chang and Yang recently proposed a modified PDSA for bilinear saddle point problems, integrating a convex combination step to enable convergence with extended step sizes. In this paper, we focus on composite monotone inclusion problems (CMIPs), a generalization of convex optimization problems. While Vũ extended PDSA to CMIPs, whether the modified PDSA can be directly adapted to CMIPs remains an open question. This paper introduces a new PDSA for CMIPs, featuring the inclusion of both an extrapolation step and a convex combination step. The proposed algorithm is reformulated as a fixed-point iteration by leveraging an extended firmly nonexpansive operator. Under a significantly relaxed step size condition, both its convergence and sublinear convergence rate results are rigorously established. For a structured convex optimization problem, we establish its sublinear convergence rate results measured by a function value gap and constraint violations. Moreover, we show through a concrete example that our condition on the involved parameters cannot be relaxed. Numerical experiments on image denoising, inpainting, matrix games, and LASSO problems are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with state-of-the-art counterparts, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Abstract. Surface parameterization is a fundamental concept in fields such as differential geometry and computer graphics. It involves mapping a surface in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional parameter space. This process allows for the systematic representation and manipulation of surfaces of complicated shapes by simplifying them into a manageable planar domain. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm for computing the parameterization of simply connected open surfaces that achieves an optimal balance between angle and area distortions. We rigorously prove the global convergence of the iteration in our algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting mappings are bijective and effectively balance angular and area accuracy across various triangular meshes. Additionally, we present the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm by applying it to represent surfaces as geometry images.},
