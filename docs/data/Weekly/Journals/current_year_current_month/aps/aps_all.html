  abstract     = {We present a surface plasmon resonance scheme for the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) employing vacuum-induced transparency. The system under consideration consists of a metal-dielectric interface placed within an optical cavity, where the dielectric medium is composed of three-level atoms in a Λ -type configuration. These atoms interact coherently with an incident probe and quantized cavity fields. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that SPPs can be excited even in the absence of classical control fields, i.e., when the cavity is in its vacuum state. We also show that the electric-field-enhancement factor increases with the number of cavity photons. Furthermore, we analyze the propagation length and lifetime of the SPPs and observe that both are enhanced as the cavity photon number increases.},

  abstract     = {Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving the QB's performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it leads to decoherence and thus reduces both the lifetime and the charging efficiency of QB. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting both the electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) effect and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Environmental dissipation is significantly inhibited due to the bound state and EIT effects, which extends the lifetime of the QB. We show that the charging efficiency of the QB is optimal when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity. In addition, there is an optimal coupling strength between the two adjacent cavities, which helps to improve the performance of the QB. Our research has achieved the realization of long-term energy storage while improving the charging efficiency of QB, which has practical implications for the realization of QB.},

  abstract     = {A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ( P T ) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the P T -symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum-criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the P T -symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.},

Second-order correlation measurements g ( 2 ) ( τ ) further reveal unanticipated phenomena in the observed cavity emission such as (1) damped oscillations at two frequencies and (2) significantly distinct g ( 2 ) ( τ ) for different polarization components. The intricate relation between cavity-emission intensity, drive-laser detuning, and atom-cavity detunings is explained. A possible mechanism for the damped oscillations with two frequency components in g ( 2 ) ( τ ) is suggested. Measurements show the existence of two separate polarization-decoupled mechanisms with distinct photon statistics, through which energy is transferred from the drive field to the cavity field. The statistical properties and mechanisms underlying cavity emission present valuable insights for extending nondestructive detection techniques to the regime of collective strong coupling.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical quantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric media of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, such as the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach.},

When the impurity velocity is much lower than the thermal velocity of the gas atoms, the relaxation time τ is governed entirely by the self-energy evaluated at zero momentum and zero frequency, Σ ( p = 0 ; ω = 0 ) . Furthermore, via virial expansion theory, τ admits a systematic expansion in powers of the fugacity z ≡ e β μ .

Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double- (triple)-minima, treelike (parquetlike), and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.},

In this article we examine multibody fragmentation of formic acid dications, produced by ultrashort intense laser pulses, using coincidence momentum imaging and deuterium tagging to distinguish the hydrogen sites. Our measurements indicate that double hydrogen elimination leads to three- and four-body breakup, specifically H + D + CO 2 2 + and H + D + O + + CO + , respectively. We find that the latter breakup channel also proceeds via the CO 2 2 + metastable dication, but with shorter lifetimes than the CO 2 2 + dications detected intact. This intriguing sequential breakup is identified using native frames analysis and simulations to confirm the signature of this process in spite of the inferior momentum resolution associated with breakup channels for which not all fragments are detected. In addition to the fragmentation channel above, we found no evidence of sequential breakup for single hydrogen elimination, H + CO + + OD + . The elimination of three atoms, H + D + O + C + + O + , shows evidence of both concerted fragmentation and sequential breakup via metastable intermediate CO 2 + ions. Measuring the dissociation dynamics of these highly excited molecular ions yields information that can be used to test theoretical approaches to these challenging few-body systems.},

  abstract     = {The transition dipole moments between different energy bands of a crystal determine the optical properties of the solid and the light-induced electron-hole dynamics. Solid-state high-harmonic generation encodes all the information about the dipole in momentum space, making it a promising approach for reconstructing the momentum-space dipole. In this work, we develop a machine-learning framework, based on a one-dimensional semiconductor Bloch equation combined with the strong-field approximation in a single-electron picture, to reconstruct semiconductor dipoles from solid-state high-harmonic spectra. As long as the assumptions of the underlying model are satisfied, the proposed approach is robust against variations in the laser parameters, band dispersion, and hidden errors in the input data. We also discuss the potential influence of the approximations employed on the reconstruction accuracy. This method provides an alternative pathway for extracting dipole information from high-harmonic spectra.},

By diagnosing the Newton diagrams, Dalitz plots, and kinetic-energy correlation maps, one concerted pathway and two sequential dissociation pathways are identified in both channels. Native frame analysis enables reconstruction of the branching ratios for these pathways. While the behaviors of the concerted pathway and the sequential pathway involving initial H + emission are comparable in both systems, the sequential pathway with H + emission in the second step exhibits distinct dynamics, with a higher relative branching ratio for ( NH 3 ) 2 . These differences arise from the stronger hydrogen bonds in ( H 2 O ) 2 promoting proton transfer and the weaker hydrogen bonds in ( NH 3 ) 2 favoring hydrogen bond breaking.

The reaction timescale is determined by introducing a time-delayed 800-nm femtosecond probe pulse, yielding a characteristic time of approximately 0.95 ps.

The convergence of QED perturbative expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections. This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects. As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision with only a few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime.

In the original framework of evolution symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales using the factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences developed in the context of NMR, including the classical Lee-Goldburg protocol, and further produces novel short and robust sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions, and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.},

However, the practical realization of k -uniform states, at scale, faces major obstacles: Verifying k uniformity is as difficult as measuring code distances, and devising fault-tolerant logical preparation protocols further adds to the complexity. To address these challenges, we present a scalable fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded k -uniform states and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine k uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded k -uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of k -uniform states.},

  abstract     = {Graph kernels are essential for learning the properties of graph data, a fundamental task in the analysis of such data. However, a major limitation of current graph kernel methods is their high computational cost, which becomes prohibitive when dealing with large-scale graphs. In order to address this bottleneck, we propose a quantum algorithm designed to analyze the intrinsic structural information within graph data through an efficient quantum kernel method. The core idea of our kernel method involves encoding pertinent information from graphs into quantum states, utilizing quantum kernel functions to represent the similarities among various graphs. This process is facilitated through the application of quantum walks and quantum signal processing techniques. Building upon this framework, we propose a quantum kernel ridge regression algorithm that consists of two key steps. First, we employ our quantum kernel method to prepare a quantum state, in which the amplitudes encode the kernel functions. Second, we implement quantum feature mapping in parallel to encode the corresponding kernel matrix into the quantum circuit. Crucially, we demonstrate that the computational complexity of our regression algorithm scales primarily as O ( M 3 / 2 ) with respect to the size of the graph set M . This suggests that our quantum kernel method could process graph data with resource requirements scaling approximately as O ( poly log ( N ) ) , where N denotes the number of nodes in the graph. Accordingly, this underscores the advantage of our approach over classical methods in the context of large-scale graph analysis. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical experiments on chemical molecular datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and advantages. In summary, this work represents a significant advancement in quantum graph learning, enhancing its potential for analyzing large-scale graph data.},

While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in nonequilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We employ the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the nonequilibrium dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our analysis reveals that nonequilibrium conditions, namely, the temperature difference and chemical potential difference, can significantly enhance the teleportation fidelity beyond what is achievable in equilibrium scenarios. Notably, under certain nonequilibrium conditions, the fidelities for all input states converge to the same value. We term this behavior the teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Importantly, at this fixed point, fidelity can be further enhanced by tuning the nonequilibrium parameters. These findings offer crucial insights for the implementation of quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, demonstrating that nonequilibrium conditions not only improve the fidelity but also present a promising avenue for simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.},

  abstract     = {The short Doppler-limited coherence time of the laser-excited Rydberg state, usually orders of magnitude shorter than the lifetime of the Rydberg state, hinders the Rydberg-mediated quantum technologies. Here, we show that a 649–658-nm two-photon excitation of the 6 s n g G 4 1 Rydberg state from a long-lived d -orbital clock state of barium can be achieved with a two-photon wave vector that is tiny, which effectively removes the Doppler-limited decoherence. Moreover, the 6 s n g G 4 1 Rydberg state has strong dipole-dipole interaction due to small Förster defect with nearby Rydberg states and possesses long radiative lifetime. These can benefit quantum computing based on individually trapped neutral atoms and can enable long-lived Rydberg polaritons in atomic media, which brings fresh opportunities in all-optical quantum information.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) appear as nonanalyticities during the coherent evolution of closed systems. However, understanding the scaling behaviors in realistic finite-size systems is intricate and requires a framework beyond thermalized equilibrium analogies. We propose a general dynamical quantum finite-size scaling theory and demonstrate its validity using numerical and analytical approaches in a spin chain. Combining fidelity and renormalization group, we identify the scaling behavior of the transverse magnetization that simultaneously exhibits quantum coherence and statistical properties. In addition, we adapt generalized correlation functions in quantum chemistry protocols to visualize the effective light cone of quantum mutual information, demonstrating the importance of the coherence propagation to DQPTs. Our work provides a phenomenological insight and a quantitative analysis to the underlying microscopic entanglement evolution, offering an alternative interpretation of DQPTs and advancing the understanding of many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily as a function of the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator ), whose energy barrier can be continuously increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a steplike decrease termed the “staircase.” The view challenged by the experimental staircase demands a deep review of our understanding of the role of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we use a Lindbladian model of dissipation to derive a semianalytical formula for the switching rate, resolving a continuous transition between tunneling-dominated dynamics and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat part and the steep part of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: the dephasing of interwell superpositions freezes tunneling via the quantum Zeno effect, and the decay from one excited state to another limits the time during which tunneling can be attempted. This physical understanding allows us to pinpoint the critical drive amplitude that separates the flat and steep part of each step using an equation involving the rates of the two dissipative processes and the tunnel splitting. In addition, analyzing the transition matrix elements in the formula shows that in the regime of a few ( ≲ 10 ) states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, we find that the perturbation induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian part of the Lindbladian model becomes increasingly important and facilitates a form of quantum heating that has not been identified before. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.},

Beyond the foundational significance, the problem of bounding nonlocal correlations by reasonable physical principles has meaningful practical consequences, particularly for device-independent (DI) cryptographic security. In this work, we advance in this direction, demonstrating that the IC is enough to ensure DI security on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security is proven for a range of theoretically quantum-attainable parameters against individual attacks by a potentially postquantum eavesdropper. This result follows as a consequence of a strong form of monogamy of Bell's inequality violations, which we prove to be implied by the recently proposed multipartite formulation for IC . Additionally, we demonstrate that the original bipartite formulation of IC fails to imply monogamy relations, and hence, ensure security of DIQKD, thus stressing the necessity of the multipartite framework.},

In a circular illumination geometry, this mechanism leads to the complete phase separation of the system into transient branching patterns, providing experimental evidence of finite wavelength selection through a motility-induced phase separation mechanism. The finite wavelength selection is a consequence of a vision-based interaction length scale which is fixed by the illumination geometry. A simple drift-diffusion framework allows us to understand how the wavelength depends on global cell density, light intensity, and medium viscosity. Finally, we show that this active phase separation shields individual cells from the deleterious effects of high light intensity, demonstrating that phototaxis can efficiently contribute to photoprotection through collective behaviors on short timescales.},

To derive the dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution, we consider a minimal ternary emulsion with one active reaction, leading to one conserved quantity. Even for cases where single droplets constantly grow, coupling many droplets via the conserved density in the far field leads to a self-organized reversal of ripening and, thus, a monodisperse emulsion. For late times, we find a scaling ansatz leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions, different from the LSW theory. This scaling behavior arises from a stable fixed point in the single droplet dynamics and may capture the late-time behavior of many active matter systems exhibiting reversed ripening.},

  abstract     = {Accurately quantifying the energy loss rate of proton beams in liquid water is crucial for the precise application and improvement of proton therapy, whereas the slowing down of protons in water ices also plays an important role in astrophysics. However, precisely determining the electronic stopping power, particularly for the liquid phase, has been elusive so far. Experimental techniques are difficult to apply to volatile liquids, and the availability of sufficient reliable measurements has been limited to the solid and vapor phases. The accuracy of current models is typically limited to proton energies just above the energy loss maximum, making it difficult to predict radiation effects at an energy range of special relevance. We elucidate the phase differences in proton energy loss in water in a wide energy range ( 0.001 − 10 MeV ) by means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory combined with the Penn method. This nonperturbative model, more computationally efficient than current approaches, describes the phase effects in water in excellent agreement with available experimental data, revealing clear deviations around the maximum of the stopping power curve and below. As an important outcome, our calculations reveal that proton stopping quantities of liquid water and amorphous ice are identical, in agreement with recent similar observations for low-energy electrons, pointing out this equivalence for all charged particles. This could help to overcome the limitation in obtaining reliable experimental information for the biologically relevant liquid water target.},

In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.},

We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is α > 3 / 2 regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains Lévy diffusion for α < 3 / 2 , which implies that the condition is optimal.

Symmetry breaking within the nanocavity ensures precise control of emission interference, yielding a record-high directivity exceeding 15 dB.

  abstract     = {Understanding nonequilibrium electron-phonon interactions at the microscopic level and on ultrafast timescales is a central goal of modern condensed matter physics. Combining time- and angle-resolved extreme ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy with constrained density functional perturbation theory, we demonstrate that photoexcited carrier density can serve as a tuning knob to enhance electron-phonon interactions in nonequilibrium conditions. Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2 H − MoTe 2 reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase. Through theoretical analysis of photoinduced electron and phonon energy and linewidth renormalizations, we attribute these transient features to nonequilibrium modifications of electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. This Letter advances our understanding of microscopic coupling mechanisms enabling control over relaxation pathways in driven solids.},

  abstract     = {The generation of pure spin currents is critical for low-dissipation spintronic applications, yet existing methods relying on spin-orbit coupling or ferromagnetic interfaces face challenges in material compatibility and operational robustness. We propose a paradigm-shifting approach to generate symmetry-protected pure spin currents by applying mechanical stress on insulating antiferromagnetic materials, i.e., the pure piezospintronic effect. We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr 2 O 3 , and NaMn X ( X = As , Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect. Our study not only provides a first-principles approach for investigating spin dipole moment related phenomena (e.g., ferrotoroidicity, fractional quantum spin dipole moment, piezospintronics), but also provides promising piezospintronic materials for experimental verification and industrial applications.},

  abstract     = {Many magnetic materials are predicted to exhibit bosonic topological edge modes in their excitation spectra, because of the nontrivial topology of their magnon, triplon, or other quasiparticle band structures. However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the noninteracting quasiparticle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the noninteracting quasiparticle theory breaks down; we discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.},

We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced “shadows” of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a rotonlike excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.},

  abstract     = {Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the “intrinsic” sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find that the positivity of higher Gauss sums is a necessary condition for a two-dimensional bosonic topological order to be realized by a stoquastic Hamiltonian, and hence “sign-problem-free.” Equivalently, a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, the gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulation may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.},

In this Letter, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the trilayer nickelate superconductor La 4 Ni 3 O 10 at ambient pressure. We reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of La 4 Ni 3 O 10 in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by an electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund’s coupling. The resultant waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate superconductors. However, at low-energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates and other correlated 3 d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron correlation in the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.},

  abstract     = {Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moiré system for exploring correlated topological states emerging from high Chern bands. Motivated by recent experimental observations of anomalous Hall effects at fractional fillings of magic-angle helical trilayers, we focus on the higher Chern number | C band | = 2 band and explore gapped many-body Hall states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. Through extensive exact diagonalization, we predict novel phases unattainable in a single | C band | = 1 band. At filling ν = 2 / 3 and ν = 1 / 3 , a 3 × 3 charge-ordered quantum Hall crystal and a Halperin fractional Chern insulator with Hall conductance | σ H | = 2 e 2 / 3 h are predicted, respectively, indicating strong particle-hole asymmetry of the system. At half-filling ν = 1 / 2 , an extensively degenerate pseudospin Hall ferromagnet featuring emergent SU(2) symmetry is found without the band being flat. Inspired by striking robustness of the ferromagnetic degeneracy, we develop a method to unveil and quantify the emergent symmetry via pseudospin operator construction in the presence of band dispersion and Coulomb interaction and demonstrate persistence of the SU(2) quantum numbers even far away from the chiral limit. Incorporating spin-valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime ν total = 3 + ν for realizing the above states. Notably, interflavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic sublattice corrugation parameter regimes.},

By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millhenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.},

Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. High resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr L 3 -edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the a and b directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.},

However, perpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where the control of the drop’s motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we show that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop’s hovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from less than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical harmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with high-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop’s motion is locked onto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled linear spring model, accounting for the drop’s deformation, that predicts bouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope of bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for precision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.},

Photonic orbital angular momentum (OAM) provides a high-dimensional degree of freedom in classical and quantum information processing. However, integrated OAM-based information technology is an open challenge, because OAM modes are always generated in pairs with opposite topological charges due to their degeneracy. Here, we observe locking of the OAM and linear momentum of light by using a chiral optical waveguide with an Archimedean cross section to induce the orbit-orbit interaction. This OAM-momentum locking enables the deterministic and robust generation of on-demand OAM vortex light beam in a photonic chip. This new correlation paves the way toward exotic high-dimensional chiral physical effects and also provides the capability of on-chip manipulation of light in high-dimensional space.},

  abstract     = {We predict collective free-space lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator. At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge toward a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.},

  abstract     = {The optical clock states of alkaline earth and alkaline earthlike atoms are the fundament of state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks is the magic trapping conditions where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in Sr 88 , realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state S 0 1 , and the two metastable clock states P 0 3 and P 2 3 . We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. At the magic angle, we probe the coherence achievable in magic-angle-tuned traps and find atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 715(30) ms. Our work opens several new directions, including qutrit-based quantum metrology on optical transitions and high-fidelity and high-coherence manipulation on the Sr 88 fine-structure qubit.},

A new setup composed of two Δ E − E telescopes has been used. High-purity radioactive beams of the isotopes of interest were provided by the IGISOL facility using the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap. The resulting beta spectra have been compared with model predictions using beta decay feedings from total absorption gamma spectroscopy measurements and shape corrections employed in the calculation of the antineutrino spectrum, corroborating both further. The procedure can be extended to other relevant nuclei in the future, providing solid ground for the prediction of the antineutrino spectrum in reactors.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of pure neutron matter is necessary for interpreting multimessenger observations of neutron stars. Reliable data analyses of these observations require well-quantified uncertainties for the EOS input, ideally propagating uncertainties from nuclear interactions directly to the EOS. This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively larger number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem for each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron matter EOS, but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ parametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include estimates of the effective field theory truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust uncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses. This Letter will enable novel applications such as using astrophysical observations to put constraints on coupling constants for nuclear interactions.},

  abstract     = {A stringent test of C P symmetry in hyperon decays is performed using 1.0 × 10 10 J / ψ events and 2.7 × 10 9 ψ ( 3686 ) events collected by the BESIII experiment. The C P asymmetry in the two-body nonleptonic weak decays Σ + → p π 0 and Σ ¯ − → p ¯ π 0 is determined to be A C P = − 0.0118 ± 0.0083 ( stat ) ± 0.0028 ( syst ) , consistent with C P conservation. The average decay parameter ⟨ α 0 ⟩ = − 0.9869 ± 0.0011 ( stat ) ± 0.0016 ( syst ) represents the most precise measurement in the baryon sector to date. A model-independent analysis of the hyperon polarization is performed for the first time at J / ψ and ψ ( 3686 ) resonances, revealing a clear sign reversal and offering new insight into SU(3) symmetry breaking and baryon internal structure. These results provide the most stringent constraints on C P violation in Σ decays and establish a benchmark for future precision studies.},

We performed long-term ( ≈ 15 orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the f mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasicircular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The f -mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of ≳ 6.3 % in the linear regime and much more as ∼ 33 % during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of ≲ 40 rad is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.},

  abstract     = {Classically, the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed—either A before B or B before A . This is no longer true in quantum theory, where it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. Optical realizations of the quantum switch have been successfully implemented in experiments, but some argue that this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order between operationally defined events that defines a meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented on an optical bench and the gravitational quantum switch, a gedanken experiment where the indefinite causal order is achieved by a quantum superposition of gravitational fields. Therefore, our results support the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart, which makes use of the quantum mechanical behavior of spacetime.},

To analyse these scenarios, we show how semidefinite programming relaxations for noncommutative polynomial optimization can be used to bound the set of quantum correlations under restrictions on the photon-number distribution. The practicality of this method is demonstrated by computing optimal performance bounds on several well-known communication tasks. We then apply the method to the certification of semi-device-inpependent random number generation protocols and show how to bound the conditional Shannon entropy.

The ultimate limit has been well established, but in general, a noiseless and controllable ancilla is required for attaining it. Little is known about the metrological performance without noiseless ancillae, which is more relevant in practical circumstances. In this Letter, we present a novel theoretical framework to address this problem, bridging quantum metrology and the asymptotic theory of quantum channels. Leveraging this framework, we prove sufficient conditions for achieving the Heisenberg limit with repeated applications of the channel to be estimated both with and without applying interleaved unitary control operations. For the latter case, we design an algorithm to identify the control operation explicitly.},

The approach is applicable to a broad class of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.},

  abstract     = {The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation, and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrow band parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom-heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feedforward conditional phase shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to 510 counts / s , with an associated detection rate of 0.32 counts / s and measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead time of 100 μ s . We take advantage of temporal multiplexing to increase the entanglement rates by a factor of 15 with respect to single mode storage, reaching a value of 22 counts / s per heralding detector. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.},

A superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is used to read out the charge state of an electron trap defined by gate electrodes beneath the helium surface. Dispersive frequency shifts are observed as the trap is loaded with electrons, from several tens down to single electrons. These frequency shifts are in good agreement with our theoretical model that treats each electron as a classical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. This sensitive charge readout scheme can aid efforts to develop large-scale quantum processors that require the high cooling powers available in cryostats operating above 1 K.},

From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled probabilistic bits, and the energy-minimization algorithm. Regarding the energy-minimization algorithm in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, the planted Ising problem, and the traveling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS-based PIM that is able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the codesign of any hybrid analog-digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.},

Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton ( )-chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. The relevant reactions of solar and stellar hydrogen burning are reviewed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities.
