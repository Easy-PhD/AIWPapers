  abstract     = {We present a surface plasmon resonance scheme for the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) employing vacuum-induced transparency. The system under consideration consists of a metal-dielectric interface placed within an optical cavity, where the dielectric medium is composed of three-level atoms in a Λ -type configuration. These atoms interact coherently with an incident probe and quantized cavity fields. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that SPPs can be excited even in the absence of classical control fields, i.e., when the cavity is in its vacuum state. We also show that the electric-field-enhancement factor increases with the number of cavity photons. Furthermore, we analyze the propagation length and lifetime of the SPPs and observe that both are enhanced as the cavity photon number increases.},

  abstract     = {Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving the QB's performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it leads to decoherence and thus reduces both the lifetime and the charging efficiency of QB. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting both the electromagnetically-induced-transparency (EIT) effect and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Environmental dissipation is significantly inhibited due to the bound state and EIT effects, which extends the lifetime of the QB. We show that the charging efficiency of the QB is optimal when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity. In addition, there is an optimal coupling strength between the two adjacent cavities, which helps to improve the performance of the QB. Our research has achieved the realization of long-term energy storage while improving the charging efficiency of QB, which has practical implications for the realization of QB.},

  abstract     = {A natural extension of the non-Hermitian qubit is to place it in a single-mode cavity. This setup corresponds to the quantum Rabi model (QRM) with a purely imaginary bias on the qubit, exhibiting parity-time ( P T ) symmetry. In this work, we first solve the P T -symmetric QRM using the Bogoliubov operator approach. We derive the transcendental function responsible for the exact solution, which can also be used to precisely identify exceptional points. The adiabatic approximation previously used can be easily formulated within this approach by considering transitions between the same manifolds in the space of Bogoliubov operators. By further considering transitions between the nearest-neighboring manifolds, we can analytically obtain more accurate eigensolutions. Moreover, these simple corrections can capture the main features of the dynamics, where the adiabatic approximation fails. Furthermore, the rich characteristics of the vacuum Rabi splitting in the emission spectrum are predicted. The width of the peaks increases with the coupling strength and the imaginary biases, reflecting the nature of open quantum systems. Additionally, we identify a quantum-criticality-enhanced effect by calculating the quantum Fisher information. Near the exceptional points, the quantum Fisher information in the P T -symmetric QRM is significantly higher than that of the non-Hermitian qubit component. This may open a new avenue for enhancing quantum sensitivity in non-Hermitian systems by incorporating coupling with an additional degree of freedom, enabling more precise parameter estimation.},

Second-order correlation measurements g ( 2 ) ( τ ) further reveal unanticipated phenomena in the observed cavity emission such as (1) damped oscillations at two frequencies and (2) significantly distinct g ( 2 ) ( τ ) for different polarization components. The intricate relation between cavity-emission intensity, drive-laser detuning, and atom-cavity detunings is explained. A possible mechanism for the damped oscillations with two frequency components in g ( 2 ) ( τ ) is suggested. Measurements show the existence of two separate polarization-decoupled mechanisms with distinct photon statistics, through which energy is transferred from the drive field to the cavity field. The statistical properties and mechanisms underlying cavity emission present valuable insights for extending nondestructive detection techniques to the regime of collective strong coupling.},

  abstract     = {This article presents a comprehensive three-dimensional canonical quantization to treat quantum plasmonics for finite metallic or dielectric media of arbitrary shape. We use a microscopic model for the dissipative and dispersive medium coupled with the electromagnetic field, which is justified by the fact that if one integrates the degrees of freedom of the medium, one obtains the macroscopic Maxwell equations. Its quantization features a Hamiltonian formulation having the form of two infinite harmonic oscillators characterized by a double continuum. The diagonalized Hamiltonian is quantized by the correspondence principle, introducing creation-annihilation operators in a bosonic Fock space. The diagonal quantum Hamiltonian is the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua. The physical observables, such as the electric field, are also the sum of two terms corresponding to the two continua, one of which had been omitted in the literature geared for an infinite bulk medium. In a second step, we show that the electric field operator can by written as linear combinations of the creation-annihilation operators with coefficients that satisfy integral equations of Fredholm type. We show that the solution of these equations can be expressed in terms of the classical Green tensor of the medium satisfying the Sommerfeld radiation condition. Finally, we consider the Purcell effect for the spontaneous emission of an atom close to the medium. We show that through an exact compensation of some terms, the Purcell factor for the system with the double continuum is proportional to the imaginary part of the Green tensor, which defines the local density of states. This result has the same form as the one obtained in the literature for bulk systems that involve a single continuum and a small dissipative background extending to infinity, and can be seen as a justification of this approach.},

When the impurity velocity is much lower than the thermal velocity of the gas atoms, the relaxation time τ is governed entirely by the self-energy evaluated at zero momentum and zero frequency, Σ ( p = 0 ; ω = 0 ) . Furthermore, via virial expansion theory, τ admits a systematic expansion in powers of the fugacity z ≡ e β μ .

Interestingly, the localization is mutually induced by both components for the quasiperiodic confinement, whereas for a harmonic trap the localization is induced in the potential-free component by interaction with that confined in the potential. Further, we explore the condensate dynamics by implementing a periodic driving of the Rabi frequency, where various frequency-dependent delocalization patterns, such as double- (triple)-minima, treelike (parquetlike), and frozen distributions with a correlated propagation of different spin populations are observed in the condensate density. These features pave the way to control the condensate mass and spin density patterns, both in the stationary and dynamical realizations.},

In this article we examine multibody fragmentation of formic acid dications, produced by ultrashort intense laser pulses, using coincidence momentum imaging and deuterium tagging to distinguish the hydrogen sites. Our measurements indicate that double hydrogen elimination leads to three- and four-body breakup, specifically H + D + CO 2 2 + and H + D + O + + CO + , respectively. We find that the latter breakup channel also proceeds via the CO 2 2 + metastable dication, but with shorter lifetimes than the CO 2 2 + dications detected intact. This intriguing sequential breakup is identified using native frames analysis and simulations to confirm the signature of this process in spite of the inferior momentum resolution associated with breakup channels for which not all fragments are detected. In addition to the fragmentation channel above, we found no evidence of sequential breakup for single hydrogen elimination, H + CO + + OD + . The elimination of three atoms, H + D + O + C + + O + , shows evidence of both concerted fragmentation and sequential breakup via metastable intermediate CO 2 + ions. Measuring the dissociation dynamics of these highly excited molecular ions yields information that can be used to test theoretical approaches to these challenging few-body systems.},

  abstract     = {The transition dipole moments between different energy bands of a crystal determine the optical properties of the solid and the light-induced electron-hole dynamics. Solid-state high-harmonic generation encodes all the information about the dipole in momentum space, making it a promising approach for reconstructing the momentum-space dipole. In this work, we develop a machine-learning framework, based on a one-dimensional semiconductor Bloch equation combined with the strong-field approximation in a single-electron picture, to reconstruct semiconductor dipoles from solid-state high-harmonic spectra. As long as the assumptions of the underlying model are satisfied, the proposed approach is robust against variations in the laser parameters, band dispersion, and hidden errors in the input data. We also discuss the potential influence of the approximations employed on the reconstruction accuracy. This method provides an alternative pathway for extracting dipole information from high-harmonic spectra.},

By diagnosing the Newton diagrams, Dalitz plots, and kinetic-energy correlation maps, one concerted pathway and two sequential dissociation pathways are identified in both channels. Native frame analysis enables reconstruction of the branching ratios for these pathways. While the behaviors of the concerted pathway and the sequential pathway involving initial H + emission are comparable in both systems, the sequential pathway with H + emission in the second step exhibits distinct dynamics, with a higher relative branching ratio for ( NH 3 ) 2 . These differences arise from the stronger hydrogen bonds in ( H 2 O ) 2 promoting proton transfer and the weaker hydrogen bonds in ( NH 3 ) 2 favoring hydrogen bond breaking.

The reaction timescale is determined by introducing a time-delayed 800-nm femtosecond probe pulse, yielding a characteristic time of approximately 0.95 ps.

The convergence of QED perturbative expansion is improved by using the extended Furry picture, which starts from the Dirac equation with a local screening potential. An ab initio treatment is accomplished for one- and two-photon electron-structure QED effects and the one-photon screening of the self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections. This is complemented with an approximate treatment of the two-photon QED screening and higher-order (three or more photon) electron-structure effects. As a result, the obtained theoretical predictions improve upon the accuracy achieved in previous calculations. Comparison with available experimental data shows a good agreement between theory and experiment. In most cases, the theoretical values surpass the experimental results in precision with only a few exceptions. In the case of uranium and bismuth, the comparison provides one of the most stringent tests of bound-state QED in the strong-field regime.

In the original framework of evolution symmetrization, a DD sequence was shown to enforce a symmetry on the unwanted Hamiltonian, thereby suppressing it if the symmetry was inaccessible. In this work, we show how symmetries already present in the undesired Hamiltonian can be harnessed to reduce the complexity of decoupling sequences and to construct nested protocols that correct dominant errors at shorter timescales using the factorization of DD symmetry groups into a product of its subgroups. We provide many relevant examples in various spin systems, using the Majorana constellation and point-group factorization to identify and exploit symmetries in the interaction Hamiltonian. Our framework recovers tailored pulse sequences developed in the context of NMR, including the classical Lee-Goldburg protocol, and further produces novel short and robust sequences capable of suppressing on-site disorder, dipole-dipole interactions, and more exotic many-body interactions in spin ensembles.},

However, the practical realization of k -uniform states, at scale, faces major obstacles: Verifying k uniformity is as difficult as measuring code distances, and devising fault-tolerant logical preparation protocols further adds to the complexity. To address these challenges, we present a scalable fault-tolerant method for preparing encoded k -uniform states and we illustrate our approach using surface and color codes. We first present a technique to determine k uniformity of stabilizer states directly from their stabilizer tableau. We then identify a family of Clifford circuits that ensures both fault tolerance and scalability in preparing these states. Building on the encoded k -uniform states, we introduce a hybrid physical-logical strategy that retains some of the error-protection benefits of logical qubits while lowering the overhead for implementing arbitrary gates compared to fully logical algorithms. We show that this hybrid approach can outperform fully physical implementations for resource-state preparation, as demonstrated by explicit constructions of k -uniform states.},

  abstract     = {Graph kernels are essential for learning the properties of graph data, a fundamental task in the analysis of such data. However, a major limitation of current graph kernel methods is their high computational cost, which becomes prohibitive when dealing with large-scale graphs. In order to address this bottleneck, we propose a quantum algorithm designed to analyze the intrinsic structural information within graph data through an efficient quantum kernel method. The core idea of our kernel method involves encoding pertinent information from graphs into quantum states, utilizing quantum kernel functions to represent the similarities among various graphs. This process is facilitated through the application of quantum walks and quantum signal processing techniques. Building upon this framework, we propose a quantum kernel ridge regression algorithm that consists of two key steps. First, we employ our quantum kernel method to prepare a quantum state, in which the amplitudes encode the kernel functions. Second, we implement quantum feature mapping in parallel to encode the corresponding kernel matrix into the quantum circuit. Crucially, we demonstrate that the computational complexity of our regression algorithm scales primarily as O ( M 3 / 2 ) with respect to the size of the graph set M . This suggests that our quantum kernel method could process graph data with resource requirements scaling approximately as O ( poly log ( N ) ) , where N denotes the number of nodes in the graph. Accordingly, this underscores the advantage of our approach over classical methods in the context of large-scale graph analysis. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical experiments on chemical molecular datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness and advantages. In summary, this work represents a significant advancement in quantum graph learning, enhancing its potential for analyzing large-scale graph data.},

While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in nonequilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We employ the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the nonequilibrium dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our analysis reveals that nonequilibrium conditions, namely, the temperature difference and chemical potential difference, can significantly enhance the teleportation fidelity beyond what is achievable in equilibrium scenarios. Notably, under certain nonequilibrium conditions, the fidelities for all input states converge to the same value. We term this behavior the teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Importantly, at this fixed point, fidelity can be further enhanced by tuning the nonequilibrium parameters. These findings offer crucial insights for the implementation of quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, demonstrating that nonequilibrium conditions not only improve the fidelity but also present a promising avenue for simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.},

  abstract     = {The short Doppler-limited coherence time of the laser-excited Rydberg state, usually orders of magnitude shorter than the lifetime of the Rydberg state, hinders the Rydberg-mediated quantum technologies. Here, we show that a 649–658-nm two-photon excitation of the 6 s n g G 4 1 Rydberg state from a long-lived d -orbital clock state of barium can be achieved with a two-photon wave vector that is tiny, which effectively removes the Doppler-limited decoherence. Moreover, the 6 s n g G 4 1 Rydberg state has strong dipole-dipole interaction due to small Förster defect with nearby Rydberg states and possesses long radiative lifetime. These can benefit quantum computing based on individually trapped neutral atoms and can enable long-lived Rydberg polaritons in atomic media, which brings fresh opportunities in all-optical quantum information.},

  abstract     = {Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) appear as nonanalyticities during the coherent evolution of closed systems. However, understanding the scaling behaviors in realistic finite-size systems is intricate and requires a framework beyond thermalized equilibrium analogies. We propose a general dynamical quantum finite-size scaling theory and demonstrate its validity using numerical and analytical approaches in a spin chain. Combining fidelity and renormalization group, we identify the scaling behavior of the transverse magnetization that simultaneously exhibits quantum coherence and statistical properties. In addition, we adapt generalized correlation functions in quantum chemistry protocols to visualize the effective light cone of quantum mutual information, demonstrating the importance of the coherence propagation to DQPTs. Our work provides a phenomenological insight and a quantitative analysis to the underlying microscopic entanglement evolution, offering an alternative interpretation of DQPTs and advancing the understanding of many-body physics.},

  abstract     = {The spontaneous switching of a quantum particle between the wells of a double-well potential is a phenomenon of general interest to physics and chemistry. It was broadly believed that the switching rate decreases steadily as a function of the size of the energy barrier. This view was challenged by a recent experiment on a driven superconducting Kerr nonlinear oscillator (often called the Kerr-cat qubit or the Kerr parametric oscillator ), whose energy barrier can be continuously increased by ramping up the drive. Remarkably, as the drive amplitude increases, the switching rate exhibits a steplike decrease termed the “staircase.” The view challenged by the experimental staircase demands a deep review of our understanding of the role of quantum effects in double wells. In this work, we use a Lindbladian model of dissipation to derive a semianalytical formula for the switching rate, resolving a continuous transition between tunneling-dominated dynamics and dissipation-dominated dynamics. These two dynamics are observed respectively in the flat part and the steep part of each step in the staircase. Our formula exposes two distinct dissipative processes that limit tunneling: the dephasing of interwell superpositions freezes tunneling via the quantum Zeno effect, and the decay from one excited state to another limits the time during which tunneling can be attempted. This physical understanding allows us to pinpoint the critical drive amplitude that separates the flat and steep part of each step using an equation involving the rates of the two dissipative processes and the tunnel splitting. In addition, analyzing the transition matrix elements in the formula shows that in the regime of a few ( ≲ 10 ) states in the well and under moderate to low temperatures, highly excited states are populated predominantly via cascaded and direct thermal heating rather than quantum heating. At very low temperatures, we find that the perturbation induced by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian part of the Lindbladian model becomes increasingly important and facilitates a form of quantum heating that has not been identified before. We numerically map the activation mechanism as a function of drive amplitude, damping rate, and temperature. Our theory deepens the understanding of switching dynamics between metastable quantum states, highlights the importance of a general interplay between tunneling and dissipation, and identifies a novel quantum regime in activated transitions.},

  abstract     = {The information causality principle ( IC ) was originally proposed as a promising means to understand the extent of quantum nonlocality without invoking the full mathematical formalism of quantum theory. Beyond the foundational significance, the problem of bounding nonlocal correlations by reasonable physical principles has meaningful practical consequences, particularly for device-independent (DI) cryptographic security. In this work, we advance in this direction, demonstrating that the IC is enough to ensure DI security on quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. Security is proven for a range of theoretically quantum-attainable parameters against individual attacks by a potentially postquantum eavesdropper. This result follows as a consequence of a strong form of monogamy of Bell's inequality violations, which we prove to be implied by the recently proposed multipartite formulation for IC . Additionally, we demonstrate that the original bipartite formulation of IC fails to imply monogamy relations, and hence, ensure security of DIQKD, thus stressing the necessity of the multipartite framework.},
