  abstract     = {Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae, and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. One such case are malaria parasites gliding through 3D hydrogels, for which we find that the internal correlation time for the stochastic process generating propulsion is similar to the time taken for one helical turn. Motivated by this experimental finding, here we theoretically analyze the case of finite internal correlation time for microorganisms with helical trajectories as chiral active particles with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that, for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. Finally, we provide experimental evidence for this prediction for the case of malaria parasites.},

While nonmotile bacteria partition exclusively into the DEX-rich phase in all conditions tested, we observed that motile bacteria penetrate the soft DEX-PEG interface and partition variably among the two phases. For our model organism Bacillus subtilis , the fraction of motile bacteria in the DEX-rich phase increased from 0.58 to 1 as we increased the DEX composition within the two-phase region. We hypothesized that the chemical affinity between DEX and the bacteria cell wall acts to weakly confine the bacteria within the DEX-rich phase; however, motility can generate sufficient mechanical forces to overcome the soft confinement and propel the bacteria into the PEG-rich phase. Using optical tweezers to drag a bacterium across the DEX-PEG interface, we demonstrate that the overall bacteria partitioning is determined by a competition between the interfacial forces and bacterial propulsive forces. Our measurements are supported by a theoretical model of dilute active rods embedded within a periodic soft confinement potential.},

We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets, which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that nonorientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and it induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply twisted connected ribbons.},

  abstract     = {Activation volume is a crucial concept in mechanochemistry because it describes how the applied mechanical energy facilitates chemical reactions. The activation volume can be determined readily from the load dependence of a chemical reaction based on the stress-assisted thermal activation theory (also known as the Bell model), but it is still very challenging to fully understand what activation volume means physically and how to compute it. Here, by introducing a concept of inherent stress difference ( σ T ) between the initial and transition states, which is associated with the displacement of reacting atoms, a universal formula of activation volume ( Δ V * ) for the interfacial reactions is derived, that is, Δ V * = ( V eff σ T / E ) , where E and V eff refer to the Young’s modulus and the volume influenced by reaction, respectively. This formula implicates that Δ V * is related to the volume change from the initial to transition states. Then, the first-principles calculation was used to confirm the validity of the proposed definition in diverse types of chemical reactions. This Letter provides clear physical insight into how a chemical reaction that is unlikely to occur under thermal conditions is facilitated by mechanical stress, explaining the core principle of mechanochemistry.},

  abstract     = {Stabilizing thermodynamically unstable phases in many-body systems, such as suppressing pathological neuronal synchronization in Parkinson’s disease or maintaining magnetic order across broad temperature ranges, remains a persistent challenge. In traditional approaches, such phases are stabilized through intervening in the dynamics of all system constituents or introducing additional interactions. Here, we offer a hitherto-unexplored alternative, namely, subsystem resetting, whereby intervention in the dynamics of only a part of the system, and that too only occasionally in time, is implemented through resetting its state to a reset configuration. Just playing with a few parameters, e.g., the nature of the reset configuration and the size of the reset subsystem, one achieves a remarkable and robust control over the phase diagram of the bare dynamics. We demonstrate that these universal effects span a wide variety of scenarios, including equilibrium and nonequilibrium, mean-field and non-mean-field dynamics, with and without quenched disorder. Despite the challenges posed by memory effects, we obtain explicit analytical predictions, validated by simulations.},

These algorithms all feature a nonthermal velocity distribution. They are exemplified by the lifted totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (lifted TASEP), a one-dimensional lattice reduction of event-chain Monte Carlo. We analyze its dynamics in terms of a velocity trapping that arises from correlations between the local density and the particle velocities. This allows us to formulate a conjecture for its out-of-equilibrium mixing timescale, and to rationalize its equilibrium superdiffusive timescale. Both scales are faster than for the (unlifted) TASEP. They are further justified by our analysis of the lifted TASEP in terms of many-particle realizations of true self-avoiding random walks. We discuss velocity trapping beyond the case of one-dimensional lattice models and in more than one physical dimensions. Possible applications beyond physics are pointed out.},

Atomic-scale electron energy loss spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy identifies this mode as out-of-plane oxygen vibrations localized at double terminated interface. Crucially, the phonon amplitude in FeTe/FeSe/ is more than twice as large as that in FeTe/ , which can be attributed to higher electron doping that strengthens dipole moments penetrating the FeSe layer, thereby resulting in an enhanced interfacial EPC. Temperature-dependent dynamics further highlight the unique electronic nature of monolayer FeSe in sustaining this robust coupling. These findings provide direct evidence for dipole-mediated interfacial EPC as a critical mechanism of interfacial superconductivity in .},

Here, we demonstrate far-field nonreciprocal thermal Fizeau drag radiation around asymmetric exceptional points (EPs) by drifting electrons in graphene sheets on dielectric periodic nanostructures. First, the generation and evolution mechanisms of symmetric scattering EP pairs have been unveiled in parameter spaces (i.e., w − θ space, w and θ are filling ratio of gratings and incident angle respectively). The EP pairs are connected by bulk Fermi arc along the θ axis whose length can be tuned over the whole angular range by modifying dielectric optical index. Drifting electrons contribute to asymmetrically redistributing EPs with specific angular and spectral positions at low drifting velocities due to Fizeau drag effects. These nonreciprocal behaviors of EPs in angle space have been used to shape magnet-free infrared nonreciprocal emissivity and absorptivity with different numbers of resonant peaks, resulting in more than an order of magnitude increase in wavelength-integrated thermal nonreciprocity. The physics that underpins the synergy between nonreciprocity and EPs offers new insights into areas such as non-Hermitian physics, nonreciprocal optics, and nonreciprocal thermal photonics.},

Here we report the full control over AFM states by voltage pulses in the insulating Co 3 O 4 spinel well below its Néel temperature. We show that the strong linear magnetoelectric effect is fully governed by the orientation of the Néel vector. As a unique feature of Co 3 O 4 , the magnetoelectric energy can easily overcome the weak magnetocrystalline anisotropy; thus, the Néel vector can be manipulated on demand, either rotated smoothly or reversed suddenly, by combined electric and magnetic fields. We achieve the nonvolatile switching within a few tens of nanoseconds between time-reversed AFM states in macroscopic volumes by voltage pulses. These observations render quasicubic antiferromagnets, like Co 3 O 4 , an ideal platform for the ultrafast (picosecond to nanosecond) manipulation of microscopic AFM domains and may pave the way for the realization of AFM spintronic devices.},

  abstract     = {Current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) can electrically switch magnetic films. The thickness of these films is usually limited to a few tenths of nanometers. Toward stable spintronic nanodevices, it is important to explore the upper thickness limit and to identify the associated SOT switching mechanism, if it is different from standard models. Here, we experimentally show that the SOT switching could occur in trilayers with a thickness of ferrimagnetic films up to 200 nm, all at room temperature. The contributions from the Oersted field, bulk SOTs, and thermal activation induced by Joule heating are also discussed. Through performing atomistic spin simulations, we identify the critical role of nucleation and propagation of vertical magnetic solitons along the thickness direction, which could explain such unprecedented SOT switching behaviors in extremely thick ferrimagnets. The revelation of the vertical soliton-assisted SOT switching of the extremely thick ferrimagnets can be used for miniaturizing spintronic devices.},

Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate this behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our Letter shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.},

Here we show that such intriguing chiral phonons can also be induced in nonmagnetic Kagome lattices that lack atomic structural chirality but harbor electronic chirality rooted in the presence of loop current order. This central finding is demonstrated using two types of loop current order, the restricted chiral flux phase characterized by a pure imaginary charge bond order and the more generalized chiral flux phase characterized by a complex charge bond order, as typified in layered ( , Rb, K). At a mechanistic level, the time-reversal symmetry breaking caused by the electronic chirality is shown to pronouncedly influence their vibrational properties through electron-phonon coupling. The electronic chirality in either chiral flux phase is accompanied by a nonzero molecular Berry curvature, which in turn manifests as a nonlocal effective magnetic field of vectorial nature acting on the phonons. Consequently, the double degeneracy at each Brillouin zone corner is lifted, empowering chirality to the phonon modes. This Letter provides an indispensable component toward a more complete understanding of various chiral collective electronic phenomena in such structurally achiral systems.},

Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the simple clean limit of the topological insulator, which is achieved via an impurity resonance inducing additional bands with Chern number 2. Thus, we call this impurity induced phase a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the Dirac semimetal, the tricritical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum that corresponds to a perfectly resonant mass impurity.

Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage.

With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg array quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of nonbipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, “hidden” vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [X. Ran et al. , Hidden orders and phase transitions for the fully packed quantum loop model on the triangular lattice, Commun. Phys. 7 , 207 (2024) ] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of “remnants of fractionalization” at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter—the plaquette loop resonance—and its constituent—the vison field—exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a three-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.},

  abstract     = {A magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor induces the formation of a Shiba state and drives a local quantum phase transition. We generalize this concept to a one-dimensional superconductor with fractionalized excitations, where the dominant instability is superconducting. In this framework, conduction electrons fractionalize into gapless charge and gapped spin excitations. We show that magnetic impurity interacts exclusively with the spin degrees of freedom and induces a quantum phase transition. Furthermore, charge excitations influence dynamical observables, giving rise to the phenomenon we term the “fractionalized Shiba state.” At zero temperature, the tunneling spectrum exhibits universal power-law scaling with an exponent of at half filling, stemming from the gapless charge modes that form a standard Luttinger liquid. Extending this analysis to finite temperatures reveals that the spectral features retain universal behavior at the critical point.},

  abstract     = {Charged defect scattering of electrons plays a critical role in determining a wide range of material properties. However, there is a lack of an accurate method to calculate the scattering, as all the existing methods require assuming a specific distribution for unscreened (i.e., bare) excess charge carried by the defect, which limits their accuracy. Here we develop a first-principles method to determine the bare charge distribution, which thus enables accurate calculations of the scattering. Using this method, we accurately calculate the electron mobility of 2D under the scattering of charged sulfur vacancies and compare with that of charge-neutral oxygen substitutes of sulfur. Interestingly, we find that the charged defect-limited mobility exhibits a strong temperature dependence at low temperature and carrier concentration, in contrast to the neutral defect and the conventional belief that the defect-limited mobility is less sensitive to the temperature. This behavior arises from the free carrier screening of the long-range scattering potential of the charged defect. Our work offers new insights into the transport mechanism, and opens access to accurate calculation, understanding, and prediction of charged defect scattering and a broad range of associated properties.},

Our work proposes and validates a “twist-on-twist” paradigm to realizing unidirectional propagation and robust magic angle at arbitrary directions of the elastic out-of-plane wave. Our elastic metasurface not only exhibits a twisted configuration between the stacked bilayer but also significantly enhances out-of-plane symmetry breaking by further twisting meta-atoms in one constituent layer.

Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a twofold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a nondegenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a threefold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele-type spin-orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our Letter demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices built in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.},

However, even in mechanically exfoliated and hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated samples that are expected to maintain the most intrinsic properties, shallow defect states are still unavoidable. Here, we reported a method for eliminating the defect states in monolayer WSe 2 by coupling it with a c-plane sapphire surface. We found that the defect-relevant photoluminescence peaks at cryogenic temperatures can be completely suppressed in WSe 2 on c-plane sapphire, resulting in intrinsic exciton radiation, prolonged lifetime, and increased diffusion length. Ab initio calculations revealed that the surface of c-plane sapphire is much more active than other planes, where oxygen atoms preferentially transfer to WSe 2 to repair selenium vacancy defects. Our Letter provides a new platform for defect engineering, which will promote the development of high-performance electronic and optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.},

Using a completely harmonic description we show that the hybridization of the local nonphononic vibrational excitations with the waves leads to a low-frequency DOS, in excess to the Debye one, which varies linearly with frequency up to a certain crossover frequency, and then becomes constant. The actual value of the crossover depends of the ratio between the local stresses and the shear modulus. This excess DOS leads to a low-temperature specific heat with an apparent temperature exponent, which is between one and two, as observed experimentally. We discuss how these findings may be utilized for the characterization of glassy materials. We further compare our findings, which only rely on harmonic interactions, with the predictions of other theories, which invoke anharmonic interactions and tunneling for explaining the low-temperature behavior of the specific heat.},

Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress IFCs for arbitrary order . Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the three- and four-IFC tensors by factors of up to while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed IFCs achieve a speedup by nearly 3 orders of magnitude with accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both three- and four-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn, and ).

  abstract     = {We investigate the occurrence of genuine quantum effects and beyond mean-field physics in the balanced and unbalanced open Dicke models with a large yet finite number of atoms . Such driven and dissipative quantum many-body systems have recently been realized in experiments involving ultracold gases inside optical cavities and are known to obey mean-field predictions in the thermodynamic limit . Here we show quantum effects that survive for large but finite , by employing a novel open-system dynamics method that allows us to obtain numerically exact quantum dynamical results for atom numbers up to a mesoscopic . While we find that beyond-mean-field effects vanish quickly with increasing in the balanced Dicke model, we are able to identify parameter regimes in the unbalanced Dicke model that allow genuine quantum effects to persist even for mesoscopic . They manifest themselves in a strong squeezing of the steady state and a modification of the steady-state phase diagram that cannot be seen in a mean-field description. This is due to the fact that the steady-state limit and thermodynamic limit do not commute.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, one for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements—capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments—and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert space of fermions on two sites. The protocol is sample-efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our Letter introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as high-temperature superconductivity.},

We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model does not require postselection and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.},

Our analysis predicts nuclear clock frequencies for various solid-state and trapped ion platforms: , and . We also determine the nuclear transition energy for the bare nucleus to be .

We performed a state-of-the-art lattice QCD calculation by taking into account all sources of systematic errors. A detailed discussion of our lattice calculation, demonstrating that inclusive semileptonic decays can nowadays be studied on the lattice at a phenomenologically relevant level of accuracy, is the subject of a companion paper [A. De Santis et al. , Inclusive semileptonic decays of the meson: A first-principles lattice QCD calculation, Phys. Rev. D 112 , 054503 (2025)]. Here, we focus on the phenomenological implications of our results. Using the current best estimates of the relevant Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements, our theoretical predictions for the decay rate and for the first two lepton-energy moments are in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. We also argue that, while the inclusive channel is not yet competitive with the exclusive channels in the determination, the situation can be significantly improved in the near future.},

Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell -boundary torus wormholes with topology are given by the lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the result.},

This “universality class of the first levels” is realized in the majority of “synthetic” random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.},

One possible source of such ultrahigh-energy particles is the rapid emission of energetic Hawking radiation from a primordial black hole (PBH) near the end of its evaporation lifetime. The mass distribution for PBHs features a power-law tail for small masses; a small subset of PBHs would be undergoing late-stage evaporation today. We find that recent high-energy neutrino events detected by the IceCube and KM3NeT Collaborations, with energies O ( 1 − 10 2 ) PeV , are consistent with event-rate expectations if a significant fraction of the dark matter consists of PBHs.},

COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this Letter, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of − 0.0002 ± 0.0026 cpd / kg / keV in the 1–6 keV and 0.0021 ± 0.0028 cpd / kg / keV in the 2–6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA’s assertion for their observation of annual modulation at 3.7 σ and 2.6 σ , respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-year datasets from both experiments finds values consistent with no modulation at 0.0005 ± 0.0019 cpd / kg / keV in the 1–6 keV and 0.0027 ± 0.0021 cpd / kg / keV in the 2–6 keV energy regions with 4.7 σ and 3.5 σ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.},

Notably, these observations feature a distinctive dark shadow—primarily arising from faint jet emissions—surrounded by a bright photon ring. Anticipated upgrades of the EHT promise substantial improvements in dynamic range, enabling deeper exploration of low-background regions, particularly the inner shadow defined by the lensed equatorial horizon. Our analysis shows that observations of these regions transform supermassive black holes into powerful probes for annihilating dark matter, which is expected to accumulate densely in their vicinity. By analyzing the black hole image morphology and performing electron-positron propagation calculations in realistic plasma backgrounds derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we set stringent constraints on dark matter annihilation, requiring contributions below the astrophysical emission. These constraints, derived from both current EHT observations and projections for future upgraded arrays, exclude a substantial region of previously unexplored parameter space and remain robust against astrophysical uncertainties, including black hole spin and plasma temperature variations.},

Here, we propose an enhanced gravity-sensing protocol for a nanodiamond levitated in a linear ion trap, which improves the sensing sensitivity and further reduces device size. By introducing gravitational acceleration into the vibrational state through transient free fall, we achieve a square-accelerated relative phase accumulation, yielding higher sensitivity than the linear accumulation process. The sensitivity reaches the standard quantum limit for a nanodiamond containing multiple nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) centers. Besides, by using phonon-mediated one-axis twisting dynamics induced by magnetic field gradient to squeeze the initial spin state, the sensitivity can further surpass the standard quantum limit as a scaling law of . To fully assess the protocol performance, we further analyze the effects of decoherence and control errors, which are negligible under experimentally achievable conditions. Specifically, the sensitivity reaches for the nanodiamond containing only one N-V center over a free-fall distance of , while exceeds for 100 N-V centers. Our results will further facilitate research on compact and high-sensitivity gravimeters.},

However, fully harvesting this advantage typically requires complex entangling measurements, which are challenging to implement and scale with the system’s size. In this Letter, we consider a natural quantum information primitive known as a random access code in which the message to be communicated is selected stochastically. We introduce a protocol that leverages high-dimensional entanglement to perform this task perfectly, without requiring quantum interference between particles at the measurement station. We experimentally demonstrate how this unlocks implementation in the high-dimensional regime through an optical setup using eight-dimensional entanglement and multioutcome detection, providing a practical solution for stochastic communication and a robust method for certifying the dimensionality of entanglement in communication experiments.},

We also investigated the enhancement of the incoherent noise due to the impedance-matched cavity and characterized the quantum memory performance, showing a two-way transfer from excited to spin states and back of up to 83%. Finally, we confirmed the quantum nature of our memory by storing nonclassical states of light, i.e., a heralded single photon from a nondegenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, and achieved nonclassical correlations between the heralding and the stored-and-retrieved photon. These results demonstrate that impedance-matched AFC spin-wave quantum memories with on-demand readout can be used for experiments involving the storage of photonic quantum states.

Specifically, we propose a novel technique called nondiagonal density matrix encoding, which leverages the inherent nonunitary dynamics of Lindbladians to encode general linear ODEs into the nondiagonal blocks of density matrices. This framework enables us to design quantum algorithms with both theoretical simplicity and high performance. Combined with the state-of-the-art quantum Lindbladian simulation algorithms, our algorithm can outperform all existing quantum ODE algorithms and achieve near-optimal dependence on all parameters under a plausible input model.

Recently, superradiant self-organized phases for ultracold atomic gases inside a cavity, pumped by a blue detuned optical lattice, have been observed. Here, we explore the formation of quantum many-body phases of bosonic atoms inside an optical cavity, subject to transverse blue detuned pumping. We investigate the strongly interacting regime, which can be reached by tuning the -wave scattering length using external fields. We analyze the interplay between superradiant self-organization with superfluid and Mott insulator phases, without the need of including higher lying bands, as the Wannier functions are dynamically linked to the cavity light via backaction. We observe different kinds of structural phase transitions driven by the light inside the cavity and the interplay with atomic collisions. We observe the mode softening at the critical points in the quantum phase transitions which can be measured in future experiments. We obtain our results within a full self-consistent theoretical framework, the light-matter density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), which employs the computation of light dependent Wannier functions for the full quantum optical lattice in combination with DMRG for the atomic dynamics. The methods introduced here can be used to analyze the effects of strong quantum correlations in strongly interacting light-matter systems.},

We demonstrate that, regardless of the connection rules, geometrical loops, constructed by piercing excited plaquettes percolate precisely at the thermal critical point , with critical exponents coinciding with those of the loop representation of the dual 3D Ising model. Further, we construct Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) clusters in a random-cluster representation, showing that they also percolate at , enabling access to all thermal critical exponents. Strikingly, the Binder cumulants of the percolation order parameters for both loops and FK clusters reveal a pseudo-first-order transition.

We observe both positive and negative drag forces, depending on the beating frequency and translational velocity, driven by the dynamic redistribution of APs in response to the object’s motion. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and an analytical model, extendable to a range of slender geometries. Our results illustrate the complex interplay between geometric body changes and the density distribution in active baths, which may also be relevant for microrobotic applications.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in synthetic methods enable designing subunits that self-assemble into structures with precise, finite sizes and well-defined architectures, but yields are frequently suppressed by the formation of off-target metastable structures. Increasing the complexity (the number of distinct subunit types) can inhibit off-target structures, but leads to slower kinetics and higher synthesis costs. Here, we study icosahedral shells formed of programmable triangular subunits as a model system, and identify design principles that produce the highest target yield at the lowest complexity. We use a symmetry-based construction to create a range of design complexities, starting from the maximal symmetry Caspar-Klug assembly up to the fully addressable, zero-symmetry assembly. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the most prominent defects leading to off-target assemblies are disclinations at sites of rotational symmetry. We derive symmetry-based rules for identifying the optimal (lowest complexity, highest symmetry) design that inhibits these disclinations, leading to robust high-fidelity assembly of targets with arbitrarily large, yet precise, finite sizes. The optimal complexity varies nonmonotonically with target size, with “magic” sizes appearing for high-symmetry designs in which symmetry axes do not intersect vertices of the triangular net. The optimal designs at magic sizes require 12 times fewer inequivalent interaction types than the (minimal symmetry) fully addressable construction, which greatly reduces the timescale and experimental cost required to achieve high-fidelity assembly of large targets. This symmetry-based principle for pruning off-target assembly generalizes to diverse architectures with different topologies.},

In a simple shear flow, deformability leads to a nonlinear coupling of strain rate and vorticity, and results in shape oscillations or flow alignment. The final steady state can depend on initial conditions, and we explain this behavior by considering a phase space representation of the dynamics. In Poiseuille flow, particle deformability and nematic elasticity induce banding, where particles near the walls are aligned, and those near the center of the channel oscillate in direction and shape. Our results show that particle deformability can lead to complex behavior even in simple flows, suggesting new microfluidic experiments.},

Moreover, efforts to enhance mechanical performance often lead to increased melt viscosity, which in turn hinders processability. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) breaks this trilemma by simultaneously enhancing strength, toughness, and processability. Through a combined experimental and molecular dynamics simulation approach, we reveal that SCNPs with higher glass transition temperature than the matrix not only increase yield strength but also delay and homogenize crazing, leading to dramatically improved toughness in the glassy state. Importantly, the SCNPs reduce melt viscosity in the molten state, countering the conventional trend of viscosity increase in nanocomposites. This triple enhancement establishes a universal framework for designing high-performance polymer glasses that transcend traditional material property limitations.},

Furthermore, time-resolved x-ray diffuse scattering indicates that THz excitation enhances crystallinity by inducing a nonthermal increase in structural symmetry originating from preexisting defects.

Photoinduced or photoenhanced chirality in 1 T − TiSe 2 has been suggested as a fascinating platform for optical manipulation of chiral states. However, the mechanisms underlying chirality training and its interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) phase remain elusive. Here, we use time-resolved x-ray diffraction (trXRD) with circularly polarized pump lasers to probe the photoinduced dynamics of chirality in 1 T − TiSe 2 . We observe a notable ( ∼ 20 % ) difference in CDW intensity suppression between left and right circularly polarized pumps. Additionally, we reveal momentum-resolved circular dichroism arising from domains of different chirality, providing a direct link between CDW and chirality. An immediate increase in CDW correlation length upon laser pumping is detected, suggesting the photoinduced expansion of chiral domains. These results both advance the potential of light-driven chirality by elucidating the mechanism driving chirality manipulation in TiSe 2 , and they demonstrate that trXRD with circularly polarized pumps is an effective tool for chirality detection in condensed matter systems.},

Here, we have achieved breaking the rotational and mirror symmetries of the three-dimensional DM vectors in a strongly correlated ferromagnet, which were directly measured through the nonreciprocal spin-wave propagations in both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic field geometries. Combining cryogenic magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we discover a bimeron phase that emerges between the spin spiral and skyrmion phases under an applied magnetic field. Such an artificially manipulated DM interaction is shown to play a critical role in the formation and evolution of the large-area bimeron lattice, a phenomenon that could be realized across a broad range of materials. Our findings demonstrate that symmetry engineering of the DM vectors can be practically achieved through epitaxial strain, paving the way for the creation of diverse spin topologies and the exploration of their emergent functionalities.},

We identify the symmetries that allow mixed-parity irreducible representations for commensurate ordering vectors, and hence permit a continuous transition into the IA AFM. The Landau free energy which describes the transition is derived from a general microscopic model, from which we establish conditions favorable to the appearance of the IA AFM: inversion is not a site symmetry of a magnetic ion, and the nesting involves different bands. Moreover, the odd-parity spin splitting is negatively correlated with the stability of the IA AFM. We illustrate our conclusions with specific examples.

  abstract     = {Degeneracy appears ubiquitously in physical systems. Exceptional points, the non-Hermitian degeneracies, have unveiled numerous novel phenomena that have no counterparts in Hermitian degeneracies—diabolic points. Here, we observe a hybrid degenerate point (HP) in a projected non-Hermitian system, namely a subsystem obtained by projecting a metasurface characterized by a Hermitian scattering matrix. In the projected space, the metasurface is found naturally anchored at the merging point of two exceptional curves, each carrying opposite chirality. The HP exhibits a unique topology that encodes features of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian degeneracies, thereby exhibiting linear and square-root sensitivities simultaneously. We conceptually validate and experimentally confirm the projected HP using a passive and lossless acoustic metagrating, uncovering its unique singular behavior: the pronounced anisotropic sensitivity to perturbations. Our findings highlight the potential for exploring degenerate states via the projective Hilbert space and pave the way for extreme wave manipulation in open spaces.},

These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electridelike interstitial states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals.

In this Letter, we introduce a generalized form of Neumann’s principle and demonstrate that both FQFE and conventional ferroelectricity can be consistently described within this unified theoretical framework. We propose a method, based on the generalized Neumann’s principle, for the systematic identification of FQFE materials. This approach is straightforward to apply and offers a clear conceptual understanding and deep physical insight for FQFE. Using this method, we determine all symmetry-allowed FQFE cases across the 32 crystallographic point groups. Since practical applications rely on the ability to control polarization, we further show that FQFE can be effectively switched via coupling with conventional polarization. Using as an illustrative example, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this coupling and outline a strategy to identify other materials with similar switching behavior.},

Here we report the observation of direct photoemission signals from excitons in a ground state of a very recent excitonic insulator candidate Ta 2 Pd 3 Te 5 below its metal-insulator transition temperature using orbital-selective angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the excitons have a lower energy than the valence band maximum to possibly drive the phase transition.

Prominent examples include Willis terms in phononics and bianisotropic terms in photonics. However, the development of analogous cross-couplings in heat conduction remains limited and incomplete; here, we close this knowledge gap. To this end, we introduce an exact and universal homogenization method to capture the macroscopic dynamics of various physical processes in heterogeneous media. For heat conduction and thermodynamics, the method shows that thermal bianisotropy emerges through the intentional design of spatial asymmetry. In certain conditions, the resulting macroscopic description is free from the infinite heat speed paradox inherent in Fourier’s law of conduction. We support the exact theory with examples based on heuristic homogenization of a canonical scattering problem. These results may benefit the design of thermal metamaterials with asymmetric response.},

Our formula shows excellent agreement for experiments for a field-tuned moiré bilayer, and can capture the quantum effects responsible for breaking the one-parameter scaling.

The ordinary Hall effect and the quantum Hall effect, initially discovered in two-dimensional (2D) nonmagnetic systems, are the phenomena that a transverse current is generated when a system carrying an electron current is placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the currents. In this Letter, we propose the electric counterparts of these two Hall effects, termed the “electric Hall effect” (EHE) and the “quantum electric Hall effect” (QEHE). The EHE and QEHE emerge in 2D magnetic systems, where the transverse current is generated by applying an electric gate field instead of a magnetic field. We present a symmetry requirement for both intrinsic EHE and QEHE. Besides, we establish an analytical expression for the intrinsic EHE coefficient when the gate field is weak. We show that it is determined by two band geometric quantities: Berry curvature polarization and Berry curvature polarizability. Via first-principles calculations, we investigate the EHE in the monolayer , where significant EHE coefficient is observed around band crossings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the QEHE can appear in the semiconductor monolayer , of which the Hall conductivity exhibits steps that take on the quantized values 0 and in the unit of by varying the gate field within the experimentally achievable range.

Our theory predicts the existence of a directional frictionless interface, which can further evolve to two kinds of all-direction frictionless interfaces, even when the total flake area is not a multiple of the size of a complete moiré tile. Before reaching the frictionless state, friction scales with flake area via a geometry-dependent proportionality factor that encodes frictionless directions, agreeing with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations for both homogeneous or heterogeneous interfaces. Our theory further paves the way for designing frictionless motions in double-interface nanoconfinement channels.

This effect not only accelerates atomic mobility but also softens the stiffness of the solid-liquid interface, triggering supercollective atomic motion and enabling rapid crystallization.

The unprecedented spectral flatness arises from a novel cavity mechanism of symmetric dispersive wave generation, enabled by opposite group-velocity dispersions—anomalous at the fundamental frequency and normal at the second harmonic—without requiring higher-order dispersion engineering. This mechanism manifests itself as a characteristic long-rippled-wing bright soliton at the second harmonic, thereby generating the ultraflat spectrum. We develop analytical criteria for predicting the radiated frequencies, and show that, under proper control of relative cavity losses, the resulting combs exhibit nearly vanishing ( ) comb-line power variations over a broad spectral range, at variance with platicon microcombs that operate at normal dispersions. Our results offer a pathway to realize octave-spanning, highly efficient, coherent ultraflat combs without needing external phase or intensity modulators, enabling applications such as high-capacity telecommunications, precision metrology, and astrophysical spectrograph calibration.},

Enabled by strong interactions associated with Rydberg blockade, they allow for simulation of complex spin models and quantum dynamics. We introduce a new Floquet engineering technique for systems in the blockade regime that provides control over novel forms of interactions and entanglement dynamics in such systems. Our approach is based on time-dependent control of Rydberg laser detuning and leverages perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as resources for operator spreading. These time-evolved operators are utilized as a basis for engineering interactions in the effective Hamiltonian describing the stroboscopic evolution. As an example, we show how our method can be used to engineer strong spin exchange, consistent with the blockade, in a one-dimensional chain, enabling the exploration of gapless Luttinger liquid phases. In addition, we demonstrate that combining gapless excitations with Rydberg blockade can lead to dynamic generation of large-scale multipartite entanglement. Experimental feasibility and possible generalizations are discussed.},

However, we find that in the weak-source limit and under the assumption of a flat spectrum, the first nonvacuum term in the state expansion does form a mixture of such pulses. This decomposition is essential for quantum-enhanced astronomical interferometry, which typically operates on localized pulses even though stellar light is inherently continuous-wave. We present a quantum derivation of the van Cittert–Zernike theorem that incorporates finite bandwidth, thereby justifying the operations on localized pulses while processing continuous-wave thermal light. For general spectra in the weak-source limit, we establish a criterion under which correlations between pulses can be safely neglected. When this criterion is not met, we provide a corrected strategy that accurately accounts for both the spectral profile and the detector-defined pulse shape.},

Through tuning the atom-photon coupling and by adjusting the number of trapped atoms, we demonstrate superradiant emission to the microring resonator. For photon emission via the nonguided modes, our study reveals signatures of subradiance and superradiance when the system is driven to the steady state and to the timed-Dicke state, respectively. Our experimental platform thus presents the first atom-light interface with selective collective emission behavior into a guided mode and the environment.

Crucially, this differs from prevailing theories based on Landau quasiparticles, which neglect the possibility of quantum degenerate impurities and predict an exchange-induced attraction. We furthermore show that the polaron-polaron interactions are strongly modified if the medium chemical potential rather than the density is held fixed, such that the medium-induced attraction between thermal impurities becomes twice the expected Landau effective interaction. Our work provides a possible explanation for the differing signs of the polaron-polaron interactions observed in experiments across cold atomic gases and two-dimensional semiconductors, and it has important implications for theories of quasiparticles and quantum mixtures in general.},

In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this Letter, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary intercomponent interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms toward the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.},

  abstract     = {Ultrashort laser pulses carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have become essential tools in atomic, molecular, and optical studies, particularly for investigating strong-field light-matter interactions. However, controlling and generating ultrashort vortex pulses presents significant challenges, since their broad spectral content complicates manipulation with conventional optical elements, while the high peak power inherent in short-duration pulses risks damaging optical components. To address these challenges, we demonstrate a “molecular wave plate” as a promising way for generating and controlling broadband ultrashort vortex beams. By exploiting the nonadiabatic alignment of linear gas-phase molecules induced by vector beams, the interaction between the vector beam and the gas-phase molecules results in spatially varying polarizability, imparting a phase modulation to a probe laser. This process effectively creates a tunable molecular wave plate that adapts naturally to a broad spectral range. By leveraging this approach, we can generate ultrashort vortex pulses across a wide range of wavelengths. Under optimized gas pressure and interaction length conditions, this method allows for highly efficient, near unity, conversion of circularly polarized light into the desired OAM pulse, thus enabling the generation of few-cycle, high-intensity vortex beams. This molecular wave plate, which overcomes the limitations imposed by conventional optical elements, opens up new possibilities for exploring strong-field physics, ultrafast science, and other applications that require high-intensity vortex beams.},

  abstract     = {We compute medium corrections to the energy-energy correlator (EEC) for jets in electron-nucleus collisions at leading order in the QCD coupling and the interaction of the jet with the medium. We derive an analytical expression for the modification of the EEC as a function of the opening angle and show that the modification is strongest at large angles within the jet cone. We obtain explicit results for the dependence of the modification on the jet energy, the scattering power of cold nuclear matter, and the path length within the medium. We extend our calculations to gluon jets in proton-nucleus collisions and compare our results with recent preliminary data for proton-lead collisions at the LHC. We also discuss the role of comovers on the EEC in p + Pb collisions.},

  abstract     = {Incoherent photoproduction in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) provides a sensitive probe of localized, fluctuating gluonic structures within heavy nuclei. This Letter reports the first measurement of the photon-nucleon center-of-mass energy ( ) dependence of this process in PbPb UPCs at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV, using of data recorded by the CMS experiment. The measurement covers a wide range of , probing gluons carrying a fraction of nucleon momentum down to an unexplored regime of . Compared to baseline predictions neglecting nuclear effects, the measured cross sections exhibit significantly greater suppression at lower . Additionally, the ratio of incoherent to coherent photoproduction is found to be constant across the probed and range, disfavoring the establishment of the black disk limit. This Letter provides critical insights into the -dependent evolution of fluctuating gluonic structures within nuclei and calls for further advancements in theoretical models incorporating nuclear shadowing and gluon saturation.},

We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next to leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative 𝐶 𝑞 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) and 𝐶 𝑔 ⁡ ( 𝑡 ) are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.},

  abstract     = {Hard-scattered partons ejected from high-energy proton-proton collisions undergo parton shower and hadronization, resulting in collimated collections of particles that are clustered into jets. A substructure observable that highlights the transition between the perturbative and nonperturbative regimes of jet evolution in terms of the angle between two particles is the two-point energy correlator (EEC). In this Letter, the first measurement of the EEC at RHIC is presented, using data taken from 200 GeV collisions by the STAR experiment. The EEC is measured both for all the pairs of particles in jets and separately for pairs with like and opposite electric charges. These measurements demonstrate that the transition between perturbative and nonperturbative effects occurs within an angular region that is consistent with expectations of a universal hadronization regime that scales with jet momentum for a given initiator flavor. Additionally, a deviation from Monte Carlo predictions at small angles in the charge-selected sample could result from mechanics of hadronization not fully captured by current models.},

  abstract     = {Proton and neutron decays into light new particles X can drastically change the experimental signatures and benefit from the complementarity of large water-Cherenkov neutrino detectors such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande and tracking detectors such as JUNO and DUNE. The proton decays p → ℓ + X and p → π + X with m X near phase-space closure lead to charged particles below the Cherenkov threshold, rendering them practically invisible in Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande but not in JUNO and DUNE, which are therefore uniquely positioned for these baryon-number-violating signatures despite their smaller size. As an additional signature, such nucleon decays in the Earth can produce a sizable flux of X particles in underground detectors. We present a simple model in which nucleons decay into sub-GeV sterile neutrinos that subsequently decay through active-sterile neutrino mixing, with a promisingly large number of events in Super-Kamiokande even in the seesaw-motivated parameter space.},

  abstract     = {This Letter reports the first evidence of electroweak production of same-sign boson pairs where at least one of the bosons is longitudinally polarized and the most stringent constraint to date for the production of two longitudinally polarized same-sign bosons. The dataset used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector during run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. The study is performed in final states including two same-sign leptons (electrons or muons), missing transverse momentum, and at least two jets with a large invariant mass and a large rapidity difference. Two independent fits are performed targeting the production of same-sign bosons with at least one, or two longitudinally polarized bosons. The observed (expected) significance of the production with at least one longitudinally polarized boson is 3.3 (4.0) standard deviations. An observed (expected) 95% confidence level upper limit of 0.45 (0.70) fb is reported on the fiducial production cross section of two longitudinally polarized same-sign bosons.},

  abstract     = {Superradiance emerges from collective spontaneous emission in optically pumped gases, and is characterized by photon emission enhancements of up to in an atom system. The gain mechanism derives from correlations developed within the decay medium rather than from stimulated emission as in lasing, so an analog of this process should be possible for fermionic final states. We introduce here the concept of superradiant neutrino emission from a radioactive Bose Einstein condensate, which can form the basis for a superradiant neutrino laser. A plausible experimental realization based on a condensate of electron-capture isotope could exhibit effective radioactive decay rates accelerated from 86.2 days to minutes in viably sized rubidium condensates of atoms.},

  abstract     = {The gravitational-wave signal GW250114 was observed by the two LIGO detectors with a network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 80. The signal was emitted by the coalescence of two black holes with near-equal masses and , and small spins (90% credibility) and negligible eccentricity . Postmerger data excluding the peak region are consistent with the dominant quadrupolar mode of a Kerr black hole and its first overtone. We constrain the modes’ frequencies to of the Kerr spectrum, providing a test of the remnant’s Kerr nature. We also examine Hawking’s area law, also known as the second law of black hole mechanics, which states that the total area of the black hole event horizons cannot decrease with time. A range of analyses that exclude up to five of the strongest merger cycles confirm that the remnant area is larger than the sum of the initial areas to high credibility.},

  abstract     = {Next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors are expected to detect millions of binary black hole mergers during their operation period. A small fraction ( ∼ 0.1 – 1 % ) of them will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies and clusters, producing multiple copies of the GW signals. The expected number of lensed events and the distribution of the time delay between lensed images will depend on the mass distribution of the lenses at different redshifts. Warm dark matter and fuzzy dark matter models predict lower abundances of low-mass dark matter halos as compared to the standard cold dark matter. This will result in a reduction in the number of strongly lensed GW events, especially with small time delays. Using the number of lensed events and the lensing time delay distribution, we will be able to put a lower bound on the mass of the warm and fuzzy dark matter particles from a catalog of lensed GW events. Our first forecasts suggest that the expected bounds from GW strong lensing from next-generation detectors are better than the current constraints.},

However, any such background is expected to be obscured by the astrophysical foreground from compact-binary coalescences. We propose a novel framework to detect a cosmological gravitational-wave background in the presence of binary black holes and binary neutron star signals with next-generation ground-based detectors, including Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. Our procedure involves first removing all the individually resolved binary black hole signals by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Then, we perform joint Bayesian inference on the individually resolved binary neutron star signals, the unresolved binary neutron star foreground, and the cosmological background. For a flat cosmological background, we find that we can claim detection at level when , where is the observation time (in years), which is within a factor of from the sensitivity reached in the absence of these astrophysical foregrounds.},

However, indirect constraints suggest that direct observation of an exploding Schwarzschild black hole at current or upcoming gamma ray observatories is implausible. We introduce a dark-QED toy model consisting of a dark photon and a heavy dark electron. In this scenario a population of light primordial black holes charged under the dark symmetry can become quasiextremal, so they survive much longer than if they were uncharged, before discharging and exhibiting a Schwarzschild-like final explosion. We show that the answer is “yes,” in this scenario the probability of observing an exploding black hole over the next 10 years could potentially be over 90%.},

This Letter explores how resonant axion-plasmon conversion modify the expected radio signals from axion-photon conversions observed on Earth. Critically, the resonant conversion radius lies within the region expected for axion-photon conversion, introducing a nonradiative power loss that diminishes the anticipated photon flux. Our analysis demonstrates that this effect can reduce radio telescope sensitivities, shifting them into regions excluded by previous experiments. These findings compel a reassessment of experimental constraints derived from radio signatures of axion-photon conversions and highlight the necessity of accounting for plasmon effects in astrophysical axion searches. The presented corrections provide critical insights for refining the detection strategies of future telescope-based dark matter axion experiments.},

We validate its effectiveness using the two most common measurement schemes in continuous-variable quantum optics: homodyne detection and double homodyne detection. This rapid estimation framework is well suited for dynamically characterizing sources with time-dependent parameters, potentially enabling real-time feedback stabilization.},

We experimentally validate this scheme using a quantum photonic system. Additionally, we employ iterative interactions to demonstrate that the LOEM strategy can achieve the precision of Heisenberg scaling.

Collective excitations generated via Rydberg blockade in an atomic ensemble—known as Rydberg superatoms—are promising candidates due to collectively enhanced atom-photon coupling and Rydberg-enabled nonlinearity. Here, we experimentally realize remote entanglement between two Rydberg superatoms via single-photon interference. The two setups are separated by 3 m and linked with two 20-m fibers, operated with independent control lasers. We verify that the entanglement generated is free from high-order excitation noise that is a key drawback in the traditional Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller scheme. This Letter paves the way for entangling long-distance separated Rydberg superatoms at a high rate, as the success probability of a single-photon-based entangling scheme scales with the square root of the channel transmittance.},

  abstract     = {Quantum defects in solids have emerged as a transformative platform for advancing quantum technologies. A key requirement for these applications is achieving high-fidelity single-spin readout, particularly at room temperature for quantum biosensing. Here, we demonstrate through ab initio simulations of a primary quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide that strain is an effective control parameter for significantly enhancing readout contrast. We validate this principle experimentally by inducing local strain in silicon carbide-on-insulator membranes, achieving a readout contrast exceeding 60% while preserving the favorable coherence properties of single spins. Our findings establish strain engineering as a powerful strategy for optimizing coherent spin-photon interfaces in PL6 divacancy centers within silicon carbide membranes and potentially other similar defect systems.},

Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level particles and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of correlations, upon accounting for beyond-mean-field effects. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral-atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.},

The steerability of quantum correlations between the two parties is the key resource enabling such an advantage. In designing the task, we exploit the correspondence between steerability and the incompatibility of observables. Our work extraction protocol involves mutually unbiased bases, which exhibit maximum incompatibility and therefore maximum steerability, showcased in maximally entangled quantum states. The work extraction protocols consist of quenches and thermalization processes, which serve as fundamental building blocks for various thermodynamic protocols, such as heat engines. We derive upper bounds on the extractable work for unsteerable and steerable correlations and devise a protocol that saturates the latter. The ratio between the extractable work in steerable and unsteerable scenarios, which encapsulates the quantum advantage, increases with the dimension of the underlying system (sometimes referred to as an unbounded advantage). This proves a quantum thermodynamic advantage arising from steerable quantum correlations.},

While the first mechanism ensures the stability of the subharmonic response throughout the entirety of the prethermal regime, it is restricted to initial states in the ground state manifold of the effective Hamiltonian. By contrast, the second mechanism enables the observation of the prethermal time-crystalline order for arbitrary initial states , albeit with a timescale that is not only determined by the frequency of the drive, but also the relative energy scale across the system’s sublattices. We characterize these two mechanisms by simulating the dynamics of a periodically driven two-dimensional spin model, and discuss natural extensions of our model to all other dimensions.},

We propose and experimentally test a novel scenario involving three jointly tested contextuality correlations constrained by a genuine triplewise monogamy relation. Remarkably, our experimental design reveals the existence of triplewise monogamy without explicitly implementing it. Furthermore, our experimental results demonstrate that any two of the three correlations can exhibit contextuality simultaneously, thereby confirming, for the first time, the genuine feature of the triplewise monogamy. This phenomenon constitutes a nontrivial extension of monogamy relations to multiple correlations. These findings deepen our theoretical understanding and enhance our experimental capabilities in probing the intricate interplay of contextuality correlations, paving the way for future advancements in quantum information science.},

In contrast to the bosonic case, the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables allows us to provide simple expressions for the Glauber , Wigner , and Husimi distributions of the arbitrary state of a single fermionic mode. It appears that all physical states are Gaussian and, thus, can be described by positive or negative thermal distributions (over Grassmann variables). We then prove several fermionic uncertainty relations, including notably the fermionic analogs of the (yet unproven) phase-space majorization and Wigner entropy conjectures for a bosonic mode, as well as the Lieb-Solovej theorem and the Wehrl-Lieb inequality. Our central point is that, although fermionic phase-space distributions are Grassmann-valued and do not have a straightforward interpretation, the corresponding uncertainty measures are expressed as Berezin integrals, which take on real values and are physically relevant.},

Among various measures, the Hurst exponent ( H ) has been used to characterize temporal correlations in neuronal activity. Here, we introduce a method to estimate H directly from binary spike train series and propose that the coefficient of variation (CV) of H , rather than H itself, more accurately reflects neural complexity during organoid maturation. After validating the method on simulated data with embedded short- and long-range correlations, we applied it to cortical organoids derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, recorded via multielectrode arrays over 250 day. The analysis revealed a peak in complexity, as indicated by the CV of H , around the 100th day. At this stage, the organoids exhibited a wide repertoire of dynamic patterns, including both isolated spiking and highly synchronized network events. These results suggest that organoid activity undergoes a structured evolution in complexity and that CV of H provides a robust metric to capture this transition. Our approach offers a scalable tool for quantifying neural complexity in the developing brain.},

Increasing cell stiffness promotes the long-range force transmission and synchronization of collective waves, which exhibit robustness against cell heterogeneity of both size and stiffness.

Instead, we use a simple elastoplastic rheological model with power-law yielding that incorporates a distribution of local strain states. Using insight from the model, we suggest a mechanism for the experimentally observed stress increase to be driven by residual anisotropy in strain states that are relaxed at different rates.

To date, establishing the relevance of these effects to laboratory systems has remained elusive due to the challenge of measuring both normal and frictional contact forces at the particle scale. In this study, we perform experiments on a sheared photoelastic granular system in a quasi-2D annular cell. During these experiments, we measure particle locations, contacts, and normal and frictional forces vectors during loading. We reconstruct the angular distributions of the contact and force vectors, and extract the corresponding emergent anisotropies for each of these metrics. Finally, we show for the first time in an experimental system that the SFF relation quantitatively predicts the relationship between particle scale anisotropies, the stress tensor components, and the bulk friction coefficient, capturing even transient behaviors—closing the gap between experimental measurements and prior theoretical and numerical models.},

  abstract     = {The ability to quantify the directional flow of information is vital to understanding natural systems and designing engineered information-processing systems. A widely used measure to quantify this information flow is the transfer entropy. However, until now, this quantity could only be obtained in dynamical models using approximations that are typically uncontrolled. Here we introduce a computational algorithm called “transfer entropy-path weight sampling” (TE-PWS), which makes it possible, for the first time, to quantify the transfer entropy and its variants exactly for any stochastic model, including those with multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. By leveraging techniques from polymer and path sampling, TE-PWS efficiently computes the transfer entropy as a Monte Carlo average over signal trajectory space. We use our exact technique to demonstrate that commonly used approximate methods to compute transfer entropies incur large systematic errors and high computational costs. As an application, we use TE-PWS in linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of the data processing inequality in the presence of feedback.},

In such networks, residual correlations cross over to a regime that retains macroscopic fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit.

  abstract     = {We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents that optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are nonreciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the suboptimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [ Phys. Rev. Lett. 120 , 208301 (2018) ]. When agents are “boundedly rational,” we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.},

We introduce a stylized model, used in the past to model spatial regularities in voting patterns, that accounts for both spatial and temporal correlations with reasonable values of parameters, some fitted on impulse response data. Our analysis reveals that price shocks are persistent in time and their amplitude is strongly heterogeneous in space.

In the weak-bias regime, the trapped dynamics of the order parameter’s phase lead to an in-gap absorption line at a frequency almost independent of the bias voltage, while, for larger biases, the frequency of the spectral feature increases approximately linearly with bias. In both cases, there is a pronounced second-harmonic response. Close to the transition between the trapped and freely oscillating states, we find a strong response upon application of a weak electric probe field, compare the results to those found in a minimal model description for the dynamics of the order parameter’s phase, and analyze the limitations of the latter.},

Spectral function analysis reveals a substantial energy correction from magnon interactions, indicating that these carrier-rich regions form a strongly bound charge-magnon liquid.

Here, we investigate the competition between charge density wave (CDW) order, gapless composite fermion liquid (CFL), and non-Abelian Moore-Read states at half filling of a moiré band. Although ground-state (quasi)degeneracies and spectral flow are not sufficient for distinguishing between charge order and Moore-Read states, we find evidence using entanglement spectroscopy that both these states of matter can be realized with Coulomb interactions. By further analyzing the graviton excitations of Moore-Read states, we unveil that the ground states exhibit a mixed behavior of Pfaffian and anti-Pfaffian, despite the weak breaking of particle-hole symmetry. In a double twisted bilayer graphene model, transitions between these phases can be driven by the coupling strength between the layers: at weak coupling there is a CFL phase and at strong coupling a CDW order emerges. Remarkably, however, there is compelling evidence for a non-Abelian Moore-Read FCI phase at intermediate coupling.},

Here, we demonstrate on Dirac semimetal films that the field-induced AHE in nonmagnetic systems can be quantitatively probed by applying and rotating the magnetic field within the Hall deflection plane. Measurements on the (112) plane reveal that AHE emerges as a clear threefold symmetric component for the in-plane field rotation.

  abstract     = {Non-Hermitian systems, distinguished by the presence of exceptional points and non-Hermitian topological states, have transformed sensing technologies through the implementation of novel physical mechanisms. However, despite their demonstrated potential, existing non-Hermitian sensors are predominantly limited to static operational configurations, which substantially restricts their effects in detecting time-varying signals. Here, we transcend this limitation by introducing a new sensing framework: non-Hermitian Floquet topological sensors (NHFTSs). This approach harnesses the synergistic interplay among time-periodic driving, nonlinear dynamics, and non-Hermitian topology to enable ultrasensitive detection of dynamic signals. NHFTSs establish nonlinear non-Hermitian Floquet topological zero modes as robust global attractors. These modes manifest extraordinary sensitivity to dynamic boundary perturbations, exhibiting frequency shifts that scale exponentially with system size. Moreover, NHFTSs possess exceptional resilience against both background noise and structural perturbations, a feature enabled by the dual protective mechanisms of nonlinear stability and topological band gaps. Notably, the signal-to-noise ratio of NHFTSs can be exponentially amplified through sensor size scaling. We experimentally validate the NHFTS using time-varying topolectrical circuits, demonstrating their unparalleled capability in detecting dynamic electrical signals with high sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratios. This Letter not only establishes a new paradigm for non-Hermitian dynamical sensing but also paves the way for exploring non-Hermitian topological phenomena in Floquet nonlinear systems, with profound implications for the development of next-generation non-Hermitian sensors and beyond.},

This local spin polarization arises through nonequilibrium processes, where the Landau levels tilt due to the -symmetry breaking induced by crossed electric and magnetic fields. We find that the nonequilibrium HSP exhibits directional selectivity owing to the spin-momentum-surface locking of the Fermi arcs. As a result of the Weyl-orbit quantization, the local spin polarization exhibits quantum oscillations with sample thickness and displays plateaus as the Fermi energy varies. This nonequilibrium HSP, which can be detected through current-induced nonlocal spin-orbit torques, is unique to the Weyl orbits.

We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements in the prototypical cuprate demonstrating that short-range static CDW order remains robust at optimal doping ( ), exhibiting a strength and temperature dependence in the normal state similar to those observed at in the underdoped regime. For an overdoped sample with , we detect no static CDW down to , though weak CDW order plausibly emerges below . More broadly, we argue that both quenched disorder and competition with superconductivity influence the apparent boundary of the CDW phase, likely causing an underestimation of its intrinsic extent in doping.

Our method is based on an automated workflow that incorporates prescreening and symmetry analysis and can be applied to a variety of correlated materials. This approach identified two previously unreported metallic altermagnets, CrSe and (in addition to one known altermagnet CrSb), as well as a dozen semiconducting altermagnets among over 2000 magnetic materials.

Here, we propose and investigate theoretically how cotunneling through Mott insulators enables direct access to the shadow band structure of GFZs. In particular, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the GFZ that is shown to govern the cotunneling amplitude and reveal fingerprints of many-body correlations clearly distinguishing the GFZ structure from the underlying free Bloch band structure of the system. Our perturbative analytical results are corroborated by numerical data in the framework of both exact diagonalization and matrix product state simulations for a one-dimensional model system consisting of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model coupled to two single-level quantum dots.},

This enhancement is caused by the linear dependence of the viscosity of the electron liquid on the flow velocity, which is allowed in the absence of time-reversal symmetry and Galilean invariance. The resulting nonlinear flows break dynamical similarity, and, thus, in addition to the Reynolds number, they are characterized by a second dimensionless parameter, the nonreciprocity number. The latter is linear in velocity but independent of system size. We determine the nonlinear conductance of a Hall bar and show that the nonreciprocal correction to the current can be of comparable magnitude to its reciprocal counterpart.},

In the intraband response regime, it can be nicely formulated as a Berry curvature effect and leads to two phenomena that are forbidden in the dc limit: linear spin generation in nonmagnetic insulators and intrinsic Néel spin-orbit torque in -symmetric antiferromagnetic insulators. These phenomena are driven by the time derivative of field rather than the field itself, and have a quantum origin in the first-order dynamic anomalous spin polarizability. Combined with first-principles calculations, we predict sizable effects driven by the terahertz field in nonmagnetic monolayer Bi and in antiferromagnetic even-layer , which can be detected in experiment.},

While conventional exchange-only qubits suffer from magnetic-field-gradient-induced leakage and coherent errors due to local nuclear environments and variations in the -factor, the SAGE qubit subspace is protected from coherent errors due to local magnetic field gradients, and leakage out of the computational subspace is energetically suppressed due to the exchange interactions between electrons being always on. Consequently, we find that when magnetic gradient noise dominates over charge noise, coherence times and single-qubit gate infidelities of the SAGE qubit improve by an order of magnitude compared to conventional exchange-only qubits. Moreover, using realistic parameters, two-qubit gates can be performed with a single interqubit exchange pulse with times comparable in duration to conventional exchange-only qubits but with a significantly simplified pulse sequence.},

For dissipation that monotonically increases with the crack speed, we derive an equation of motion for crack fronts that is second-order accurate. In the linear order, heterogeneity does not change the net speed of fracture. In the second order, nonlinear interactions of the front and the heterogeneous landscape populate an intermediate-scale fluctuation spectrum. We find that, when dissipation weakly grows with velocity, nonlinearities globally amplify dissipation and reduce the crack speed. Strong velocity dependence, however, mitigates toughening effects and may facilitate fracture.},

Here, we demonstrate that pressure-induced polyhedral reorganization triggers an indirect-to-direct band-gap transition driven by the enhanced hybridization of orbitals in systems. The pressure-induced polyhedral reorganization also causes a connectivity shift from corner-sharing tetrahedra ( ) to edge-sharing octahedra ( ) in single-phase crystals, which tailors the electronic redistribution from isolated to quasi-1D ladderlike configurations. The optimized electronic structure leads to a concurrent enhancement in the photoresponsivity by and the emergence of an exotic white-light emission, which can be quenched to ambient conditions. These findings reveal how polyhedral reorganization directly governs electronic evolution in , providing a new pathway to tailor electronic structures and optoelectronic properties through pressure-driven design that bypasses the limitations of traditional approaches.},

We demonstrate that this NTE is intrinsic to the amorphous nature of the alloy and is correlated with Fe moment. Extended x-ray absorption fine structure reveals a strong NTE for nearest neighboring Fe-Fe pairs. Further analysis using a x-ray pair distribution function indicates that the amorphous alloy, serving as a transition state, exhibits a tendency toward local ordered atomic arrangement.

In this study, we combine experimental techniques and modeling to explore the full dynamical process of mushy ice growth and spontaneous aging in saline water, within a natural convective flow system. We show that the aging of newly formed mushy ice in the present system, characterized by a gradual long-term reduction in porosity, is controlled by diffusion-driven desalination. Moreover, we observe that the system eventually transits into a dense freshwater ice layer adjacent to a well-mixed saline water region. The shape of the ice layer in this asymptotic state is well captured by numerical simulations of nonporous ice. Our findings improve the understanding of the complex physics governing phase changes in aqueous systems and provide a framework for studying sea ice aging in laboratory settings, with implications spanning diverse natural and industrial applications.},

Here, we consider the perturbing effects of body forces and incorporate them into a minimal Landau theory of the transition. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of Reynolds number and body force strength, and show that above a threshold strength of the latter, there is a tricritical point which accounts for the observed discontinuity behavior, including spatially heterogeneous states.

  abstract     = {Large single-atom cooperativity in quantum systems is important for quantum information processing. Here, we propose to exponentially enhance the single-atom cooperativity parameter by exploiting the strongly localized effect of modes in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems. By increasing the wing width of a cavity with special geometry symmetry, the interference property allows us to exponentially improve the quality factor without altering the mode volume for cavities supporting subwavelength light modes. This effectively overcomes the trade-off between and in conventional subwavelength Fabry-Pérot cavities. Consequently, we demonstrate the occurrence of ultralong vacuum Rabi oscillations and the generation of strong photon blockade by enhancing the single-atom cooperativity parameter. This Letter offers a promising approach for advancing coherent manipulation and holds significant potential for applications in establishing longer-distance quantum communication networks, enhancing the precision and stability of quantum sensors, and improving the efficiency of quantum algorithms.},

Investigation of atomic coherence across a range of lattice depths and atomic densities reveals decoherence mechanisms related to photon scattering and atomic interaction. At a reduced density, we observe a coherence time of 118(9) s, approaching the fundamental limit set by spontaneous emission. Guided by this coherence understanding, we demonstrate a clock instability for an atomic ensemble of at 1 s in fractional frequency units.

This method extends high-precision spectroscopic thermometry across a pressure range an order of magnitude larger than prior techniques, enabling a fully optical, noncontact, and molecule-selective primary amount-of-substance measurement.

We argue that a particular choice of algebraic 1-forms of the second kind that avoids derivatives is crucial. We observe that the corresponding Feynman integrals satisfy a special form of differential equations that has not been previously reported, and that their solutions order by order in yield pure functions.

  abstract     = {String breaking is a fundamental concept in gauge theories, describing the decay of a flux string connecting two charges through the production of particle–antiparticle pairs. This phenomenon is particularly important in particle physics, notably in quantum chromodynamics, and plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics. However, achieving a theoretical understanding of this nonperturbative effect is challenging, as conventional numerical approaches often fall short and require substantial computational resources. On the experimental side, studying these effects necessitates advanced setups, such as high-energy colliders, which makes direct observation difficult. Here, we report an experimental investigation of the string breaking mechanism in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory using an optical lattice quantum simulator. By deterministically preparing initial states of varying lengths with fixed charges at each end, and adiabatically tuning the mass and string tension, we observed in situ microscopic confined phases that exhibit either string or broken-string states. Further analysis reveals that string breaking occurs under a resonance condition, leading to the creation of new particle–antiparticle pairs. These findings offer compelling evidence of string breaking and provide valuable insights into the intricate dynamics of lattice gauge theories. Our work underscores the potential of optical lattices as controllable quantum simulators, enabling the exploration of complex gauge theories and their associated phenomena.},

  abstract     = {Gravitational waves from merging binary black holes present exciting opportunities for understanding fundamental aspects of gravity, including nonlinearities in the strong-field regime. One challenge in studying and interpreting the dynamics of binary black hole collisions is the intrinsically geometrical nature of spacetime, which in many ways is unlike that of other classical field theories. By exactly recasting Einstein’s equations into a set of coupled nonlinear Maxwell equations closely resembling classical electrodynamics, we visualize the intricate dynamics of gravitational electric and magnetic fields during the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of a binary black hole collision.},

  abstract     = {Fluctuations in ultralight dark matter produce significant metric perturbations, which may be detected by monitoring the arrival times of light from millisecond pulsars. While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field. The statistics of this field depend on the velocity dispersion of dark matter and, consequently, its coherence length. In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This Letter presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter. Our key result is the derivation of the two-point function of the metric fluctuations, which we apply to pulsar timing and discuss its implementation in future searches.},

In this Letter, we demonstrate how these virtual excitations and their correlations can be harnessed to enhance precision measurements, without the need to extract them. Building on the paradigmatic Dicke model, which describes the interaction between an ensemble of two-level atoms and a single radiation mode, we propose a method to harness hybridized light-matter modes whose renormalized frequencies encode the effects of virtual excitations for quantum metrology. Remarkably, we find that, for a fixed squeezing parameter , exploiting virtual squeezing through oscillator frequency shifts yields a quadratic enhancement in estimation precision—scaling as —compared to the conventional scaling of real squeezed states. These results show that virtual excitations, though unobservable, can drive metrological performance beyond the standard quantum limit. Our approach establishes a broadly applicable framework for high-precision measurements across a wide class of ultrastrongly coupled quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Distributed quantum metrology (DQM) enables the estimation of global functions of d distributed parameters beyond the capability of separable sensors. Continuous-variable DQM involves using a linear network with at least one nonclassical input. Here, we fully elucidate the structure of linear networks with two nonvacuum inputs, which allows us to prove a number of fundamental properties of continuous-variable DQM. While measuring the sum of d parameters at the Heisenberg limit can be achieved with a single nonvacuum input, we show that two inputs, one of which can be classical, are required to measure an arbitrary linear combination of d parameters and an arbitrary global function of the parameters. We obtain a universal and tight upper bound on the sensitivity of DQM networks with two inputs, and completely characterize the properties of the nonclassical input required to obtain a quantum advantage. This reveals that a wide range of nonclassical states makes this possible, including a squeezed vacuum. We also show that, for a class of nonclassical inputs, local photon number detection will achieve the maximum sensitivity. Finally we show that a general DQM network has two distinct regimes. The first achieves Heisenberg scaling. In the second the nonclassical input is much weaker than the coherent input, nevertheless providing a multiplicative enhancement to the otherwise classical sensitivity.},

Additionally, we design a set of measurements that remains incompatible even under extreme losses, where the number of measurements in the set increases with the amount of loss. These measurements rely on on-off photodetectors and linear optics, making them feasible for implementation under realistic laboratory conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that no loss channel can break the incompatibility of all measurements. As a result, quantum steering remains achievable in the presence of pure loss.},
