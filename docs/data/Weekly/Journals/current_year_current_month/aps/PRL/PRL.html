  abstract     = {Cell-to-cell heterogeneity in transcription, or transcriptional noise, is important in cellular development and in disease. The molecular mechanisms driving it are, however, elusive and ill-understood. Here, we use computer simulations to explore the role of 3D chromatin structure in driving transcriptional noise. We study a simple polymer model where proteins—modeling complexes of transcription factors and polymerases—bind multivalently to transcription units—modeling regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We also include cohesinlike factors that extrude chromatin loops that are important for the physiological folding of chromosomes. We find that transcription factor binding creates spatiotemporal patterning and a highly variable correlation time in transcriptional dynamics, which is linked to the cell-to-cell variation in gene expression. Loop extrusion also contributes to noise, as the stochastic nature of this process leads to different networks of cohesin loops in different cells in our model. Our results could be tested with single-cell experiments and provide a pathway to understanding the principles underlying transcriptional plasticity in vivo .},

Through molecular dynamics simulations of physically cross-linked networks composed of semiflexible polymers, we identify a previously unexplored class of self-similar aging. The network undergoes ultraslow coarsening characterized by a logarithmically growing mesh size, which governs the spatial organization, cohesive and bending energies, and the aging dynamics of the system. This single time-dependent length scale defines an internal clock, giving rise to spatiotemporal self-similarity of both structure and dynamics—offering a perspective on aging in soft and disordered materials.},

By measuring the amplitude and phase of the optical field in a recirculating loop, we determine the spectral distribution of SGs at various propagation distances. We demonstrate that a SG, initially prepared as a soliton condensate with a Weyl distribution, undergoes significant changes in its spectral distribution due to dissipation. Specifically, weak gain leads to the emergence of a bichromatic SG, while weak damping results in a SG with a semicircular spectral distribution at long propagation distances. These observed dissipation-driven changes in the SG’s spectral characteristics are not explained by existing hydrodynamic or kinetic theories.},

For models of itinerant electron systems, which do not have discrete energy levels, a clear definition of this regime has been lacking to date. Here, we argue that a change of the electronic mass exceeding 10% of its bare value may serve as such a definition. We propose a quantitative computational scheme for obtaining the electronic mass in relation to its bare vacuum value and show that coupling to surface polariton modes can induce such mass changes.

Furthermore, we develop an advanced machine learning model that simultaneously predicts interatomic potentials and Born effective charges to investigate their FE behavior. In particular, we discover a low-energy FE silicon film merely above its antiferroelectric (AFE) ground state. Both phases are confirmed to be dynamically and mechanically stable semiconductors with indirect band gaps of approximately 1.3 eV. Although the ground state exhibits AFE ordering, our simulations with the machine learning model remarkably reveal a robust FE hysteresis loop above room temperature, characterized by a low coercive field of about . An effective Hamiltonian model analysis indicates that this anomalous FE behavior arises from weak AFE coupling between the top and bottom surfaces of the silicon film.

  abstract     = {The use of orbital torques to efficiently modulate magnetization is currently a central topic in orbitronics. In this Letter, we report the discovery of an unexpectedly large dampinglike torque efficiency per unit electric field in metallic heterostructures, with its maximum value being 2 (1) orders of magnitude higher than that in typical heavy-metal Ta (Pt) systems. Current-induced magnetization reversal experiments confirm the enhanced dampinglike torque efficiency, which increases significantly with the thickness of the Cu layer. We attribute this ultraefficient orbital torque to the interfacial vorticity of the drift velocity of conduction electrons, arising from the substantial resistivity difference between the Cu and PtCo layers. The remarkable dampinglike torque efficiency demonstrated in our Letter highlights the potential of interfacial vorticity in spin orbitronics, suggesting a promising new direction for future research in the field.},

  abstract     = {The optical pump-probe technique is a common tool for the investigation of ultrafast spin dynamics, which usually utilizes single-diode detection averaging the dynamics over the pumped area. Using an ultrafast imaging technique, we show experimentally that a femtosecond laser pulse with a gradient distribution of intensity efficiently excites strongly inhomogeneous spin dynamics on spatial scales much smaller than the pump spot size. The mechanism responsible for the inhomogeneous distribution is based on temperature gradients and corresponds to a sign change of the torque derivative in different areas of the pump. We argue that the observed phenomenon is general for the systems with competitive magnetic anisotropies. Overlooking this effect in the majority of pump-probe experiments can result in a dramatic underestimate of the lifetime and amplitude of the laser-induced spin dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Spinons are elementary excitations at the core of frustrated quantum magnets. Although it is well established that a pair of spinons can emerge from a magnon via deconfinement, controlled manipulation of individual spinons and direct observation of their deconfinement remain elusive. We propose an artificial gauge field scenario that enables the engineering of specific excited states in quantum spin models. This generates spatially localized individual spinons with high controllability. By applying time-dependent gauge fields, we realize adiabatic braiding of these spinons, as well as their dynamical evolution in a controllable manner. These results not only provide the first direct visualization of individual spinons localized in the bulk, but also point to new possibilities to simulate their confinement process. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our scenario in Rydberg atoms, which suggests an experimentally viable direction-gauge-field engineering of correlated phenomena in excited states.},

The primary cause of this transition is debated to be either electron-hole correlations, in line with the excitonic insulator hypothesis, or structural instability. The chain structure of Ta 2 NiSe 5 enables effective control over its electronic and lattice properties by applying uniaxial strain. In this study, we utilize polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to demonstrate that the electronic and structural order parameters respond differently to uniaxial pressure applied along the Ta-Ni chains. Compressive strain reduces monoclinic distortions while enhancing excitonic fluctuations. Such disparate behavior suggests that many-body effects may significantly amplify exciton fluctuations even when monoclinic distortions are minimized, thereby supporting the excitonic nature of the phase transition.},

  abstract     = {Rhombohedral graphene (RG) has emerged as a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, such as quantum magnetism, unconventional superconductivity, and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects. Despite its potential, atomic-scale investigations of RG remain limited, hindering a detailed microscopic understanding of the origins of these correlated states. In this Letter, we employ scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy to probe the intrinsic electronic states in trilayer and tetralayer RG. We identify a correlated insulating state with a gap up to 19 meV at the charge neutrality point in tetralayer RG, which is absent in the trilayer RG and Bernal stacking tetralayer. This gap is suppressed by applying a perpendicular magnetic field or doping the charge carrier density and does not exhibit intervalley coherence patterns. We attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-broken layer antiferromagnetic state, characterized by ferrimagnetic ordering in the outermost layers and antiferromagnetic coupling between them. To further investigate this magnetic correlated state, we conduct local scattering experiments. Within the correlated regime, a threefold symmetric pattern emerges around a possible nonmagnetic impurity, suggesting that nonmagnetic doping may induce a spin texture in the ferrimagnetic surface layers. Outside the correlated regime, Friedel oscillations are observed, allowing precise determination of the band dispersion in tetralayer RG. These findings provide atomic-scale evidences of zero-field correlations in RG and may be extended to study other exotic phases in RG.},

Across gate voltages, this regime extends over 3 orders of magnitude in resistivity and can be continuously tuned into the conventional metallic phase.

However, experimental studies have produced inconsistent and even contradictory conclusions regarding the vdW transparency of 2D materials. Here, we employ colloidal atomic force microscopy with a geometrically well-defined probe to measure pull-off and pull-in forces in a model system: graphene on silicon dioxide ( SiO 2 ). Our results reveal that the total vdW force deviates significantly from the naive sum of contributions from graphene and its substrate. Intriguingly, the measured pull-off forces indicate that the effective surface energy of a suspended graphene monolayer can exceed that of its substrate-supported counterpart. Furthermore, our measurements of pull-in forces in substrate-supported systems suggest that graphene of 1–5 layers screens 15%–50% of the intrinsic solid-solid vdW interaction, consistent with Lifshitz theory calculations.},

Specifically, while the latter stabilize a standard spin-triplet p -wave state, just like ferromagnetic fluctuations, the former leads to intra-unit-cell pairing, in which the Cooper pairs are formed by electrons from different sublattices. The symmetry of the intra-unit-cell gap function can be not only p -wave, but also spin-singlet s -wave and d -wave, depending on the shape of the Fermi surface. We also show that coexistence with altermagnetic order promotes intrinsic nontrivial topology, such as protected Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces and higher-order topological superconductivity.

In unmagnetized plasma with flow gradients comparable to the mean free path of reacting ions, fusion reactivity can be more than doubled. The effect is of particular relevance to inertial confinement fusion (ICF), where it allows implosion kinetic energy to contribute to the fusion burn even before thermalizing. Because colder fuel stops alpha particles more quickly, ignition is possible in a smaller volume, substantially reducing energy requirements in fast-ignition designs.},

  abstract     = {Low-energy electrons, with their large scattering cross sections and exceptional sensitivity to electric fields, have attracted considerable attention for probing ultrafast surface structural and electronic dynamics, particularly through techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction and imaging. However, the significant dispersion of low-energy electron pulses during transport poses a critical challenge to achieving high temporal resolution in time-resolved experiments. In this Letter, we present an at-the-source compression method for low-energy electron pulses using terahertz surface waves on a micrometer-sized tip cathode. Simultaneous electron acceleration and compression have been achieved directly at the emitter surface within a few tens of micrometers. A low-energy (1.5 keV) electron beam with near femtocoulomb charge is temporally compressed by a factor of 3.5, producing 74-femtosecond (FWHM) electron bunches. The quality of the compressed electron bunches is validated through high-quality diffraction patterns of few-layer graphene and projection imaging of a copper mesh. Furthermore, the compressed electrons are applied to investigate the transient electric field propagation generated by photoexcited charged particles on metal surfaces, demonstrating the enhanced temporal resolution. This advancement presents the most compact solution for an electron gun that integrates electron generation, acceleration, and compression into a unified system, paving the way for investigating surface dynamics and complex material phenomena with unprecedented precision.},

Current chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) techniques in free-electron lasers (FELs), however, face efficiency limitations in the soft x-ray regime due to the inherent constraints of conventional optical compressors. To address this challenge, we propose a high-efficiency plasma-based compressor utilizing highly ionized noble gas plasma. Exploiting strong refractive index dispersion near ionic resonances, this scheme achieves over 70% transmission efficiency around 5.2 nm and is extendable to other highly charged ions for operation across the soft x-ray to vacuum ultraviolet range. Simulations demonstrate that a 25 fs FEL pulse can be compressed to 1.4 fs with peak power boosted to over 100 GW, while maintaining high-energy throughput. This transformative approach bridges the soft x-ray CPA gap and opens a scalable path toward compact, high-brightness attosecond FEL sources.},

This phenomenon is exploited in cooling textiles, but also complicates forensic stain analysis. The distance that the liquid spreads and the time it takes to evaporate are coupled, yet the consequence of this coupling on the wicking dynamics is not well understood. Here we measure and model how evaporation can reverse the direction of the liquid front so that the wetted patch shrinks after reaching a maximum diameter. We show that both this maximum diameter and the time to fully evaporate can be predicted with a single dimensionless parameter based on the substrate and liquid properties. Yet regardless of the system properties, we uncover a universal dynamic in which drops expand for approximately 1 / 4 of their lifetime and shrink for the rest. Counterintuitively, we find that neither the evaporative cooling nor the stain area scales linearly with the initial droplet volume.},

  abstract     = {We present an experimental study of the flow regime and vortex structure in bulk polymeric turbulence through three-dimensional velocity measurements with unprecedented high spatial resolution. We demonstrate that, as the polymer concentration increases, the effect of polymers on the fluid energy dissipation rate can be categorized into two distinct regimes: the dissipation reduction regime and the maximum dissipation reduction (MDR) regime, and in the latter the effect of the polymers saturates. We reveal that the MDR regime occurs when the scale range affected by the polymer additives extends up to the integral length scale, rather than the generally accepted Lumley scale. This finding enables us to map out the phase diagram of the flow regimes of polymeric turbulence on the Reynolds number and Weissenberg number. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the MDR regime, sheetlike vortex and strain structures dominate, which is traced to the fact that polymer stress stabilizes shear layers and reduces perturbation to shear instability. These results suggest that the MDR regime is a universal flow state in bulk polymeric turbulence and is the counterpart of the maximum drag reduction regime in wall-bounded flows. Our findings emphasize the significance of sheetlike vortex structures and offer new insights into predicting the critical conditions for the emergence of various flow regimes in viscoelastic fluids.},

We found that disorder in the transition frequencies can induce photon antibunching and especially nearly perfect photon blockade events in the transmission and reflection outputs. As a comparison, in ordered chains, strongly correlated photons cannot be generated in the transmission output, and only weakly antibunched photons are found in the reflection output. The occurrence of nearly perfect photon blockade events stems from the disorder-induced nearly completely destructive interference of photon scattering paths. Our Letter highlights the impact of disorder on photon correlation generation and suggests that disorder can enhance the potential for achieving strongly correlated photons.},

By carefully tuning the phase and amplitude of the intracavity field, we achieve a π -phase shift between two dipole states, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio.

In practical implementations, it is important to achieve this manipulation with high speeds, low loss, and low noise. In this Letter, we propose the use of terahertz electric fields as a pump source for electro-optic modulation of single photons in bulk media. We demonstrate spectral modulations of single photons in the form of frequency translation and bandwidth manipulations as the terahertz field imparts linear and quadratic phases on the photons at various time delays within 1 ps. Our results show frequency translations exceeding 500 GHz at multi-THz modulation speeds and loss levels of ≈ 1 dB , complementing the current state-of-the-art electro-optic modulation techniques limited to speeds up to 100 GHz. The proposed approach leverages recent developments in terahertz generation techniques, introducing new avenues to manipulate nonclassical light in an unexplored regime for quantum photonics.},

Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previous estimates for molecular condensates. Strikingly, we observe that, for stronger interactions, the oblate quantum droplet transitions to a two-dimensional sheet or superfluid membrane with a thickness of a single molecule. As interactions are increased further the system continually loses superfluidity while correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.},

  abstract     = {The rapid proton-capture process is one of the primary, explosive thermonuclear burning processes that drive type I x-ray bursts. A possible termination of the rapid proton-capture process at around Mo 84 was previously suggested by the formation of a ZrNb cycle. We report here precision mass measurements at around Mo 84 that conclude the issue regarding the possibility of the cycle. The experiment was conducted using the multireflection time-of-flight spectrograph at RIKEN Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory, and the masses of Y 79 , Nb 83 , Mo 84 , Ru 88 , and an isomer in Y 78 were measured. For Mo 84 , Ru 88 , and the isomeric state of Y 78 , their masses were experimentally determined for the first time with uncertainties of δ m ≈ 20 keV / c 2 . The mass precisions of Y 79 and Nb 83 were improved to 13 and 9.6 keV / c 2 , respectively. The new α -separation energy of Mo 84 , 1.434(83) MeV, unambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The x-ray burst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively remove the large final abundance uncertainties in the A = 80 – 90 mass region. The new mass values improve the prediction power for the composition of the nuclear ashes in x-ray bursts.},

  abstract     = {We present an ab initio study of the charge and matter radii of oxygen isotopes from O 16 to O 20 using nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) with high-fidelity N 3 LO chiral interactions. To efficiently address the Monte Carlo sign problem encountered in nuclear radius calculations, we introduce the partial pinhole algorithm , significantly reducing statistical uncertainties and extending the reach to more neutron-rich and proton-rich isotopes. Our computed charge radii for O 16 , O 17 , and O 18 closely match experimental data, and we predict a charge radius of 2.810(32) fm for O 20 . The calculated matter radii show excellent agreement with values extracted from low-energy proton and electron elastic scattering data, but are inconsistent with those derived from interaction cross sections and charge-changing cross section measurements. These discrepancies highlight model-dependent ambiguities in the experimental extraction methods of matter radii and underscore the value of precise theoretical benchmarks from NLEFT calculations.},

  abstract     = {This manuscript reports on the direct observation of a β -delayed two-neutron emission in a study of In 134 at the ISOLDE Decay Station using neutron spectroscopy. We also report on the first measurement in β − decay of the long-sought 13 / 2 + excited state in Sn 133 , attributed to be the neutron single-particle i 13 / 2 orbital. The observation of sequential neutron emission is used to extract the relative population of the i 13 / 2 state, which was found to be much smaller than the predictions of the statistical model. The experiment was possible because of the innovative use of a neutron array with neutron discrimination and interaction tracking capabilities. This is the first study of the details of the two-neutron emission for a nucleus, which belongs to the r -process path. Understanding β -delayed two-neutron emission probabilities is essential to validate models used in astrophysical r -process nucleosynthesis calculations. Observing two-neutron emissions in β − decay paves the way for new experiments to study energy and angular correlations for β -delayed multineutron emitters.},

  abstract     = {Nucleon structure functions, as measured in lepton-nucleon scattering, have historically provided a critical observable in the study of partonic dynamics within the nucleon. However, at very large parton momenta, it is both experimentally and theoretically challenging to extract parton distributions due to the probable onset of nonperturbative contributions and the unavailability of high-precision data at critical kinematics. Extraction of the neutron structure and the d quark distribution have been further challenging because of the necessity of applying nuclear corrections when utilizing scattering data from a deuteron target to extract the free neutron structure. However, a program of experiments has been carried out recently at the energy-upgraded Jefferson Lab electron accelerator aimed at significantly reducing the nuclear correction uncertainties on the d quark distribution function at large partonic momentum. This allows leveraging the vast body of deuterium data covering a large kinematic range to be utilized for d quark parton distribution function extraction. In this Letter, we present new data from experiment E12-10-002, carried out in Jefferson Lab Experimental Hall C, on the deuteron to proton cross section ratio at large Bjorken x . These results significantly improve the precision of existing data and provide a first look at the expected impact on quark distributions extracted from parton distribution function fits.},

  abstract     = {Using data samples with a total integrated luminosity of collected by the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider, the differential cross sections of inclusive and production, as a function of the momentum and normalized by the total hadronic cross section, are measured at center-of-mass energies from 2.000 to 3.671 GeV. The measured cross sections are consistent with the previously reported cross sections by BESIII, while the cross sections are systematically higher than the cross sections by a factor of approximately 1.4. These new results are in agreement with state-of-the-art QCD analyses at next-to-next-to-leading-order accuracy, particularly in the large hadron momentum region at energy scales down to 3 GeV. These findings support the validity of isospin symmetry in parton fragmentation processes.},

  abstract     = {A search for an invisible particle, with a mass between 0 and , is performed in the process using events collected with the BESIII detector from 2017 to 2019. The meson is fully reconstructed and an efficient veto of photons and neutral and charged hadrons up to twice the mass is applied to the rest of the event and the recoil mass against the is obtained precisely from the kinematic constraint in the event. No significant signal over the expected background is observed in the investigated region and the upper limit on the inclusive branch fraction of is determined to be at 90% confidence level. Upper limits at a 90% confidence level are also given for this branch fraction as a function of the invisible particle mass, varying from to over the investigated mass range. Additionally, a 90% confidence level upper limit on the branch fraction of is determined to , which improves the previous best results by more than 4 times. The analysis technique in this Letter offers a clean window to search for sub-GeV invisible particles, which can be adapted for other decays and direct annihilation experiments in future studies, and improve the sensitivity by orders of magnitude.},

  abstract     = {The T2K Collaboration presents the first measurement of electron neutrino-induced charged-current pion production on a predominantly carbon target in a restricted kinematical phase space. This is performed using data from the 2.5° off-axis near detector, ND280. The differential cross sections with respect to the outgoing electron and pion kinematics, in addition to the total flux-integrated cross section, are obtained. Comparisons between the measured and predicted cross-section results using the n eut, g enie, and n u w ro Monte Carlo event generators are presented. The measured total flux-integrated cross section is [ 2.52 ± 0.52 ( stat ) ± 0.30 ( syst ) ] × 10 − 39 cm 2 nucleon − 1 , which is lower than the event generator predictions.},

  abstract     = {We present a search for the rare flavor-changing neutral-current decay with data collected by the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider. The analysis uses a data sample recorded at the center-of-mass energy of the resonance. One of the mesons produced in the process is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode, while its companion meson is required to decay into a and two leptons of opposite charge. The leptons are reconstructed in final states with a single electron, muon, charged pion or charged meson, and additional neutrinos. We set an upper limit on the branching fraction of at the 90% confidence level, which is the most stringent constraint reported to date.},

  abstract     = {One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in the triple-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the complexity volume proposal in classical Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Our Letter utilizes the recent connection between the double-scaled SYK model and sine dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. Furthermore, we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. The key lesson from our Letter is that gravity demands to assign complexity also to Euclidean state preparation.},

  abstract     = {It is shown that both standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the nonrelativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given.},

In the context of black hole mimickers, we show how maximally viscous stars on the threshold of stability mimic the absorption of a black hole with the same mass.

These prescriptions replace any field that appears in a test-body law of motion with a certain effective field which is a quasilocal functional of the physical variables—a functional that can be interpreted as a regularization procedure in a point-particle limit. We generalize these results, presenting a formalism that allows Detweiler-Whiting prescriptions to be be directly derived for extended bodies, even in nonlinear field theories. If a generating functional with particular properties can be constructed, we find effective linear and angular momenta which evolve via Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations involving appropriate effective fields. These equations implicitly incorporate all self-force, self-torque, and extended-body effects. Although our main focus is on bodies coupled to nonlinear scalar fields, we also remark on the gravitational case.},

Although generation of multipartite entanglement within a small set of individual qubits has been demonstrated, further scale-up in system size requires the connection of smaller entangled states into a larger state in a scalable and modular manner. Here, we achieve this goal by implementing memory-enhanced fusion of two multipartite entangled states via photonic interconnects. Through asynchronous preparation of two tripartite -state entanglements in two spatially separated modules of atomic quantum memories and on-demand fusion via single-photon interference, we demonstrate the creation of a four-partite -state entanglement shared by two remote quantum memory modules in a heralded way. We also demonstrate memory-enhanced scaling in efficiencies in the entanglement fusion. The demonstrated scalable generation and fusion of multipartite entangled states pave the way toward realization of large-scale distributed quantum information processing in the future.},

In this Letter, we report an experimental demonstration of this protocol using high-fidelity polarization-entangled photon pairs in a star topology. For a three-user network, we obtain secure key rates of 21.18, 4.69, and 1.71 kbps under single-user channel losses of 7.6, 10.9, and 12.9 dB respectively. Furthermore, under conditions of equal channel loss per user, we achieve secure key rates of 6.97, 6.46, and 5.88 kbps for three-, four-, and five-user scenarios respectively.

  abstract     = {The Hadamard test is one of the pillars on which quantum algorithm development rests and, at the same time, is naturally suited for the intermediate regime between the current era of noisy quantum devices and complete fault tolerance. Its applications use measurements of the auxiliary qubit to extract information but disregard the system register completely. Concomitantly, but independently of this development, advances in quantum learning theory have enabled the efficient representation of quantum states via classical shadows. This Letter shows that, strikingly, putting both lines of thought into a new context results in substantial improvements to the Hadamard test on a single auxiliary readout qubit, by suitably exploiting classical shadows on the remaining n -qubit work register. We argue that this combination inherits the best of both worlds and discuss statistical phase estimation as a vignette application. At the same time, the framework is more general and applicable to a wide range of other algorithms. There, we can use the Hadamard test to estimate energies on the auxiliary qubit, while classical shadows on the system register provide access to additional features such as (i) the fidelity of the initial state with certain pure quantum states, (ii) the initial state’s energy, and (iii) how pure and how close the initial state is to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian. Finally, we also discuss how anticontrolled unitaries can further augment this framework and explain how this Letter settles the exploitation of the Hadamard test for intermediate applications.},

This Letter proposes an algorithm for mapping the problem of counting ground state degeneracy into one for finding a special ground state of a k -local super Hamiltonian in an enlarged system with twice as many qubits or spins. We show that all traditional methods, designed for finding the ground state by evolution under a function of a Hamiltonian, can be employed to find the special ground state of the super Hamiltonian from a well-designed initial state and thus can be used to count the ground degeneracy.

  abstract     = {F 1 -ATPase ( F 1 ) is central to cellular energy transduction. Forcibly rotated by another motor F o , F 1 catalyzes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis by converting mechanical work into chemical free energy stored in the molecule ATP. The details of how F o drives F 1 are not fully understood; however, evaluating efficient ways to rotate F 1 could provide fruitful insights into this driving since there is a selective pressure to improve efficiency. Here, we show that rotating F 1 with an angle clamp is significantly more efficient than a constant torque. Our experiments, combined with theory and simulation, indicate that the angle clamp significantly suppresses the nonequilibrium variation that contributes to the futile dissipation of input work.},

  abstract     = {As with many motile microalgae, the freshwater species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii can detect light sources and adapt its motile behavior in response. Here, we show that suspensions of photophobic cells can be unstable to density fluctuations, as a consequence of shading interactions mediated by light absorption. In a circular illumination geometry, this mechanism leads to the complete phase separation of the system into transient branching patterns, providing experimental evidence of finite wavelength selection through a motility-induced phase separation mechanism. The finite wavelength selection is a consequence of a vision-based interaction length scale which is fixed by the illumination geometry. A simple drift-diffusion framework allows us to understand how the wavelength depends on global cell density, light intensity, and medium viscosity. Finally, we show that this active phase separation shields individual cells from the deleterious effects of high light intensity, demonstrating that phototaxis can efficiently contribute to photoprotection through collective behaviors on short timescales.},

Our findings, validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments, advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy.

To derive the dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution, we consider a minimal ternary emulsion with one active reaction, leading to one conserved quantity. Even for cases where single droplets constantly grow, coupling many droplets via the conserved density in the far field leads to a self-organized reversal of ripening and, thus, a monodisperse emulsion. For late times, we find a scaling ansatz leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions, different from the LSW theory. This scaling behavior arises from a stable fixed point in the single droplet dynamics and may capture the late-time behavior of many active matter systems exhibiting reversed ripening.},

  abstract     = {Accurately quantifying the energy loss rate of proton beams in liquid water is crucial for the precise application and improvement of proton therapy, whereas the slowing down of protons in water ices also plays an important role in astrophysics. However, precisely determining the electronic stopping power, particularly for the liquid phase, has been elusive so far. Experimental techniques are difficult to apply to volatile liquids, and the availability of sufficient reliable measurements has been limited to the solid and vapor phases. The accuracy of current models is typically limited to proton energies just above the energy loss maximum, making it difficult to predict radiation effects at an energy range of special relevance. We elucidate the phase differences in proton energy loss in water in a wide energy range ( 0.001 − 10 MeV ) by means of real-time time-dependent density functional theory combined with the Penn method. This nonperturbative model, more computationally efficient than current approaches, describes the phase effects in water in excellent agreement with available experimental data, revealing clear deviations around the maximum of the stopping power curve and below. As an important outcome, our calculations reveal that proton stopping quantities of liquid water and amorphous ice are identical, in agreement with recent similar observations for low-energy electrons, pointing out this equivalence for all charged particles. This could help to overcome the limitation in obtaining reliable experimental information for the biologically relevant liquid water target.},

A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.},

We consider prototypical spin systems, the transverse Ising model, and the XYZ model in the D -dimensional lattice with a finite exponent α > D which guarantees the thermodynamic extensivity. In one dimension, both normal and anomalous diffusion are observed, where the anomalous diffusion is attributed to anomalous enhancement of the amplitude of the equilibrium current correlation. We prove the power-law clustering property of arbitrary orders of joint cumulants in general dimensions. Applying this theorem to equal-time current correlations, we further prove several theorems leading to the statement that the sufficient condition for normal diffusion in one dimension is α > 3 / 2 regardless of the models. The fluctuating hydrodynamics approach consistently explains Lévy diffusion for α < 3 / 2 , which implies that the condition is optimal. In higher dimensions of D ≥ 2 , normal diffusion is indicated as long as α > D .},

Here we report what we believe to be the first experimental study of hyperbolic surface exciton polaritons (HSEPs). We study the intensity and phase response of HSEPs in the J-aggregate TDBC (a type-II natural hyperbolic material). HSEPs can be used to generate phase singularities; the behavior of these phase singularities is a consequence of the hyperbolic nature of TDBC. The combined intensity and phase response of nonhyperbolic and hyperbolic SPs suggests that they are topologically distinct. We predict analogous effects for hyperbolic surface phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride.

Here, we demonstrate the simultaneous giant excitonic photoluminescence (PL) enhancement and unidirectional emission from a two-dimensional InSe film integrated with an asymmetric plasmonic nanocavity. A 3500-fold PL enhancement is achieved by engineering spatial, spectral, and orientational overlap between cavity modes and out-of-plane excitons in InSe. Symmetry breaking within the nanocavity ensures precise control of emission interference, yielding a record-high directivity exceeding 15 dB. The design achieves a high coupling efficiency of 24% and supports guided light propagation of 140 μ m .

Specifically, nonequilibrium band structure mapping and valley-resolved ultrafast population dynamics in semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide 2 H − MoTe 2 reveal band-gap renormalizations and reduced population lifetimes as photoexcited carrier densities increase.

We first classify magnetic point groups enabling pure piezospintronic effects. A novel first-principles method is developed to compute the spin dipole moments and coefficients of the piezospintronic effect. Integrating these methodologies with high-throughput screening, we identify FeOOH, Cr 2 O 3 , and NaMn X ( X = As , Bi, P, Sb) with significant pure piezospintronic effects. Interestingly, we reveal that the ionic displacement contribution dominates the piezospintronic effect, in contrast to the piezoelectric effect.

However, there is a discrepancy between theory prediction and experimental observation, which suggests some underlying mechanism that intrinsically suppresses the expected experimental signatures, like the thermal Hall current. Many-body interactions that are not accounted for in the noninteracting quasiparticle picture are most often identified as the reason for the absence of the topological edge modes. Here we report persistent bosonic edge modes at the boundaries of a ladder quantum paramagnet with gapped triplon excitations in the presence of the full many-body interaction. We use tensor network methods to resolve topological edge modes in the time-dependent spin-spin correlations and the dynamical structure factor, which is directly accessible experimentally. We further show that signatures of these edge modes survive even when the noninteracting quasiparticle theory breaks down; we discuss the topological phase diagram of the model, demonstrate the fractionalization of its low-lying excitations, and propose potential material candidates.},

  abstract     = {Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the “intrinsic” sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find that the positivity of higher Gauss sums is a necessary condition for a two-dimensional bosonic topological order to be realized by a stoquastic Hamiltonian, and hence “sign-problem-free.” Equivalently, a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, the gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulation may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.},

  abstract     = {Band renormalizations comprise crucial insights for understanding the intricate roles of electron-boson coupling and electron correlation in emergent phenomena such as superconductivity. In this Letter, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the trilayer nickelate superconductor La 4 Ni 3 O 10 at ambient pressure. We reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of La 4 Ni 3 O 10 in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by an electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund’s coupling. The resultant waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate superconductors. However, at low-energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates and other correlated 3 d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron correlation in the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.},

  abstract     = {Helical trilayer graphene realizes a versatile moiré system for exploring correlated topological states emerging from high Chern bands. Motivated by recent experimental observations of anomalous Hall effects at fractional fillings of magic-angle helical trilayers, we focus on the higher Chern number | C band | = 2 band and explore gapped many-body Hall states beyond the conventional Landau level paradigm. Through extensive exact diagonalization, we predict novel phases unattainable in a single | C band | = 1 band. At filling ν = 2 / 3 and ν = 1 / 3 , a 3 × 3 charge-ordered quantum Hall crystal and a Halperin fractional Chern insulator with Hall conductance | σ H | = 2 e 2 / 3 h are predicted, respectively, indicating strong particle-hole asymmetry of the system. At half-filling ν = 1 / 2 , an extensively degenerate pseudospin Hall ferromagnet featuring emergent SU(2) symmetry is found without the band being flat. Inspired by striking robustness of the ferromagnetic degeneracy, we develop a method to unveil and quantify the emergent symmetry via pseudospin operator construction in the presence of band dispersion and Coulomb interaction and demonstrate persistence of the SU(2) quantum numbers even far away from the chiral limit. Incorporating spin-valley degrees of freedom, we identify an optimal filling regime ν total = 3 + ν for realizing the above states. Notably, interflavor interactions renormalize the bandwidth and stabilize all the gapped phases even in realistic sublattice corrugation parameter regimes.},

By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millhenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.},

Characterizing the orbital character and propagation of these electronic excitations is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior; however, this information is challenging to access. High resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering is a momentum-resolved technique that can address these crucial questions. We present measurements collected at the Cr L 3 -edge which show a rich spectrum of excitations with a variety of spin-orbital characters. While most of these excitations appear to be localized, the dispersion of the lowest energy dark exciton indicates that it is able to propagate along both the a and b directions within the planes of the crystal. This two-dimensional character is surprising as it contrasts with electrical conductivity and the behavior of the bright exciton, both of which are strongly one dimensional. The discovery of this propagating dark exciton highlights an unusual coexistence of one- and two-dimensional electronic behaviors in CrSBr.},

Through particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we identify the J × B force at the front edge as the primary mechanism for injecting electrons into the SPW, where they are further accelerated.

However, perpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where the control of the drop’s motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we show that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop’s hovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from less than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical harmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with high-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop’s motion is locked onto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled linear spring model, accounting for the drop’s deformation, that predicts bouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope of bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for precision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.},

However, integrated OAM-based information technology is an open challenge, because OAM modes are always generated in pairs with opposite topological charges due to their degeneracy. Here, we observe locking of the OAM and linear momentum of light by using a chiral optical waveguide with an Archimedean cross section to induce the orbit-orbit interaction. This OAM-momentum locking enables the deterministic and robust generation of on-demand OAM vortex light beam in a photonic chip.

At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge toward a single narrow spectral line at high pump power.

  abstract     = {Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of pure neutron matter is necessary for interpreting multimessenger observations of neutron stars. Reliable data analyses of these observations require well-quantified uncertainties for the EOS input, ideally propagating uncertainties from nuclear interactions directly to the EOS. This, however, requires calculations of the EOS for a prohibitively larger number of nuclear Hamiltonians, solving the nuclear many-body problem for each one. Quantum Monte Carlo methods, such as auxiliary-field diffusion Monte Carlo (AFDMC), provide precise and accurate results for the neutron matter EOS, but they are very computationally expensive, making them unsuitable for the fast evaluations necessary for uncertainty propagation. Here, we employ parametric matrix models to develop fast emulators for AFDMC calculations of neutron matter and use them to directly propagate uncertainties of coupling constants in the Hamiltonian to the EOS. As these uncertainties include estimates of the effective field theory truncation uncertainty, this approach provides robust uncertainty estimates for use in astrophysical data analyses. This Letter will enable novel applications such as using astrophysical observations to put constraints on coupling constants for nuclear interactions.},

  abstract     = {A stringent test of C P symmetry in hyperon decays is performed using 1.0 × 10 10 J / ψ events and 2.7 × 10 9 ψ ( 3686 ) events collected by the BESIII experiment. The C P asymmetry in the two-body nonleptonic weak decays Σ + → p π 0 and Σ ¯ − → p ¯ π 0 is determined to be A C P = − 0.0118 ± 0.0083 ( stat ) ± 0.0028 ( syst ) , consistent with C P conservation. The average decay parameter ⟨ α 0 ⟩ = − 0.9869 ± 0.0011 ( stat ) ± 0.0016 ( syst ) represents the most precise measurement in the baryon sector to date. A model-independent analysis of the hyperon polarization is performed for the first time at J / ψ and ψ ( 3686 ) resonances, revealing a clear sign reversal and offering new insight into SU(3) symmetry breaking and baryon internal structure. These results provide the most stringent constraints on C P violation in Σ decays and establish a benchmark for future precision studies.},

We performed long-term ( ≈ 15 orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the f mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasicircular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The f -mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of ≳ 6.3 % in the linear regime and much more as ∼ 33 % during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of ≲ 40 rad is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.},

  abstract     = {Classically, the causal order of two timelike separated events A and B is fixed—either A before B or B before A . This is no longer true in quantum theory, where it is possible to encounter superpositions of causal orders. The quantum switch is one of the most prominent processes with indefinite causal order. Optical realizations of the quantum switch have been successfully implemented in experiments, but some argue that this merely simulates a process with indefinite causal order and that a superposition of spacetime metrics is required for a true realization. Here, we provide a relativistic definition of causal order between operationally defined events that defines a meaningful observable in both the general relativistic and quantum mechanical sense. Importantly, this observable does not distinguish between the indefinite causal order implemented on an optical bench and the gravitational quantum switch, a gedanken experiment where the indefinite causal order is achieved by a quantum superposition of gravitational fields. Therefore, our results support the thesis that the optical quantum switch is just as much a realization of indefinite causal order as its gravitational counterpart, which makes use of the quantum mechanical behavior of spacetime.},

Such constraints are natural and practical control parameters for semi-device-independent certification in optical platforms. To analyse these scenarios, we show how semidefinite programming relaxations for noncommutative polynomial optimization can be used to bound the set of quantum correlations under restrictions on the photon-number distribution. The practicality of this method is demonstrated by computing optimal performance bounds on several well-known communication tasks. We then apply the method to the certification of semi-device-inpependent random number generation protocols and show how to bound the conditional Shannon entropy. We showcase this versatile tool by improving randomness extraction in established protocols based on coherent states and homodyne measurements.},

  abstract     = {Extensive research has been dedicated to the asymptotic theory of quantum metrology, where the goal is to determine the ultimate precision limit of quantum channel estimation when many accesses to the channel are allowed. The ultimate limit has been well established, but in general, a noiseless and controllable ancilla is required for attaining it. Little is known about the metrological performance without noiseless ancillae, which is more relevant in practical circumstances. In this Letter, we present a novel theoretical framework to address this problem, bridging quantum metrology and the asymptotic theory of quantum channels. Leveraging this framework, we prove sufficient conditions for achieving the Heisenberg limit with repeated applications of the channel to be estimated both with and without applying interleaved unitary control operations. For the latter case, we design an algorithm to identify the control operation explicitly.},

The approach is applicable to a broad class of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.},

  abstract     = {We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes, and hyperbolic planes to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces, which we call tessellation codes. We show that tessellation codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups. This formalism sheds a new light on quantum code and logical operation construction.},

  abstract     = {Mpemba effects occur after a sudden quench of control parameters if, for “far” (or “hot”) initial states with respect to a final target state, the relaxation time toward the target state is shorter than for “close” (or “cold”) initial states. Following a strategy of fishermen in Pontus described by Aristotle, we introduce the Pontus-Mpemba effect as a two-step protocol that includes the time needed for preparing the system in the “far” initial state that can now be an arbitrary nonequilibrium state. Our protocol needs no parameter distance concept and applies to general (classical or quantum) systems. We find that all possible Pontus-Mpemba effects fall into three classes and illustrate the theory for open Markovian two-state quantum systems.},
