  abstract     = {Tensor networks provide a natural language for noninvertible symmetries in general Hamiltonian lattice models. We use ZX-diagrams, which are tensor network presentations of quantum circuits, to define a noninvertible operator implementing the Wegner duality in 3 + 1 D lattice Z 2 gauge theory. The noninvertible algebra, which mixes with lattice translations, can be efficiently computed using ZX-calculus. We further deform the Z 2 gauge theory while preserving the duality and find a model with nine exactly degenerate ground states on a torus, consistent with the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis-type constraint imposed by the symmetry. Finally, we provide a ZX-diagram presentation of the noninvertible duality operators (including noninvertible parity and reflection symmetries) of generalized Ising models based on graphs, encompassing the 1 + 1 D Ising model, the three-spin Ising model, the Ashkin-Teller model, and the 2 + 1 D plaquette Ising model. The mixing (or lack thereof) with spatial symmetries is understood from a unifying perspective based on graph theory.},

  abstract     = {Beginning with high- T c cuprate materials, it has been observed that many superconductors exhibit so-called “Homes scaling,” in which the zero-temperature superfluid density ρ s 0 is proportional to the product of the normal-state dc conductivity and the superconducting transition temperature σ dc T c . For conventional, s -wave superconductors, such scaling has been shown to be a natural consequence of elastic-scattering disorder, not only in the extreme dirty limit, but across a broad range of scattering parameters. Here we show that when an analogous calculation is carried out for elastic scattering in d -wave superconductors, a stark contrast emerges, with ρ s 0 ∝ ( σ dc T c ) 2 in the dirty limit, in apparent violation of Homes scaling. Within a simple approximate Migdal-Eliashberg treatment of inelastic scattering, we show how the observed Homes scaling is recovered. The normal-state behavior of near-optimally-doped cuprates is dominated by inelastic scattering, but significant deviations from Homes scaling occur for disorder-dominated cuprate systems, such as underdoped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 6.333 and overdoped La 2 − x Sr x CuO 4 , and in very clean materials with little inelastic scattering, such as Sr 2 RuO 4 . We present a revised analysis where both axes of the original Homes scaling plot are normalized by the Drude plasma weight ω p , D 2 and show that a new universal scaling emerges, in which the superfluid fractions of dirty s -wave and dirty d -wave superconductors coalesce to a single point at which normal-state scattering is occurring at the Planckian bound. The combined result is a new tool for classifying superconductors in terms of order parameter symmetry, as well as scattering strength and character. Although our model starts from a Fermi-liquid assumption, it describes underdoped cuprates surprisingly well.},

  abstract     = {The discovery of a new, reaction channel in deuteron-deuteron (DD) fusion at very low energies might have major implications for understanding primordial and stellar nucleosynthesis, where electron-positron reaction channels are typically not considered. It could also enable research on metal hydride fusion, potentially paving the way for the design and construction of next-generation fusion energy sources. Following the first experimental indications of electron emission, we present here an extensive experimental study confirming emission of high-energy electrons from DD reaction at very low energy. A simultaneous use of Si charged particle detectors of different thicknesses and large-volume NaI(Tl) and HPGe detectors has allowed the determination of the branching ratios between emitted protons, neutrons, and pairs for deuteron energies down to 5 keV. The high-energy positrons could be unambiguously detected by their bremsstrahlung spectra and annihilation radiation, supported by the g eant4 Monte Carlo simulations. The theoretical calculations, based on a destructive interference between the threshold resonance and the known broad resonance in , agree very well with experimentally observed increase of branching ratios for lowering projectile energies. The partial width of the threshold resonance for the internal pair creation should be at least 10 times larger than that of the proton channel.},

  abstract     = {The ability to distribute heralded entanglement between distant matter nodes is a primitive for the implementation of large-scale quantum networks. Some of the most crucial requirements for future applications include high heralding rates at telecom wavelengths, multiplexed operation, and on-demand retrieval of stored excitations for synchronization of separate quantum links. Despite tremendous progress in various physical systems, the demonstration of telecom-heralded entanglement between quantum nodes featuring both multiplexed operation and on-demand retrieval remains elusive. In this work, we combine narrow band parametric photon-pair sources and solid-state quantum memories based on rare-earth doped crystals to demonstrate telecom-heralded entanglement between spatially separated spin-wave quantum memories with fully adjustable recall time and temporal multiplexing of 15 modes. In a first experiment, the storage in the spin state is conditioned on the entanglement heralding. We take advantage of the control over readout pulse phase to achieve feedforward conditional phase shifts on the stored photons depending on which heralding detector clicked. We exploit this effect to double the entanglement heralding rate for a given quantum state up to 510 counts / s , with an associated detection rate of 0.32 counts / s and measured positive concurrence by up to 6 standard deviations. In a second experiment, we simulate the communication time of a long-distance link by implementing an unconditional storage scheme with a dead time of 100 μ s . We take advantage of temporal multiplexing to increase the entanglement rates by a factor of 15 with respect to single mode storage, reaching a value of 22 counts / s per heralding detector. These results establish our architecture as a prime candidate for the implementation of scalable high-rate quantum network links.},

  abstract     = {Electrons trapped on the surface of cryogenic substrates (liquid helium, solid neon, or hydrogen) are an emerging platform for quantum information processing made attractive by the inherent purity of the electron environment, the scalability of trapping devices, and the predicted long lifetime of electron spin states. Here we demonstrate the spatial control and detection of single electrons above the surface of liquid helium at temperatures above 1 K. A superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator is used to read out the charge state of an electron trap defined by gate electrodes beneath the helium surface. Dispersive frequency shifts are observed as the trap is loaded with electrons, from several tens down to single electrons. These frequency shifts are in good agreement with our theoretical model that treats each electron as a classical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. This sensitive charge readout scheme can aid efforts to develop large-scale quantum processors that require the high cooling powers available in cryostats operating above 1 K.},

  abstract     = {Probabilistic computing with p-bits is emerging as a computational paradigm for machine learning and for facing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with the so-called probabilistic Ising machines (PIMs). From a hardware point of view, the key elements that characterize a PIM are the random number generation, the nonlinearity, the network of coupled probabilistic bits, and the energy-minimization algorithm. Regarding the energy-minimization algorithm in this work we show that PIMs using the simulated quantum annealing (SQA) schedule exhibit better performance as compared to simulated annealing and parallel tempering in solving a number of COPs, such as maximum satisfiability problems, the planted Ising problem, and the traveling salesman problem. Additionally, we design and simulate the architecture of a fully connected CMOS-based PIM that is able to run the SQA algorithm having a spin-update time of 8 ns with a power consumption of 0.22 mW. Our results also show that SQA increases the reliability and the scalability of PIMs by compensating for device variability at an algorithmic level enabling the development of their implementation combining CMOS with different technologies such as spintronics. This work shows that the characteristics of the SQA are hardware agnostic and can be applied in the codesign of any hybrid analog-digital Ising machine implementation. Our results open a promising direction for the implementation of a new generation of reliable and scalable PIMs.},
