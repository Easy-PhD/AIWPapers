  abstract     = {Number 1A, 1948 by Jackson Pollock is a quintessential example of his action painting technique where ropes of color, drips of black, and pools of white coalesce into the layered dynamism that defines his style. While past work has identified the red and yellow pigments that form part of his core palette, the vibrant blue in the painting has remained unassigned. In this study resonance Raman spectroscopy is used to assign the blue in the painting as manganese blue. This assignment offers critical context for the conservation of his works. Importantly, assignment of this pigment enables spectroscopic investigation of the electronic structure origin of the pure hue of manganese blue and the chemical phenomena that produce its color. To probe these phenomena, resonance Raman data are coupled to magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to assign and analyze the two electronic transitions that create the blue color. This study reveals these bands are split by excited-state exchange interactions; the gap between them contains the reflected light that gives manganese blue its appearance. This sheds light on distinct advantages of molecular inorganic pigments: their ability to leverage ligand field effects in charge transfer states to create multiple intense visible absorption features and the ability to fine-tune pigment color through host lattice electrostatics.},

  abstract     = {There are a variety of contexts in which “pitching in” to address environmental or resource management problems could benefit from individuals or firms working not just on their own but also working together collaboratively as a group. Examples include working together on promoting conservation or habitat protection, the sharing of information, or the development of less polluting products or production processes. However, to date, the literature on environmental policy has considered only the incentives for individual parties (e.g., firms, landowners, or individuals) to take steps (i.e., exert “effort”) to reduce pollution or meet resource management goals where those steps impact that party’s own environmental footprint or performance. Missing from the literature is any consideration of the ability of one party to undertake activities that instead help another improve the latter’s performance. Such help could be either a substitute for or a complement to one’s own effort. This paper presents an analysis showing that traditional policy approaches based on individual performance cannot generally efficiently incentivize both effort and help, but a (properly designed) collective approach where rewards or punishments are based on group performance can. This suggests an additional rationale for the use of collective approaches as a potentially important tool for promoting sustainability that has not been recognized in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Emerging infectious diseases and biological invasions pose increasing threats to public and ecosystems health. Proactive measures—such as prevention and surveillance taken before initial detection of the pathogen or species—are essential to ensure minimal spread prior to first detection. We developed an optimization model to determine where, when, and how much effort should be allocated to prevention versus surveillance. The model accounts for imperfect detection, system dynamics, spatial heterogeneity in risk and costs and is scalable to large landscapes. We found that the most cost-effective strategy is to maintain the prevention and surveillance efforts at stable equilibrium for the majority of the time, with deviations occurring only initially to steer the system toward the equilibrium. The equilibrium effort is jointly determined by the introduction risk, management costs, and total budget. Application of this model to chronic wasting disease in New York State suggests that the optimal strategy could reduce the cumulative disease cases before initial detection by an average of 22% compared to current practice. The optimal surveillance strategy could detect the disease on average over 8 mo earlier than the current strategy.},

  abstract     = {Human monogenic traits can confer resistance to viral infection in exposed individuals or predisposition to severe disease in infected individuals. Enhanced susceptibility can be driven directly by mutations in genes essential for control of the virus or indirectly via the production of autoantibodies against components of host defense. While the impact of viruses on individuals carrying these genotypes permitted their identification and has been amply studied, little is known about the impact of these human genotypes on the natural history of viruses, including not only persisting but also emerging viruses. We envisage several scenarios, including the possibility that genetically susceptible individuals serve as patient zeros, superspreaders, or mutation incubators, or that genetically resistant individuals even permit the selection of new viral mutants. Viruses are continually shared between individuals and even host species, where they can benefit from adaption to new environments. Current human viruses, as well as novel viruses from animal reservoirs, will continue to threaten the human population. Improvements in the scale of human genomic sequencing and analysis will permit testing hypotheses about the impact of human genetics on the origin and trajectory of viral infections, including future pandemics, which may ultimately help to prevent or curtail impending outbreaks.},

  abstract     = {G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large class of membrane proteins that mediate cellular responses to a wide range of external signals and as such constitute major drug targets. While oligomerization has been shown to play a well-established role in modulating signaling for class C GPCRs (e.g., the glutamate and GABA receptors), the functional relevance of oligomerization for class A receptors, such as the β 1 -adrenergic receptor (β 1 AR), remains unclear. Here, we have examined the influence of the membrane mimetic environment on the dimerization propensity of β 1 AR using a combination of pulsed Q-band double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and single-molecule fluorescence brightness measurements in an Anti-Brownian Elektrokinetic trap. While β 1 AR is predominantly monomeric in docecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) micelles, reconstitution of β 1 AR in lipid nanodiscs preferentially favors symmetric parallel dimers. Using nanodiscs of different diameters we observed a clear size-dependent increase in the dimer fraction, reaching over 50% of the β 1 AR molecules in large (~12.5 nm diameter) nanodiscs. Addition of cholesteryl hemisuccinate, an analog of cholesterol, suppresses β 1 AR dimerization in lipid nanodiscs, recapitulating the behavior in DDM micelles. This work provides quantitative evidence that β 1 AR possesses an intrinsic, membrane sensitive predisposition for dimerization, and highlights the importance of spatial membrane constraints in the modulation of class A GPCR dimerization.},

  abstract     = {Synapse pruning sculpts neural circuits throughout life. The human Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor type B2 (LilrB2)/murine Paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PirB) receptors expressed in neurons and complement protein C4 have been separately implicated in pruning. Here, we report that C4d, a C4 cleavage product with unknown function, binds LilrB2/PirB with nanomolar affinity. C4d and LilrB2 colocalize at excitatory synapses in the human cerebral cortex as well as with beta amyloid in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). C4d, as well as C4, increase with age and more so in AD. To examine whether C4d-PirB interactions can drive pruning, dendritic spines—the postsynaptic structure of excitatory synapses—were monitored on L5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse cerebral cortex: A significant decrease in dendritic spine density occurred in WT with C4d exposure, but KO of PirB completely prevented this loss. Together, our findings reveal an unexpected physiological role for C4d in pruning and imply that different complement cascade components may collaborate to engage both neuronal and glial-specific effectors of synaptic pruning.},

  abstract     = {Crops genetically engineered to produce insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have revolutionized pest management, but their benefits have been reduced by evolution of practical resistance in at least 31 cases. To delay evolution of resistance, farmers have shifted from crops producing one Bt protein to crops called pyramids that produce two or more Bt proteins or other traits targeting each pest. Here, we focus on resistance to transgenic corn pyramids in the western corn rootworm ( Diabrotica virgifera virgifera ) and northern corn rootworm ( Diabrotica barberi ), which cost farmers in the United States $2 billion yearly in yield losses. We analyzed 998 relevant data values for 2005 to 2023 from 12 published field studies. The results support the hypothesis that rootworm resistance to Bt proteins Cry3Bb and Gpp34/Tpp35Ab reduces the efficacy of pyramids that produce one or both of these proteins and an RNA interference trait (DvSnf7) targeting rootworms, despite no apparent strong cross-resistance between the Bt proteins and DvSnf7. The reduced efficacy of pyramids producing Bt proteins and DvSnf7 entails increased root injury and emergence of adult beetles. Efficacy of DvSnf7 was substantially lower for reducing root injury than emergence. Because root injury decreases yield, the increased root injury has immediate practical consequences. More sustainable control may be achieved by deploying pyramids with traits that are each highly effective against rootworms, increasing the abundance of host plants that do not target rootworms, and combining transgenic corn with crop rotation and other control tactics in integrated pest management programs.},

  abstract     = {Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignancies with limited therapeutic options. Among the alternative targets explored for pancreatic cancer, the glycolipid stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA4) has been extensively studied. We have previously demonstrated that the chimeric anti-SSEA4 antibody with alpha-2,6-sialylated complex type biantennary glycan (SCT) or its 3-fluorosialyl derivative (FSCT) attached to the Fc-Asn297 residue exhibited enhanced binding to the Fc-receptors FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIA which are responsible for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis as well as vaccinal effect. Here, we found that high-SSEA4 expression correlates with increasing tumor proliferation and sensitivity to the glyco-optimized antibodies (anti-SSEA4-SCT and anti-SSEA4-FSCT) which preferentially recruit NKG2D-expressing natural killer cells and FcγRIIA-bearing macrophages with enhanced target killing activity. We also uncovered an immune evasion mechanism involving the interaction of sialoglycans on the cancer cell with Siglec-9 on NK cells or Siglec-10 on macrophages to block the antibody-mediated effector functions, and this immune checkpoint inhibition can be suppressed with the removal of sialic acid on cancer cells or blockade of Siglec recognition. In xenograft models, the glyco-optimized antibodies exhibited superior inhibition of tumor growth with high-SSEA4 expression compared to the wild-type antibody and persistent antitumor activity without additional antibody administration. These findings support anti-SSEA4 antibodies with enhanced effector functions and blockade of Siglec-mediated immune checkpoint as a promising therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract     = {Thrombopoietin (TPO), predominantly produced by the liver, is the key regulator for platelet production and the hematopoietic stem cell niche. Our earlier report demonstrated that platelet GPIbα is required for hepatocellular TPO generation, which is the major resource of TPO in the blood circulation. However, how hepatocytes physically contact circulating sinusoidal platelets across the liver endothelium for this process is unknown. Kupffer cells reside in contact with both sinusoidal blood and underlying hepatocytes, and mediate senescent platelet clearance, but their role in TPO regulation has never been explored. Here, we found Kupffer cell depletion via either clodronate liposomes or specific transgenic models abrogated circulating TPO. Kupffer cell depletion also prevented TPO level increase in GPIbα-deficient mice following wild-type (GPIbα + ) platelet transfusion, signifying an interdependent mechanism for TPO regulation. Mice treated with arsenite had significantly decreased liver endothelial fenestrations and hepatocyte sinusoidal protrusions as well as TPO levels. This effect was exacerbated by Kupffer cell depletion, and Kupffer cells were identified to enhance liver endothelial fenestrations. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis of the liver revealed platelets arrested on Kupffer cell surface were in contact with hepatocyte protrusions. Thus, we elucidated that Kupffer cells promote endothelial fenestrae and hepatocyte protrusions, accumulate circulating platelets, and facilitate cellular interactions between hepatocytes and platelets, which drive TPO generation. This connection between platelet clearance and thrombopoiesis should have broad implications for hematology and pathologies such as Bernard–Soulier syndrome, thrombocytopenias, as well as liver diseases.},

Of the five known viral TAP inhibitors, only the herpes simplex virus (HSV) protein ICP47 has been structurally resolved. We now report cryoelectron microscopy structures of TAP in complex with the remaining four: BNLF2a (Epstein–Barr virus), hUS6 (human cytomegalovirus), bUL49.5 (bovine herpesvirus 1), and CPXV012 (cowpox virus), assembling a structural atlas of viral TAP evasion. Despite employing divergent sequences, folds, and conformational targets, these viral inhibitors converge on a common strategy: they stall TAP from the alternating access cycle, precluding peptide entry into the ER and shielding infected cells from cytotoxic T cell surveillance. These findings reveal striking functional convergence and provide a structural framework for rational antiviral design.},

  abstract     = {Deep mutational scanning (DMS) assays provide a powerful method to generate large-scale datasets essential for advancing AI-driven predictions in biology. The tripartite β-lactamase assay (TPBLA), in which a protein of interest is inserted between two domains of β-lactamase, has previously been reported as capable of detecting and quantitating the aggregation of proteins and biologics in the oxidizing periplasm of Escherichia coli and used as a platform for identifying small molecule inhibitors of aggregation. Here, we repurpose the TPBLA into a high-throughput DMS platform. We validate this format using a single-site saturation library of the intrinsically disordered peptide Aβ 42 , linked to Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating strong agreement between observed variant fitness scores and variant behavior using our previously reported low-throughput TPBLA. The results of DMS revealed variant fitness scores that correlate with known amyloid-promoting regions. An in silico approach using FoldX-derived per-residue thermodynamic stability confirmed that the TPBLA reports on amyloid fibril stability. In vitro experiments support this finding, showing a strong correlation between variant fitness scores and the critical concentration of amyloid formation. Machine learning using the DMS dataset identified β‐sheet propensity and polarity as primary drivers of variant fitness scores. The derived model is also able to predict thermodynamically stabilizing regions in other amyloid systems, underscoring its generalizability. Collectively, our results demonstrate the TPBLA as a versatile platform for generating robust datasets to advance predictive modeling and to inform the design of aggregation‐resistant proteins.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First, we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced λ -jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the λ -jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become “soft” under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked “kineo-elastic” term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree–Fock calculations.},

  abstract     = {In southern China and Southeast Asia (collectively, Southeastern Asia), Terminal Pleistocene and Early to Middle Holocene (ca. 12,000 to 4,000 cal. BP) hunter-gatherer burials feature tightly crouched or squatting postures, sometimes with indications of post-mortem dismemberment. Such burials contrast strongly with the extended supine burial postures typical of subsequent Neolithic inhumations in these regions. Their contorted postures, often with traces of burning, present interpretive challenges. This study uses multiple techniques, including X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, to investigate 54 pre-Neolithic burials from 11 archaeological sites located across Southeastern Asia. The findings confirm that many of these pre-Neolithic flexed and squatting burials were treated by an extended period of smoke-drying over fire, a process of mummification similar to that recorded ethnographically in some Australian and Highland New Guinea societies. Some of the analyzed archaeological samples represent the oldest known instances of such artificial mummification in the world.},

  abstract     = {Differentiation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) is driven by the activation of a set of genes controlled by serum response factor (SRF), a ubiquitous transcription factor with limited intrinsic transcriptional activity. Myocardin (MYOCD) is a strong transcriptional coactivator that orchestrates smooth muscle differentiation through its association with SRF. MYOCD forms nuclear condensates via its intrinsically disordered transcription activation domain (TAD), whereas SRF is diffusely distributed in the nucleus. MYOCD recruits SRF into these condensates, thereby activating the smooth muscle gene program. We engineered a “superactivator” of smooth muscle genes by replacing SRF’s weak TAD with that of MYOCD, thereby enabling SRF to form nuclear condensates and reprogram fibroblasts into SMCs. Using protein proximity labeling, quantitative proteomics and superresolution confocal microscopy, we show that condensates formed by the MYOCD TAD aggregate chromatin remodelers, RNA polymerases, and mRNA processing factors to drive smooth muscle gene expression. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms whereby nuclear condensates facilitate tissue-specific gene expression and highlight a strategy for engineering cell fate determinants by coupling condensate-forming domains to heterologous DNA-binding proteins.},

  abstract     = {Multireference methods such as multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory accurately capture electronic correlation in systems with strong multiconfigurational character, but their cost precludes direct use in molecular dynamics. Combining these methods with machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLPs) can extend their reach. However, the sensitivity of multireference calculations to the choice of the active space complicates the consistent evaluation of energies and gradients across structurally diverse nuclear configurations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the weighted active space protocol (WASP), a systematic approach to assign a consistent active space for a given system across uncorrelated configurations. By integrating WASP with MLPs and enhanced sampling techniques, we propose a data-efficient active learning cycle that enables the training of an MLP on multireference data. We demonstrated the approach on the TiC + -catalyzed C–H activation of methane, a reaction that poses challenges for Kohn–Sham density functional theory due to its significant multireference character. This framework enables accurate and efficient modeling of catalytic dynamics, establishing a paradigm for simulating complex reactive processes beyond the limits of conventional electronic-structure methods.},

  abstract     = {Winds generate waves over the oceans with a wide range of properties. The largest wave heights and periods are important parameters in the design of marine structures. Extreme waves also play an outsize role in air–sea fluxes and coastal dynamics, and leave imprints on seismic and sediment records. Rare events have so far escaped measurements, with few wave heights from satellite altimeters exceeding 16 m, and no associated measurement of wave periods. Here, we use swells radiated from storms to reveal long wave periods within the storms, and their generation mechanism. Swells are resolved in the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite sea level measurements. Patterns of increasing swell wavelength and decreasing swell height away from storms are consistent with a nonlinear transfer of energy from short to long period waves. We propose an updated parametric shape for wave spectra in storms that aligns with SWOT swell measurements. It reduces energy levels by a factor of 20 at 1.2 to 1.4 times the peak period compared to commonly used spectral shapes and allows estimation of storm wave periods from swell heights. Consistent with less extreme conditions, the peak period generally increases with wave height. This was particularly verified for the largest storm peak period of 20.2 ± 0.6 s, obtained for the event with the largest significant wave height 19.7 ± 0.3 m measured by altimeters. These observations of long period swells should have a wide range of applications from coastal dynamics to seismology.},

  abstract     = {Understanding mesoscale structural dynamics of precipitation-strengthened alloys is essential for optimizing the mechanical performances of these alloys. Herein, we establish a multimodal coherent X-ray diffraction imaging framework for spatiotemporal mapping of mesoscale structural dynamics in precipitation-strengthened alloys. As a demonstrative application, we visualized the structural evolution in Mg 97 Zn 1 Gd 2 during isothermal annealing at 700 K, revealing real-time dynamics of nucleation, growth, and coarsening. Ptychographic reconstruction enabled imaging of microstructural transformations across a wide field of view (~100 μm 2 ) with temporal resolution spanning several hours. We observed decomposition of (Mg, Zn) 3 Gd and concurrent precipitation and coarsening of long-period stacking ordered phases. To resolve local dynamics at finer spatiotemporal scales, we combined dynamic coherent diffraction imaging with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, targeting selected regions (~10 μm 2 ) with time resolution down to tens of seconds. This approach revealed the rapid formation of nanoscale precipitates within 10 s after heating, followed by coarsening over several hundred seconds. Additionally, we applied optical flow analysis—a computational method to track motion patterns—to visualize and quantify the nucleation, growth, and coarsening kinetics. The abovementioned findings demonstrate the capability of in situ coherent X-ray techniques to acquire the real-time evolutions of mesoscale structures in complex materials. Our methodology offers a robust framework for investigating dynamic phenomena in diverse material systems, including metals, polymers, and functional nanomaterials, under realistic thermal or mechanical conditions.},

  abstract     = {Cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP) is a ubiquitous bacterial second messenger that regulates a variety of cellular processes, including motility, biofilm formation, secretion, cell cycle progression, and development, and also contributes to the virulence of many bacterial pathogens. While the genes encoding c-di-GMP cyclases and hydrolases are readily identifiable in microbial genomes, known c-di-GMP receptor domains are quite few, with only PilZ and MshEN broadly distributed across bacterial phyla. Recently, a new c-di-GMP receptor, named CdgR or ComFB, has been identified in cyanobacteria and shown to regulate cell size and natural competence. We demonstrated that CdgR proteins exhibit sequence and structural similarity to the Bacillus subtilis late competence development protein ComFB, a conserved protein of unknown function associated with bacterial competence. This prompted us to hypothesize that ComFB and ComFB-like proteins could also serve as c-di-GMP receptors. Here, we comprehensively investigated the ComFB protein family and demonstrated that ComFB proteins are evolutionarily widespread among bacteria and function as a novel family of c-di-GMP receptors. We showed that ComFB proteins from Gram-positive bacteria ( B. subtilis , Thermoanaerobacter brockii ) and Gram-negative pathogens ( Vibrio cholerae , Treponema denticola ) bind c-di-GMP with high affinity. Several ComFB proteins also bind cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), suggesting that ComFB represents a widely distributed bacterial protein family with dual specificity for c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP. Our physiological studies further showed that ComFB plays vital roles in controlling motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner in two phylogenetically distant bacteria, B. subtilis and the gram-negative Shewanella oneidensis , attesting to the biological relevance of ComFB as a c-di-GMP binding protein.},

  abstract     = {In an ever-changing environment, animals make optimal decisions to ensure their well-being. Faced with limited food sources, they often seek foods that provide the nutrients they require to maintain homeostasis. Under extreme circumstances (e.g., infection), they may exhibit ingestive behaviors, such as seeking out substances (e.g., toxins) that suggest self-medication. Few studies, however, have investigated the mechanisms that ensue self-medication. Here, we report the selective intake of antioxidants by Drosophila melanogaster during a period of heat stress or sleep deprivation. This preference was alleviated by prefeeding them vitamin C or dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) before exposure to stress. Heat stress led to an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the gut, which was alleviated by the intake of vitamin C. Heat stress reduced vitamin C in hemolymph, whereas the consumption of vitamin C or DHA increased it. Furthermore, the intake of vitamin C ameliorated the intestinal barrier dysfunction and extended the survival of flies that had been exposed to chronic heat stress. The heat-induced preference for vitamin C appears to develop independently of the known peripheral chemosensory receptors for this micronutrient. We propose that fruit flies possess an interoceptive mechanism that mediates the detection of vitamin C to overcome environmental challenges.},

  abstract     = {γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R) is a pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that plays a crucial role in inhibition in the adult brain. Structural and electrophysiological studies have provided numerous insights into the receptor’s functioning but the complete molecular mechanism of GABA A R action remains elusive. Herein, we used high-resolution single-channel recording to analyze point-mutated α 1 β 2 γ 2 receptors and applied so called Φ value (REFER, rate-equilibrium free energy relationship) analysis which allows to infer the order of domains engagement during activation, offering a complementary “dynamic” insight into the receptor’s function. As anticipated, point mutations at the orthosteric binding sites reduced GABA binding affinity, with the magnitude of this effect diminishing progressively with increasing distance from the binding site. On the contrary, mutations located all over the macromolecule’s structure, e.g., in “peripheral top position,” extracellular/transmembrane interface, and channel pore, affected the receptor with a clear tendency to influence entire gating including opening/closing, preactivation, and desensitization with no clear correlation with the distance to the channel gate. Interestingly, the calculated Φ values for the GABA A R showed a relatively narrow range (0.42 to 0.81), suggesting that the conformational transitions are highly synchronized and coordinated by a global network of interactions. This prediction is also in agreement with observation that, typically, single GABA A R residue mutation alters the kinetics of not just one but many (often all) conformational transitions. We thus propose a dictum reflecting modus operandi of the GABA A R: Binding is local and gating is global. In conclusion, our analysis indicates that GABA A R shows particularly strong functional compactness manifested as global gating mechanisms and high allostery.},

But in the United States, the digital advertising market in which these platforms operate is dominated by a few major players, raising concerns for antitrust regulators. In such a concentrated market, the entry or exit of a single platform can reallocate billions in ad spending, affecting businesses and users. TikTok’s temporary suspension in the United States in January 2025 provides a unique natural experiment to examine how the removal of a major player would shift advertising demand and supply on competitors, specifically Facebook and Instagram, revealing the degree of substitutability across platforms and the intensity of competition. Using a difference-in-differences approach comparing advertising activity in the United States to other countries, we find that Meta ad volume and spend rose by 6.3% and 22.4%, as a result of the outage, without a corresponding increase in ad impressions. Consequently, Meta ad prices, as measured by cost per thousand impressions, jumped by 12.1%. Shifts in demand were three times greater for larger advertisers relative to smaller ones, suggesting that Meta platforms and TikTok are closer substitutes for larger firms and that a TikTok ban would therefore impose greater challenges on smaller businesses.},

  abstract     = {Tailoring the nanoscale distribution of chemical species at grain boundaries is a powerful method to dramatically influence the properties of polycrystalline materials. However, classical approaches to the problem have tacitly assumed that only competition is possible between solute species. In this paper, we show that solute elements can cooperate in the way they segregate to grain boundaries: In properly targeted alloys, the different chemical species cooperate to each fill complementary grain boundary sites disfavored by the other. By developing a theoretical “spectral” approach to this problem based on quantum-accurate grain boundary site distributions, we show how grain boundaries can be cooperatively alloyed, whether by depletion or enrichment. We provide machine-learned cosegregation information for over 700 ternary aluminum-based alloys and experimentally validate the concept in one ternary alloy where cosegregation is not expected by prior models but is expected based on the cooperative model.},

  abstract     = {Neurodegenerative diseases present one of the most significant global health challenges. These disorders are defined by the accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates that impair synaptic function and cause progressive neuronal degeneration. Therefore, stimulating protein clearance mechanisms may be neuro-protective. Variants in FBXO7/PARK15 cause Parkinsonian Pyramidal Syndrome, an early-onset parkinsonian neurodegenerative disorder in humans, and inactivation of this gene in mice recapitulates many phenotypes seen in patients. The proteasome regulator PI31 is a direct binding partner of Fbxo7 and promotes local protein degradation at synapses by mediating fast proteasome transport in neurites. PI31 protein levels are reduced when the function of Fbxo7 is impaired. Here we show that restoring PI31 levels in Fbxo7 mutant fly and mouse strains prevents neuronal degeneration and significantly improves neuronal function, health, and lifespan. Notably, Fbxo7 inactivation in mouse neurons causes hyperphosphorylation of tau, and this was suppressed by transgenic expression of PI31. Our results demonstrate that PI31 is a crucial biological target through which Fbxo7 deficiency drives pathology. Therefore, targeting the PI31-pathway may represent a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders.},

  abstract     = {One-carbon metabolism influences gene expression by providing methyl units for DNA, RNA, and histone methylation. Robust methylation requires rapid hydrolysis of the methylation by-product S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by S -adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy). Ahcy is essential for maintaining methylation potential; however, the mechanisms governing its enzymatic activity, particularly in response to cellular stress, remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show Ahcy is a redox-sensitive enzyme that is inhibited by oxidation of a conserved cysteine, C195, in vitro resulting in elevated SAH levels upon oxidative stress in vivo. We leveraged High-Throughput Desorption Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry to directly quantify Ahcy enzymatic activity and observed that H 2 O 2 -induced oxidation significantly reduced its catalytic efficiency. Notably, while C195 is essential for enzymatic activity in Drosophila melanogaster and humans, this residue is not conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans Ahcy that is also insensitive to H 2 O 2 . Structural analysis revealed that C195 is positioned near NAD + in the active site, close to a second cysteine residue that is also lacking in C. elegans Ahcy. Ahcy oxidation is neuroprotective in a Drosophila light stress model that increases oxidative stress. Moreover, Ahcy knockdown suppresses light stress–induced gene expression changes in photoreceptors, although this response is uncoupled from changes in H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 levels, which were previously reported to alter in response to Ahcy knockdown in cultured cells. Thus, the one-carbon metabolism enzyme Ahcy senses changes in cellular redox homeostasis through a conserved cysteine residue that alters its activity, enabling rapid changes in gene expression that enable a neuroprotective response.},

  abstract     = {Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are being extensively researched as replacements for liquid electrolytes in future batteries. Despite significant advancements, there are still challenges in using SSEs, particularly in extreme conditions. This study presents a hydrated metal-organic ionic cocrystal (HMIC) solid-state ion conductor with a solvent-assisted ion transport mechanism suitable for extreme operating conditions. Through crystal engineering strategies, the adsorption capacity of HMIC for anions and water molecules can be regulated, thereby facilitating cation hopping transport and enhancing electrochemical stability. As a result, optimized HMIC shows exceptional properties, including an extraordinarily high Zn 2+ transference number (t Zn2+ = 0.81), an expanded electrochemical stability window (~2.6 V), and an exceptionally high Zn 2+ ion conductivity (8.6 mS cm –1 , 25 °C). Interface dynamics analysis indicates that this strong binding to water molecules can significantly reduce the desolvation energy barrier and enhance the ionic diffusion coefficient. (10 to 100 times higher than that in aqueous electrolytes). This allows Zn|| Prussian blue analog batteries to exhibit impressive fast-charging performance (180 C, 20 s, over 1,000 charge/discharge cycles) and maintain 100% discharge capacity retention and discharge plateau from –30 to 30 °C. The development of HMICs with a solvent-assisted hopping mechanism provides a promising path for solid-state zinc-ion batteries in extreme conditions, including fast charging, low temperature, and high loading.},

  abstract     = {The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is critical for maintaining cerebral homeostasis, and its deterioration with age is an important pathogenic factor in the etiology of vascular dementia. Extracellular matrix–integrin interactions play a central role in regulating vascular stability. The αvβ3 integrin is not expressed by brain endothelial cells under stable conditions but is strongly induced by hypoxia. However, it is currently unclear whether αvβ3 integrin exerts a destructive or protective influence on BBB integrity. In young (8 to 10 wk) and aged (20 mo) mice, we examined the impact of a function-blocking β3 integrin antibody as well as the inhibitory peptide cilengitide on BBB disruption during exposure to CMH (8% O 2 ). Hypoxic induction of brain endothelial β3 integrin was much stronger in aged mice. In both young and aged mice, β3 integrin inhibition greatly amplified hypoxia-induced BBB disruption, correlating with loss of tight junction proteins and induction of the leaky BBB marker mouse endothelial cell antigen (MECA)-32. Consistent with this, β3 integrin null mice showed increased levels of hypoxia-induced BBB disruption and MECA-32 expression. Cilengitide also reduced the integrity of a brain endothelial monolayer in vitro, prevented β3 integrin localization to focal adhesions, and reduced expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and tight junction proteins. These observations suggest that hypoxic induction of endothelial αvβ3 integrin enhances BBB integrity by stabilizing endothelial adhesion. This raises the interesting possibility that pharmacological upregulation of endothelial αvβ3 integrin in the aged brain might hold therapeutic promise for vascular dementia.},

Specifically, the effect of the deformation-director coupling on LCE fracture paths is unknown, and fracture criteria for LCEs are not yet established. To address this gap, we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to investigate fracture propagation in LCEs. We stretch edge-cracked monodomain LCE samples, recording their stress-stretch responses and crack paths under varying initial directors and stretching rates. Our findings reveal that cracks can change direction during propagation, which are highly dependent on both the initial director and the stretching rate. To further understand LCE fracture behavior, we develop a rate-dependent phase-field fracture model, which is validated through experiments, and demonstrates the ability to predict complex fracture paths. Our study paves the way for designing LCEs with enhanced fracture properties, imperative for their future applications.},

  abstract     = {The optimal control of finite-time processes on the microscale is of significant theoretical and practical interest, particularly for the energy-efficient operation of nanomachines. While previous studies have primarily focused on transitions between equilibrium states, many biologically and technologically relevant processes occur far from equilibrium. In such nonequilibrium settings, memory, a ubiquitous feature in realistic systems, plays an intricate role, as any driving necessarily excites internal memory modes. This motivates a deeper exploration of optimal control strategies in nonequilibrium regimes. Here, we combine experiments, theory, and computational methods to investigate the transition of a colloidal particle confined in an optical trap between two nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). We identify optimal control protocols that minimize the thermodynamic work during the finite-time transition between two NESS. We compare optimal protocols in viscous and viscoelastic fluid environments, which are common in realistic technical and biological processes and introduce memory due to a delayed response. Regardless of the presence of memory effects, optimal protocols consistently balance energy extraction with dissipation minimization. In the presence of memory, optimal control is achieved if the protocol matches the time response of the environment. These findings offer key insights for designing optimal control strategies for finite-time, nonequilibrium processes in complex environments.},

To identify tumor-intrinsic regulators of immunotherapy resistance and explore therapeutic strategies to restore T cell–mediated tumor control, we employed three functional genomics approaches using in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screening. Cancer USP14 was identified as the critical immune evasion driver. USP14-high HCC patients exhibited poorer anti-PD1 antibody therapy responses and reduced CD8+ T cell infiltration. Inhibition of USP14 suppressed HCC cell growth in coculture with activated CD8+ T cells and restored cocultured CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. In vivo USP14 targeting synergized with anti-PD1 antibody therapy. Mechanistically, USP14 deubiquitinated and stabilized GLUT1 through the removal of Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains at Lys-245, which enabled HCC cells to outcompete CD8+ T cells for glucose, generating a glucose-deprived tumor microenvironment that suppressed CD8+ T cell function. Our findings show USP14 in cancer has a proimmunoevasive role in CD8+ T cell–based tumor immunity through GLUT1-mediated glucose competition. These findings position USP14 inhibitors as promising adjuvants to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in HCC, providing actionable insights for overcoming resistance.},

  abstract     = {R-loops are an important class of non-B DNA structures that form co-transcriptionally. Using in vitro transcription and unbiased quantitative sequencing readouts, we show that the addition of single-strand DNA binding proteins co-transcriptionally can drive a 3- to 5-fold increase of R-loop frequency without significant changes to R-loop distribution. We propose that this is caused by stabilizing and preventing the collapse of short nascent R-loops. This suggests that R-loop formation is highly dynamic and highlights single strand binding proteins as players in cellular R-loop regulation. We further show that nontemplate strand DNA nicks are powerful initiators of R-loop formation, increasing R-loop frequencies by up to two orders of magnitude. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the nontemplate strand in nick-initiated structures is often flayed away from the RNA:DNA hybrid and engaged in self-pairing, creating unique forked R-loop features. DNA nicks, one of the most frequent DNA lesions in cells, are therefore potential hotspots for opportunistic R-loop initiation and may cause the formation of a distinct class of R-loops. Overall, this work highlights the importance of the displaced single-strand on R-loop initiation and dynamics.},

Both traditional regression methods and modern machine-learning approaches require specialized data labels, which often cannot be sufficiently obtained from experiments. This data demand makes many sophisticated models impractical for real-world problems. Improvements in digital image correlation techniques have enabled accurate measurements of displacement data, providing an alternative kinematics-based approach for model identification. However, for materials undergoing plastic deformation, fracture, and damage, the corresponding inverse problem could be inherently challenging due to the dependence on loading history. We overcome this by formulating an inverse problem to discover interpretable plasticity models parameterized by neural networks (NN) from kinematic observations, leveraging a differentiable simulator with a smooth constitutive update that enables backpropagation for the NN training. The ability to use kinematic observations to infer complex material models may pave the way for a massive generation of material models that can be game-changing for emerging applications such as the design of metamaterials, response surface analyses, and the design of experiments.},

However, the role of pseudouridylation in infection is poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) manipulates the pseudouridylation pathway to enhance replication. We show that the pseudouridine synthases (PUS), PUS1, and PUS7 are essential for efficient KSHV lytic replication, supported by their redistribution to viral replication and transcription complexes. We present a comprehensive analysis of KSHV RNA pseudouridylation, revealing hundreds of modified RNAs at single-nucleotide resolution. Notably, we demonstrate that pseudouridylation of the KSHV-encoded polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN) plays a significant role in the expression of PAN RNA.

  abstract     = {Arsenic contamination in rice poses a global challenge to food safety and agricultural productivity, as toxic methylated arsenic species—dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and its highly toxic derivative, methylated monothioarsenate (DMMTA)—accumulate in rice grains. These arsenic species endanger human health and trigger rice straighthead disease, a crop disorder that drastically reduces yields. However, the microbial ecological processes driving arsenic speciation in paddy soils, and their link to striking geographic disparities in rice arsenic speciation profiles and disease prevalence, remain poorly understood. Here, we integrate soil chronosequences spanning 1 to 2,000 y of rice cultivation, a global metagenomic survey of 801 paddy soils, controlled incubations, and field surveys to demonstrate that the balance between arsenic-methylating and arsenic-demethylating microbes is the key determinant of rice grain arsenic speciation and straighthead disease susceptibility. We show that young and moderate-age paddy soils (<700 y), common in regions such as the Americas and Europe, are enriched in arsenic-methylating bacteria, leading to elevated DMA and DMMTA in soils and rice grains. In contrast, ancient paddies in Southeast Asia harbor robust populations of DMA-demethylating methanogenic archaea that effectively mitigate the buildup of these toxic arsenic species. We identify core microbial taxa whose abundances serve as predictive biomarkers and construct a global risk map linking a high methylator-to-demethylator ratio in soils with increased straighthead disease incidence. These findings advance our understanding of arsenic biogeochemistry in agroecosystems and establish a predictive framework for identifying regions at elevated risk of arsenic-induced crop disorders and food contamination.},

In this study, we introduce a design approach for physically intelligent underactuated mechanisms capable of autonomously adjusting their motion in response to environmental interactions. Specifically, multistability is harnessed to sequence the motion of different degrees of freedom in a programmed order. A key aspect of this approach is that this order can be passively reprogrammed through mechanical stimuli arising from interactions with the environment. To showcase our approach, we construct a mechanism that passively sorts objects based on their mass and a four-degree-of-freedom robot capable of autonomously moving away from obstacles. Remarkably, these devices operate without relying on traditional computational architectures and utilize only a single linear actuator.},

  abstract     = {Seasonal changes in time policy, such as switching between Standard Time (SDT) and Daylight Saving Time (DST), have been adopted by many countries, including the United States. While transitioning between SDT and DST has notable acute negative population health impacts, the chronic impact of these time policies on health has not been well evaluated. To estimate the impact of permanent SDT or DST on health, we modeled the circadian impact of SDT, DST, and Biannual Shifting (BAS) across a year in the contiguous, continental United States. We find that BAS produces a greater burden on the circadian system as compared to either permanent SDT or DST. Chronotype as well as location (latitude and location within time zones) impact this burden. Analyzing these data relative to county-level health data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Places dataset), we find that, under idealized light exposure conditions and after controlling for health and socioeconomic factors, there would be a decrease in the prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.78% ( − 0.06% to − 1.49%)] and stroke [ − 0.09% ( − 0.04% to − 0.14%)] under SDT compared with the current policy. The prevalence of both obesity [ − 0.51% ( − 0.09% to − 0.93%)] and stroke [ − 0.07% ( − 0.04% to − 0.09%)] would also decrease under permanent DST, though to a lesser degree. Our data, reflecting the impact of time policy on circadian burden and subsequent health benefits, support the cessation of BAS.},

NR-interacting protein 1 (NRIP1) is an important coregulator of various NRs that has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease risk, but mechanistic details of how NRIP1 controls NR activities mediating immune homeostasis and inflammation remain elusive. We demonstrate that a missense risk variant, NRIP1 R448G, promotes activated CD4 + T cell gut homing and inflammatory cytokine production, ultimately leading to exacerbated intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, NRIP1 acts as a corepressor in retinoic acid signaling by expression of a gut-homing transcriptional program. Our study reveals the impacts of NRIP1 on CD4 + T cells in immune regulation during intestinal inflammation, providing insights into mechanisms by which an NR coregulator controls immune homeostasis and tissue inflammation.},

  abstract     = {The RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF) are essential components of the RAS-ERK signaling pathway, which controls vital cellular processes and is frequently dysregulated in human disease. Notably, mutations that alter BRAF function are prominent drivers of human cancer and certain RASopathy disorders, making BRAF an important target for therapeutic intervention. Despite extensive research, several aspects of BRAF regulation remain unclear. In this study, we developed an in vitro BRAF activation assay using purified autoinhibited BRAF:14-3-3 2 :MEK complexes. Our results show that fully processed, active-state KRAS alone can promote dimer-dependent BRAF activation. Moreover, we found that phosphatidylserine (PS)-containing liposomes synergized with KRAS to promote BRAF activation, achieving activity levels comparable to those observed with BRAF proteins that constitutively dimerize. In contrast, the SMP phosphatase complex had only a minimal effect on BRAF catalytic activity in this system but mediated the dephosphorylation of the negative regulatory pS365 14-3-3 binding site in a manner that was accelerated by the presence of KRAS alone or KRAS and 30% PS liposomes. Finally, we show that inhibitors blocking the BRAF RBD:KRAS interaction were able to suppress the in vitro activation of BRAF, underscoring the critical role of RAS binding in initiating the disassembly of the BRAF autoinhibited state. Thus, this assay provides valuable insights into the steps required for BRAF activation and can serve as an effective screening tool for identifying compounds that may inhibit this process and have therapeutic potential.},

  abstract     = {In biological membranes, proteins face a fundamentally different environment than in water. To avoid untenable lipid contacts with polar backbone atoms, they use the continuous hydrogen bonding achieved by α-helices or β-barrels to traverse membranes. Here, we show that integrin αX, and by homology αM, undermine this paradigm by partially unfolding the N-terminal third of their transmembrane (TM) helix. Unfolding results in a dynamic, frayed helix that weakens the association with its partnering β2 subunit to lower the activation threshold of integrin αXβ2-mediated cell adhesion. The extent of unfolding depends on membrane geometry, thereby establishing a mechanism for sensing membrane properties. The combination of adhesive control with sensory capacity in integrin αXβ2 and αMβ2 may achieve membrane localization-dependent receptor activation in leukocyte phagocytosis. The unfolding of the αX TM helix arises from a high number of α-helix-destabilizing residues that TM helices in general approach but do not exceed. Accordingly, backbone dynamics of TM helices may disrupt hydrogen bonds, modulate protein function, and optimize TM helix rigidity.},

  abstract     = {Recent discovery of “extreme clustering” of inertial particles in isotropic turbulent flow suggests a hidden mechanism of particle–particle interaction at sub-Kolmogorov separations unexplained by hydrodynamic interaction. The near-contact radial distribution function (RDF) reaches O ( 10 4 ) , resulting in a collision kernel four orders larger than direct numerical simulation predictions. Statistical stationarity is lost in the particle-laden turbulence, suggesting the particles experience a nonequilibrium process. We hypothesize dielectric particles in isotropic turbulence experience contact electrification through interparticle collisions, creating inhomogeneous mosaic surface charge. These mosaic charges lead to attractive forces and thereby extreme clustering and collision amplification, forming a positive feedback loop. To explore this potential mechanism, we investigated hollow glass spheres dispersed in a high-Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic air turbulence chamber using high-resolution 3D particle tracking velocimetry and Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM). We measured RDF, particle-pair mean-inward radial relative velocity, and mean radial relative acceleration (RA) with time up to 10 min. We sampled particles from the flow chamber through time and evaluated their nanoscopic charge distribution using KPFM. We found that both RDF and mosaic surface charge increase with time; RA at close separations is attractive, intensifies as particles approach, and grows in time; and the turbulence-exposed RA curves collapse when nondimensionalized by the dipole–dipole acceleration calculated from mosaic charge distributions. These results support the proposed mechanism—Inhomogeneous Mosaic Potential Amplified Collisions in Turbulence (IMPACT). Better understanding and modeling of these effects could improve predictions for air pollution, weather patterns, and drug manufacturing—where particle interactions have big impacts.},

Interestingly, these RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils were capable of infiltrating recipient cells and acting as seeds for the nucleation and formation of the endogenous necrosome. Cryo electron microscopy structural analysis unveiled a distinctive S-shaped conformation common to RHIM fibrils of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which can facilitate the cross-seeding of RIPK3 by RIPK1 or RIPK1/RIPK3 fibrils. Our findings suggest the ability of functional RIPK1/RIPK3 amyloid fibrils in intercellular spreading to induce protein conformation change in recipient cells and provide structural insights into the mechanism of RIPK1 and RIPK3 cross-templating to drive necroptosis.},

  abstract     = {Palytoxin (PTX), a potent marine toxin, has long been known to transform Na + ,K + -ATPase (NKA), an indispensable ion pump, into a nonselective cation channel. It has been postulated that PTX takes control of the two gates on either side of a channel-like pore. These gates normally open and close alternately, synchronized with chemical events, never opening simultaneously. A critical question is whether palytoxin takes over the control of the two gates or creates a new pathway. Here, we present structures of NKA with bound palytoxin in three different states. PTX binds to NKA in E2P, occupying the physiological Na + exit pathway, similar to istaroxime, a new-generation cardiotonic steroid. Adding Na + and ATP/ADP to the NKA·PTX complex induces an open channel traversing the entire membrane alongside the physiological ion pathway. As AlF x , a stable transition state analog of phosphate replaces phosphate in the NKA·PTX complex preformed in E2P, the complex appears to undergo the normal reaction cycle from E2P to E1· n Na + . PTX occupies the space between the transmembrane helices M4 and M6, thereby preventing the closure of the extracellular half of the ion pathway. These structures demonstrate that the architecture of NKA is fundamentally different from “a pore with two gates.” Each half of the ion pathway comprises three segments, including a movable component that plays a pivotal role in translocating the bound cations by connecting the constant part to an appropriate inlet. The ion pathway of NKA transforms dynamically, ensuring that the two halves never exist simultaneously.},

  abstract     = {The Casas Grandes region in northwest Chihuahua, Mexico, is ideally situated to explore the notion of contact between the US Southwest/Northwest Mexico and Mesoamerica, as it lies geographically in a region where cultural traditions were combined in unique ways. In order to explain these dynamics, past researchers have suggested that the primary catalyst for the flourishing Casas Grandes population in the thirteenth century A.D. was caused by migrants from Mesoamerica or from larger populations to the north. We analyzed mitochondrial genetic data from individuals interred at sites that date to earlier (A.D. 700–1200) and later (A.D. 1200–1450) time periods, which allowed us to examine changes in gene pools over time and to test these migration hypotheses. Comparing the full mitogenomes from 114 individuals, we show that low levels of migration occurred diachronically, although they still may have contributed to hybridized cultural practices. These data counter the long-standing assumption that widescale population replacement was the cause for the rise of Paquimé, the center of the Casas Grandes world in the thirteenth-century A.D.},

Acyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase medium-chain family member 3 (ACSM3), a key enzyme of medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) metabolism, has been implicated in metabolic syndrome, but its function in fibrotic kidney remains unexplored. Here, we found that tubular epithelial ACSM3 expression was downregulated in kidney fibrotic mice and patients and inversely correlated with disease severity. Systemic and tubular-specific knockout of ACSM3 both exacerbated renal fibrosis, whereas adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated ACSM3 overexpression alleviated fibrotic kidneys in mice. Mechanistically, ACSM3 deficiency disrupted MCFA metabolism and resulted in abnormal mitochondrial homeostasis. Notably, we identified that dodecanoic acid (C12:0) could improve kidney fibrosis, which was primarily utilized via ACSM3 in kidneys. Furthermore, C12:0 oxidation impairment caused by tubular ACSM3 deficiency aggravated fibrotic kidney. Together, ACSM3-regulated MCFA metabolism played a pivotal role in kidney fibrosis, highlighting a potent drug target of ACSM3 and a potential supplementary therapy of MCFA against chronic kidney disease.},

  abstract     = {With the advent and widespread use of messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), RNA vaccines have emerged as an exciting class of vaccine offering low cost, rapid development, and high modularity and manufacturability. Protein-coding circular RNA (circRNA) is an emerging class of RNA cargo that offers increased stability compared to mRNA with potentially reduced immunogenicity, but delivery technologies for intracellular delivery of circRNA remain underexplored. Here, we develop an optimized lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform for circRNA delivery to immune cells, observing strong and durable transgene expression in vitro and in vivo. We employ a design-of-experiments (DoE) methodology to identify key formulation parameters for enhanced circRNA delivery and, upon intramuscular administration of our optimized circRNA LNPs to mice, observe substantial accumulation within draining lymph nodes and strong dendritic cell (DC) maturation at short time points. Applying this optimized circRNA LNP platform to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate robust antibody production and enhanced immune responses in mice compared to vaccination with mRNA LNPs, including strong T h 1-biased cellular responses and a 3.8-fold increase in antigen-specific reciprocal endpoint IgG titers. These results provide insights into design criteria for circRNA LNP formulations and support the use of circRNA LNPs for vaccination against infectious diseases.},

  abstract     = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle-wasting disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and inflammation caused by mutations in the DMD gene. Chronic inflammation in DMD exacerbates the complications associated with disease progression. Since the lymphatic system plays a crucial role in regulating and resolving inflammation, our primary goal was to investigate whether lymphatics were dysregulated in skeletal muscle of DMD animals. We used the D2.mdx murine and golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine models, as well as mouse and rat lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) to determine the role of dystrophin in lymphatic structure and function in skeletal muscles. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from control LMCs showed dystrophin expression, and protein results demonstrated that the 427-, 140-, and 71-kDa dystrophin isoforms were detectable in the LMCs from control mice, whereas the 427 kDa isoform was undetectable in LMCs derived from D2.mdx mice. Microlymphangiography and magnetic resonance lymphangiogram results showed a significant decrease in lymph transport in D2. mdx mice and GRMD dogs, respectively. Isolated flank lymphatic vessels from D2. mdx mice exhibited an increase in tonic contraction and a significant decrease in the phasic contractile frequency and amplitude, supporting lymphatic vessel dysfunction. The gene expression profile and immunofluorescence analyses of dystrophic muscle revealed inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in dystrophic muscle. Skeletal muscle tissues that showed improvement in function after adeno-associated virus-microdystrophin treatment also showed significant improvement in inflammatory lymphangiogenesis in GRMD dogs. Thus, these results show a linkage between lymphatic function and DMD pathogenesis that merits further investigation in DMD patients.},

  abstract     = {The human gut microbiome plays a central role in nutrient metabolism, yet the fate of exogenous nucleic acids within this ecosystem remains poorly understood. Here, we show that multiple Bacteroidales species efficiently metabolize exogenous DNA, with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron converting it into the deaminated nucleobases uracil and xanthine. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we identify ddbABCDEF , a six-gene locus encoding secreted nucleases and an outer membrane transporter, essential for exogenous DNA metabolism in B. thetaiotaomicron . Colonization of gnotobiotic mice with ddbABCDEF mutants reveals that this pathway significantly alters nucleobase pools in a gnotobiotic mouse model. Comparative genomic analyses demonstrate that ddbABCDEF is evolutionarily related to a natural transformation system present in Bacteroidota and has diversified into four distinct subtypes, each linked to unique DNA-processing activities in closely related gut Bacteroidales strains. These findings thus expand our understanding of DNA metabolism in the gut microbiome and reveal a distinctive pathway for nucleobase production with implications for host–microbe interactions.},

  abstract     = {Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic “triangular keyhole” shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular keyhole shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and find that the hindgut deforms in two stages: An initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.},

  abstract     = {The use of AI, or more generally data-driven algorithms, has become ubiquitous in today’s society. Yet, in many cases and especially when stakes are high, humans still make final decisions. The critical question, therefore, is whether AI helps humans make better decisions compared to a human-alone or AI-alone system. We introduce a methodological framework to answer this question empirically with minimal assumptions. We measure a decision maker’s ability to make correct decisions using standard classification metrics based on the baseline potential outcome. We consider a single-blinded and unconfounded treatment assignment, in which the provision of AI-generated recommendations is assumed to be randomized across cases, conditional on observed covariates, with final decisions made by humans. Under this study design, we show how to compare the performance of three alternative decision-making systems—human-alone, human-with-AI, and AI-alone. Importantly, the AI-alone system encompasses any individualized treatment assignment, including those not used in the original study. We also show when AI recommendations should be provided to a human-decision maker, and when one should follow such recommendations. We apply the proposed methodology to our own randomized controlled trial evaluating a pretrial risk assessment instrument. We find that the risk assessment recommendations do not improve the classification accuracy of a judge’s decision to impose cash bail. Furthermore, replacing a human judge with algorithms—the risk assessment score and a large language model in particular—yields worse classification performance.},

  abstract     = {Elastic turbulence (ET) and elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) of viscoelastic fluids are unique flow states with features distinct from the inertial turbulence of Newtonian fluids. Whether these two states are connected or entirely decoupled remains controversial. We here resolve this controversy by providing experimental evidence of a continuous transition between ET and EIT in Taylor-Couette flow. Through experimentally quantifying the roles of elasticity and inertia in flow stability, we find that elasticity is the primary driving mechanism for both elastic and elastoinertial instabilities, and inertia plays a secondary role in the latter. Remarkably, the critical condition for these instabilities can be described by a unified function derived from stability analysis, revealing that the transition between elastic instability to elastoinertial instability is continuous. Moreover, we show that the flow structures and the energy spectrum evolve seamlessly from ET to elasticity-dominated EIT, transitional EIT, and inertia-modulated EIT, with inertia playing an increasingly important role in the last three regimes. Our results offer insights into the fundamental nature of turbulence in viscoelastic flows and would have implications for applications involving drag reduction and polymer processing.},

The engineered variants offer a promising pathway for increasing Reb M production, advancing biotechnological strategies for steviol glycoside biosynthesis and optimizing plant metabolic engineering approaches.

High-dimensional immunostaining of murine mammary tumor progression revealed that MTMs were localized in the peritumoral stroma and associated with eosinophils, which were previously shown to facilitate antitumor T cell responses. The depletion of MTMs accelerated tumorigenesis in both spontaneous and orthotopically transplanted mammary tumor models. Upon induction of a productive antitumor response via the depletion of regulatory T cells, MTMs assumed an alternatively activated state and expressed eotaxins, thereby attracting eosinophils to peritumoral regions. MTMs expressed the receptor for the alarmin IL-33, which induced both MTM activation and eosinophil recruitment. These results suggest that MTMs can sense IL-33 and recruit eosinophils to facilitate antitumor immunity, a mechanism that may operate during tumor progression and be further enhanced during productive antitumor responses.},

Using two-dimensional numerical models of mantle convection with sharp and broad mineral phase transitions for pyrolite, we show that both scales of upwellings can be generated in a stagnant lid planet with an interior temperature 250 to 400 K warmer than Earth’s. The smaller plumes originate from a ~600 km deep internal layer that exists as a consequence of the different sequence of mineral phase transitions that occur in warmer mantles less processed and differentiated by partial melting and volcanism. Future models that include melting will provide further tests of our hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {Insulin potently decreases blood glucose; thus, tight control is required to prevent excessive insulin release and hypoglycemia. Central to this inhibition is somatostatin released from delta cells that are clustered with beta cells in pancreatic islets. This communication is of interest because the loss of functional beta cells in diabetes leads to uncontrolled delta cell activity that disrupts islet paracrine crosstalk. While it is established that insulin and somatostatin secretion are coordinated, the specific mechanism is unsettled. We have previously demonstrated that beta cells release the hormone Urocortin 3 to stimulate delta cells at high glucose, demonstrating a paracrine negative feedback loop. Others have proposed direct coordination via gap junctions. To resolve this conundrum, we used the genetically encoded fluorescent Ca 2+ reporter GCaMP6s to simultaneously record the activity of hundreds of beta and delta cells in low (2.8 mM) (LG) and high (16.8 mM) glucose (HG). Surprisingly, while many delta cells exhibit Ca 2+ oscillations in HG that are coordinated with beta cells, the activation of these delta cells precedes beta cells and is more variable than beta cell responses. The selective delta cell knockout of connexin 36 confirmed the involvement of gap junctions. However, blockade of vesicle release with the Rho-GTPase inhibitor ML-141 completely removed coupling between beta and most delta cells in HG. Our data reveal considerable functional heterogeneity among delta cells, where most delta cells are entrained by oscillatory Ca 2+ behaviors of beta cells that are mediated by a combination of paracrine signaling and low-density gap junction coupling.},

These proposals were based on studies of the principal σ factor of Escherichia coli , σ 70 , which generally, albeit not obligatorily, is released from RNAP upon the transition from transcription initiation to elongation. Here, we show that, in contrast to E. coli σ 70 , the Bacillus subtilis principal σ factor, σ A , is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We further show that a mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ region 1.1 (σ R1.1) is not released and is retained on RNAP core throughout transcription elongation. We also observe that B. subtilis σ A and the mutant E. coli σ 70 derivative lacking σ R1.1 interact much more stably with RNAP than full-length E. coli σ 70 . Our results indicate that the σ cycle is not a universal phenomenon in bacteria.},

  abstract     = {To survive in highly competitive environments, bacteria use specialized secretion systems to deliver antibacterial toxins into neighboring cells, thereby inhibiting their growth. In many Gram-positive bacteria, the export of such toxins requires a membrane-bound molecular apparatus known as the type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb). Recently, it was shown that toxin recruitment to the T7SSb requires a physical interaction between a toxin and two or more so-called targeting factors, which harbor key residues required for T7SS-dependent protein export. However, in addition to these targeting factors, some toxins additionally require a protein belonging to the DUF4176 protein family. Here, by examining two toxin–DUF4176 protein pairs, we demonstrate that DUF4176 constitutes a family of toxin-specific molecular chaperones. In addition to being required for toxin stability in producing cells, we find that DUF4176 proteins facilitate toxin export by specifically interacting with a previously uncharacterized intrinsically disordered region found in many T7SS toxins. Using X-ray crystallography, we determine structures of several DUF4176 chaperones in their unbound state, and of a DUF4176 chaperone in complex with the binding site of its cognate toxin. These structures reveal that this binding site consists of a disordered amphipathic α-helix that requires interaction with its cognate chaperone for proper folding. Overall, we have identified a family of secretion system associated molecular chaperones found throughout T7SSb-containing Gram-positive bacteria.},

  abstract     = {Social networks scaffold the diffusion of information on social media. Much attention has been given to the spread of true vs. false content on online social platforms, including the structural differences between their diffusion patterns. However, much less is known about how platform interventions on false content alter the engagement with and diffusion of such content. In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,078 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 46.1% in reposts, 44.1% in likes, 21.9% in replies, and 13.5% in views after being attached. Over the posts’ entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.6% fewer reposts, 13.3% fewer likes, 6.9% fewer replies, and 5.5% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep and less “viral,” but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach. This structural difference contrasts notably with differences between false vs. true content diffusion itself, where false information diffuses farther, but with structural patterns that are otherwise indistinguishable from those of true information, conditional on reach.},

Integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with Life Cycle Costing (LCC), we quantified the environmental impacts alongside capital and operational costs, net present costs, and break-even prices of each route. The results reveal significant variation across the schemes, with Schemes #1 and #2 exhibiting the highest impacts and costs due to intensive use of chloroform and diethyl ether, while Scheme #8 demonstrated the lowest impacts and costs, benefitting from higher batch output, greener solvents, and process intensification. Scenario analyses showed that solvent recovery improves sustainability only when high recovery rates are combined with clean electricity; otherwise, the additional energy demand may offset benefits. Scale-up analysis confirmed that higher production scales substantially reduce per-gram impacts and costs, supporting economies of scale. These findings highlight the critical role of solvent management, energy sourcing, the use of sustainability assessment at the earliest stages of innovation, and process design in aligning green chemistry with economic viability. The proposed integrated LCA-LCC framework provides transferable insights to guide sustainable pharmaceutical manufacturing and supports the development of evidence-based policy for greener antiviral drug production.},

  abstract     = {Influenza A virus (IAV) entry into host cells begins with interactions between the viral envelope proteins hemagglutinin (HA)/neuraminidase (NA) and sialic acid moieties on the cell plasma membrane. These interactions drive IAV’s lateral diffusion along the cell membrane and trigger membrane morphological changes required for endocytosis. However, directly visualizing these dynamic processes, which are crucial for IAV entry, has been challenging using conventional microscopy techniques. In this study, we enabled live-cell observation of nanoscale morphological dynamics of IAV and the cell membrane by reducing the mechanical invasiveness of atomic force microscopy (AFM). A customised cantilever with less than half the spring constant of conventional cantilevers enabled virus-view AFM imaging that preserved IAV–membrane interactions. By combining virus-view AFM with confocal microscopy, we performed correlative morphological and fluorescence observations of IAV lateral diffusion and endocytosis in living cells. Variations in diffusion coefficients of single virions suggested heterogeneity in sialic acid density on the cell membrane. NA inhibition decreased diffusion coefficients, while reduced sialic acid density increased them. The timing of clathrin accumulation at virion binding sites coincided with a decrease in diffusion coefficients, a relationship that was maintained independent of NA activity or sialic acid density. As clathrin assembly progressed, ~100-nm-high membrane bulges emerged adjacent to the virus, culminating in the complete membrane envelopment of the virus at peak clathrin accumulation. Our virus-view AFM will deepen our understanding of various virus–cell interactions, facilitate the evaluation of drug effects and promote future translational research.},

  abstract     = {Our spontaneous thoughts encompass various dimensions, such as task-relatedness (off vs. on task), and thought orientation (internal vs. external). However, their distinction remains unclear. Our study addresses this issue by focusing on their timescales at both the behavioral level (using fast and slow finger tapping) and the neural level (using EEG) using two independent datasets (N = 84 and 35). Behavioral results revealed a double dissociation: Task-relatedness was linked to fast tapping only, whereas thought orientation was associated with slow tapping only. At the neural level, we assessed topographic similarity in EEG to quantify the temporal influence of past neural activity on current ones. Task-relatedness modulated topographic similarity only during fast tapping, while thought orientation did so only during slow tapping. Critically, topographic similarity was phase-based, as shown by its correlation with phase-locking value and the loss of associations with thought after phase-shuffling. This indicates that the neural signatures of both thought dimensions are strongly phase-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that nonlinearity plays a distinct role mediating the impact of different timescales (slow and fast finger tapping) on spontaneous thoughts at both behavioral (precision error) and neural levels (topographic similarity). Overall, these results demonstrate that task-relatedness is associated with short timescales, whereas thought orientation is associated with long timescales. This highlights how distinct temporal dynamics shape different spontaneous thought dimensions on both their behavioral and neural features.},

  abstract     = {Unlike gas molecules at equilibrium, the spatial organization of self-propelled particles can be very sensitive to what happens at the boundaries of their container. Understanding the link between boundary phenomena and bulk stationary distributions could enable the design of optimized container shapes for the geometric control of confined active particles. Here, we propose a boundary method based on the flux transfer formalism typical of radiometry problems, where surface elements transmit and receive “rays” of active particles with infinite persistence length. We demonstrate the power of this boundary method in the case of the swimming microalgae Euglena gracilis trapped in light-defined billiard geometries. Quite surprisingly, we found that Euglena scatters with a nearly Lambertian cosine law, resembling the behavior of blackbody radiation and consequently resulting in nearly uniform distributions inside simple cavity geometries. Nevertheless, leveraging our boundary method, we were able to design a stacked multistage billiard geometry, with a connection scheme between subunits that breaks spatial symmetry and achieves an exponential amplification of cell concentration between its two ends. Our method can be applied to confined active matter in contexts ranging from spatial control and sorting of microorganisms to the design of efficient navigation strategies for microscopic and macroscopic robots.},

Here, we present a high luminous-intensity photobleacher that is based on rigorous simulations of illumination patterns, along with the framework to maximize bleaching efficiency.

Humanized mice, generated by transplanting human hematopoietic stem, progenitor cells into genetically modified mice, are invaluable to study human immune development and function in vivo. However, a major limitation of current models is suboptimal myelopoiesis, particularly lack of functional human neutrophils, hampering the modeling of human immune responses and chronic diseases. Here, we describe a humanized mouse model, named MaGIC for genes replaced, in the C57Bl/6 N strain, which improves human myelopoiesis and enables development of functional human neutrophils. In MaGIC mice, human cytokines M-CSF/CSF1(M), GM-CSF/CSF2(G) and IL-6(I) are knocked-in replacing mouse genes and murine IL2rg and Rag1 (a) are deleted. Human THPO in these mice supports human hematopoiesis. More importantly, insertion of human CD47 (C) under the control of endogenous mouse CD47 promoter enables xenotransplantation and human neutrophil development. MaGIC mice support all human neutrophil subsets found in human bone marrow and blood, a major improvement. This is achieved by creating a niche postirradiation for human granulocyte–macrophage progenitors via reduced murine CD47 and physiological levels of human CD47. These mice also have mature human monocytes, tissue macrophages, alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and NK cells, enabled by humanized M-CSF and GM-CSF. Human neutrophils in MaGIC mice are fully functional in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and neutrophil extracellular trap formation in response to inflammation. MaGIC mice address critical gaps in current models and enable incisive translational research on human neutrophils, advancing studies in infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.},

Functional characterization using Slc39a8 A391T knock-in mice and kidney-specific Slc39a8 knockout mice reveals that loss of SLC39A8 function reduces renal zinc accumulation, thereby mitigating susceptibility to kidney injury and disease progression. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that perturbed zinc homeostasis drives renal damage, and limiting zinc levels—whether via impaired SLC39A8 activity or direct chelation—activates the zinc–AKT–FOXO1–G6PC axis to confer protection. Critically, zinc chelation with EDTA recapitulates this benefit, significantly preventing and ameliorating experimental acute and chronic kidney disease. These findings establish renal zinc homeostasis as a key therapeutic node, with SLC39A8 and zinc-modulating strategies representing promising avenues for treating a broad range of kidney diseases.},

  abstract     = {Across all domains of life, cobalamin-dependent methyltransferases have diversified to perform a range of crucial functions, such as methionine synthesis and the demethylation of various reduced nitrogen and sulfur compounds. These large modular enzymes typically possess three substrate-binding domains, two binding either the methyl donor or methyl acceptor, as well as a cobalamin-binding domain. Here, by challenging the current paradigm of glycine betaine (GBT) catabolism, we have identified a unique methyltransferase in aerobic environmental bacteria that has a dual function both as a methionine synthase and a GBT methyltransferase. Using the marine bacterium Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 as a model, we demonstrate that a core cobalamin-binding domain (MtgC) and a bidirectional methyltransferase (MtgD) are essential for both methionine synthesis and GBT demethylation. MtgC is phylogenetically distinct from the cobalamin-binding domains of either the classical methionine synthase (MetH) or the GBT methyltransferases found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Across the global ocean, mtgC expression is frequently greater than previously known GBT catabolic pathways due to its occurrence in abundant cosmopolitan marine bacteria. Thus, we uncover a unique relationship between GBT catabolism and methionine synthesis in nature and identify a major route for N-osmolyte demethylation in the global ocean.},

  abstract     = {Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a clinically important herpesvirus that has coevolved for millions of years with its human host, and establishes lifelong persistent infection. A substantial proportion of its 235 kb genome is dedicated to manipulating host immunity through targeting antiviral host proteins for degradation or relocalization. Quantitative proteomics of the infected cell has extensively characterized these processes, but the cell-free virion has been less well studied. We therefore carried out proteomic analysis of a clinical HCMV strain (Merlin) virion. This revealed 18 novel components, including the viral protein gpUL141, which is recognized as an NK immune-evasin that targets several host proteins (CD155, CD112, and TRAILR) when expressed within the cell. Coimmunoprecipitation of gpUL141 from virions identified interactions with viral entry glycoproteins from the trimer (gH/gL/gO), pentamer (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A), and gH/gpUL116 complexes, as well as gB. Only interactions with gH/gB occurred in the absence of other viral proteins. Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/Golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytium formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.},

  abstract     = {Francis Crick’s global parameterization of coiled coil geometry has been widely useful for guiding design of new protein structures and functions. However, design guided by similar global parameterization of beta barrel structures has been less successful, likely due to the deviations from ideal barrel geometry required to maintain interstrand hydrogen bonding without introducing backbone strain. Instead, beta barrels have been designed using two-dimensional structural blueprints; while this approach has successfully generated new fluorescent proteins, transmembrane nanopores, and other structures, it requires expert knowledge and provides only indirect control over the global shape. Here, we show that the simplicity and control over shape and structure provided by parametric representations can be generalized beyond coiled coils by taking advantage of the rich sequence–structure relationships implicit in RoseTTAFold-based design methods. Starting from parametrically generated barrel backbones, both RFjoint inpainting and RFdiffusion readily incorporate backbone irregularities necessary for proper folding with minimal deviation from the idealized barrel geometries. We show that for beta barrels across a broad range of beta sheet parameterizations, these methods achieve high in silico and experimental success rates, with atomic accuracy confirmed by an X-ray crystal structure of a rare barrel topology, and de novo designed transmembrane nanopores with conductances ranging from 200 to 500 pS. By combining the simplicity and control of parametric generation with the high success rates of deep learning–based protein design methods, our approach makes the design of proteins where global shape confers function, such as beta barrel nanopores, more precisely specifiable and accessible.},

  abstract     = {Scientific explanation is one of the most sophisticated forms of human reasoning. Nevertheless, here we hypothesize that scientific explanation is susceptible to some of the same biases that influence everyday thinking—particularly during the initial stages of theory building, when scientists are first grappling with complex phenomena and are thus more likely to rely on explanatory “guesses.” Specifically, we investigated whether scientific explanation exhibits an inherence bias—a tendency to explain phenomena through inherent or intrinsic features rather than extrinsic factors such as context or relations. Consistent with this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of major explanatory transitions across the history of Western science revealed that initial scientific explanations systematically favored inherent properties, while subsequent explanations incorporated extrinsic factors more consistently. Seven experiments with lay participants (both adults and children; N = 1,673) and two experiments with practicing scientists from top departments worldwide ( N = 275) provided converging evidence for this bias and identified the psychological mechanisms involved. When explaining unfamiliar phenomena, even leading scientists showed a robust tendency to overweight inherent properties and underweight extrinsic factors relative to established scientific understanding. This bias appears rooted in basic cognitive constraints on attention and memory that excessively narrow the space of hypotheses initially considered. These findings advance our understanding of both the psychology of explanation and the development of scientific knowledge, while suggesting specific ways to improve scientific training and education.},

  abstract     = {Tropical cyclones are expected to intensify more rapidly with warming, but relatively little work has examined whether they could expand more rapidly with warming, too. Recent theory predicts that peak expansion rate should increase with sea surface temperature (SST), and physical arguments suggest this dependence should be specifically on the relative SST, i.e. the SST difference from the tropical mean. We test this hypothesis with historical observational data, in which SST variations are primarily variations in relative SST. Both average and peak expansion rates are found to systematically increase with relative SST globally across the Northern Hemisphere (27.2 and 37.5 km/d/K) and within each individual basin. Results are robust across both reanalysis and Best Track observational datasets. Uniform-SST aquaplanet simulations show a much weaker dependence of maximum expansion rate on absolute SST, suggesting that the dominant dependence is on relative SST. Hence, mean global warming is not expected to strongly change storm size dynamics, but patterns of sea surface warming may play an important role in determining how storm size, and hence coastal risk, may change in the future. This work can also help improve forecasting of the wind field and its hazards and impacts at landfall.},

  abstract     = {The Turkana Basin is a renowned paleoanthropological region in Kenya and Ethiopia and is famous for discoveries of numerous hominin fossils and their associated cultural technologies. The Plio-Pleistocene sedimentary sequences hosting these important remains are interbedded with volcanic ash (tuff) beds that provide crucial bracketing age constraints. The Nariokotome Tuff Complex, comprising the Upper, Middle, and Lower Nariokotome Tuffs, preserves deposits that cover an important time interval during the late Early Pleistocene that saw milestone events for Homo erectus and associated technological development. Unfortunately, characterization of these tuffs has been hampered by a) overlapping published eruption ages and b) indistinguishable major element compositions. In addition, fluvial reworking of feldspar-bearing pumice clasts (the target rock for age determinations) from older volcanic deposits into younger tuff layers complicates correct age assignments. Here, we use multiple tephrochronological correlation tools, including high-resolution 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology and grain-specific major- and trace-element geochemistry, to establish a well-characterized geochemical and geochronological framework for the Nariokotome tuffs. Utilizing a modern-generation mass-spectrometer, we report distinct ages for the Upper Nariokotome Tuff at 1,233.1 ± 1.3 ka (± 1.9 ka, 2σ; including external uncertainties), the Middle Nariokotome Tuff at 1,263.4 ± 1.2 ka (± 1.9 ka) and the Lower Nariokotome Tuff at 1,285.8 ± 1.0 ka (± 2.1 ka). In addition, high-spatial resolution Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry trace element compositions provide distinct characterization of each tuff, aiding intrabasin correlation of these units. This combined methodology demonstrates the potential to resolve the stratigraphic complexities associated with assigning ages to key paleoanthropological sites.},

  abstract     = {Despite the many studies on the ubiquitin–proteasome system, our understanding of the proteasome itself is limited. The balance and regulation of 26S and 30S proteasomes are not yet known. Here, we show that among the proteasome base assembly chaperones, only S5b/PSMD5 determines the levels of proteasome holoenzymes, especially the 30S proteasome, in mammals. In a variety of cell lines and mouse tissues, we found that apart from its role in yeast 19S proteasome assembly, loss of S5b/PSMD5 increased assembly toward the 26S and 30S proteasomes. During the process, we identified proteasome complexes that may represent alternative assembly intermediates, including the 19S base complex and 20S complexes harboring 19S subunits, eventually leading to a shift in the overall steady-state level of the 26S and 30S proteasomes. Intriguingly, the addition of the S5b/PSMD5 protein in vitro and its increase in cells efficiently disassembled the 30S proteasome into the 20S and 19S complexes. Increase in the 26S and 30S proteasomes over the 20S proteasome enhances the degradation of the aggregation-prone proteins and ubiquitinated proteins in cells and ameliorates cognitive impairment through the reduction of tau pathology in PS19 mice. These results suggest that 26S and 30S proteasomes are manipulated by S5b/PSMD5 and are beneficial for mitigating proteinopathy in mammals.},

  abstract     = {Bubble-mediated gas exchange associated with wave breaking is a critical pathway for ocean–atmosphere exchange of low solubility gases such as oxygen. Yet, ocean and climate models, as well as observation-based products, usually rely on wind-only air–sea flux formulations derived from carbon constraints that ignore the asymmetric nature of the bubble flux, contributing to discrepancies between estimates of oxygen inventories and their response to climate change. Without bubbles, gas exchange is controlled by a symmetric wind-driven exchange, with the ocean–atmosphere gas partial pressure difference controlling whether outgassing or uptake occurs. Bubbles entrained by wave breaking can enhance this symmetric turbulent exchange, and contribute an additional asymmetric flux, always leading to an uptake, as they get squeezed by hydrostatic pressure (large bubbles) or collapse and fully dissolve (small bubbles). We present an observation-constrained theoretical framework of the air–sea flux accounting for air entrainment due to wave breaking and symmetric and asymmetric bubble exchange. The combined evidence from theory, laboratory, and field measurements of carbon dioxide fluxes, oxygen concentration, and noble gas supersaturation yields a universal formulation of gas exchange which we implement into a global ocean biogeochemical model. We discuss the resulting oxygen fluxes and demonstrate that our wind–wave–bubble formulation better reproduces observed in situ oxygen concentrations in water mass formation regions, where air–sea exchange is high, than a commonly used wind-only formulation. We show that the asymmetric bubble flux is essential for evaluating air–sea oxygen fluxes and estimating the magnitude of the ocean oxygen loss associated with global warming.},

Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset.

  abstract     = {The noncoding small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associate with a large set of proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs). While the function of snRNAs is well characterized, the regulation of their transcription remains poorly understood. Recently, we demonstrated that SUMO conjugation regulates snRNA3′ end processing. To further study the connection between SUMOylation and snRNA biogenesis, we generated a CRISPR/dCas9 tool comprising a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) fused to the catalytic domain of the SUMO protease SENP1 (dCas9-SENP1). Here, we show that snRNA transcription decreases when dCas9-SENP1 is delivered to their promoter-proximal sequence elements (PSE), indicating that SUMO conjugation to proteins associated with snRNA promoters is necessary for proper transcriptional activity. Focusing on SNAPC1, a subunit of the snRNA-specific transcription complex SNAPc, we identified lysine residues 245 and 333 as SUMO acceptor sites and generated a SUMOylation-deficient mutant of this protein (SNAPC1 2KR). To explore the relevance of SNAPC1 SUMOylation on snRNA transcription, we generated a cell line carrying an inducible degron system for depletion of the endogenous SNAPC1 protein. This system led us to demonstrate that SNAPC1 2KR is unable to sustain basal levels of snRNA transcription. By tagging endogenous SNAPC3 and SNAPC4, two other subunits of SNAPc, we show that while SNAPC1 SUMOylation-deficient mutant is able to interact with SNAPC3, its interaction with SNAPC4 is affected, despite the fact it is still recruited to the PSE. Altogether, these results indicate that SNAPC1 SUMOylation is required for proper snRNA transcription and SNAPc complex assembly.},

  abstract     = {Wnt signaling plays a crucial role for many developmental processes. It is also pivotal in the generation and limited treatment outcomes of glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we identified Wnt7b, which is markedly upregulated in GBM patients, as a determinant of resistance to immune checkpoint blockers (αPD1; anti-Programmed Cell Death Protein 1) in a clinically relevant, αPD1-resistant GBM murine model with abundant stem cells. We observed that increased levels of Wnt7b and β-catenin correlated with the resistance to αPD1. Treatment combining a porcupine inhibitor WNT974 with αPD1 reprogrammed the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) to bolster antitumor immune responses and extended the survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM, with 25% long-term survivors. Our causal studies revealed that WNT974 potentiated αPD1 therapy by the expansion of antigen presenting DC3-like dendritic cells (DCs). Additionally, WNT974 combination with αPD1 was associated with a reduction in immune suppressive granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), an increase in the Ki67+CD8/Ki67+regulatory T cells (Treg) ratio, tilting the CD8:Treg balance in the TME toward antitumor immune response, and more pronounced GrzB+CD8+ effector T cells. Conversely, an increase in monocytic MDSCs and phosphorylation of pro-oncogenic proteins was associated with resistance to the combination therapy. Collectively, our preclinical findings provide a strong rationale to test Wnt7b/β-catenin inhibition with αPD1 therapy in GBM patients with elevated Wnt7b/β-catenin signaling.},

To enhance our understanding of dietary niche breadth, we used DNA metabarcoding to examine how diets of a widespread, model herbivore (woodrats, genus Neotoma ) respond to changing resources and the extent to which dietary specialization is conserved across space and time. We used diet data from 13 species, 57 populations, and over 500 individuals to examine predictors of niche breadth and interindividual diet variation at a landscape scale. Then, to test whether these patterns are conserved across scales, we explored the same questions using a single population sampled over 5 y and mark-recapture data from individuals sampled at least three times. We found that woodrats exhibited a continuum of dietary specialization that included species-level dietary generalists and specialists. Specialist species maintained narrow population-level niche breadths with little evidence of interindividual diet variation. In contrast, generalist species consisted of populations with varying degrees of dietary specialization and interindividual diet variation. Across sampling scales, increased population-level niche breadth was explained by both increased interindividual diet variation and increased diet richness. These results are consistent with the Niche Variation Hypothesis and suggest that diet breadth is constrained by costs of both specialization and generalization.},

  abstract     = {Climate policy faces increasingly complex challenges that span multiple human decision scales in nature–society systems. Contemporary climate policy models, while valuable and increasingly versatile in handling spatial and temporal scales, struggle to capture interacting multiscale decisions on the socioeconomic side. This perspective draws attention to the power of coupling among different modeling families, taking integrated assessment models (IAM), computable general equilibrium models (CGE), and agent-based models (ABM) as examples. Recent computational advances, maturity of models, availability of data, and interdisciplinary expertise make model coupling an increasingly feasible, effective, and useful tool for climate policy analysis. We examine the unique contributions of each modeling approach, highlight synergies from uniting their strengths, and discuss alternatives to and conditions for coupling. In addressing methodological challenges, we present examples of effective coupling of IAM–ABM–CGE, emphasizing the importance of maintaining model integrity while enhancing policy relevance. By bridging human decision scales and leveraging complementary strengths, coupled models can provide nuanced insights into climate–economy interactions, ultimately supporting effective and equitable—not just efficient and optimal—climate policies.},

Keating et al. , N. Engl. J. Med. 379, 1612–1620 (2018)]. The disease is caused by mutations that disrupt the function of a gene known as CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator which encodes a chloride channel expressed in epithelial cells including the lung. Collectively the three recipients were responsible for the development of novel high-throughput drug screens that led to the development of the new drugs. Welsh is a pulmonologist who played a key role in understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of the disease. González is a physical organic chemist who developed a novel technology that enabled robust high-throughput screens for drugs that correct the channel defects. Negulescu led a group of extremely talented biologists, chemists, and physicians who built on these advances to develop novel three-drug combinations that have miraculous benefits for the majority of afflicted patients. This advance represents a true milestone in medicine and fulfills a dream of research scientists and families—the conversion of a fatal disease into a fully treatable one.

This year’s Lasker Basic Science Award is given to Steven McKnight and Dirk Görlich for their pioneering work on such low-complexity domains (LCDs). They showed, using a variety of elegant approaches, that such LCDs can form homotypic and heterotypic interactions that lead to reversible phase separations in cells. These phase separations, which in the laboratory manifest as hydrogels and in cells as membrane free structures (liquid condensates) such as P bodies and stress granules, form hubs for molecular processes such as transcription and messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing and also underlie the selectivity of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), which act a barriers to large molecules unless they are escorted by specific LCD containing nuclear transporters that interact with LCD containing nucleoporins within NPC channels. Naturally occurring LCD mutations linked to neurodegeneration and other diseases cause the formation of irreversible (rather than reversible) LCD polymers, resulting in insoluble, amyloid-like, fibrils, underscoring the critical importance of these domains.},

In plants, seed traits such as size, yield, and dormancy are all affected by the environment during reproduction, but whether developing progeny sense temperature within the fruit or whether seasonal climate information is inherited intergenerationally from the parents remains unclear. In this study, we use intergenerational single-nucleus omics to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of seasonal temperature changes in fruits containing developing seeds of the next generation. We show that the sensing of temperature takes place specifically in maternal fruit tissues and that mothers preadapt their progeny to maternal temperature through the intergenerational flux of the hormone ABA to the zygote itself where it is sensed to affect dormancy. We conclude that mothers can control filial traits via direct transfer of hormones to progeny and propose that this is an important mechanism by which populations can rapidly adapt to environmental change.},

While divergent genetic clocks have been studied extensively in bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, an ancient conserved circadian redox rhythm has been recently reported. However, its biological function and physiological outputs remain elusive. Here, we uncovered the coexistence of redox and genetic rhythms with distinct period lengths and transcriptional targets through concurrent metabolic and transcriptional time-course measurements in an Arabidopsis long-period clock mutant. Analysis of the target genes indicated regulation of the immune-induced programmed cell death (PCD) by the redox rhythm. Moreover, this time-of-day-sensitive PCD was eliminated by redox perturbations and by blocking the signaling pathway of the plant defense hormones jasmonic acid/ethylene, while remaining intact in genetic clock-defective backgrounds. This study shows that compared to robust genetic clocks, the more sensitive circadian redox rhythm serves as a signaling hub in regulating incidental energy-intensive processes, such as immune-induced PCD involving reprogramming of chloroplast and mitochondria activities, to provide organisms a flexible strategy to mitigate metabolic overload during stress responses.},

While bacterial and archaeal primase generate short RNA primers, the eukaryotic primase, Polα-primase, contains both RNA primase and DNA polymerase (Pol) subunits that function together to form a >20 base hybrid RNA–DNA primer. Interestingly, the DNA Pol1 subunit of Polα lacks a 3’-5’ proofreading exonuclease, contrary to the high-fidelity normally associated with DNA replication. However, Polδ and Polε synthesize the majority of the eukaryotic genome, and both contain 3’-5’ exonuclease activity for high fidelity. Nonetheless, even the small amount of DNA produced by Pol1 in each of the many RNA/DNA primers during chromosome replication adds up to tens of millions of nucleotides in a human genome. Thus, it has been a longstanding question why Pol1 lacks a proofreading exonuclease. We show here that Polα is uniquely capable of traversing common oxidized or hydrolyzed template nucleotides and propose that Polα evolved to bypass these common template lesions when they are encountered during chromosome replication. Additionally, we show a unique ability of replication factor C (RFC) to stimulate Polδ lesion bypass, independent of its sliding clamp. This suggests that there may be a coordination between Polδ and RFC that does not involve RFC loading of PCNA.},

While bacterial adhesion mechanisms also exhibit remarkable diversity, the molecular processes that regulate the dynamic modulation of binding strength between elongated bacterial cells and host cells remain poorly understood. Fusobacterium nucleatum ( F. nucleatum ) utilizes the surface adhesin CbpF to interact with the highly expressed host receptors CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 on cancer cells to facilitate tumor colonization. By elucidating the structural details of CbpF binding to human CEACAM1/CEACAM5 receptors, and through mechanistic investigations, we identified that the prominent EFNGQYQ loop on CbpF and the key Q78 residue of CEACAM1/CEACAM5 constitute the molecular linchpin of this pathogen–host interface. Furthermore, we found a distinct type of binding particle and proposed a Velcro-like adhesion model. In this model, CbpF mediates robust attachment through the simultaneous interaction of multiple binding sites, akin to the interlocking mechanism of Velcro. This multivalent interaction allows F. nucleatum to dynamically switch between firm anchoring and easy detachment, adapting to varying physiological microenvironments. Our study elucidates the dynamic modulation of bacterial adhesion strength and lays the foundation for developing therapeutic interventions to disrupt the bacterium–host interface.},

  abstract     = {Microglia regulate neuronal circuit plasticity. Disrupting their homeostatic function has detrimental effects on neuronal circuit health. Neuroinflammation contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with several microglial activation genes linked to increased risk for these conditions. Inflammatory microglia alter neuronal excitability, inducing metabolic strain. Interestingly, expression of APOE4 , the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, affects both microglial activation and neuronal excitability, highlighting the interplay between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and neuronal function. It remains unclear how microglial inflammatory state is conveyed to neurons to affect circuit function and whether APOE4 expression alters this intercellular communication. Here, we use a reductionist model of human iPSC-derived microglial and neuronal monocultures to dissect how the APOE genotype in each cell type independently contributes to microglial regulation of neuronal activity during inflammation. Conditioned media (CM) from LPS-stimulated microglia increased neuronal network activity, assessed by calcium imaging, with APOE4 microglial CM driving greater neuronal activity than APOE3 CM. Both APOE3 and APOE4 neurons increase network activity in response to CM treatments, while APOE4 neurons uniquely increase presynaptic puncta in response to APOE4 microglial CM. CM-derived exosomes from LPS-stimulated microglia can mediate increases to network activity. Finally, increased network activity is accompanied by increased lipid droplet (LD) metabolism, and blocking LD metabolism abolishes network activity. These findings illuminate how microglia-to-neuron communication drives inflammation-induced changes in neuronal circuit function, demonstrate a role for neuronal LDs in network activity, and support a potential mechanism through which APOE4 increases neuronal excitability.},

  abstract     = {The β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR), a prototype G protein–coupled receptor, controls cardiopulmonary function underpinning O 2 delivery. Abundance of the β 2 AR is canonically regulated by G protein–coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestins, but neither controls constitutive receptor levels, which are dependent on ambient O 2 . Basal β 2 AR expression is instead regulated by the prolyl hydroxylase/pVHL-E3 ubiquitin ligase system, explaining O 2 responsivity. Interplay between O 2 and nitric oxide (NO, a potent bronchodilator) is central to cardiopulmonary function. Here, we demonstrate that pVHL-mediated β 2 AR degradation is counteracted by NO, revealing pVHL control of pulmonary function. NO S-nitrosylates Cys77 in human pVHL (cognate to mouse Cys43), which induces binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to degrade pVHL, thereby increasing β 2 AR expression. pVHL–C43S mutant mice refractory to S-nitrosylation exhibit decreases in β 2 AR signaling and increases in airway tone. Thus, pVHL controls adrenergic pulmonary function and contributes to bronchodilation by NO. Our findings suggest therapeutic approaches to asthma and obstructive airway disease.},

  abstract     = {Animals can improve their decision-making abilities by integrating information from multiple senses, which is especially beneficial when living in fluctuating environments. However, understanding how wild predators may use multimodal sensing when hunting prey in split-second interactions remains largely unexplored. As nocturnal hunters, bats rely on echolocation to navigate and to locate evasive prey, yet they have retained functional vision, despite the associated costs. We therefore hypothesized that bats use vision to enhance sensory redundancy when commuting and tracking small insects. To test this, we equipped 21 wild common noctule bats ( Nyctalus noctula ) with high-resolution light, sound, and motion sensor loggers and measured their echolocation and movements while commuting and foraging in both dark and lit environments. When commuting, the bats maintained consistent echolocation sampling across light levels. However, when tracking prey in illuminated environments, the bats emitted calls with half the rate and with 7 dB higher call levels compared to in dark conditions, but at much faster approach speeds (from 5.2 in darkness to 7.9 m/s in lit conditions). This suggests that, in illuminated environments, hunting bats integrate acoustic and visual information, resulting in more efficient approaches to prey. Our findings demonstrate how a wild sensory specialist predator uses multimodal sensing to hunt efficiently in highly dynamic resource landscapes.},

  abstract     = {Typically, people perform actions in a valenced—positive or negative—way, depending on their attitudes or desires. These forms of action are named vitality forms (VFs). While it is well established that action goals are mediated by a parieto-frontal network, less is known about the processing of VFs. Recent fMRI studies suggest that the insula (INS)—and its connections with the parieto-frontal circuit—plays a crucial role in VFs processing. However, a key question remains: How does our internal affective state shape our motor behavior? To explore this issue, we conducted an fMRI study. Participants were required to perform two sequential tasks: 1) to evoke either a positive (enthusiastic) or a negative (angry) affective state (feeling task); 2) to execute an action while maintaining these affective states (execution task). Univariate analysis revealed activation of the INS and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) during the feeling task, which extended to the premotor (PM) and parietal areas during the execution task. To determine the directionality of information flow among these nodes, we employed dynamic causal modeling. Bayesian model comparison showed that, during the feeling task, affect generation involves INS, which, together with the PFC, modulates the activity of PM. In contrast, during execution, motor commands emerge from PM and influence activity in the INS and PFC. These findings indicate that while the internal states crucially imply the INS, their regulation is mediated by PFC. The PM cortex plays a crucial role in the selection of the corresponding action VFs.},

  abstract     = {A frequent goal of phage biology is to quantify how well a phage kills a population of host bacteria. Unfortunately, traditional methods to quantify phage success can be time-consuming, limiting the throughput of experiments. Here, we use theory to show how the effects of phages on their hosts can be quantified using bacterial population dynamics measured in a high-throughput microplate reader (automated spectrophotometer). We use mathematical models to simulate bacterial population dynamics where specific phage and bacterial traits are known a priori. We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g., growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is expected to pose significant threats to public health, particularly vector-borne diseases. Despite dramatic recent increases in dengue that many anecdotally connect with climate change, the effect of anthropogenic climate change on dengue remains poorly quantified. To assess this link, we assembled local-level data on dengue across 21 countries in Asia and the Americas. We found a nonlinear relationship between temperature and dengue incidence with the largest impact of warming at lower temperatures, peak incidence at 27.8°C, and a decline at higher temperatures. Using this inferred temperature response, we estimate 18% (95% CI: 11 to 27%) of historical dengue incidence on average across our study countries is attributable to anthropogenic warming. Future warming could further increase incidence by 49% (95% CI: 16 to 136%) to 76% (95% CI: 27 to 239%) by midcentury for low or high emissions scenarios, respectively, with cooler regions projected to double in incidence due to warming while other currently hot regions experience little impact or even small declines. Under the highest emissions scenario, we estimate that 262 million people are currently living in places in these 21 countries where dengue incidence is expected to more than double due to climate change by midcentury. These insights highlight the major impacts of anthropogenic warming on dengue burden across most of its endemic range, providing a foundation for public health planning and the development of strategies to mitigate future risks due to climate change.},

However, precise manipulation of cells in 3-D microfluidic environments remains challenging, particularly for heterogeneous populations. Here, we present “Electro-LEV,” a unique platform integrating electromagnetic and magnetic levitation principles for dynamic 3-D control of cell position during separation. We demonstrated that small current adjustments in electromagnets significantly alter the levitation heights of diverse particles and cell types. By periodically modulating and tracking cell positions along the z-axis, Electro-LEV identified distinct levitation behaviors between single cells and cell clusters, with clusters responding more rapidly to magnetic field changes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Electro-LEV significantly enhances the purity and efficiency of levitational sorting, achieving 10-fold enrichment of live cells from 50% starting viability samples and 18.8-fold enrichment from 10% starting viability samples. These results establish Electro-LEV as a powerful tool for investigating cellular heterogeneity, differentiating cell sizes and types, and improving cell sorting efficiency. Thus, Electro-LEV is broadly applicable, offering different possibilities for high-resolution cell analysis and label-free cell sorting in various biomedical fields, including but not limited to single-cell sequencing and drug screening.},

However, due to the localized stress concentration induced by a high Peierls-Nabarro stress and limited dislocation mobility, increasing material strength usually comes at the expense of ductility and toughness, resulting in a trade-off between strength–ductility/strength–toughness. Here, we report an anomalous phenomenon of dislocation absorption at the crack front, which is unlike typically observed dislocation emission at the crack tip, in a heterogeneous “plain” steel consisting of tempered lath martensite embedded with stable carbon-enriched retained austenite. The continuous absorption of dislocations emitted from the tempered martensite into the tough austenite significantly alleviates the localized stress concentration, and as such retards crack propagation in the tempered martensite matrix. This allows the plain high-carbon low-alloyed steel subjected to simple quenching–partitioning–tempering processes to achieve remarkable properties comprising a multiplication of strength and elongation over 50 GPa·% with an exceptionally high fracture toughness over 130 MPa·m 1/2 . The toughening strategy based on this mechanism provides a promising route for developing cost-effective plain steels with ultrahigh strength, ductility, and toughness that is a persistent pursuit in the steel industry.},

Herein, we find elevated levels of muricholic acid (MCA) species in the serum of girls with central precocious puberty, which strongly correlate with indices of hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis activation and can reach peak levels during puberty among healthy children. Intriguingly, reduction of MCA species can lead to decreased expression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and delay the early onset of puberty, while elevated MCA levels induced premature sexual development in female mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that MCA had strong activation effects on Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), and MCA enhanced GnRH expression in GnRH neurons through activation of the TGR5-PI3K/Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Our findings reveal a link between metabolic status and reproductive maturation, highlighting MCA as a potential therapeutic target for managing early puberty initiation.},

Targeting this pathway represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of human REV1, a ca. 100 amino acid scaffold essential for TLS polymerase interactions, disrupts REV1/POLζ-dependent TLS in mammalian cells. Inducible expression of REV1-CTD in multiple human and murine cancer cell lines sensitizes cells to DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, and methyl methanesulfonate, without intrinsic cytotoxicity. REV1-CTD expression increases genomic instability, decreases mutagenesis, and enhances G2 arrest following genotoxic stress. Mutational disruption of the CTD’s interaction interfaces abrogates these effects, confirming a dominant-negative mechanism via sequestration of TLS components. In a xenograft mouse model, REV1-CTD expression markedly enhances cisplatin efficacy, significantly reducing tumor burden. These findings establish the REV1-CTD as an effective dominant-negative inhibitor of TLS and support its development as a therapeutic agent delivered to cancer cells to enhance the efficacy of genotoxic chemotherapy.},

However, the selectivity of the chaperones mediating Rubisco assembly in vascular plants toward their cognate Rubisco presents a substantive roadblock to both Rubisco protein engineering and transgenic expression of heterologous Rubisco orthologs, both of which necessitate changes to the Rubisco sequence. Here, we ask whether a plant Rubisco chaperone can be reprogrammed by directed evolution to accommodate a nonnative client. We developed a selection strategy to assess Rubisco assembly factor activity in high-throughput and used this selection to identify mutants of the chaperone Raf1 from Arabidopsis thaliana ( At Raf1) that assemble Nicotiana tabacum Rubisco, for which wild-type At Raf1 has minimal activity. We show that directed evolution can generate At Raf1 variants that enable significantly increased N. tabacum Rubisco assembly compared to wild-type At Raf1. Evaluation of evolved At Raf1s indicates that they retain the ability to assemble their native client and can assemble other dicot Rubisco orthologs that they were not evolved to recognize. This work may provide a strategy for addressing the constraints chaperone selectivity impose upon Rubisco-centric efforts to improve plant photosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Major depressive disorder affects millions worldwide, yet current treatments require prolonged administration. In contrast, ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects by blocking spontaneous N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor signaling, which lifts the suppression of protein synthesis and triggers homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Here, we identify a parallel signaling pathway involving metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) that promotes rapid antidepressant-like effects. We show that enhancing the endogenous mGluR5 signaling produces synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus and triggers the rapid antidepressant effect, similar to ketamine. Importantly, blocking mGluR5 prevents ketamine’s effects, revealing a synergy between the two pathways. At the cellular level, spontaneous calcium transients mediated by mGluR5 activate the phosphatase calcineurin and promote eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) dephosphorylation, increasing BDNF translation to drive synaptic plasticity. We show that quantal glutamate release activates two spatially segregated Ca 2+ signals—NMDAR- and mGluR5-driven—which exert opposing effects on protein synthesis. Together, these findings highlight mGluR5 as a promising therapeutic target for rapid antidepressant action, harnessing the complex nanoscale organization of synapses.},

  abstract     = {Adrenal lipomas are benign tumors containing ectopic adipose tissue in the adrenal gland, an organ that normally lacks both adipocytes and their progenitors. The origin of this ectopic fat remains enigmatic, and the absence of a genetic animal model has hindered its investigation. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P 3 ], a key signaling lipid that regulates cellular growth and differentiation, is tightly regulated by the lipid phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and SHIP2 (SH2-containing inositol phosphatase 2). Here, we demonstrate that simultaneous loss of Pten and Ship2 in the adrenal cortex induces adrenal lipoma formation in mice. These lipomatous cells display both adipocyte-like morphology and adipocyte-specific gene expression. Lineage tracing revealed that these lipomas originate from the adrenal cortex. Mechanistically, PI(3,4,5)P 3 hyperaccumulation in the adrenal cortex activates AKT (AKT8 virus oncogene cellular homolog), leading to ectopic PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) expression, a key driver of adipocyte differentiation. This study suggests that the PI(3,4,5)P 3 /AKT-driven transdifferentiation of adrenocortical cells may represent a central mechanism underlying adrenal lipoma formation, thereby providing insights into lipoma pathogenesis and cellular reprogramming in vivo.},

The same technology was applied to cultured macrophages exposed to cholesterol crystals, and the observations made on the macrophages were compared to those made on the pathological tissue. We observed that cholesterol crystal digestion and, eventually, cholesterol crystal clearance occurs in the advanced human plaques through cellular processing. Our findings suggest that cholesterol crystal disassembly occurs through the esterification of crystalline cholesterol to cholesteryl-ester in isolated volumes, whereby the ester aggregates into intra- and extracellular pools. The hypothesis is supported by the close similarity of the processes imaged in the human tissue and in the macrophages and is in agreement with earlier biochemical studies performed on cultured macrophages.},

Rad54 is an ATP-dependent DNA motor protein that stimulates Rad51 activity during mitosis. In meiosis Rad51 is downregulated by the protein Hed1, which blocks Rad54 binding to Rad51, and allows Dmc1 to function as the active recombinase. We currently have a poor understanding of the regulatory interplay between Rad54, Hed1, Rad51, and Dmc1. Here, we identify a conserved Rad51 interaction motif within Rad54, and we solve a CryoEM structure of this motif bound to Rad51. We also identify a distinct Rad51 interaction motif within Hed1 and solve its structure bound to Rad51. These structures explain how Rad54 engages Rad51 to promote recombination between sister chromatids during mitosis and how Rad51 is downregulated by Hed1 upon entry into meiosis such that its meiosis-specific homolog Dmc1 can promote recombination between homologous chromosomes.},

  abstract     = {Many soft, tough materials have emerged in recent years, paving the way for advances in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and flexible displays. However, understanding the interfacial fracture behavior of these materials remains a significant challenge, owing to the difficulty of quantifying the respective contributions from viscoelasticity and damage to energy dissipation ahead of cracks. This work aims to address this challenge by labeling a series of polymer networks with fluorogenic mechanophores, subjecting them to T-peel tests at various rates and temperatures, and quantifying their force-induced damage using a confocal microscope. The results challenge longstanding assumptions underlying linear viscoelastic fracture theories, revealing a complex interplay between viscoelasticity and damage governed by the Weissenberg number, W i . Specifically, they suggest a molecular picture in which the interfacial toughness increases due to polymer chain breakage and enlarged strains when W i < 0.3 , and significant chain friction and network stiffening when W i > 0.3 , with the damage being negligible in the limits of W i ≪ 0.3 and W i ≫ 0.3 either due to insufficient strains at the peel front or because of excessive stress at weak interfacial bonds. Overall, these results illustrate the molecular and mesoscopic mechanisms underpinning interfacial fracture, aiding to refine current viscoelastic fracture theories and accelerating the development of advanced polymer networks for increasingly demanding applications.},

  abstract     = {Ovulation is an intricate process that is essential for reproductive success. In Drosophila melanogaster , ovulation increases after mating. This increase is initiated by the male seminal fluid protein ovulin and is executed by female pathways, including octopamine (OA) neuronal signaling. Despite OA signaling’s central role in ovulation regulation, the broader molecular landscape underlying female control of ovulation remains poorly understood. Here, using ovulin as a probe, we performed evolutionary rate covariation and AlphaFold-Multimer prediction screens to identify candidate female ovulation-regulating proteins. Ovulation assays performed on knockdowns or mutants of identified membrane-protein candidates revealed seven important female ovulation regulators: Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, mthl9, Smog, Cirl, and CG6067. Lgr3 and GabaβR1 function in an ovulin-dependent manner, while SIFaR and mthl9 regulate ovulation independently of ovulin. For proteins with known nervous system expression, we examined their requirement in OA neurons and their expression in female reproductive tract neurons. Tissue-specific knockdown revealed that Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, and CG6067 act in OA neurons to influence ovulation, highlighting OA neurons as a key signaling hub. Additionally, Lgr3, GabaβR1, SIFaR, Smog, and Cirl are expressed in OA neurons innervating the reproductive tract, suggesting a potential local function. Finally, we identified evidence of recurrent positive selection having acted on residues within Smog’s ligand binding region, which is interesting in light of ovulin’s rapid evolution. Together, these findings significantly expand our understanding of the molecular networks regulating ovulation following mating in Drosophila .},

  abstract     = {Chimaeras ( Holocephali ) are an understudied group of mostly deep-ocean cartilaginous fishes ( Chondrichthyes ) with unique characteristics that distinguish them from their distant relatives, sharks, skates, and rays. Unlike sharks, chimaeras lack scales and do not have serially replacing rows of serrated teeth crowned with enameloid. Instead, they possess a fused dentition of dentine tooth plates. Additionally, male chimaeras develop an articulated cartilaginous facial appendage, the tenaculum, which is covered in an arcade of tooth-like structures. These extraoral teeth remain poorly understood, and their evolutionary origin is unclear. We investigate the development of the tenaculum and its teeth throughout the ontogeny of the Spotted Ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei , to assess homology and convergence between this novel craniofacial feature and oral jaws. Our study aims to 1) describe the development of the tenaculum, 2) assess tenaculum tooth development in comparison to oral teeth and denticles, and 3) characterize the genes and tissues responsible for tenaculum tooth emergence. We found that juvenile male chimaeras develop a full tenaculum before tooth development is complete and that only mature males possess a fully toothed tenaculum. These extraoral teeth emerge from within the tenaculum rather than from the surrounding epithelium. We integrate our developmental data with fossil evidence of the tenacular dentition from the Carboniferous holocephalan Helodus simplex . Our findings show that the tenaculum is closely associated with the upper jaw and that tenacular dentition resembles separate shark-like oral tooth whorls more than modified dermal denticles.},

  abstract     = {Agonist-induced interaction of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) with β-arrestins (βarrs) is a critical mechanism that regulates the spatiotemporal pattern of receptor localization and signaling. While the underlying mechanism governing GPCR–βarr interaction is primarily conserved and involves receptor activation and phosphorylation, there are several examples of receptor-specific fine-tuning of βarr-mediated functional outcomes. Considering the key contribution of conformational plasticity of βarrs in driving receptor-specific functional responses, it is important to develop novel sensors capable of reporting distinct βarr conformations in cellular context. Here, we design an intrabody version of a βarr-recognizing nanobody (nanobody32), referred to as intrabody32 (Ib32), in NanoLuc enzyme complementation assay format and measure its ability to recognize βarr1 and 2 in live cells upon activation of a broad set of GPCRs. Ib32 robustly recognizes activated βarr1 and 2 in the plasma membrane and endosomes, and effectively mirrors βarr recruitment profile upon stimulation of selected GPCRs. We also design an Ib32 sensor for polarization microscopy with a change in linear dichroism as readout and demonstrate its utility for monitoring βarr activation upon stimulation of selected GPCRs by natural and biased agonists. Taken together with a previously described sensor of βarr1 activation, Ib32 underscores the inherent flexibility encoded in βarrs and conformational diversity imparted by different GPCRs, which is further corroborated using an orthogonal limited proteolysis assay. Our study presents Ib32 as a sensor of βarr activation and highlights the structural diversity of βarrs, which likely allows their ability to interact with, and regulate, a large repertoire of GPCRs.},

  abstract     = {Many essential cellular processes, including cell division and the establishment of cell polarity during embryogenesis, are regulated by pattern-forming proteins. These proteins often need to bind to a substrate, such as the cell membrane, onto which they interact and form two-dimensional (2D) patterns. It is unclear how the membrane’s continuity and dimensionality impact pattern formation. Here, we address this gap using the MinDE system, a prototypical example of pattern-forming membrane proteins. We show that when the lipid substrate is fragmented into submicrometer-sized diffusive liposomes, adenosine triphosphate-driven protein–protein interactions generate three-dimensional (3D) spatially extended patterns, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. Remarkably, these 3D patterns emerge at scales four orders of magnitude larger than the individual liposomes. By systematically varying protein concentration, liposome size, and density, we observed and characterized a variety of 3D dynamical patterns not seen on continuous 2D membranes, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals, and a coexistence phase. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model revealed that the physical properties of the dispersed membrane effectively rescale both the protein–membrane binding rates and diffusion, two key parameters governing pattern formation and wavelength selection. These findings highlight the robustness of Min’s pattern-forming ability, suggesting that protein–membrane suspensions could serve as an adaptable template for studying out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo contexts.},

Traditional control strategies, such as predefined temperature modulation, struggle to achieve substantial enhancement. Here, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that autonomously discovers optimal control policies to maximize heat transfer in turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection. By dynamically adjusting wall temperature fluctuations, the DRL agent achieves a heat transfer enhancement of up to 38.5%, exceeding the 20 to 25% limit of conventional methods. The learned strategy reveals a nonlinear state–action relationship, inducing a fully modulated boundary layer regime. Furthermore, we distill the DRL insights into a simplified bang-bang control model, which retains comparable performance (up to 40.0% enhancement) and, crucially, generalizes to unseen, higher Rayleigh number cases without additional training. Our results demonstrate the power of machine learning in turbulence control and reveal a framework with potential for intelligent heat transfer optimization in real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {The TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain is an ancient protein module that functions in immune and cell death responses across the Tree of Life. TIR domains encoded by plants and prokaryotes function as enzymes to produce diverse small molecule immune signals. Plant genomes can encode hundreds of TIR-domain containing proteins—many of which confer important agricultural disease resistance as TIR-NLR (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat) immune receptors. Despite their importance, how natural variation influences TIR enzymatic output and immunity-associated cell death is largely unexplored. We assayed a complete collection of the TIR domains of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (the “AtTIRome”) to explore variation in TIR metabolite production and cell death signaling. Roughly half of the AtTIRome triggered cell death in transient assays. Artificial TIR proteins designed based on consensus sequences of the AtTIRome’s cell death phenotypic classes revealed polymorphisms controlling variation in TIR cell death elicitation and metabolite production. Structure–function analyses of artificial TIRs revealed that natural variation in the “BB-loop”, a flexible region overlying the catalytic pocket, determines differences in function across Arabidopsis TIR-containing proteins. We further demonstrate that artificial TIRs are functional on an NLR chassis and that BB-loop variation can tune the activity of a natural TIR-NLR protein. These findings shed light on the diversity of TIR outputs and reveal methods to design and engineer TIR-based immune receptors.},

Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles—a distinct state of interfacial ionic matter—our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport, electrified matter, and wetting dynamics at interfaces.},

  abstract     = {High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is a chromatin-associated nonhistone protein widely distributed in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. It is transported extracellularly as a proinflammatory mediator or late warning protein to induce immune and inflammatory reactions upon stimuli such as microbial infection. Here, we have found that HMGB1 directly interacts with bacterial DNA analogue CpG-A in the extracellular environment to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) via its positively charged DNA-binding domain. We have demonstrated that the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE) responds to stimulation of the extracellular HMGB1-CpG-A complex and triggers phase separation of the downstream adaptor protein, Src76kDa structural domain leukocyte protein (SLP76), which promotes activation of the MAPK pathway and release of inflammatory cytokines. These results not only designate that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function mechanism involved in the axis of DNA-HMGB1 stimulated RAGE-SLP76 signaling pathway but also provide evidence that the activity of HMGB1 is regulated by LLPS, highly relevant to immune responses of inflammatory cells toward microbial infection. Especially, the finding that the intracellular SLP76 forms condensates with the cytosol domain of RAGE may represent a general downstream phenomenon when an inflammatory cell membrane receptor is activated.},

  abstract     = {Aqueous sodium-ion batteries (ASIBs) are gaining attention for their inherent safety and the use of abundant sodium resources. Bismuth (Bi) anode, with its high theoretical capacity and low cost, enhances the performance and competitiveness of ASIBs in energy storage applications. However, as a conversion-type material, Bi inevitably undergoes dramatic volume changes during cycling, limiting the structural stability and calendar life of the electrode. Herein, we present a Bi-carbon composite electrode with ultrafine Bi nanocrystals (< 10 nm) uniformly integrated into nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (UF Bi@NCF). Despite Bi’s low melting point (271 °C), Ostwald ripening of metallic Bi during carbonization (750 °C) is effectively suppressed by incorporating polyacrylic acid as a chelating polymer in the electrospun Bi(III)/polyacrylonitrile precursor solutions. The high dispersity of Bi nanocrystals at elevated temperature is attributed to the strong coordination and electrostatic interactions between carboxyl groups and Bi 3+ . This structural refinement significantly reduces localized stress concentrations during sodiation/desodiation. The UF Bi@NCF anode demonstrates a reversible capacity of 237.5 mAh g −1 at 0.5 C, and negligible capacity decay even after 5,700 cycles at an extremely high current rate of 20 C for ASIBs. These findings highlight the potential of the anti-Ostwald ripening effect in enhancing the stability and performance of metal-carbon composite electrodes, providing valuable insights into the design of advanced materials for next-generation aqueous batteries.},

  abstract     = {Learning when to initiate or withhold actions is essential for survival, requiring the integration of past experiences with new information to adapt to changing environments. The prelimbic cortex (PL) plays a central role in this process, with a stable PL neuronal population (ensemble) recruited during operant reward learning to encode response execution. However, it is unknown how this established reward-learning ensemble adapts to changing reward contingencies, such as reward omission during extinction. Specifically, does the same ensemble adjust its activity to support behavior suppression, or is a distinct ensemble recruited for this new learning? Our data reveal that operant extinction learning recruits a distinct PL Extinction ensemble to support response inhibition, and concerted engagement of both ensembles encodes both ongoing and subsequent context-specific behavior. Using single-cell calcium imaging, we longitudinally tracked PL neurons in rats as they pressed a lever for food rewards (Training), learned to suppress responding upon reward omission (Extinction), and reinstated responding following a noncontingent “priming” pellet (Reinstatement). We trained decoders on individual rats’ PL activity patterns to predict trial-wise responses and used an in silico deletion approach to identify separate PL Training and Extinction ensembles associated with response execution and inhibition, respectively. Critically, both ensembles were reengaged and maintained their distinct roles during Reinstatement. These findings highlight ensemble-based encoding of multiple, even opposing, learned associations within the same region, demonstrating how selective ensemble recruitment enables behavioral flexibility under changing contingencies.},

  abstract     = {Organisms often face multiple selective pressures simultaneously (e.g., mine tailings with multiple heavy metal contaminants), yet we know little about when adaptation to one stressor provides cross-tolerance or cross-intolerance to other stressors. To explore the potential for cross-tolerance, we adapted Saccharomyces cerevisiae to high concentrations of six single metals in a short-term evolutionary rescue experiment. We then measured cross-tolerance of each metal-adapted line to the other five metals. We tested three predictors for the degree of cross-tolerance, based on similarity in 1) the physiochemical properties of each metal pair, 2) the overlap in genes known to impact tolerance to both metals, and 3) their co-occurrence in the environment. None of these predictors explained significant variation in cross-tolerance. Instead, the strongest predictor was the metal in which adaptation occurred: Cobalt-adapted lines performed well in most metals (generalists) while manganese-adapted lines typically performed poorly (specialists). To determine the genetic basis, we sequenced the genomes of 109 metal-adapted lines. Broader cross-tolerance characterized lines bearing mutations affecting phosphorus metabolism, with three genes related to phosphate metabolism bearing several independent mutations ( PHO84 , SIW14 , VTC4 ). Thus, while a genome-wide analysis failed to predict cross-tolerance, a subset of genes facilitated growth in multiple metals. We also observed two “mutator” lines (both in manganese) and report evidence that cadmium, cobalt, and manganese altered the mutation spectrum. While it is challenging to predict how evolutionary adaptation to one stressor will impact tolerance to other stresses, our work helps reveal the environments and pathways that contribute to cross-tolerance among metals.},

In four field experiments over 2 y ( n = 542,804 low-income households), we test whether more proactive communication, varying message framing, and more precise targeting can boost take-up of tax-based benefits in California above and beyond traditional light-touch approaches. Our interventions focused on extremely vulnerable households, most with no prior-year earnings, who were at risk of missing out on two crucial benefits: the 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit and pandemic-relief Economic Impact Payments. Light-touch outreach consistently increased take-up of these benefits by 0.14 to 2 percentage points—a 150% to over 500% relative increase—regardless of message, sample, timing, or modality. These light-touch approaches resulted in over $4 million disbursed, with a highly cost-effective return of $50 to over $8,000 per $1 spent. However, higher-touch proactive outreach, varying messaging, and more precise targeting yielded minimal additional benefits, with proactive outreach even showing negative returns. These findings demonstrate that light-touch outreach can effectively shift behavior among very vulnerable households in contexts with reduced compliance burdens, but also underscore an urgent need to rethink the role of higher-touch strategies in closing take-up gaps in social safety net programs.},

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of MS4A4A+ macrophages in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and response to treatment. RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry of synovial samples from either early treatment-naïve or active chronic RA patients showed that MS4A4A expression positively correlated with synovial inflammation. Synovial macrophages from patients treated with corticosteroids (CS) exhibited an enhanced expression of MS4A4A and Fc γ receptor (FcγR) 3. Accordingly, CS enhanced in vitro the expression of MS4A4A and FcγR3 in human and murine macrophages. In an experimental model of arthritis, Ms4a4a deletion had no effect on the disease course but was associated with enhanced therapeutic response selectively to CS. These results suggest that macrophage expression of MS4A4A represents a biomarker of joint inflammation in RA and that its upregulation in concert with FcγR3 by CS counteracts the therapeutic activity of these drugs. Macrophage MS4A4A may represent a biomarker of joint inflammation in RA and a target to amplify the therapeutic activity of CS.},

A S. Typhimurium strain deficient for hydrogen sulfide production ( phsA asrA mutant) did not inhibit cytochrome bd oxidase-mediated aerobic respiration in E. coli , even when D. piger was present.

  abstract     = {Following encounter with an unrepaired DNA lesion, replication is halted and can restart downstream of the lesion leading to the formation of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap. To complete replication, this ssDNA gap is filled in by one of the two lesion tolerance pathways: the error-prone Translesion Synthesis (TLS) or the error-free Homology Directed Gap Repair (HDGR). In the present work, we evidence a role for the RecBC complex distinct from its canonical function in homologous recombination at DNA double strand breaks. We show that upon lesion encounter RecBC (independently of its catalytic activity and of the RecD subunit) is required to protect the nascent DNA in order to promote efficient lesion bypass. In the absence of RecBC, our data indicate that the nuclease ExoI can access and degrade the nascent DNA, affecting both TLS and HDGR mechanisms. We show that the recruitment of RecBC becomes particularly important at strong blocking lesions, when postreplicative ssDNA gaps persist and are covered by the ssDNA binding proteins. This protective role of RecBC is reminiscent of the role of BRCA2 in protecting the nascent DNA in human cells, highlighting once again the evolutionary conservation of DNA replication mechanisms across all living organisms.},

Here, we use a combination of stable isotope imaging and tracing to reveal carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) exchanges among three symbiotic primary producers that fuel a salmon-bearing river food web. Bulk isotope analysis, nanoSIMS (secondary ion mass spectrometry) isotope imaging, and density centrifugation for quantitative stable isotope probing enabled quantification of organism-specific C- and N-fixation rates from the subcellular scale to the ecosystem. After winters with riverbed-scouring floods, the macroalga Cladophora glomerata uses nutrients in spring runoff to grow streamers up to 10 m long. During summer flow recession, riverine N concentrations wane and Cladophora becomes densely epiphytized by three species of Epithemia , diatoms with N-fixing endosymbionts (proto-organelles) descended from a free-living Crocosphaera cyanobacterium. Over summertime epiphyte succession on Cladophora , N-fixation rates increased as Epithemia spp. became dominant, Cladophora C-fixation declined to near zero, and Epithemia C-fixation increased. Carbon transfer to caddisflies grazing on Cladophora with high densities of Epithemia was 10-fold higher than C transfer to caddisflies grazing Cladophora with low Epithemia loads. In response to demand for N, Epithemia allocates high levels of newly fixed C to its endosymbiont. Consequently, these endosymbionts have the highest rates of C and N accumulation of any taxon in this tripartite symbiosis during the biologically productive season and can produce one of the highest areal rates of N-fixation reported in any river ecosystem.},

  abstract     = {We analyzed the patterns of transmission in the 2022 clade IIb mpox epidemic as it unfolded in the European population of men who have sex with men (MSM). We developed an agent-based model that simulates sexual pair formation, incorporating both brief and longer-term sexual relationships. The model implements survey data on the sexual behavior of MSM and accounts for the highly heterogeneous nature of the sexual contact network within this community. When simulating the mpox epidemic, the model reproduces the reported numbers of sexual partners of mpox-infected individuals. We find that infection-derived immunity had little impact on ending the European outbreak. Instead, we suggest that the marked decrease in serial interval observed across the epidemic reflects a substantial increase in self-isolating behavior among infected persons and that this is sufficient to explain the early control of the epidemic. Our work highlights the critical interplay between relationship dynamics and adaptive behaviors in shaping mpox epidemic patterns and achieving control in 2022. Despite continued propagation of clade IIb mpox, the European MSM population remains protected by immunity, primarily vaccine-induced.},

  abstract     = {The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel is a voltage-gated cation channel that plays a crucial role in regulating cellular excitability, especially in cardiac pacemaker cells and neurons. Its dysregulation is linked to heart diseases such as bradycardia and neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain. Structural and functional studies have revealed that the S4 voltage sensor of the HCN channel moves downward during hyperpolarization. Recent structural studies of HCN channels have shown that the extracellular portion of the S4 segment is approximately three helical turns longer than that of voltage-gated K + (Kv) channels. However, whether this extended extracellular part of S4 plays a functional role in gating is still unknown. In this study, utilizing the available HCN4 channel structures, we examined the formation of salt bridges in the extracellular part of S4 with the S5 segment and the S1-S2 linker. Results from charge-swapped mutants and double cysteine mutants suggested that sequential, stepwise salt bridge formation involving the extracellular positively charged amino acids of S4 plays a role in the voltage-dependent gating of HCN channels. Furthermore, we applied voltage clamp fluorometry to confirm that the extracellular salt bridge network affects the S4 movement. This extracellular S4 portion includes disease-related arginine residues, R375 and R378. Our results suggest that disruption of salt bridge formation may perturb the smooth transition of S4 movement and cause HCN channel dysfunction.},

  abstract     = {Vegetation phenology, i.e., seasonal biological events such as leaf-out and leaf-fall, regulates local climate through biophysical processes like evapotranspiration (ET) and albedo. However, the net surface temperature impact of these processes—whether ET cooling or albedo-induced warming predominates—and how the dominance changes across phenological transitions and regions remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of vegetation foliage on daytime land surface temperature (LST) following six phenological transitions, spanning from the start of season to end of season, in deciduous and mixed forests across the mid- to high-latitude Northern Hemisphere during 2013–2021 using multiple satellite products and ground observations. We quantified vegetation effect as the difference between observed LST and LST estimates from the Annual Temperature Cycle (ATC) model, representing a no-foliage scenario. We found that vegetation-induced cooling consistently outweighs warming following all phenological transitions except for the end of the season. Cooling intensity increased with vegetation greenness, ranging from 1.0 ± 0.5 °C (mean ± 0.15 SD) in 59% of forests after the start of the season (SOS) to 6.1 ± 0.8 °C in 89% of forests following the onset of maturity, before declining toward the end of the season. Over half of the regions experiencing cooling showed intensification of surface cooling with climate warming, suggesting an amplified vegetation-mediated cooling under future climate change. The findings provide a more precise understanding of the role of vegetation in modulating climate at the intraseasonal scale, highlighting the importance of integrating phenological impacts into climate adaptation strategies and Earth system modeling.},

We analyze how cities manage this trade-off by measuring the coherence of the economic activities they support, defined as the technological distance between randomly sampled productive units in a city. We use this framework to study how the US urban system developed over almost two centuries, from 1850 to today. To do so, we rely on historical census data, covering over 600M individual records to describe the economic activities of cities between 1850 and 1940, as well as 8 million patent records and detailed occupational and industrial profiles of cities for more recent decades. Despite massive shifts in the economic geography of the United States over this 170-y period, average coherence in its urban system remains unchanged. Moreover, across different time periods, datasets, and relatedness measures, coherence falls with city size at the exact same rate, pointing to constraints to diversification that are governed by a city’s size in universal ways.},

  abstract     = {Excitatory glycine receptors (eGlyRs), composed of the glycine-binding NMDA receptor subunits GluN1 and GluN3A, have recently emerged as a novel neuronal signaling modality that challenges the traditional view of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Unlike conventional GluN1/GluN2 NMDARs, the distribution and role of eGlyRs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that eGlyRs are highly enriched in the ventral hippocampus (VH) and confer distinct properties on this brain region. eGlyRs display a massive expression in both VH CA1 pyramidal cells and SST- and PV-positive interneurons, whereas in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) pyramidal cells lack these receptors. eGlyRs mediate excitatory tonic currents and control VH network excitability. They are also responsible for the attenuated long-term potentiation (LTP) in the VH compared with the DH, providing a molecular basis for this difference. Furthermore, eGlyRs are required for regulation of VH LTP by corticosterone, pointing to eGlyRs as mediators of the neuroendocrine stress response. Consistent with this pervasive influence in the ventral division of the hippocampus, eGlyRs contribute to the modulation of anxiety-related behaviors. Our work identifies eGlyRs as key players in VH circuitry and function, demonstrating their intimate association with brain regions that control internal states and emotional processing.},

  abstract     = {Programmable self-assembly has recently enabled the creation of complex structures through precise control of the interparticle interactions and the particle geometries. Targeting ever more structurally complex, dynamic, and functional assemblies necessitates going beyond the design of the structure itself, to the measurement and control of the local flexibility of the intersubunit connections and its impact on the collective mechanics of the entire assembly. In this study, we demonstrate a method to infer the mechanical properties of multisubunit assemblies using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and RELION’s multi-body refinement. Specifically, we analyze the fluctuations of pairs of DNA-origami subunits that self-assemble into tubules. By measuring the fluctuations of dimers using cryo-EM, we extract mechanical properties such as the bending modulus and interparticle spring constant. These properties are then applied to elastic models to predict assembly outcomes, which align well with experimental observations. This approach not only provides a deeper understanding of nanoparticle mechanics but also opens pathways to refining subunit designs to achieve precise assembly behavior. This methodology could have broader applications in the study of nanomaterials, including protein assemblies, where understanding the interplay of mechanical properties and subunit geometry is essential for controlling complex self-assembled structures.},

  abstract     = {Multivalent binding and the resulting dynamical clustering of receptors and ligands are known to be key features in biological interactions. For optimizing biomaterials capable of similar dynamical features, it is essential to understand the first step of these interactions, namely the multivalent molecular recognition between ligands and cell receptors. Here, we present the reciprocal cooperation between dynamic ligands in supramolecular polymers and dynamic receptors in model cell membranes, determining molecular recognition and multivalent binding via receptor clustering. The nonlinear dependences of the ligand concentration, receptors, and their binding affinity are observed experimentally by fluorescence and superresolution fluorescence microscopies, revealing a valency-dependent clustering mode of anchoring. The mechanism is supported by stochastic modeling demonstrating that such nonlinear dependence is unlikely in the absence of any dynamics and superselectivity. Using a coarse-grained molecular model, the subtle competition between local and global entropies that controls this anchoring mechanism explains the clustering. Further investigation using single particle tracking reveals the presence of two populations of bound and unbound receptors after the clustering process. The result of this study highlights the importance of reciprocity of dynamics in supramolecular polymer and lipid membrane for recruitment, multivalent binding, and clustering, all of which are crucial elements in the design of materials capable of actively interacting with biological targets.},

We used data from 431,211 survey responses collected in the United States, between April 2020 and June 2022, to provide a description of how human behaviors fluctuated during the first 2 y of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis suggests that at the national and state levels, people’s adherence to recommendations to avoid contact with others (a preventive behavior) was highest early in the pandemic but gradually—and linearly—decreased over time. Importantly, during periods of intense COVID-19 mortality, adaption to preventive behaviors increased—despite the overall temporal decrease. These spatial-temporal characterizations help improve our understanding of the bidirectional feedback loop between outbreak severity and human behavior. Our findings should benefit both computational modeling teams developing methodologies to predict the dynamics of future epidemics and policymakers designing strategies to mitigate the effects of future disease outbreaks.},

To effectively exploit these resources, they have evolved a wide range of feeding strategies that combine chemotactic motility with active feeding flows. However, there is a notable lack of experimental studies that examine how these active flows shape resource fields to optimize feeding. In particular, the suspected cooperative hydrodynamics provided by groups of cells remains largely unexplored due to the difficulties in visualizing these dynamic three-dimensional flows. Here, we experimentally investigate how Stylonychia lemnae ciliates form feeding clusters of independent cells around food patches. Individual feeding flows interact hydrodynamically to create a chaotic collective flow at the population scale. Using a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, we measure and predict the entire collective flow, enabling us to assess its remarkable mixing and dispersion properties. We show that the active spreading of the food patch accelerates its detection by starving cells. As many fitness advantages provided by collective flows can be envisioned, we propose that this feeding cluster represents a form of intraspecific by-product cooperative behavior.},

At the core of the proposal is a hierarchy of layered prosodic messages that co-occur within the same intonation unit (0.5 to 2 s long). Motivated by this hierarchy, a procedure for the differential detection of three such co-occurring nonverbal messages is then described. In way of implementation, we produce a variant model of the WHISPER automatic speech recognition system that flags intonation unit boundaries, intonation unit prototypes, and emphases therein. The procedure required us to alter WHISPER’s token combinations and significantly adjust its prediction process. The variant model was tested on four datasets that contain spontaneous and read speech, and performs on a par with similar human annotation, and often better, using relatively modest training data. Several insights regarding this implementation, such as model size and encoding methods, are described as well. We believe that the proposed framework, coupled with the results of its application herein, can greatly improve the analysis of speech and language, integrating contextual information and speaker intentions into linguistic descriptions for a large array of purposes with modest means.},

Here, we demonstrated that Serinc2 is associated with susceptibility to BD and showed a reduced expression in BDII patient plasma, which correlated with the disease severity. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of sporadic and familial BDII patients, we found that Serinc2 expression showed deficits in iPSC-derived microglia-like cells, resulting in decreased synaptic pruning. Further, combining the microglia-specific Serinc2-deficient mouse and iPSC-microglia models, we found that microglial Serinc2 deficits functioned through attenuating the synthesis of serine-related phospholipids in the plasma membrane, thus resulting in depression-like behavioral abnormalities in the animals. Finally, we showed that the Serinc2-dependent lipid deficits diminished microglial membrane CR3 formation to interrupted synaptic pruning signals from neurons. Therefore, our results indicated that Serinc2 deficits in microglia might contribute to the pathogenesis of BD.},

  abstract     = {All organisms are exposed to various stressors, which can sometimes lead to organismal death, depending on their intensity. While stress-induced organismal death has been observed in many species, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of stress-induced organismal death in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster . We identified a chymotrypsin-like serine protease Phaedra1 ( Phae1 ) as a death mediator in D. melanogaster larvae. Phae1 expression was up-regulated by lethal heat stress (40 °C) but not nonlethal heat stress (38 °C or lower). The most prominent induction of Phae1 occurred in the central nervous system (CNS). We found neuro-specific knockdown of Phae1 increased survival and reduced neuronal caspase activity following exposure to lethal heat stress, suggesting that the transcriptional upregulation of Phae1 in the CNS is essential for stress-induced organismal death. We next found via bioinformatic and biochemical analyses that the transcription factor Zeste (Z) bound the Phae1 enhancer region and that z loss-of-function impaired Phae1 induction in the CNS, increasing survival following lethal heat stress. In addition, we found via chemical screening that rapamycin, a chemical inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), suppressed Phae1 expression. Neuro-specific knockdown of mTor reduced the protein levels of both Phae1 and Z, leading to an increase in survival following lethal heat stress. Together, these results indicate that heat stress–induced organismal death in D. melanogaster larvae is regulated by a genetically encoded transcriptional signaling pathway involving the mTOR–Z–Phae1 axis.},

  abstract     = {Proliferative retinopathy is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in humans; however, the molecular mechanisms behind the immune cell–mediated retinal angiogenesis remain poorly elucidated. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, we identified an enrichment of sorting nexin (SNX)-related pathways, with SNX3, a member of the SNX family that is involved in endosomal sorting and trafficking, being significantly upregulated in the myeloid cell subpopulations of OIR retinas. Immunostaining showed that SNX3 expression is markedly increased in the retinal microglia/macrophages of mice with OIR, which is mainly located within and around the neovascular tufts. Myeloid cell-specific deficiency of Snx3 inhibited retinal neovascularization, hyperpermeability, and dysfunction in OIR mice. Using glutathione S-transferase pull-down, coimmunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescent staining, we found that SNX3 interacted with receptor-interacting protein 1/3 (RIP1 and RIP3). We further demonstrated that RIP1/3 degradation was accelerated in SNX3-deleted microglia/macrophages, causing an inhibition of hypoxia-induced necroptosis and mitochondrial fission, thereby decreasing the production of proinflammatory and proangiogenic factors (FGF2 and MMP12). Moreover, OIR retinas from myeloid cell–specific SNX3 overexpression transgenic mice presented more angiogenic tufts, while RIP1/3 inhibition largely ablated SNX3 overexpression–induced pathological angiogenesis. Based on the structure of SNX3, we identified a small-molecule inhibitor, W1122. Intriguingly, we found that W1122 effectively inhibited retinal angiogenesis in the OIR model, and combination treatment with anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) yielded enhanced antiangiogenic effects. Collectively, our findings disclose a link between SNX3 and RIP1/3 signaling and implicate SNX3 in the development of ischemic retinopathy.},

  abstract     = {The self-organization of cortical microtubule (MT) arrays within plant cells is an emergent phenomenon with important consequences for the synthesis of the cell wall, cell shape, and subsequently the structure of plants. Mathematical modeling and experiments have elucidated the underlying processes involved. There has been recent interest in the influence of geometric cues on array orientation, be it direct (cell shape) or indirect (tension in the membrane). However, the mechanical influence of membrane curvature on these elastic filaments has largely been ignored. A previous model was proposed to describe how the anchoring process may control the deflection of individual MTs seeking to minimize bending on a cylindrical cell. We incorporate this process into a model of interacting MTs and find the cell curvature influence to be significant: the array favors orientations parallel to the direction of elongation rather than the expected transverse direction. Even without elasticity, the geometry of large cells hinders robust MT organization. These results suggest the necessity of additional processes to overcome these factors. We propose an orientation-dependent catastrophe rate, hypothetically caused by cellulose microfibrils impeding MT polymerization. We find a combination of anchoring and impedance to be sufficient to generate transverse arrays despite the geometric influences.},

  abstract     = {Color polymorphism can influence the evolutionary fate of cryptic species because it increases populations’ chances of survival in heterogenous or variable environments. Yet, little is known about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the persistence of cryptic color polymorphisms, or the impact these polymorphisms have on the macroevolutionary dynamics of lineages. Here, we examine the evolutionary history of the most widespread cryptic color polymorphism in anurans, involving green and brown morphs. Using an order-scale comparative analysis, we show that these morphs can coexist within species over long evolutionary periods and that polymorphic lineages switch habitat more frequently and have greater diversification rates than other groups. We then identify the locus responsible for the green/brown polymorphism in a group of African grass frogs, and demonstrate that it evolves under long-term balancing selection, resulting in trans-specific polymorphism. These results provide a microevolutionary mechanism for the long-term persistence of multiple color morphs within species observed at a macroevolutionary scale. This study underscores the importance of cryptic color polymorphism in the ecology and evolution of anurans, and provides a framework for future research on the genetic architecture and selective forces underlying cryptic coloration traits.},

  abstract     = {The streams of Alaska’s Brooks Range lie within a vast (~14M ha) tract of protected wilderness and have long supported both resident and anadromous fish. However, dozens of historically clear streams have recently turned orange and turbid. Thawing permafrost is thought to have exposed sulfide minerals to weathering, delivering iron and other potentially toxic metals to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we report stream water metal concentrations throughout the federally designated Wild and Scenic Salmon River watershed and compare them with United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chronic (4-d) exposure thresholds for toxicity to aquatic life. The main stem of the Salmon had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca relative to a predisturbance baseline for most of its length, consistent with increased sulfide mineral weathering. Most of the tributaries also had elevated SO 4 2− concentrations and elevated SO 4 2− : Ca, especially those in the upper watershed. The Salmon River mainstem consistently exceeded EPA chronic exposure thresholds for total recoverable iron, total recoverable aluminum, and dissolved cadmium from its first major tributary to its mouth. Nine of ten major tributaries that we sampled exceeded EPA thresholds for at least one metal on at least one of three sampling dates. Our findings indicate that habitat quality for resident and anadromous fish has been severely degraded in the Salmon River watershed. Loss of important spawning habitat in the Salmon and many other streams in the region might help explain a recent crash in chum salmon returns, which local communities depend upon for commercial and subsistence harvest.},

  abstract     = {The origin and phylogenetic distribution of symbiotic associations between nodulating angiosperms and nitrogen-fixing bacteria have long intrigued biologists. Recent comparative evolutionary analyses have yielded alternative hypotheses: a multistep pathway of independent gains and losses of root nodule symbiosis vs. a single gain followed by numerous losses. A detailed reconstruction of the history of genes involved in signaling between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and potential hosts, particularly lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signaling, is needed to distinguish between these hypotheses. LCO recognition by plants involves the Nod Factor Perception ( NFP ) gene family; in the legume model Medicago truncatula (Fabales), MtNFP is essential for establishing rhizobial symbiosis. Here, we document convergent evolution of NFP , indicating multiple origins of LCO-driven symbiosis. In contrast to previous models that explain the recruitment of NFP via a single duplication in the ancestor of the nitrogen-fixing clade, our phylogenomic and synteny results suggest this duplication does not span the entire clade. Tandem duplication in a common ancestor of Cucurbitales and Rosales resulted in the NFP1 and NFP2 groups. In contrast, the phylogenetically closest paralog of MtNFP is MtLYR1 , located on a different chromosome within a large syntenic block. All available data indicate that a large-scale duplication resulted in MtNFP and MtLYR1 , likely corresponding to a whole-genome duplication in an ancestor of subfamily Papilionoideae of Fabaceae. We show that MtNFP and the NFP2 -like group are not orthologous, indicating multiple independent gains of NFP -based LCO signaling. This molecular convergence provides a possible mechanism for multiple gains of root nodule symbiosis across the nitrogen-fixing clade.},

  abstract     = {The iron-based high- T c superconductors (SCs) exhibit rich phase diagrams with intertwined phases, including magnetism, nematicity, and superconductivity. The superconducting T c in many of these materials is maximized in the regime of strong nematic fluctuations, making the role of nematicity in influencing the superconductivity a topic of intense research. Here, we use the AC elastocaloric effect (ECE) to map out the phase diagram of Ba(Fe 1− x Co x ) 2 As 2 near optimal doping. The ECE signature at T c on the overdoped side, where superconductivity condenses without any nematic order, is quantitatively consistent with other thermodynamic probes that indicate a single-component superconducting state. In contrast, on the slightly underdoped side, where superconductivity condenses within the nematic phase, ECE reveals a second thermodynamic transition proximate to and below T c . We rule out magnetism and reentrant tetragonality as the origin of this transition and find that our observations strongly suggest a phase transition into a multicomponent superconducting state. This implies the existence of a subdominant pairing instability that competes strongly with the dominant s ± instability. Our results highlight the significant role of nematic order in determining the pairing symmetry close to optimal doping in this extensively studied iron-based SC, while also demonstrating the power of ECE in uncovering strain-tuned phase diagrams of quantum materials.},

Alterations in nuclear size or the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio are hallmark features of cancer cells and often correlate with disease progression. However, the mechanisms underlying nuclear size abnormalities and their impact on tumor progression remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that nuclear hypertrophy occurs in response to enhanced DNA replication stress, a key characteristic of cancer cells. Increased actin polymerization within the nucleus appears to be the primary mechanism driving nuclear hypertrophy downstream of the ATR-CHEK1 pathway. Replication stress–induced nuclear hypertrophy alters transcriptomic profiles and chromatin topology, while reducing the migratory and metastatic capacity of cancer cells. In addition, nuclear hypertrophy in cancer cells is associated with increased infiltration of antitumor immune cells. Our findings suggest that cell-autonomous effects of nuclear hypertrophy do not promote cellular fitness or aggressive characteristics in cancer cells. This may explain why cells with nuclear hypertrophy are not positively selected and persist as a subpopulation during tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, the link between replication stress and nuclear hypertrophy provides insights into why enlarged nuclei are consistently observed in advanced-stage cancers.},

This method enables customization and large-scale production of exosomes with specific functionalities, potentially advancing precision therapies across a wide array of diseases. As demonstrated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models, exosomes derived from hybrid cells (HCs) (H/Exos) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neutrophils efficiently targeted AD-affected areas via LFA-1/ICAM-1 and improved the cognition of AD mice. Beyond directly promoting neural repair and inhibiting inflammation, we surprisingly found that H/Exos increased microglia abundance, modulated microglia gene expression, enhanced the endocytic and lysosomal function, and promoted microglial phagocytic phenotypic differentiation to clear Aβ. This hybridoma-inspired strategy offers a versatile and practical way to engineer exosomes with desired therapeutic functions, representing a promising direction for personalized therapies.},

  abstract     = {Ocular fibrosis, a severe consequence of excessive retinal wound healing, can lead to vision loss following retinal injury. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a common form of ocular fibrosis, is a major cause of blindness, characterized by the formation of extensive fibrous proliferative membranes. Understanding the cellular origins of PVR-associated fibroblasts (PAFs) is essential to decipher the mechanisms of ocular wound healing. In this study, we combined single-cell transcriptomics with genetic lineage tracing to map the contributions of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, immune cells, and Müller cells to disease progression. RPE cells were found to constitute the largest fraction of cells within PVR lesions, transitioning through metabolic, proliferative, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition stages during their conversion to PAFs. These cells exhibited remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity. Notably, Pdgfrb + RPE cells demonstrated significant morphological plasticity, transitioning toward a fibroblast-like phenotype, while macrophage-like RPE cells acquired inflammation-related functions post-PVR. Cell communication network analysis identified Thbs1 (encoding TSP-1) as a key hub gene driving RPE cell fate transitions during PVR. Importantly, therapeutic antibodies targeting TSP-1 significantly mitigated PVR progression. This study provides a detailed roadmap of fibrosis formation during ocular wound healing and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting TSP-1 in the management of PVR.},

In this study, we found that increased severity in IAV infection and reduced innate immune response correlated with extensive mitophagy in senescent human cells and in the lung of aged mice. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) was identified as strongly elevated in the lungs and sera of aged human (>65 y old) and mouse (>21 mo old). ApoD was able to localize to mitochondria and interact, through its WXXI motif in the LC3B-Interacting Region domain, with LC3B to trigger mitophagy during IAV infection, in a PINK1 pathway independent manner, which attenuated type I interferon response and promoted virus replication. ApoD deficiency, on the other hand, protected older mice from severe influenza and improved survival. Likewise, depletion of senescent cells by ABT-263, a senolytic compound, in aged mice lowered ApoD level and restored innate immune antiviral response, limiting virus propagation and associated pulmonary damage.

  abstract     = {During wound healing, tumor growth, and organ formation, epithelial cells migrate and cluster in layered tissue environments. Although cellular mechanosensing of adhered extracellular matrices is now well recognized, it is unclear how deeply cells sense through distant matrix layers. Since single cells can mechanosense stiff basal surfaces through soft hydrogels of <10 μm thickness, here we ask whether cellular collectives can perform such “depth-mechanosensing” through thicker matrix layers. Using a collagen-polyacrylamide double-layer hydrogel, we found that epithelial cell collectives can mechanosense basal substrates at a depth of >100 μm, assessed by cell clustering and collagen deformation. On collagen layers with stiffer basal substrates, cells initially migrate slower while performing higher collagen deformation and stiffening, resulting in reduced dispersal of epithelial clusters. These processes occur in two broad phases: cellular clustering and dynamic collagen deformation, followed by cell migration and dispersal. Using a cell-populated collagen-polyacrylamide computational model, we show that stiffer basal substrates enable higher collagen deformation, which in turn extends the clustering phase of epithelial cells and reduces their dispersal. Disruption of collective collagen deformation, by either α-catenin depletion or myosin-II inhibition, disables the depth-mechanosensitive differences in epithelial responses between soft and stiff basal substrates. These findings suggest that depth-mechanosensing is an emergent property that arises from collective collagen deformation caused by epithelial cell clusters. This work broadens the conventional understanding of epithelial mechanosensing from immediate surfaces to underlying basal matrices, providing insights relevant to tissue contexts with layers of varying stiffness, such as wound healing and tumor invasion.},

  abstract     = {Despite periods of permanent darkness and extensive ice coverage in polar environments, photosynthetic ice diatoms display a remarkable capability of living inside the ice matrix. How these organisms navigate such hostile conditions with limited light and extreme cold remains unknown. Using a custom subzero temperature microscope during an Arctic expedition, we present the finding of motility at record-low temperatures in a Eukaryotic cell. By characterizing the gliding motility of several ice diatom species, collected from ice cores in the Chukchi Sea, we record that they retain motility at temperatures as low as − 15 ° C. Remarkably, ice diatoms can glide on ice substrates, a capability absent in temperate diatoms of the same genus. This unique ability arises from adaptations in extracellular mucilage that allow ice diatoms to adhere to ice, essential for gliding. Even on glass substrates where both cell types retain motility at freezing temperatures, ice diatoms move an order of magnitude faster, with their optimal motility shifting toward colder temperatures. Combining field and laboratory experiments with thermo-hydrodynamic modeling, we reveal adaptive strategies that enable gliding motility in cold environments. These strategies involve increasing internal energy efficiency with minimal changes in heat capacity and activation enthalpy, and reducing external dissipation by minimizing the temperature sensitivity of mucilage viscosity. The finding of diatoms’ ice gliding motility opens new routes for understanding their survival within a harsh ecological niche and their migratory responses to environmental changes. Our work highlights the robust adaptability of ice diatoms in one of Earth’s most extreme settings.},

  abstract     = {Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are highly compartmentalized neurons whose long axons serve as the sole connection between the eye and the brain. In both injury and disease, RGC degeneration occurs in a similarly compartmentalized manner, with distinct molecular and cellular responses in the axonal and somatodendritic regions. The goal of this study was to establish a microfluidic-based platform to investigate RGC compartmentalization in both health and disease states. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived RGCs were seeded into microfluidic devices that allow physical separation of axons from the somatodendritic compartment, enabling precise study of each region. Initial experiments characterized axonal outgrowth and the specific segregation of axons and dendrites. We then examined compartment-specific phenotypes in RGCs carrying the OPTN(E50K) glaucoma mutation compared to isogenic controls, including differences in axonal growth and axonal transport efficiency, with OPTN-mutant RGCs showing reduced axon length and slower transport, hallmarks of neurodegeneration. Axonal RNA-seq analyses revealed transcriptomic alterations related to disease states, including specific transcriptomic changes along OPTN axons. To assess glial influences on axonal health, we developed models with astrocytes localized specifically to the proximal axonal compartment and modulated their disease states to simulate pathological conditions. Importantly, the induction of diseased astrocytes solely along proximal axons triggered compartment-specific neurodegenerative changes in RGCs. Collectively, this platform represents a successful recapitulation of the spatially distinct features of hPSC-derived RGCs under both healthy and disease conditions, offering a physiologically relevant, human-specific in vitro system to study neuronal development, axon–glia interactions, and mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.},

  abstract     = {The size and composition of local species pools are, in part, determined by past dispersal events. Predicting how communities respond to future disturbances, such as fluctuating environmental conditions, requires knowledge of such histories. We assessed the influence of a historical dispersal event on community assembly by simulating various scales of dispersal for 240 serpentine annual plant communities that experienced a large shift from drought to high rainfall conditions over three years. We collected, aggregated, and redistributed the aboveground seed bank (i.e., all loose seed present on the soil surface before the growing season initiates) from 30 sites across five nested spatial scales ( ∼ 1 m, 5 m, 100 m, 5 km, and 10 km), and annually censused communities to identify change in community structure among dispersal scales and over time. Our one-time dispersal manipulation diversified aboveground seed banks, provided insurance against temporal variability at intermediate and large dispersal distances ( ≥ 100 m), and even supported community reassembly toward a new compositional state at the 10 km scale. We also found evidence that temporal lags directed community responses to environmental fluctuations, preventing rare species extirpations and providing subordinate species discrete windows of time to supplement their seed banks. Our results reveal a joint spatiotemporal equilibrium in this system where dispersal through space interacts with temporal fluctuations in climate to support species’ persistence via aboveground seed banks. This experiment underscores the importance of dispersal for diversity maintenance in this global biodiversity hotspot, where the magnitude and frequency of future climate fluctuations is uncertain.},

Here, we demonstrate that posttranscriptional regulation by the RNA binding protein HuR is essential for the homeostatic self-replenishment of innate B-1a cells, the expansion of B-1 cell clones targeting self-antigens, and the production of natural autoantibodies. HuR KO B-1 cells fail to express the high levels of surface B-cell receptor (BCR), TACI, and BAFFR required for tonic signaling and cell survival. At the molecular level, HuR promotes the translation of messenger RNAs encoding the IgM heavy chain and modules, in a direct or indirect manner, the expression of TACI and BAFFR. In summary, we reveal the need for posttranscriptional regulation in BCR expression, tonic signaling, and homeostatic maintenance of functional innate B-1 cells.},

We explore a common scenario in omics, where statistically independent cross-sectional samples are available at a few time points, and the goal is to infer the underlying diffusion process that generated the data. Existing inference approaches often simplify or ignore noise intrinsic to the system, compromising accuracy for the sake of optimization ease. We circumvent this compromise by inferring the phase-space probability flow that shares the same time-dependent marginal distributions as the underlying stochastic process. Our approach, probability flow inference (PFI), disentangles force from intrinsic stochasticity while retaining the algorithmic ease of ordinary differential equation (ODE) inference. Analytically, we prove that for Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes the regularized PFI formalism yields a unique solution in the limit of well-sampled distributions. In practical applications, we show that PFI enables accurate parameter and force estimation in high-dimensional stochastic reaction networks, and that it allows inference of cell differentiation dynamics with molecular noise, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.},

Our EV adoption scenarios are informed by 1) an Energy Information Administration scenario with no policy intervention, 2) EV growth expected under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), 3) a Biden Administration 50% EV sales target by 2030, 4) the Environmental Protection Agency’s projections under vehicle emissions standards, and 5) the International Energy Agency’s roadmap to Net Zero by 2050. We find across these scenarios that increasing EV adoption induces investment in new wind, solar, storage, and natural gas capacity, affecting power generation mix and emissions. The net effect of increasing EV adoption beyond our IRA base case is to increase power sector emissions by about 5 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year in 2026 (comparable to displaced gasoline vehicle combustion emissions), but this effect rapidly drops to annual levels below 1 mtCO 2 eq per EV-year by 2032 and continues below this level through 2050. Consequential effects of EV adoption vary regionally, with most regions primarily increasing wind or solar capacity and some regions primarily increasing natural gas capacity, even in 2050. Our national emissions estimates per EV-year are relatively robust to the level of EV adoption beyond our baseline and to variation in assumptions about power systems, EV behavior, and policy.},

When mutated, the P2X2R exacerbates age- and noise-related hearing loss, but selective modulators of the receptor are lacking, and the molecular basis of activation and desensitization remains poorly understood. Here, we determine high-resolution cryoelectron microscopy structures of the full-length wild-type human P2X2R in an apo closed state and two distinct ATP-bound desensitized states. In the apo closed state structure, we observe features unique to the P2X2R and locate disease mutations within or near the transmembrane domain. In addition, our ATP-bound structures show how free anionic ATP forms subtype-specific interactions with the orthosteric binding site. We identify and characterize two different ATP-bound desensitized state structures, one similar to published models for other P2XR subtypes, and a second alternate conformation not previously observed. A loop adjacent to the orthosteric binding site between these two ATP-bound desensitized state structures undergoes significant conformational changes. These movements are supported by multireplicate, microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulation studies and suggest a path by which ATP could enter or leave the orthosteric pocket. Together, our results provide structural insights into the P2X2R, facilitating structure-based drug development for this therapeutically important target.},

Here, we explored the structure and population variability of the CACNA1C intron 3 VNTR using 155 long-read genome assemblies from 78 diverse individuals. Based on sequence differences among repeat units, we clustered individual sequences into 7 VNTR structural alleles called Types. Three Types were related through large duplications, but the other Types diverged much earlier such that only 12 repeat units at the 5′ end of the VNTR were shared across most Types. The most diverged Types were rare and present only in individuals with African ancestry, but a multiallelic structural polymorphism was present across populations at different frequencies, consistent with expansion of the VNTR preceding the emergence of early hominins. We demonstrated that this polymorphism was in complete linkage disequilibrium with fine-mapped schizophrenia variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and that this risk haplotype was associated with decreased CACNA1C gene expression in the brain. Our work suggests that sequence variation within a human-specific VNTR affects gene expression and provides a detailed characterization of new alleles at a flagship neuropsychiatric GWAS locus.},

  abstract     = {Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) is the central prey species in the Southern Ocean food web, supporting the largest and fastest-growing fishery in the region, managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Climate change is threatening krill populations and their predators, while current catch limits do not take into account climate variability or krill population dynamics. In 2024, CCAMLR was unable to renew its spatial catch limits, highlighting the urgent need for improved management of the krill fishery to prevent any harm to the Southern Ocean ecosystem. To address this, we propose a management framework that integrates variability in krill recruitment and key pathways between spawning and nursery areas—a krill stock hypothesis—to inform decisions on catch limits and conservation measures. Implementing this approach will require targeted data collection, which we propose can be achieved through a multisector collaborative network that combines traditional and new technologies, including the use of fishing vessels as data collection platforms. We use case studies to demonstrate how fisheries can contribute to data collection while promoting sustainable management. A major challenge in this effort is securing long-term funding for data collection, which is critical for managing climate-sensitive populations of high commercial interest. We therefore recommend using the industry as a source of funding, research platform and data provider, alongside national research funding opportunities. Given the fundamental role of krill in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, its decline would have cascading effects on predators and essential ecosystem services.},

  abstract     = {In mammals, a hierarchically organized circadian timing system orchestrates daily rhythms of nearly all physiology. A master pacemaker in the brain’s suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) synchronizes subsidiary clocks in most peripheral organs. By driving anabolic and catabolic cycles of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates and by detoxifying endo- and xenobiotic components, the liver plays an important role in adapting the metabolic needs to rest-activity rhythms. In keeping with these functions, the liver expresses many clock-controlled genes that are required for these processes. Remarkably, however, this organ also fluctuates in size and morphological parameters. In mice, the mass of the liver increases and decreases by 30 to 40% during the 24-h day. The oscillation in liver mass is accompanied by daily rhythms of similar amplitudes in hepatocyte cell size and global RNA and protein accumulation. The number of ribosomes, which parallels the ups and downs of liver size, appears to be the rate-limiting factor in driving the diurnal rhythms of overall protein synthesis. Obviously, the rapid increase in hepatocyte size within the liver engenders mechanical stress, which must be dealt with by increasing the physical robustness of cells. Indeed, the actin cytoskeleton of hepatocytes undergoes dramatic polymerization cycles. Thus, massive intracellular and subcortical F-actin bundles are assembled during the night, at which the liver reaches its maximal size. In turn, the oscillation in actin polymerization elicits rhythms in myocardin-related transcription factors-serum response factor signaling, which participate in the circadian transcription of the core clock gene Per2 and thereby contribute to the synchronization of hepatocyte clocks.},

Research has suggested that class-based differences in factors such as socialization practices and access to resources partly explain this phenomenon, but less work has explored whether teachers’ practices also exacerbate these inequalities. Using whole-class observations of 63 preschool classroom discussions ( N = 226 students, 10 teachers), we coded 7,941 student participation attempts and subsequent responses from teachers. Mixed-effects Bayesian logistic regressions showed that whether students played by the rules by raising their hands or broke the rules by calling out, they were less likely to have their participation attempts accepted if they came from a working-class background, even when their perceived language skills were matched to their middle- and upper-class peers. These results suggest that early schooling experiences may serve to exacerbate inequalities rather than level the playing field.},

  abstract     = {The awakening of dormant disseminated cancer cells appears to be responsible for the clinical relapses of patients whose primary tumors have been successfully cured months and even years earlier. In the present study, we demonstrate that dormant breast cancer cells lodged in the lungs reside in a highly mesenchymal, nonproliferative phenotypic state. The awakening of these cells is not triggered by a cancer cell-autonomous process. Instead, lung inflammation induced by the chemotherapeutic agent bleomycin effectively awakens dormant cancer cells, providing useful models for studying metastatic awakening. Mechanistically, the awakened cells shift from a highly mesenchymal to a quasi-mesenchymal phenotypic state in which they acquire tumorigenicity and proliferative ability. Once awakened, these cells can stably reside in this quasi-mesenchymal state and maintain their tumor-initiating ability, doing so without ongoing heterotypic signaling from the lung microenvironment. Epidermal growth factor receptor ligands released by the cells of the injured tissue microenvironment, including notably M2 type macrophages, promote dormant cancer cells to move toward this quasi-mesenchymal state, a transition that is critical for the awakening process. An understanding of the mechanisms of metastatic awakening may lead in the future to treatment strategies designed to prevent such awakening and resulting metastatic relapse.},

Data suggest that the cause was a reduction in Panama wind-jet frequency, duration, and strength, possibly related to the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position during the 2024–2025 La Niña, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Nevertheless, the consequences are likely significant, including decreases in fisheries productivity and exacerbated thermal stress on corals that typically benefit from upwelling’s cooling.

  abstract     = {Despite the clinical significance of many nonenveloped viruses, the molecular mechanisms of their internalization and membrane penetration are not well understood. Rotaviruses (RVs) are nonenveloped double-stranded RNA viruses and the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young children. We identified fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (encoded by FA2H ) in the fatty acid 2-hydroxylation pathway as a proviral gene that supports RV infection. Genetic ablation of FA2H interfered with an early step in RV entry for multiple human and animal strains. Intestinal epithelial cell–specific deletion of Fa2h limited RV replication and diarrhea incidence in vivo. Using transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence, we found that viral particles were trapped in early and late endosomes in FA2H knockout cells, preventing their further exit into the cytosol. The defect in RV infectivity could be partially restored by treatment of cells with long-chain 2-hydroxy ceramides or a calcium channel activator that promotes Ca 2+ efflux from endosomes. Both Junín virus, an arenavirus, and Shiga toxin, dependent on endosomal Ca 2+ transport, required FA2H for efficient entry. Together, this study highlights a role of fatty acid 2-hydroxylation in RV entry into host cells and implicates 2-hydroxy ceramides as potential key regulators of endosomal Ca 2+ levels, offering important insights for the development of host-directed therapies targeting fatty acid 2-hydroxylation to control microbial infections.},

  abstract     = {Cyanobacteria achieve highly efficient photosynthesis using a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism relying on specialized Type I (NDH-1) complexes. Among these, NDH-1 3 and NDH-1 4 catalyze redox-coupled hydration of CO 2 to bicarbonate, supporting carbon fixation in carboxysomes. The mechanism of coupling electron transfer to CO 2 -hydration by these variant NDH-1 complexes remains unknown. We engineered a Synechococcus PCC7942 strain that expresses exclusively the high flux/low affinity NDH-1 4 complex, enabling the observation of the coupling of CO 2 hydration to cyclic electron flow in isolation from the other NDH-1 isoforms normally present in cells. We found that inhibition of the CupB protein by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ethoxzolamide (EZ) suppressed CO 2 uptake, slowed photosystem I rereduction, and abolished proton pumping as probed by acridine orange fluorescence. These effects were absent in strains lacking Cup proteins, confirming specificity. The results demonstrate that CO 2 hydration and electron transfer through NDH-1 4 are tightly coupled via proton translocation across the thylakoid membrane. These findings provide direct evidence for the bidirectional interaction in bioenergetic coupling between the plastoquinone reduction and the CO 2 uptake at the distal Zn-site over a span of ~150 Å and support a proton-removal hypothesis involving the proton transfer pathways from the Zn-site of CO 2 hydration to an energetically coupled proton loading site evolutionarily repurposed from the ancestral proton pumping mechanism to enable energetic CO 2 uptake.},

  abstract     = {Nanoporous structures play a critical role in a wide range of applications, including catalysis, thermoelectrics, energy storage, gas adsorption, and thermal insulation. However, their thermal instability remains a persistent challenge. Inspired by the extraordinary resilience of tardigrades, an “atomic armor” strategy is introduced to enhance the stability of nanoporous structures. Applied to mesoporous silica at parts-per-million levels, the atomic armor provides thermal resistance exceeding that of existing stabilization techniques. Thermal treatment at 1,000 °C for 168 h results in a fivefold increase in specific surface area, 66% lower thermal conductivity, and a sixfold increase in pore volume compared to untreated samples. Surface viscosity is linked to sintering resistance, and glass transition temperature and fragility are introduced as design parameters. Machine-learned interatomic potentials and metabasin escape algorithm-assisted molecular dynamics simulations are employed to reveal that materials traditionally classified as nonglass formers can exhibit glass transition temperatures and display intrinsic fragility. Alumina is identified as having a record-high glass transition temperature. By modulating the surface viscosity of nanoparticles, this approach stabilizes nanoporous structures effectively. The proposed method offers a simple and universal posttreatment process for improving the thermal stability of nanoporous structures.},

  abstract     = {Digital bioanalysis enables highly sensitive detection of biomolecules at the single-molecule level, making it a widely used technique in biomedical research. However, conventional approaches typically rely on fluorescence detection of single-enzyme reactions, which limits molecular selectivity and the ability to analyze multiple targets simultaneously. To address these limitations, we developed a digital bioanalysis platform based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy and microchamber arrays decorated with silver nanoparticles. This platform achieves a million-fold amplification of Raman signals from products generated by single-enzyme reactions, enabling precise digital counting of enzyme biomarkers with high molecular selectivity and multiplexing capability. We applied this platform to detect and distinguish two closely related enzyme biomarkers, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase. By leveraging the sharp and distinct Raman spectral signatures of the reaction products, the platform achieved multiplexed biomarker quantification with femtomolar-level sensitivity. As a proof-of-concept, the platform successfully quantified AChE in human cerebrospinal fluid within 8.5 min, highlighting its potential utility in clinical diagnostics, particularly for differentiating types of dementia based on subtle differences in enzyme levels. Hence, this study presents a valuable alternative to fluorescence-based digital bioanalysis by offering enhanced molecular selectivity and multiplexing capability. Its application extends the scope of digital bioanalysis and broadens its capacity to quantify multiple biomarkers in complex biological samples with high precision and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Redox-sensitive elements figure prominently in studies of the evolution of Earth’s surface redox state, including the first major rise in atmospheric O 2 , the Paleoproterozoic Great Oxidation Event. Most Precambrian rocks endured multistage tectonothermal histories, however, adding ambiguity to interpretation of their chemistry. Here, we apply U-Th-Pb isotope geochronology to the highly oxidized ~2.06 Ga Kuetsjärvi Volcanic Formation, Pechenga Greenstone Belt, Russia, to constrain the age and extent of U oxidation. By contrasting the relative mobility of U and Th using Pb isotopes, we find that complete to near-complete oxidation and removal of U occurred shortly after eruption. We argue that this likely indicates relatively high atmospheric O 2 , where oxidative weathering and alteration produced a global pulse of U to the oceans. Such a pulse could explain widespread shifts in the U-Th-Pb isotope character of mantle reservoirs at ~2 Ga, including a decrease in the 232 Th/ 238 U ratio of the mid-ocean ridge basalt source and inception of the high- 238 U/ 204 Pb (HIMU) source to ocean island basalts, underscoring the connections between the redox character of the Paleoproterozoic surface and deep Earth. Using 207 Pb- 206 Pb, 238 U- 206 Pb, 235 U- 207 Pb, and 232 Th- 208 Pb geochronology, ~2.06 Ga oxidative loss of U may be distinguished from reintroduction of U at ~1.8 Ga during regional metamorphism, as well as Pb loss during a Phanerozoic tectonothermal event. Our results therefore establish the complex history of redox-sensitive element behavior in the rocks, highlighting the fact that elemental abundances, by themselves, are unlikely to capture straightforward proxy information in rocks that have seen multistage geologic histories.},

  abstract     = {How drugs penetrate tissues is poorly understood yet important, since drugs that fail to reach their target will be ineffective. We followed the fate of anthracycline cancer drugs at high resolution by exploiting their intrinsic fluorescence. In a cell-based spheroid model, the soluble compound fluorescein penetrates the entire spheroid, unlike hydrophobic fluorescent lipids, which only enter the outermost cell layer. Anthracyclines have intermediate hydrophobicity. They enter the nucleus of a few outer cell layers at neutral pH, but penetrate the spheroids more deeply under acidic conditions, with a reduction in cell entry and cytotoxicity. The glycolytic conditions that prevail in the tumor microenvironment may thus limit cell entry and contribute to anthracycline drug resistance. We evaluated a library of anthracycline variants to determine the physicochemical properties related to tissue penetration depth. We find that this is determined by only three chemical properties: molar refractivity, topological polar surface area, and water solubility. Our findings suggest that modifications of anthracyclines may improve access and activity to deeply tissue-embedded targets such as pancreatic cancer.},

The SV2A-BRV-UCB1244283 structure reveals how UCB1244283 allosterically enhances BRV binding by occupying an allosteric site near the primary binding site, preventing BRV dissociation. This allosteric site, formed by hydrophobic and uncharged residues, is an uncharacterized small-molecule binding site in SV2A. Structural analysis and mutagenesis demonstrate that an allosteric network between the primary and allosteric sites governs high-affinity ASM binding. Our studies suggest that UCB1244283 selectively binds SV2A over SV2B and SV2C, with specific mutations disrupting binding. Structures of SV2A-UCB-J and SV2A-UCB7361 show that UCB1244283 binding is only possible when the primary site ligand does not overlap with the allosteric site, and that repositioning of Ser601, Thr605, and Leu655 is critical for allosteric ligand binding. Structural comparison of multiple SV2A complexes reveals that primary site occupancy shapes the conformation of the lumenal half of the transmembrane domain, influencing how UCB1244283 binds via a connected network that differentially stabilizes TM1 in either an open or closed conformation and repositions key allosteric and primary site residues. These insights provide a foundation for developing therapeutics targeting the allosteric site and modulating SV2A function.},

  abstract     = {The ESX-5 secretion system, uniquely found in slow-growing mycobacteria, is predicted to secrete over 150 proteins across the inner membrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ). Although many of these substrates are believed to promote M.tb virulence, most remain poorly characterized. Here, we use a complete locus deletion strain of ESX-5 in M.tb to examine the molecular changes caused by a broad loss in ESX-5 secretory substrates. We confirmed the selective loss of PE/PPE proteins secreted by ESX-5 into both the culture filtrate (CF) and outer mycomembrane (OMM) fractions of the M.tb ∆esx5 mutant. In examining other ESX systems, we found that ESX-1 substrate levels were increased in both the CF and OMM fractions of the ∆esx5 mutant. Conversely, the ESX-3 locus was transcriptionally repressed upon ESX-5 deletion. We noted that the ∆esx5 mutant had altered morphology in the form of wrinkled distortions of the bacterial surface. Likewise, we identified increased susceptibility of the ∆esx5 mutant to a variety of large (molecular weight >550 g/mol) antimicrobial compounds, suggesting that an intact ESX-5 system is required for M.tb to exclude such molecules. Our findings suggest that removing the ESX-5 system from M.tb fundamentally alters the properties of the mycobacterial OMM and impacts the expression and secretion activity of other ESX systems.},

Photophysical characterizations and conductivity measurements confirm the occurrence of energy/charge transfer and photocurrent generation upon optical excitation in both dry and electrolytic environments. Comparing an electrostatic sequence pair against a sequence-matched donor–acceptor coassembly, we demonstrate that the sequence design with charge complementarity shows more prominent photocurrent behavior. With the flanking bioadhesive units, the primary and stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes interfaced with covalently stabilized films of the optoelectronic nanostructures exhibited material-stimulated genotypic, structural, or functional cardiac features. Collectively, our findings introduce an optoelectronic cardiac biomaterial where coassembled peptide nanostructures are molecularly designed to induce light sensitivity in excitable cells without gene modification, influencing in vitro cardiac contractile behavior and expression of cardiac markers.},

Nonetheless, this nanobody required a weakened outer membrane to access its target and elicit its toxic activity. Borrowing from observations of innate immune proteins, we found that resurfacing nanobodies with positively charged residues enabled them to bind and perturb the gram-negative outer membrane, but this alone was not sufficient for toxic activity. However, when we resurface our lipid A-targeting nanobody, it gained the ability to disrupt the outer membrane and enact its antibacterial function against wild-type bacteria.

We developed a CRISPR knockout screen to identify host factors that impact ZIKV replication, resulting in the finding of angiomotin-like protein 2 (AMOTL2), a protein that inhibits ZIKV by regulating the host type I interferon (IFN) response. AMOTL2 affects IFN signaling by modulating STAT1 levels and activation in response to type I IFN. Thus, AMOTL2, which has largely been studied for its role in cancer, represents an antiviral protein that interacts with the IFN signaling pathway to promote downstream expression of IFN stimulated genes, resulting in restriction of ZIKV.},

  abstract     = {In mammals, sperm formation is completed in the seminiferous tubules within the testis, and sperm maturation occurs during the epididymal transit of the spermatozoa. Sperm morphology drastically changes when abnormal spermatozoa migrate from the testis to the epididymis. Detailed molecular mechanisms for sperm survival in the epididymis have not been determined yet. Globozoospermia is a cause of male infertility and is characterized by round-headed spermatozoa without acrosomes, an abnormal sperm nuclear membrane, and sperm midpiece defects. Testis expressed 50 ( Tex50 ) is a testis-enriched gene that is expressed in mice and humans. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we generated Tex50 knockout (KO) mice and found that the KO males were sterile due to epididymal sperm malformations and impaired sperm motility. Surprisingly, electron microscopy, sperm morphology, and globozoospermia-related protein expression and localization in the KO testis were all normal. To understand this phenotype in more detail, we created TEX50-mCherry knockin mice to determine the localization of the TEX50 protein during spermatogenesis. The mCherry signals detected a ring-shaped structure surrounding the sperm acrosome and migrated to the posterior region of the sperm head. After the acrosome reaction, most of the spermatozoa retained mCherry signals. These results indicate that the Tex50 KO globozoospermia phenotype occurs after the migration of spermatozoa from the testis to the epididymis. We found that sperm membrane protein TEX50 is a putative key molecule to survive against globozoospermia-like malformations in the epididymis. It is essential for complete sperm formation and male fertility in mice.},

  abstract     = {An explosion of recent research uses remote imaging spectroscopy from aircraft and spacecraft to detect and quantify methane point source emissions. These instruments first map the methane enhancement field and then combine this information with the effective wind speed to estimate the source emission rate. This wind speed is typically the largest uncertainty in derived emission rates. It is often, by necessity, inferred from coarse-resolution meteorological reanalysis products which do not match the spatial or temporal extent of wind experienced by the gas plume. Here, we circumvent this problem by simultaneously measuring plume velocity using the same spectrometer that maps the methane plume. Our approach acquires multiple consecutive views of the same point source, with visual tracking of the plume’s features to estimate its ground velocity. This resolves the representational mismatch between reanalysis and effective wind speeds. It provides data with exact spatiotemporal coincidence to the plume being measured. The approach facilitates dramatic improvement in the precision of remote methane point source quantification.},

  abstract     = {Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a target for near-term climate change mitigation. In many natural ecosystems, methane is sequestered by microbial communities, yet little is known about how constituents of methane-oxidizing communities interact with each other and their environment. This lack of mechanistic understanding is a common issue for many important microbial communities, but it is difficult to draw links between available sequencing information and the metabolites that govern community interactions. Here, we develop and apply a technique called inverse stable isotope probing–metabolomics (InverSIP) to bridge the gap between metagenomic and metabolomic information and functionally characterize interactions in a complex methane-oxidizing community. Using InverSIP, we link a highly transcribed biosynthetic gene cluster in the community with its secondary metabolite product: methylocystabactin, a triscatecholate siderophore not previously observed in nature. We find that production of methylocystabactin is widespread among methanotrophic alphaproteobacteria and that it can be used by another methanotroph in the community that does not produce this siderophore itself. Functional assays reveal that methylocystabactin supports methanotroph growth and the activity of the methane-oxidizing enzyme soluble methane monooxygenase under conditions where bioavailable iron is limited, establishing an important molecular link between methane-oxidation and the insoluble iron found in many natural environments. These findings contribute to a molecular-level understanding of these environmentally important bacterial communities and establish InverSIP as a broadly applicable genomics-guided strategy for characterizing metabolites in microbial ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Here, we explore the long-term history of chemical weathering and particle transport from the continents to the oceans by leveraging the histories of Zr/Al, Rb/Al, and Na/Al in marine sediments over the last 2000 My. We interpret these data in the context of elemental behavior in modern weathering environments and modern marine sediments. We find that from 2000 Mya to ca. 650 Mya, physical erosion was effective, where braided rivers efficiently delivered particles from land to the sea. Overall, chemical weathering was less efficient than now, although many easily weatherable minerals were as weathered as today. We suggest a dramatic change in weathering dynamics after 650 Mya when modern-like deep subduction originated. With this development, mantle dynamics, by promoting periodic vigorous subduction and intense mountain building, began to control the intensity of chemical weathering and particle transport to the oceans. Through spectral analysis of several geochemical records, we find that during times of enhanced subduction and mountain building, continents underwent periods of net erosion and less intense chemical weathering, while during periods of less intense subduction, continents accumulated particles, and chemical weathering was more intense. The evolution and proliferation of land plants changed chemical weathering intensity but had little apparent impact on the cyclic nature of particle transport and storage on the continents. These results could offer a framework to better understand the evolution of elemental cycling from the continents to the oceans over the last 2000 My.},

However, recent work suggests that on nonwetting surfaces, whether microdroplets stick or bounce depends only on their size and fluid properties, but not on the incoming velocity. Here, we show using theory and experiments that even poorly wetting surfaces have a velocity-dependent criterion for bouncing of aqueous droplets, which is as high as 6 m/s for diameters of 30 to 50 μ m on hydrophobic surfaces such as Teflon. We quantify this criterion by analyzing the interplay of dissipation, surface adhesion, and incoming kinetic energy, and describe a wealth of associated phenomena, including air bubbles and satellite droplets.

Here, we subjected the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 to a long-term evolution experiment under high light, high temperature, and elevated CO 2 levels. After 1,200 generations, we obtained a strain exhibiting a 600% increase in growth rate. Whole-genome sequencing revealed three mutations fixed in the evolved population, two of which were sufficient to recapitulate the fast-growing phenotype in the wild type. A mutation in the promoter of the shikimate kinase aroK led to its overexpression, while a mutation in the central circadian regulator sasA disrupted both the phase and amplitude of the circadian rhythm. Changes in circadian control led to widespread perturbations in the transcriptome and metabolome. These included major shifts in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle and glycogen storage dynamics. While these changes increased fitness under the experimental conditions, they caused maladaptation when light or CO 2 levels were altered, revealing a trade-off between fitness and environmental flexibility. Our results demonstrate that mutations in circadian control can drive fast adaptation by modulating central metabolism, underscoring the circadian cycle as a cornerstone of cellular plasticity. Thus, targeting the circadian cycle could be key to engineering cyanobacterial strains optimized for carbon fixation and biomass production.},

Despite clear ancestral trait differences, all lines showed highly parallel evolutionary rescue within 20 generations. Long-term average population size varied across source populations and was positively correlated with ancestral development rate, which increased convergently across populations and emerged as the single best predictor of population performance during and after evolutionary rescue. Notably, specific demographic events during rescue (such as the rate of population decline and recovery) were uncorrelated both with ancestral trait distributions and post-rescue adaptation. Our results support prior work showing founder traits as key predictors of adaptation, and highlight their role in long-term adaptation and trait evolution following evolutionary rescue.},

Here, we show that monoallelic missense mutations in TRIM71 are associated with hearing loss (HL) and inner ear aplasia in humans. Utilizing conditional Trim71 knockout mice carrying a CH and HL-associated mutation, we demonstrate that loss of TRIM71 function during early otic development (embryonic day 9 to 10) causes severe HL. While inner ear morphogenesis occurs normally in Trim71 knockout mice, we find that early otic loss of TRIM71 function disrupts the highly stereotyped timing of cell cycle exit and differentiation within the inner ear auditory sensory organ (cochlea), resulting in the premature formation and innervation of mechanosensory hair cells. Transcriptomic profiling of Trim71 -deficient cochlear progenitor cells identifies Inhba and Tgfbr2 as targets of TRIM71 repression, and our analysis of Inhba-Tgfbr1 double knockout mice indicates that TRIM71 maintains hair cell progenitors in a proliferative and undifferentiated state by restricting TGFβ-type signaling. Characterization of hair cells and their associated neurons in adult Trim71 knockout mice revealed reduced presynaptic terminals and neuronal degeneration in the outer hair cell region, providing a basis for the observed hearing deficits in Trim71 knockout mice.},

  abstract     = {As global climate change exacerbates extreme heat events, the interplay between heat stress and blast disease resistance in rice remains poorly understood. In this study, through integrated transcriptome profiling and systematic phenotyping of mutants in several thermosensory pathways, we identified HsfA1 as a positive regulator of heat priming–enhanced blast resistance in rice. Systematic analysis of microRNA (miRNA) dynamics, bioinformatics prediction, and RNA pull-down experiments revealed that miR444b.2 , a temperature-responsive miRNA, directly suppresses the expression of HsfA1 by targeting the second exon of HsfA1 messenger RNA (mRNA). Genetic analyses demonstrated that heat stress–mediated suppression of miR444b.2 expression relieves the repression of HsfA1 , thereby enhancing blast resistance in rice. Furthermore, HsfA1 directly binds to the promoter of AOC1 , a key jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis gene, to activate its expression. Knockout of HsfA1 or AOC1 abolishes heat priming–enhanced JA accumulation and blast disease resistance, and the phenotypes are largely restored via AOC1 overexpression and MeJA treatment. Further identification of HsfA1 natural variants and generation of the HsfA1 uORF -edited lines with improved blast resistance offer potential strategies for breeding disease-resistant rice varieties. This study elucidates the miR444b.2 –HsfA1– AOC1 module that links thermal sensing to JA-mediated blast resistance, providing a molecular blueprint for engineering climate-resilient crops with concurrent biotic–abiotic stress tolerance.},

The binding mechanism was further characterized by the NMR and mutagenesis study. More importantly, we demonstrated that our designed protein binders efficiently reduced TDP-43 amyloid aggregation both in vitro and in cells.

Here, we observe the cell behaviors of the murine neural crest in three dimensions over time and apply a free energy framework to more wholly understand why cells ingress. Guided by work on granular matter that provides a path by which to define the roles of stochastic mechanisms in nonequilibrium systems, we measured and manipulated biophysical parameters in vivo. The data suggest that an energy barrier to cell ingression is overcome by a combination of relatively favorable cell adhesion energies, high cell shape fluctuations, and entropic cell packing configurations. Under those conditions, cell ingression may proceed spontaneously. Recognized biophysical cues likely tilt these parameters to make the process more robust. The results imply that dissipative mechanisms which transiently disorder tissue may underlie some morphogenetic events. Variations of a thermodynamic framework can potentially be applied to integrate various inputs that drive morphogenesis in different contexts.},

This process shifts the water column toward a more autotrophic and alkaline state, effectively sequestering CO 2 from the atmosphere. Over the full culture period, the net carbon sequestered by oyster-driven organic carbon production is 2.39 times greater than the CO 2 sequestered in oyster shells. These findings position oyster farming as a scalable, nature-based solution for climate change mitigation, offering dual benefits of carbon sequestration and enhanced food security.

However, the relative influence of environmental and anthropogenic factors in animal body size evolution, and the coevolution of wild and domestic species remain poorly understood. In the Northwestern Mediterranean, abundant archaeozoological data from well-contextualized sites and reliable paleoenvironmental reconstructions provide a unique opportunity to explore long-term morphological changes and their drivers over time. This study analyzes 81,211 biometric measurements from 311 archaeological sites in Mediterranean France, spanning the past 8,000 y. It examines body size evolution in key wild (red deer, red fox, brown hare, rabbit) and domestic (sheep, goat, cattle, pig, chicken) species alongside vegetation, climate, and human activity changes. Our analyses reveal a long-standing synchrony between wild and domestic species until the last millennium, both influenced by a complex interplay of environmental and anthropogenic factors. From the Early Neolithic to the Roman period, environmental conditions exerted comparable effects on wild and domestic species, though the magnitude and timing of changes varied, reflecting species-specific interactions with humans. From the Middle Ages onward, evolutionary trajectories diverged. Domestic species experienced intensified human selection, while human activities increasingly impacted wild populations and their habitat. These findings highlight the dynamic and interwoven roles of environmental and anthropogenic factors in shaping animal morphological evolution, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in the evolution of domestic species, and illustrating the growing impact of human activities on wild populations.},

  abstract     = {Sexual conflict over mating has been documented in many species, both in the field and in experimental studies. In pond damselflies (family Coenagrionidae), sexual conflict maintains female-limited color polymorphisms, with one female morph typically being a male mimic. However, it is not known whether sexual conflict can also explain the evolutionary origin of novel female morphs, and if so, what ecological factors play a role in this macroevolutionary transition, by modulating the strength of the conflict. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative methods to show that female color polymorphisms are more likely to evolve in temperate regions and open landscapes, whereas region and habitat shifts are independent of female-color states. We also show that these macroecological patterns are mediated by population densities at breeding sites. Temperate and open habitats are associated with female-polymorphic lineages because they harbor higher densities of adults, promoting more frequent encounters between females and males. Finally, we found that female-limited polymorphisms typically evolve from sexually dimorphic ancestors through the addition of a male-like female morph, consistent with the hypothesis of selection for male mimicry. We conclude that female color polymorphisms evolve in a predictable fashion and are likely driven by ecological conditions that increase the rate of premating interactions and thus the intensity of sexual conflict.},

  abstract     = {Understanding host factors driving asymptomatic versus severe disease outcomes is of key importance if we are to control emerging and re-emerging viral infections. HLA-B*15:01 has been associated with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhospitalized individuals of European ancestry, with protective immunity attributed to preexisting cross-reactive CD8 + T-cells directed against HLA-B*15:01-restricted Spike-derived S 919-927 peptide (B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells). However, fundamental questions remained on the abundance and clonotypic nature of CD8 + T-cell responses in HLA-B*15:01-positive patients who succumbed to life-threatening COVID-19. Here, we analyzed B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses in COVID-19 patients from independent HLA-typed COVID-19 patient cohorts across three continents, Australia, Asia and Europe. We assessed B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells in COVID-19 patients across disease outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to hospitalized critical illness. We found that severe/critical COVID-19 patients mounted B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses lacking a highly expanded key public B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell receptor (TCR; TRAV9-2/TRBV7-2) which recurred across multiple individuals in COVID-19 patients with a mild disease. Instead, B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cell responses in life-threatening disease had a prevalence of an alternate TCR clonotypic motif (TRAV38-2/DV8/TRBV20-1), potentially contributing, at least in part, to why B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients were less protective. Interestingly, the frequency, memory phenotype, and activation profiles of circulating B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells did not differ across disease severity. Moreover, B15/S 919 + CD8 + T-cells were better maintained into convalescence compared to other SARS-CoV-2-specificities. Our study thus provides evidence on the differential nature of the TCR clonal repertoire in 22.37% of HLA-B*15:01-positive COVID-19 patients who developed severe or critical disease in our cohorts, comparing to HLA-B*15:01-expressing individuals with mild COVID-19.},

  abstract     = {Metastasis remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, driven by complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in metastatic progression, yet their molecular diversity and upstream regulators remain poorly defined. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), overexpressed in subsets of tumors including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is implicated in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified GPNMB as a marker of immunosuppressive TAMs associated with poor prognosis, but its mechanistic role in TNBC has remained unclear. Coculturing monocytic cells with three-dimensional TNBC spheres induced GPNMB + TAMs expressing sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 9 (Siglec-9). Tumor-expressed GPNMB promotes monocyte-to-TAM polarization by inducing secondary GPNMB expression in monocytes, establishing a feed-forward amplification loop. GPNMB knockdown in TNBC cells inhibited immunosuppressive TAM subsets, including Siglec-9 + and EMT-associated populations, as determined by deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data using a custom TAM signature matrix derived from publicly available TNBC scRNA-seq datasets. TNBC-derived GPNMB carried α2,3-sialylation, whereas macrophage-derived GPNMB carried α2,6-sialylation, enabling differential Siglec-9 recognition. Elevated GPNMB and Siglec-9 correlated with poor prognosis in TNBCcohorts. Importantly, dual inhibition of Siglec-E (murine Siglec-9 ortholog) and PD-1 reduced tumor stemness, suppressed IL-6-dependent EMT, and limited lung metastasis in vivo. The GPNMB–Siglec-9 axis thus represents a critical glyco-immunological checkpoint driving TAM-mediated metastasis, providing a promising therapeutic target in TNBC.},

  abstract     = {12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX, Alox15 ) generates bioactive oxygenated lipids during inflammation, however its homeostatic role(s) in normal healing are unclear. Here, the role of 12/15-LOX in resolving skin wounds was elucidated, focusing on how its lipids act together in physiologically relevant amounts. In mice, wounding caused acute appearance of 12/15-LOX-expressing macrophages and stem cells, coupled to early generation of ~12 monohydroxy-oxylipins and enzymatically oxidized phospholipids (eoxPL). Alox15 deletion increased collagen deposition, stem cell/fibroblast proliferation, IL6/pSTAT3, pSMAD3, and interferon (IFN)-γ levels. Conversely, CD206 expression, F480+ cells, and MMP9 and MMP2 activities were reduced. Alox15 −/− skin was deficient in PPARγ/adiponectin activity. Furthermore, while pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated as normal during wounding, many including Il6, Il1b, ccl4, Cd14, Cd274, Clec4d, Clec4e, Csf3, Cxcl2, and miR-21 failed to revert to baseline during healing, indicating disruption of PPARγ’s anti-inflammatory brake on NLRP3/inflammasome and TGF-β signaling. Reconstituting Alox15 −/− wounds with a physiological mixture of Alox15 -derived primary oxylipins generated by healing wounds restored MMP and dampened collagen deposition. The oxylipin mixture activated the PPARγ response element in vitro, while in vivo, its coactivator, Helz2 , was significantly upregulated as well as several fatty acid and prostaglandin PPARγ ligands. Additional inflammatory and proliferative gene networks impacted by Alox15 −/− included Elf4, Cebpb , and Tcf3. In summary, 12/15-LOX generates abundant monohydroxy oxylipins that act together via PPARγ. The identification of multiple gene alterations reveals several targets for treating nonhealing wounds. Our studies demonstrate that 12/15-LOX oxylipins act in concert, dampening inflammation in vivo, revealing the need to consider lipid signaling holistically.},

  abstract     = {Reduced mitochondrial quality and quantity in tumors is associated with dedifferentiation and increased malignancy. However, it remains unclear how to restore mitochondrial quantity and quality in tumors and whether mitochondrial restoration can drive tumor differentiation. Our study shows that restoring mitochondrial function using retinoic acid (RA) to boost mitochondrial biogenesis and a mitochondrial uncoupler to enhance respiration synergistically drives neuroblastoma differentiation and inhibits proliferation. U- 13 C-glucose/glutamine isotope tracing revealed a metabolic shift from the pentose phosphate pathway to oxidative phosphorylation, accelerating the tricarboxylic acid cycle and switching substrate preference from glutamine to glucose. These effects were abolished by electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors or in ρ 0 cells lacking mitochondrial DNA, emphasizing the necessity of mitochondrial function for differentiation. Dietary RA and uncoupler treatment promoted tumor differentiation in an orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft model, evidenced by neuropil production and Schwann cell recruitment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of xenografts revealed that this strategy effectively eliminated the stem cell population, promoted differentiation, and increased mitochondrial gene signatures along the differentiation trajectory, potentially improving patient outcomes. Collectively, our findings establish a mitochondria-centric therapeutic strategy for inducing tumor differentiation, suggesting that maintaining/driving differentiation in tumor requires not only ATP production but also continuous ATP consumption and sustained ETC activity.},

  abstract     = {Self-assembled thin films respond to external loads via surface instabilities that are critical to their functionality in both biology and technology. Lipid monolayers at the air–liquid interface are one such system. Tunability between out-of-plane buckling (e.g., folding) and in-plane relaxation (e.g., reorganization of lipid domains) in highly compressed lipid monolayers suggests underlying mechanistic generality. Yet, how in-plane relaxation occurs and how it is distinguished from folding remains elusive. Here, we use continuum mechanics, finite element (FE) simulations, and Langmuir trough fluorescence microscopy (FM) data to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these elastic instability modes. Uniaxial loading of the Langmuir trough is evaluated in FE simulations, where the lipid monolayer is modeled as a thin sheet with a hyperelastic energy function developed to exhibit a relaxation mechanism. Results show that this material relaxation mechanism triggers tunable in-plane shear localization (shear banding). Furthermore, the simulation results of a heterogeneous model, built from fluorescence micrographs of lipid domains distributed in a continuous matrix, are rigorously compared with experimental data by domain organizational analyses. These analyses suggest shear bands are sufficient in inducing domain symmetry breaking that is characteristic of in-plane relaxation and, without such shear bands, domain organization remains in powder structure, characteristic of folding lipid monolayers. Our findings develop a hyperelastic model validated against experimental FM images that can connect the observed lipid monolayer instabilities of folding and in-plane relaxation, establishing a generalized framework with the potential to unify all other monolayer instability modes and characterize other thin film systems.},

The transient regenerative cellular state that discriminates between missing-tissue and non-missing-tissue injuries remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we identified a homolog of Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), named pdgf-like ( pdgfl ), in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea . This gene exhibits inducible expression following missing-tissue injury in a back-and-forth manner between myosin + muscular cells and piwi-1 + stem cells. The dynamic expression of pdgfl is induced through the elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) signaling over short distances. Suppression of pdgfl expression impairs the regrowth of essential structures, including the intestine and central nervous system. Evidence on the decrease of notum and sfrp-1 at the anterior pole, together with the accumulation of myoD + PIWI-1 + progenitors, suggests a role of pdgfl in pole muscular cell differentiation. These findings highlight the significant impact of pdgfl in orchestrating the behavior of specific cell types by the regional specificity of this gene expression.},

It has previously been shown that several species of infectious-disease-carrying mosquitoes utilize these distortion products for detecting and locating potential mates. Furthermore, the mechanical tuning curve of the male mosquito flagellum was shown not to be aligned with that of its sensory neural elements. Using a generic theoretical model for acoustic sensing, we evaluate the signal-detection advantages and disadvantages that are implied by these two schemes: distortion product detection and cascading a signal through multiple layers of oscillator elements of different characteristic frequency. Last, we show that the combination of these two schemes yields a signal detector with enhanced frequency selectivity and speed of response, thus enabling the detection of transient, narrowband flight tones.},

  abstract     = {While it has been appreciated for decades that lysosomes can import cysteine, its significance for whole-organism physiology has remained uncertain. Recent work identified MFSD12 as a transmembrane protein required for cysteine import into lysosomes (and melanosomes), enabling genetic interrogation of this pathway. Here, we show that Mfsd12 knockout mice die between embryonic days 10.5 and 12.5, indicating that MFSD12 is essential for organogenesis. Mfsd12 loss results in the expression of genes involved in cellular stress and thiol metabolism and likely disproportionately affects the erythroid, myeloid, and neuronal lineages. Within lysosomes, imported cysteine is largely oxidized to cystine, which is exported to the cytosol by the cystinosin (CTNS) transporter. However, unlike Mfsd12 , loss of Ctns is compatible with viability, suggesting that the essential role of MFSD12 lies not in supplying cystine to the cytosol, but in providing reduced cysteine within the lysosomal lumen. Supporting this model, maternal treatment with cysteamine—a lysosome-penetrant thiol—rescued the development of Mfsd12 knockout embryos, yielding viable adult offspring. These findings establish lysosomal thiol import as a critical metabolic pathway and provide genetic tools to further clarify its physiological and biochemical roles.},

  abstract     = {Closed capsules, such as lipid vesicles, soap bubbles, and emulsion droplets, are ubiquitous throughout biology, engineered matter, and everyday life. Their creation and disintegration are defined by a singularity that separates a topologically distinct extended liquid film from a boundary-free closed shell. Such topology-changing processes are of fundamental interest. They are also essential for intercellular transport, transcellular communication, and drug delivery. However, studies of vesicle formation are challenging because of the rapid dynamics and small length scale involved. We develop fluid colloidosomes, micrometer-sized analogues of lipid vesicles. The mechanics of colloidosomes and lipid vesicles are described by the same theoretical model. We study colloidosomes close to their disk-to-sphere topological transition. Intrinsic colloidal length and time scales slow down the dynamics to reveal colloidosome conformations in real time during their assembly and disassembly. Remarkably, the lowest-energy pathway by which a closed vesicle transforms into a flat disk involves a topologically distinct cylinder-like intermediate. These results reveal aspects of topological changes that are relevant to all liquid capsules. They also provide a robust platform for the encapsulation, transport, and delivery of nanosized cargoes.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis is a prevalent joint disease in the aging population. The hallmark of osteoarthritis is the degeneration of the joint cartilage, characterized by changes in chondrocytes including mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the precise mechanisms of how this affects chondrocyte homeostasis and whether such processes can be explored as therapeutic targets for osteoarthritis remain unclear. Here, we show that impaired mitochondrial function and disrupted cartilage matrix metabolism due to loss of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) expression in chondrocytes leads to the development of osteoarthritis. Sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), a key regulator of mitochondrial function, plays a critical role in modulating MFN2 to restore mitochondrial dynamics, reduce fragmentation, and preserve mitochondrial function in chondrocytes. Specifically, SIRT3 directly deacetylates and indirectly deubiquitinates MFN2, preventing its degradation. MFN2-mediated mitochondrial–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) junctions support cellular homeostasis, alleviate ER stress, and maintain mitochondrial calcium ion balance, which collectively mitigate chondrocyte senescence. Extracellular vesicles engineered with MFN2 mRNA effectively prevented cartilage degeneration and restored mobility in osteoarthritic mice. These findings suggest that targeting MFN2 is a promising strategy to prevent cartilage degeneration and alleviate progression of osteoarthritis.},

  abstract     = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite treatment advances, and a major challenge is that biomarkers that predict response and resistance to current therapies are lacking. We report that activated and proliferating malignant CLL B cells in circulation express PD-1, a protein normally expressed in T cells. PD-1 expression is absent in circulating B cells from healthy controls and nonmalignant B cells from patients with CLL. Circulating PD-1 + CLL cells are found in all treatment naïve patients, regardless of immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene mutation status or cytogenetic abnormalities. PD-1 + CLL cells are transcriptionally distinct compared to PD-1 − CLL cells and upregulate genes associated with cell activation, proliferation, and B cell receptor (BCR) and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. Indeed, ex vivo stimulation of the BCR and TLR9 readily increased PD-1 expression in CLL cells from treatment-naïve patients within 24 h, an effect that was blocked by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi). More importantly, patients initiating BTKi therapy experienced profound reductions in circulating PD-1 + CLL cell numbers within 1 mo, which is in line with reduction in Ki-67 + CLL cells. Elevated percentages of circulating PD-1 + CLL cells also preceded a clinical diagnosis of disease progression in patients receiving BTKi. Thus, our findings indicate that PD-1 expression is a potential biomarker to identify proliferating CLL cells in vivo and will be useful to predict response and resistance to BTKi. In addition, eliminating PD-1 + CLL cells with depleting anti-PD-1 monospecific or bispecific antibodies should be explored as a potential therapeutic strategy.},

However, we still lack the understanding needed to recreate at the microscale key features of autonomous behavior exhibited by microorganisms or swarms of macroscopic robots. In this study, we propose a model for a three-dimensional deformable cellular composite particle consisting of self-propelled rod-shaped colloids confined within a flexible vesicle—representing a superstructure we call a “flexicle” that couples particle deformation to the internal dynamics of the internal active components. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the collective behavior of dense systems composed of many flexicles. We show that individual flexicles exhibit shape changes upon collisions with other flexicles that lead to rearrangements of the internal active rods, which slows flexicle motion. This shape deformability gives rise to a diverse set of motility-induced phase separation phenomena and the spontaneous flow of flexicles reminiscent of the migration of cells in dense tissues. Our findings establish a foundation for designing responsive, cell-like active particles and developing strategies for controlling swarm migration and other autonomous swarm behaviors at cellular and colloidal scales.},

For instance, standard Kresling origami cells exhibit nontunable intrinsic energy landscapes determined by their geometry and material properties, limiting their adaptability after fabrication. To overcome this limitation, we introduce frustration to enable fine-tuning of the energy landscape and resulting deformation states. By prestressing the Kresling cell by means of special springs with individual control, we induce either global or localized (i.e., crease level) frustration, which allows changing the energy barrier (cell or assembly). We investigate the mechanical behavior of frustrated Kresling assemblies, both theoretically and experimentally, under various loading and boundary conditions. Our findings reveal that changing the frustration state leads to precise control of folding sequences, enabling previously inaccessible folding paths. The proposed concept paves the way for applications in mechanical metamaterials and other fields requiring highly programmable and reconfigurable systems – e.g., prosthetic limbs.},

  abstract     = {Creatine plays a vital role in cellular energy production and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) homeostasis and has also been identified as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain. Creatine is transported into cells by the human creatine transporter (hCRT) (SLC6A8), an Na + /Cl − -dependent symporter encoded on the X chromosome. Mutations in hCRT cause cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome 1, a neurological disorder marked by intellectual disability, speech delay, and seizures. Beyond its role in the brain and muscle, hCRT is highly expressed in metabolically active tumors. Many cancer cells, including colorectal cancer and glioblastoma, upregulate hCRT to sustain intracellular creatine levels and buffer ATP under energy stress. Pharmacological blockade of hCRT by RGX202 has been shown to impair tumor growth by disrupting energy homeostasis. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human hCRT in three states: apo, creatine-bound, and RGX202-bound. hCRT adopts a canonical LeuT-fold with 12 transmembrane helices and two pseudosymmetric inverted repeats. Creatine is coordinated in the central substrate-binding site through interactions with transmembrane helices TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM8, while the inhibitor RGX202 occupies the same binding pocket, engaging in overlapping contacts that competitively block creatine access. Our structural and mechanistic findings clarify substrate recognition and inhibitory binding of hCRT, providing a molecular rationale for targeting hCRT in both inherited metabolic diseases and cancer therapy.},

Here, we combine two nucleic acid delivery approaches to create CRISPR lipid nanoparticle–spherical nucleic acids (LNP–SNAs) that are both efficient and biocompatible. Compared to lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) lacking a surface-bound DNA shell, CRISPR LNP–SNAs exhibit two- to three-fold higher cellular uptake, reduced cytotoxicity, and improved gene transfection efficiency. Across multiple cell lines and genomic loci, CRISPR LNP–SNAs induce insertion–deletion mutations at average frequencies two- to three-fold higher than those observed with LNPs. When codelivered with donor templates, CRISPR LNP–SNAs enable homology-directed repair at an average efficiency of 21 ± 7%, a 2.5-fold improvement over LNPs (8 ± 4%). The ease of synthesis and biocompatibility of CRISPR LNP–SNAs highlight their potential as a versatile delivery platform for CRISPR–Cas and other gene therapies.},

Nonetheless, these scholars continue to debate over when people first started foraging for grass seeds, when they began to readily utilize sickles, how prominent the early selection pressures were, and when the first traits of domestication fully introgressed into the cultivated grass population. Here, we present complementary archaeobotanical and archaeological (stone tool) evidence for cereal foragers from Toda-1 Cave in the Surkhan Darya, dating to 9200 cal BP. We conclude that early Holocene foragers were processing grains along with nuts and fruits as far north as the rich river valleys of southern Uzbekistan. These data expand the known range that preagricultural cereal foragers covered in the early Holocene, adding to our understanding of the cultural processes that led to farming. Additionally, we present the earliest evidence for people interacting with the progenitors for pistachios and apples (or a close apple relative). The complex foraging behaviors that led to cultivation were being undertaken by people during the early Holocene across a wider area of Eurasia than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Environmental stimuli, including the exposure to ultraviolet (UV)-B light, are known to play a role in the modulation of immune-mediated mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS). In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we have shown that UV-B irradiation ameliorates disease outcome by regulatory T cells (Treg) expansion. Moreover, the UV-B-mediated induction of Treg numbers was also observed in MS. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) can be activated by environmental factors including UV-B-induced photoproducts of tryptophan. Thus, we investigated the role of AhR during the transmission of UV-B irradiation. Therefore, wild-type (WT) and AhR-deficient mice (AhR –/– ) were irradiated with UV-B light and immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-peptide. In WT mice it was shown that UV-B irradiation reduces EAE symptoms by Treg expansion. This effect was abrogated in animals with AhR deficiency. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of AhR regulation, we used mice with a deletion of AhR specifically in different subsets of antigen-presenting cells (APC) that have been shown to mediate the expansion of Treg. Interestingly, we could show that the AhR activation in murine cutaneous APC was sufficient to switch APC from a stimulatory into a regulatory phenotype, and moreover, responsible for APC cell maturation and migration into regional lymph nodes. Thus, our data indicate that AhR activation in APC might be required for UV-B-mediated immunosuppression during MOG-induced EAE. Hence, activation of AHR in tissue-resident APC, potentially by low-dose UV-B irradiation, might be beneficial as an adjuvant treatment in inflammatory or degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.},

  abstract     = {Reconstructing carbon release fluxes during ancient climatic warming events is important for improving predictions of carbon cycle and climate dynamics under future anthropogenic warming scenarios. We investigate the extent of biogenic methane release and its contribution to climate variability across the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE) approximately 183 million years ago. To do this, we developed a global biogeochemical model and applied a Bayesian inversion using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Based on a high-resolution record of carbon isotope excursions from the Yorkshire section, our results indicate that a release of at least 4,700 Gt carbon from biogenic CH 4 (with a carbon isotopic composition, δ 13 C of −50 to −70‰) is necessary to accurately reproduce the pronounced pulsed shift in the δ 13 C, as well as the inferred changes in atmospheric p CO 2 and global temperature. This massive methane release may have led to a substantial increase in atmospheric p CH 4 and contributed to additional global surface warming, perhaps by more than 2 °C. We further elucidate that the liberation of methane may have been facilitated by an upsurge in methanogenesis alongside a concomitant decline in methane oxidation within organic-rich, sulfate-depleted marine environments. An active CH 4 cycle represents a positive feedback mechanism that exacerbates environmental deterioration during climatic warming events, ultimately contributing to mass extinction of marine life.},

  abstract     = {Humans and other organisms make decisions choosing between different options, with the aim of maximizing the reward and minimizing the cost. The main theoretical framework for modeling the decision-making process has been based on the highly successful drift-diffusion model, which is a simple tool for explaining many aspects of this process. However, recent observations challenge this model. It was found that inhibitory tone increases during situations of difficult discrimination tasks, but the origin of this phenomenon is not understood. Motivated by this observation, we extend a recently developed model for directional decision-making of animals moving in real space. We introduce an integrated Ising-type model that includes global inhibition and use it to describe two-choice decision-making. This model can explain how the brain may utilize inhibition to improve its decision-making accuracy. Compared to experimental results, this model suggests that the regime of the brain’s decision-making activity is in proximity to a critical transition line between the ordered and disordered phases. Within the model, this observation can be explained by noting that this critical region has unique dynamics that give rise to advantageous properties for the decision-making process.},

  abstract     = {Membrane proteins play crucial roles in numerous biological processes and are important drug targets. However, structural studies of membrane proteins often rely on solubilization with detergents, which may not accurately reflect their native states in a cellular context. Additionally, identifying suitable detergents for individual membrane proteins can be a detailed and time-consuming process. Here, we developed a vesicle-based method that preserves the native lipid environment for subsequent structural and functional studies. Using the bacterial multidrug efflux transporter AcrB as an example, we isolated AcrB-containing vesicles and determined its cryo-EM structure with all protomers in a loose (L) state at 3.88 Å by incorporating our micrograph-based sorting strategy. Notably, compared to the L-state AcrB in liposomes and nanoparticles, the exterior transmembrane helices (TMs) in our map exhibited superior quality, featuring a continuous and clear representation of lα, which is positioned horizontally within the lipid bilayer. We further expanded our method by identifying endogenous membrane proteins, including F-ATPase and respiratory complexes, in vesicles generated using mitochondria from pig hearts. The high-resolution structure of respiratory complex III in vesicles revealed a shared subunit nine between two monomers. Briefly, our method presents a promising and straightforward approach for studying the structure and function of membrane proteins in their native environment, eliminating the need for detergent screening and protein purification.},

  abstract     = {Each year, billions of animals migrate across the globe on diverse spatial and temporal scales. Migration behavior thus plays a fundamental role in the life cycle and Darwinian fitness of many organisms. While the influence of migration on early-life survival and reproduction is well documented, its effects on senescence (aging) in advanced age remain largely unexplored. Using a unique 44-y ring-resighting dataset from a long-lived, partially migratory bird species, the Greater Flamingo ( Phoenicopterus roseus ), we demonstrate that migration plays a key role in shaping age-specific trajectories of mortality and reproduction. Resident flamingos exhibit higher early-life demographic performances, with lower baseline mortality than migrants, resulting in longer adult lifespan. Residents also have a higher probability of breeding than migrants, though their breeding success is similar. However, residents seem to pay for their early-life advantages in old age, experiencing accelerated actuarial and reproductive senescence compared to migrants. Overall, our study highlights the critical impact of migration on survival and reproduction throughout life, thereby illustrating the role played by behavioral decisions in the biology of aging in long-lived vertebrates.},

  abstract     = {Cardiogenesis relies on the integrated interplay between cardiac transcription factors and signaling pathways. Here, we uncover a role for type IIA procollagen (IIA), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein encoded by an alternatively spliced Col2a1 transcript, encoding a N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, as a critical regulator in a cardiac gene regulatory feedback loop. The cysteine-rich domain of IIA protein was previously reported to interact with bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and transforming growth factors-beta (TGFβ) in in vitro binding assays and acts as a BMP antagonist in amphibian embryo assays. We show that the Col2a1 gene in mice is activated in the developing heart by core cardiogenic factors (NKX2-5, GATA4, MEF2, and SRF) via cis-regulatory enhancer elements. IIA loss (ΔIIA) in mice results in depletion of Isl1- and Nkx2-5-expressing progenitors, causing outflow tract defects resembling disrupted BMP/TGFβ-SMAD signaling, alongside reduced nuclear pSMAD1/5/8 in cardiac tissues. Compound +/ΔIIA ; Smad4+/− mutants exhibit aggravated malformations. IIA enhances BMP-responsive reporter activity in cells in transactivation assays. We propose that IIA supports a positive functional role on SMAD4-dependent signaling, fine-tuning BMP/TGFβ signaling, thereby regulating GATA4 and NKX2-5 activity during second heart field progenitor specification. These findings position IIA procollagen as a key ECM component that integrates BMP/TGFβ signaling with cardiac transcription factors such as NKX2-5, revealing a feedback loop essential for cardiogenesis. Given its role in cardiac development, IIA emerges as a potential congenital heart disease risk factor.},

It can be explained by at least two computational processes: asymmetric update and (gradual) choice perseveration. A recent meta-analysis showed that both mechanisms are detectable in human reinforcement learning. However, while their descriptive value seems to be well established, they have not been compared regarding their possible adaptive value. In this study, we address this gap by simulating reinforcement learning agents in a variety of environments with a variant of an evolutionary algorithm. Our results show that positivity bias (in the form of asymmetric update) is evolutionary stable in many situations, while the emergence of gradual perseveration is less systematic and robust. Overall, our results illustrate that biases can be adaptive and selected by evolution, in an environment-specific manner.},

  abstract     = {Isoniazid (INH) inhibits mycolic acid synthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) and is a cornerstone of treatment regimens against this deadly pathogen. However, over 10% of Mtb infections are INH-resistant. The compound C10 can sensitize clinically relevant INH-resistant mutants to killing by INH. Thus, understanding the mechanism of action for C10 could aid in designing new strategies for circumventing drug resistance. We find that C10 treatment reroutes carbon flux toward valine, drawing carbon away from gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle. As a result, C10 decreases cell envelope capsule thickness and blocks an accumulation of peptidoglycan precursors that occurs in response to INH treatment in an INH-resistant Mtb katG mutant. In this altered metabolic state induced by C10, INH treatment of the INH-resistant Mtb katG mutant inhibits peptidoglycan synthesis, precipitating collapse of cell envelope integrity. Pyruvate supplementation relieves the C10-induced requirement for carbon flux toward valine, enhancing carbon assimilation into cell envelope precursors and restoring resistance to INH. In addition, we identify the formation of isoniazid-pyruvate in INH-treated katG W328L Mtb , where pyruvate sequesters INH, lowering the concentration of INH available to inhibit Mtb . Together, our findings reveal a bactericidal activity for INH in Mtb that can function in INH-resistant mutants independently of INH-mediated inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis. This activity for INH can be elicited by shifting carbon flux toward valine and away from cell envelope precursor synthesis, highlighting a metabolic vulnerability that can be exploited to kill INH-resistant Mtb .},

The intrinsic processes are the superfluid analogue of the Schwinger mechanism in quantum field theory; here they appear as a quantum phase transition at T = 0, driven by an external supercurrent.

  abstract     = {Regulation of cell growth and division is essential to achieve cell-size homeostasis. Recent advances in imaging technologies, such as “mother machines” for bacteria or yeast, have allowed long-term tracking of cell-size dynamics across many generations, and thus have brought major insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-size control. However, understanding the governing rules of cell growth and division within a quantitative dynamical-systems framework remains a major challenge. Here, we implement and apply a framework that makes it possible to infer stochastic-differential-equation models with Poisson noise directly from experimentally measured time series for cellular growth and division. To account for potential nonlinear memory effects, we parameterize the Poisson intensity of stochastic cell-division events in terms of both the cell’s current size and its ancestral history. By applying the algorithm to experimentally measured cell-size trajectories, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the linear one-step memory hypothesis underlying the popular “sizer,” “adder,” and “timer” models of cell homeostasis. For Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria, Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we find that in many cases, the inferred stochastic models have a substantial nonlinear memory component. This suggests a need to reevaluate and generalize some of the currently prevailing linear-memory paradigms of cell homeostasis. More broadly, the underlying inference framework is directly applicable to identify quantitative models for stochastic jump processes in a wide range of scientific disciplines.},

Finding algorithms and methods to improve convergence is important to accelerate the capabilities of near-term hardware for variational quantum eigensolver or more broad applications of hybrid methods in which optimization is required. To this goal, we look to use modern approaches developed in circuit simulations and stochastic classical optimization, which can be combined to form a surrogate optimization approach to quantum circuits. Using an approximate (classical central processing unit/graphical processing unit) state vector simulator as a surrogate model, we efficiently calculate an approximate Hessian, which is passed as input for a quantum processing unit or exact circuit simulator. This method will lend itself well to parallelization across quantum processing units. We demonstrate the capabilities of such an approach with and without sampling noise and a proof-of-principle demonstration on a quantum processing unit utilizing 40 qubits.},

  abstract     = {Coopetition is a term from game theory that describes a mix of cooperative and competitive behavior. The maternal–fetal interface (MFI) among eutherian mammals presents close interaction of two distinct individuals. These interactions have resulted in a remarkable diversity in MFI structure, often interpreted as the outcome of maternal–fetal conflict. Nevertheless, the fetus and the mother share evolutionary interests since 50% of fetal genes are maternal. In hemochorial species, characterized by invasive placentation, endometrial stromal fibroblasts (ESFs) undergo decidualization to regulate embryo implantation. In great apes, hemochorial placentation is driven by highly invasive extravillous trophoblast cells (EVT). Here, using EVTs differentiated from trophoblast stem cells, term placenta, as well as HTR8/SVneo, we demonstrate that EVTs orchestrate a transformation of the maternal stroma, reducing its resistance to invasion acquired during decidualization. Through paracrine signals, in particular IL-11, trophoblasts transform decidual ESFs from a matrix-producing to a matrix-degrading state. Notably, noninvasive cytotrophoblast cells, do not transform decidual ESFs. We further provide evidence that maternal coadaptation is critical to EVT-induced decidual transformation. Decidual ESFs upregulate expression of Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 in response to EVTs, rewiring downstream IL-11 signaling from JAK/STAT to AP-1 specific transcription. We conclude that the evolution of highly invasive placentation is the outcome of both the evolution of invasive EVTs, as well as the evolution of maternal traits, i.e., the switch from JAK/STAT to AP-1 signaling. We interpret this as evidence for co-opetition (cooperation among competitors).},

  abstract     = {The fast-paced improvements in mortality in high-income countries since the early 1900s have led to a sustained increase in life expectancy. However, whether this linear trend will continue or life expectancy gains will decelerate in the near future remains unclear. To answer this question, we apply multiple established and recently developed mortality forecasting methods to estimate cohort life expectancy for individuals born between 1939 and 2000 in 23 high-income countries. Across all forecasting methods, our results robustly and consistently indicate a deceleration in cohort life expectancy. The previously observed pace of improvement, 0.46 y per cohort, declines by 37% to 52%, depending on the method used. Robustness checks suggest that these findings are unlikely to be solely due to downward bias in cohort life expectancy forecasts. Furthermore, an age-decomposition analysis indicates that this deceleration is primarily driven by a slower pace of mortality improvement at very young ages. Over half of the total deceleration is attributable to mortality trends under age 5, while more than two-thirds is explained by mortality trends under age 20. This pattern had already emerged in the observed data for the cohorts included in our analysis. Thus, even if these estimates turned out to be overly pessimistic, it is unlikely that the deceleration will reverse in the near future.},

  abstract     = {The Foxp3 + CD4 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) generated around birth are phenotypically and functionally distinct from those engendered during adulthood. That perinatally produced Tregs persist for a protracted period in peripheral lymphoid organs has been well documented, as has their superior ability to protect the organism from many autoimmune diseases. However, their contribution to pools of nonlymphoid-tissue Tregs and their homeostatic functions therein have been little studied. We show that perinatal Tregs preferentially derive from a CD25 + Foxp3 − thymocyte progenitor; that they seed and persist to varying degrees in every nonlymphoid tissue examined; and that transient depletion of perinatally generated Tregs in adults, but not in neonates, is followed by poor reconstitution of Treg numbers and phenotypes in epididymal visceral-adipose tissue (eVAT) and the skin but not in several lymphoid and other nonlymphoid tissues. Potential clinical implications of such a deficiency are highlighted by findings on mice subjected to weight cycling: Imposing a low-fat–high-fat–low-fat diet regimen in adult, but not juvenile, mice results in an impoverished eVAT, but not spleen, Treg compartment, accompanied by normal weight gain and glucose tolerance but profound insulin resistance. These findings point to a layered immune system, the different layers exerting specialized, nonredundant functions.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation often requires individuals to balance personal risk with mutual gain. The Stag Hunt game provides a well-established paradigm for studying such decision-making. Prior research suggested that verbal communication about the game correlated with participants finding the optimal coordinated solution, but these studies either did not manipulate communication directly or informed participants of the payoff structure in advance. This study examined whether communication improves cooperative decision-making among college students under conditions in which the payoff structure had to be inferred through repeated play. A total of 127 same-sex dyads ( M age = 22.8 y, 51.2% female) played 40 rounds of an online Stag Hunt game, with dyads randomly assigned to either a no communication or communication condition. Participants were not informed about the game’s payoff structure in advance and had to infer it during play. Results showed that coordination on the payoff-dominant outcome (Stag–Stag) increased across trials, but only when communication was possible. No significant sex differences were observed. These findings highlight the central role of communication in fostering cooperation, particularly in environments in which information must be jointly discovered. This is an important consideration for developing and interpreting future research. Moreover, subsequent research should explore how the content, timing, and relevance of communication shape cooperative outcomes over time.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria have several nucleotide second messengers, most of which act as global regulators to control a wide range of bacterial physiological processes. Studies usually focus on a single second messenger, and the mechanisms and physiological significance of the cross-regulation between different nucleotide second messengers are often unclear. Here, we show that Shewanella putrefaciens can form biofilms in both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor media. While both are controlled by c-di-GMP, the regulatory models differ. Under low nutrient conditions, cross-regulation of cAMP-CRP and c-di-GMP occurs at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels, thereby controlling biofilm development. During the early stages of biofilm development, cAMP-CRP directly promotes the transcription of a PDE gene, lrbR , by LrbA. Additionally, cAMP-CRP recruits LrbR to BpfD to suppress early biofilm formation via LrbR-dependent local degradation of c-di-GMP. Finally, as intracellular LrbR levels decrease, cAMP-CRP-BpfD enables a rapid shift to biofilm development and supports biofilm maintenance. Under high nutrient conditions, this cross-regulation does not occur, resulting in a positive correlation between global c-di-GMP levels and biofilm biomass. The identification of distinct modes of biofilm regulation in different nutrients will provide a theoretical basis for future targeted control of biofilm formation in different nutrient environments.},

To identify host factors that modulate interferon induction within cells infected by influenza A virus, we developed CRISPR with Transcriptional Readout using sequencing (CRITR-seq). CRITR-seq is a method linking CRISPR guide sequence to activity at a promoter of interest. Employing this method, we find that depletion of the Negative Elongation Factor (NELF) complex increases both flu transcription and interferon expression. We find that the process of flu transcription, both in the presence and absence of viral replication, is a key contributor to interferon induction. Taken together, our findings highlight innate immune ligand concentration as a limiting factor in triggering an interferon response, identify NELF as an important interface with the flu life cycle, and validate CRITR-seq as a tool for genome-wide screens for phenotypes of gene expression.},

  abstract     = {Amyloid β (Aβ)-dependent circuit dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is determined by a puzzling mix of hyperactive and inactive (“silent”) brain neurons. Recent studies identified excessive glutamate accumulation as a key Aβ-dependent determinant of hyperactivity. The cellular mechanisms underlying neuronal silence depend on both Aβ and tau protein pathologies, with an unknown role of Aβ. Here, by using single-cell-initiated rabies virus (RV) tracing in mouse models of β-amyloidosis, we demonstrate that the presynaptic connectivity of silent, but not that of hyperactive, neurons is severely disrupted. Furthermore, silent neurons display a major spine loss and strongly suppressed synaptic activity. Thus, we suggest that synaptic decoupling is an Aβ-dependent cellular mechanism underlying progressive neuronal silencing and a critical factor for the cognitive impairments encountered in AD.},

  abstract     = {Despite sharing fewer than 10 core genes, the hyperdiverse Nucleocytoviricota phylum (ranging from poxviruses to giant viruses) universally assembles viral factories (VFs) resembling biomolecular condensates. Regardless, it is unclear how these viruses achieve such a level of functional conservation without clear conserved genetic information. We demonstrate that the VFs produced by amoeba-infecting viruses have liquid-like properties and identify a conserved molecular grammar governing viral factory scaffold protein: charge-patterned intrinsically disordered regions that drive phase separation independently of sequence homology. This grammar predicts functional scaffold proteins across the 15 viral families, revealing evolutionary constraints invisible to sequence or structural analysis. Strikingly, VFs exhibit subcompartmentalization analogous to nuclei, segregating transcription and mRNA processing (inner condensates) from replication (interphase zones) and translation (host cytoplasm). Our work establishes phase separation as a fundamental organizational principle bridging extreme genomic diversity, explaining how biological complexity emerges without gene conservation. This grammar is likely also conserved in non-amoeba-infecting members of the phylum and thus may represent a primordial solution for organelle-like organization, with broad implications for antiviral targeting.},

We study the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction to methanol in a flow cell and its discontinuous photooxidation to formaldehyde (PMOR) with excellent selectivity. Utilizing a highly active N- heterocyclic carbene catalyst enables tunable generation of C 4 –C 6 aldoses without undesirable byproducts, with carbon conversion yield reaching 60 to 80% for desired pentose, tetrose, and triose product mixtures and over 20% for hexose.

The scarcity of verified Denisovan fossils makes it challenging to study their anatomy, and how well they were adapted to their environment. We previously developed a genetic phenotyping approach to gain insight into Denisovan anatomy by detecting gene regulatory changes that likely altered Denisovan skeletal morphology. Here, we scan the Middle Pleistocene fossil record for crania matching the predicted Denisovan morphology and might therefore be related to Denisovans. We developed quantitative measures to assess both the proportion and extent of matches. These analyses revealed that the East Asian specimens of Harbin and Dali show an exceptionally high concordance with the Denisovan profile, surpassing all other examined Middle Pleistocene hominin specimens, including Neanderthals. Specifically, 15 out of 18 of Dali ’s features and 16 out of 18 of Harbin ’s matched Denisovan predictions. These findings are robust to overall skull size and to correlations between phenotypes. We also found that Kabwe 1 shows a strong affinity to the Denisovan–Neanderthal clade and might be placed near its root. Our results show that gene regulatory phenotyping may assist in classifying poorly understood specimens.},

Its response to osmotic stress shares similarities with the function of the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. In this study, we show that Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, activates WNK1 downstream kinase targets oxidative stress-responsive 1 (OSR1) and STE20/SPS1-related serine, proline-, and alanine-rich kinase (SPAK) in endothelial cells within minutes. Ionophore-induced Ca 2+ influx similarly triggers their activation. Comparable responses were observed in HDMEC, HUVEC, A549, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa cells. Hypotonic stress also enhances SPAK and OSR1 phosphorylation, which is attenuated by WNK1 inhibition or Piezo1 knockdown, whereas hypertonic stress-induced phosphorylation is not affected by Piezo1 knockdown. Chelating Ca 2+ or depleting intracellular stores prevents their activation, while increasing intracellular Ca 2+ via the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger or thapsigargin enhances it. ER-released Ca 2+ is sufficient to activate SPAK and OSR1 even in the absence of extracellular Ca 2+ , and this effect is diminished by Piezo1 knockdown. Both Yoda1 and ionomycin promote phosphorylation of WNK1 at serine 382, a modification that increases its catalytic activity. These findings identify Piezo1 as an activator of WNK1, linking Ca 2+ dynamics to WNK1-OSR1/SPAK signaling.},

We test how ingroup solidarity and outgroup hostility predicted social media users’ engagement with 62,118 posts by 484 US partisan accounts before and after the first Trump assassination attempt (July 13) and Biden’s re-election campaign suspension (July 21). We find that, while outgroup hostility is typically the dominant predictor of engagement, interactions with ingroup solidarity surged among Republicans after the Trump shooting and among Democrats after Biden’s withdrawal. We show that negativity toward other groups is not always key to going viral. Rather, positive ingroup emotions appear to play a leading role in times of crisis.},

  abstract     = {Glucose metabolism impacts the innate immune response against viral infection. However, the key enzymes or the natural products and mechanisms involved are not well elucidated. Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection.},

Major cultural events—the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—were systematically linked to changes in legacy reflections about personal values, with security declining after 9/11, achievement declining after the financial crisis, and benevolence declining for years after COVID-19 began and, to date, not yet returning to baseline. Gender and age of the deceased were also linked to differences in legacy: Men were remembered more for achievement , power , and conformity , while women were remembered more for benevolence and hedonism . Older people were remembered more for tradition and conformity than younger people. These patterns shifted dynamically across the lifespan, with obituaries for men showing more age-related variation than legacies for women.

  abstract     = {Membrane active peptides (MAPs) represent a diverse group of agents that disrupt the integrity of lipid membranes. One class of MAPs, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), destroy bacteria by transiently porating the bacterial membrane causing leakage of cellular contents. Transient leakage is classified as “graded,” where all vesicles in a population leak partially, or “all-or-none,” where some vesicles leak completely. However, the molecular interactions underlying transient leakage have eluded experimental determination. Here, dye leakage experiments with the AMP piscidin 1 (P1) show that graded leakage can be converted to all-or-none by simply adding a defect-promoting lysophospholipid. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that area stress arising from membrane asymmetry decreases the energy of pore formation and is highly lipid dependent. Furthermore, lipids and peptides translocate the bilayer through these pores, leading to area-relaxed states where poration is highly unfavorable. Even pores too small to leak dye relieve area stress; they are the “none” component of all-or-none release. These observations lead to development of a quantitative model where graded and all-or-none leakage are treated as a continuum explained by a single mechanism that accounts for the local peptide concentration and probabilities of different pore sizes. This unified model accurately reproduces the P1 dye leakage data and provides an explanation for varying pore energy, size, and probability within the framework of asymmetry-driven poration. This model is expected to be applicable to other MAPs, including cell-penetrating peptides, and could provide a framework for designing peptides with greater cellular specificity, a long-sought outcome.},

  abstract     = {Human learning embodies a striking duality: Sometimes, we can rapidly infer and compose logical rules, benefiting from structured curricula (e.g., in formal education), while other times, we rely on an incremental approach or trial-and-error, learning better from curricula that are randomly interleaved. Influential psychological theories explain this seemingly conflicting behavioral evidence by positing two qualitatively different learning systems—one for rapid, rule-based inferences (e.g., in working memory) and another for slow, incremental adaptation (e.g., in long-term and procedural memory). It remains unclear how to reconcile such theories with neural networks, which learn via incremental weight updates and are thus a natural model for the latter, but are not obviously compatible with the former. However, recent evidence suggests that metalearning neural networks and large language models are capable of in-context learning (ICL)—the ability to flexibly infer the structure of a new task from a few examples. In contrast to standard in-weight learning (IWL), which is analogous to synaptic change, ICL is more naturally linked to activation-based dynamics thought to underlie working memory in humans. Here, we show that the interplay between ICL and IWL naturally ties together a broad range of learning phenomena observed in humans, including curriculum effects on category-learning tasks, compositionality, and a trade-off between flexibility and retention in brain and behavior. Our work shows how emergent ICL can equip neural networks with fundamentally different learning properties that can coexist with their native IWL, thus offering an integrative perspective on dual-process theories of human cognition.},

We found that most class 3 mAbs, especially those not blocking receptor-binding domain-ACE2 binding, including VIR-7831, were substantially underestimated in cell-line-based assays. Nasal organoids adequately recapitulated the real-world effectiveness of VIR-7831 because of biologically relevant low ACE2 expression, and exclusively reproduced the in vivo protection of S2 mAbs due to the high TMPRSS2 expression, reminiscent of native human respiratory epithelial cells. Collectively, the robust organoid culture system and biologically relevant expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 make nasal organoids present a correlate of in vivo protection of neutralizing mAbs exclusively. The organoid-based neutralization assays, superior to conventional cell-line-based assays, can recapitulate and predict the real-world efficacy of mAbs.},

  abstract     = {Human papillomavirus (HPV)–related lesions contain types with benign outcomes and those with a risk of progression to cancer. We addressed the role of immune surveillance in 76 cervical biopsies (normal = 23, HPV+ benign = 16, HPV+ precancer = 37) by studying the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and the expression of the immune modulators PDL1, ICOSL, and miR-155 and compared the data to 101 cervical squamous cell carcinomas. In the normal cervix, ICOSL expression was restricted to the endocervical epithelia whereas neither miR-155 nor PDL1 were detected. MiR-155 was up-regulated in both the benign (88%) and precancerous (92%) HPV squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and colocalized to cells in the upper part of the lesion that is the area with productive viral infection. Both PDL1 (95%) and ICOSL (89%) were only evident in the precancerous SIL and each localized to squamous cells in the basal aspect that lacked replicating virus. In both microinvasive and invasive cervical squamous cell cancer miR-155 expression remained high (83%) as did PDL1 expression (80%) but ICOSL detection was reduced to 17%. Infiltration by CD8+ T cells was intense in the invasive lesions and these cells were mostly inactive as determined by the lack of granzyme B colocalization. It is concluded that miR-155 expression is a marker of HPV infection in both benign and precancerous lesions, whereas the approximately 10% of the latter lesions that progress to cancer gain PDL1 and lose ICOSL expression, which are important factors in avoiding immune surveillance.},

  abstract     = {Streptomyces are naturally endowed with the capacity to produce a wide array of natural products with biomedical and biotechnological value. They have garnered great interest in synthetic biology applications given the abundance of uncharacterized biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, progress has been hindered by the limited availability of genetic tools for manipulating these bacteria. Several representative CRISPR-Cas systems have been established in Streptomyces to streamline experimental workflows and improve editing efficiency. Nevertheless, their broader applicability has been constrained by issues such as nuclease activity-related cytotoxicity and the large size of effector proteins. To address these challenges, we present Streptomyces -compatible TnpB-assisted genome editing (STAGE), a genetic toolkit based on ISDra2 TnpB, which is approximately one-third the size of Cas9 and enables precise, site-specific gene editing. We demonstrated that STAGE introduces genetic mutations with high efficiency and minimal off-target effects in two industrially important Streptomyces strains. Building on this platform, we developed STAGE-cBEST and STAGE-McBEST, enabling single and multiplexed C·G-to-T·A base editing, respectively, with editing efficiencies exceeding 75%. To further enhance performance, we engineered the ISDra2 TnpB system using an AI-assisted protein engineering framework, resulting in two variants that achieve nearly 100% genome editing efficiency. Additionally, through sequence homology analysis, we identified a TnpB ortholog from the same biological origin of ISDra2 TnpB, which also functions effectively as a gene editing tool. Our study establishes STAGE as a highly precise, programmable, and versatile genome editing platform for Streptomyces , paving the way for advanced genetic manipulation and synthetic biology applications in these industrially important bacteria.},

  abstract     = {The investigation of biomolecular interactions at the single-molecule level has emerged as a pivotal research area in life science, particularly through optical, mechanical, and electrochemical approaches. Spins existing widely in biological systems offer a unique degree of freedom for detecting such interactions. However, most previous studies have been largely confined to ensemble-level detection in the spin degree. Here, we developed a molecular interaction analysis method approaching single-molecule level based on relaxometry using the quantum sensor, nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Experiments utilized an optimized diamond surface functionalized with a polyethylenimine nanogel layer, achieving ∼ 10 nm average protein distance and mitigating interfacial steric hindrance. Then we measured the strong interaction between streptavidin and spin-labeled biotin complexes, as well as the weak interaction between bovine serum albumin and biotin complexes, at both the micrometer scale and nanoscale. For the micrometer-scale measurements using ensemble NV centers, we reexamined the often-neglected fast relaxation component and proposed a relaxation rate evaluation method, substantially enhancing the measurement sensitivity. Furthermore, we achieved nanoscale detection approaching single-molecule level using single NV centers. This methodology holds promise for applications in molecular screening, identification, and kinetic studies at the single-molecule level, offering critical insights into molecular function and activity mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {The human gut is rich in metabolites and harbors a complex microbial community, yet surprisingly little is known about the spectrum of chemical signals detected by the large variety of sensory receptors present in the gut microbiome. Here, we systematically mapped the ligand specificities of selected extracytoplasmic sensory domains from twenty members of the human gut microbiota, with a primary focus on the abundant and physiologically important class of Clostridia. Twenty-five metabolites from different chemical classes—including amino acids, nucleobase derivatives, amines, indole, and carboxylates—were identified as specific ligands for fifteen sensory domains from nine bacterial species, which represent all three major functional classes of transmembrane receptors: chemotaxis receptors, histidine kinases, and enzymatic sensors. We have further characterized the specificity and evolution of ligand binding to Cache superfamily sensors specific for lactate, dicarboxylic acids, and for uracil and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Structural and biochemical analysis of the dCache sensor of uracil and SCFAs revealed that its two different ligand types bind at distinct sensory modules. Overall, combining experimental identification with computational analyses, we were able to assign ligands to approximately half of the Cache-type chemotaxis receptors found in the eleven gut commensal genomes from our set, with carboxylic acids representing the largest ligand class. Among these, the most commonly found ligand specificities were for lactate and formate, indicating a particular importance of these metabolites in the human gut microbiota and consistent with their observed growth-promoting effects on selected bacterial commensals.},

  abstract     = {The glycerol-3-phosphate (G-3-P) pathway is central to the synthesis of triacylglycerols (TAGs) and glycerophospholipids, essential for membrane biogenesis and lipid storage. The first and rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs), with microsomal GPAT3 and GPAT4 being evolutionarily conserved and predominant in most tissues. While previous studies have implicated Calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1) as a cofactor for GPAT4, the broader role of CHP1 in regulating microsomal GPATs and TAG biosynthesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that CHP1 is a critical regulator of both GPAT3 and GPAT4, essential for their stability, enzymatic activity, and lipid droplet (LD) localization. Structural modeling and mutational analyses identified key hydrophobic interfaces mediating the CHP1–GPAT interaction, which are required for optimal GPAT activity and LD growth. Loss of CHP1 impairs LD expansion and disrupts the localization of GPAT3/4 and downstream enzymes in the TAG synthesis pathway, including 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (AGPAT3) and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2). Mechanistically, CHP1 helps circumvent seipin-mediated restriction of late LD-targeting enzymes, facilitating their access to mature LDs. Together, our findings reveal CHP1 as a dual-function regulator that stabilizes and activates microsomal GPATs while enabling the coordinated recruitment of TAG biosynthetic enzymes to LDs. This work uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating LD growth and glycerolipid metabolism, with broad implications for lipid homeostasis and metabolic diseases.},

  abstract     = {Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data are available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our minimal hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation–integration transition even with memory-less agents. While residential segregation is a multifactorial phenomenon, this physics analogy suggests a simple mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood’s population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract spaces.},

  abstract     = {The plant immune system utilizes nucleotide-binding/leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins to detect pathogen virulence factors (effectors) inside host cells and transduce recognition to rapid defense. In dicotyledenous plants, pathogen activated Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor-containing NLRs (TNLs) establish a signaling network of enhanced susceptibility 1 (EDS1)-family dimers with RPW8-type coiled-coil (CC R ) domain NLRs (RNLs) to stimulate transcriptional reprogramming leading to host cell death and pathogen restriction. Evidence suggests that TNL- and EDS1-activated RNLs function as oligomeric Ca 2+ permeable ion channels at the plasma membrane. However, the downstream processes for immunity execution are poorly understood. Here, we studied pathogen effector-triggered immunity conferred by Nicotiana benthamiana TNL (Roq1) which signals almost exclusively through the EDS1-senescence associated gene101 (SAG101)-N required gene 1 (NRG1) RNL module. We identify a pair of glutamate receptor–like Ca 2+ ion channels (GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b) which, unlike most other pathogen-induced GLRs, are highly up-regulated by the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module in the TNL immune response. We show that oligomeric NRG1 Ca 2+ channel activity is necessary for GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b induced expression. Consequently, GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b proteins contribute to NRG1 -dependent Ca 2+ accumulation in host cells, and to pathogen resistance and host cell death. We establish that GLR2.9a localizes mainly to the plasma membrane/cytoplasm whereas GLR2.9b accumulates preferentially at the nuclear envelope. The data show that transcriptionally up-regulated canonical Ca 2+ ion channels GLR2.9a and GLR2.9b are a functional output of the EDS1-SAG101-NRG1 module for TNL-triggered immunity.},

Mineral–organic interactions in frozen environments, such as soils and permafrost, are crucial for explaining the flux of soluble iron during melting events, yet the mechanisms remain misunderstood. This study elucidates the unique roles of freezing in the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles (α–FeOOH) by oxalate, a low molecular weight dicarboxylate, under acidic conditions. From time-resolved experiments conducted over 4 d, we demonstrate that soluble iron was released through reactions in minute volumes of liquid water trapped between ice micrograins. Freeze concentration of nanoparticles, oxalate, and protons into this liquid water drove oxalate- and proton-promoted dissolution reactions at temperatures as low as −30 °C. Remarkably, ice at −10 °C dissolved more iron than liquid water at 4 °C under high oxalate loadings, and even more than at 25 °C under low oxalate loadings. In contrast, high salinity subdued dissolution. Also, sequential freeze-thaw cycles enhanced dissolution by releasing unreacted oxalate that was previously locked in ice. By resolving the chemical controls on mineral dissolution in ice, this work can help explain how freeze-thaw events are supplying new fluxes of soluble iron to nature.},

However, the fixed distribution limits the spatial selectivity and efficiency of qubit manipulation, which is of central importance in a scaled-up quantum system.

A “photothermal doping” method was proposed to optically control local insulator-to-metal transition in vanadium dioxide.

  abstract     = {Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a Ca 2+ -sensing protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The depletion of ER Ca 2+ stores induces a large conformational transition of the cytosolic STIM1 C-terminus, initiated by the dimerization of the transmembrane (TM) domain. We use the AI-guided transition path sampling algorithm aimmd to extensively sample the dimerization of STIM1-TM helices in an ER-mimicking lipid bilayer. In nearly 0.5 ms of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without bias potentials, we harvest over 170 transition paths, each about 1.2 μs long on average. We find that STIM1 dimerizes into three distinct and coexisting configurations, which reconciles conflicting results from earlier crosslinking studies. The dominant X-shaped bound state centers around contacts supported by the SxxxG TM interfacial motif. Mutating residues in this contact interface allows us to tune the STIM1-dimerization propensity in fluorescence experiments. From the trained model of the committor probability of dimerization, we identify the transition state ensemble for TM-helix dimerization. At the transition state, interhelical contacts in the luminal halves of the two monomers dominate, which likely enables the luminal Ca 2+ -sensing domain in STIM1 to condition the dimerization of the TM helices. Our work demonstrates the unique power of AI-guided simulations to sample rare and slow molecular transitions and to produce detailed atomistic insight into the mechanism of STIM1 TM-helix dimerization as a key step in ER Ca 2+ -sensing.},

  abstract     = {For over 5,000 y, chanting has been practiced across many Western and Eastern traditions. However, there is hardly any empirical research on 1) whether chants from across the globe share common acoustic properties, 2) whether these acoustic features make them distinct from other human vocalizations, and 3) the extent to which they may positively impact listeners’ well-being. Here, we collected 242 chants belonging to seven distinct traditions and associated with a wide range of language families, and compared them acoustically to a large corpus of song (n = 126) and speech (n = 616) samples from across 14 linguistic and 12 geographical regions. We show that, irrespective of language and geographical origin, chants share distinctive acoustic traits, namely relatively flat and slow-changing intonation and steady, unbroken voicing in a comfortable, rather low pitch range with a prevalence of mid-central vowels. Thus, chants are produced in a relaxed vocal tract configuration with minimal articulation. Additionally, playback experiments involving original chants (with a participant pool of 61 listeners), resynthesized chants (with 114 listeners), and fully synthetic chants (with 80 listeners) demonstrate that these acoustic characteristics enhance listeners’ perceived sensations of relaxation. Specifically, relatively flat and slow-changing intonation, combined with vowel production in a relatively relaxed vocal tract configuration, resulted in higher overall relaxation ratings. Together these results hint at a specific function of chants’ acoustic commonalities: the enhancement of well-being through relaxation.},

  abstract     = {Arsenite (As III ) is toxic to all organisms due to its ability to tightly bind exposed thiols within cells. An important As III resistance mechanism in prokaryotes involves proteins encoded by the ars operon. A central component of the ars operon in many bacteria is the cytoplasmic ATPase, ArsA, which orchestrates a series of nucleotide-dependent handoffs, starting with the capture of As III by the ArsD metallochaperone and culminating in its removal from the cell by the ArsB efflux pump. Although the mechanism of ArsA has been widely studied, the molecular details of how nucleotide hydrolysis modulates these events remain unclear. ArsA is an archetypal member of the intradimeric Walker A (IWA) family of ATPases, implicated in a diversity of complex biological functions. Conformational changes typical of IWA ATPases have been postulated to drive these molecular events but have not been demonstrated. We report cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of ArsA in MgADP-bound and MgATP-bound open states, as well as a distinct closed MgATP-bound state liganded to As III . X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed three-coordinate binding of As III to the conserved cysteines at the metalloid-binding site of the closed state. Coupled with biochemical characterization, our cryo-EM structures reveal key conformational changes in the ArsA catalytic cycle consistent with other IWA ATPases and provide the structural basis for allosteric activation of nucleotide hydrolysis by As III . This work establishes how the nucleotide state of ArsA transiently creates a high-affinity binding site that can sequester metalloid within the cell, followed by a nucleotide-driven handoff to ArsB for efflux.},

  abstract     = {In vivo genome editing has the potential to address many inherited and environmental disorders. However, a major hurdle for the clinical translation of genome editing is safe, efficient delivery to disease-relevant tissues. A modality-agnostic reporter animal model that facilitates rapid, precise, and quantifiable assessment of functional delivery and editing could greatly enhance the evaluation and translation of delivery technologies. Here, we present the development of the tdTomato in vivo genome-editing reporter (TIGER) mouse, a reporter strain that harbors an integrated and constitutively expressed mutated tdTomato gene in the Polr2a locus. The mutations (Q115X, Q357X) abolish fluorescence, but successful adenine base editing (ABE) or prime editing (PE) restores tdTomato fluorescence. This mouse model facilitates the tissue- and cell type–specific assessment of genome editing agent delivery. We describe several editing strategies validated in vitro and demonstrate efficient ABE and PE in vivo using viral and nonviral delivery vectors targeting four cell types within the mouse eye: the retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors, Müller glia, and the trabecular meshwork. We show direct editing characterization in the ocular tissues via in vivo and ex vivo two-photon confocal microscopy and verify the spectral and fluorescence lifetime properties of tdTomato reporter in other mouse tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate successful adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PE of extraocular tissues, including hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and brain neurons by intravenous injection. Thus, the TIGER mouse facilitates the direct development, comparison, and optimization of delivery platforms for efficient and productive ABE or PE broadly applicable in vivo across multiple tissues tested in this study.},

  abstract     = {Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that infect more than 200 million people globally. However, there is a shortage of molecular tools that enable the discovery of potential drug targets within schistosomes. Thus, praziquantel has remained the frontline treatment for schistosomiasis despite known liabilities. Here, we have conducted a genome-wide study in Schistosoma mansoni using the human druggable genome as a bioinformatic template to identify essential genes within schistosomes bearing similarity to catalogued drug targets. Then, we assessed these candidate targets in silico using a set of unbiased criteria to determine which possess ideal characteristics for a ready-made drug discovery campaign. Following this prioritization, we pursued a parasite p97 ortholog as a bona-fide drug target for the development of therapeutics to treat schistosomiasis. From this effort, we identified a covalent inhibitor series that kills schistosomes through an on-target killing mechanism by disrupting the ubiquitin proteasome system. Fascinatingly, these inhibitors induce a conformational change in the conserved D2 domain P-loop of schistosome p97 upon modification of Cys519. This conformational change reveals an allosteric binding site adjacent to the D2 domain active site reminiscent of the “DFG” flip in protein kinases. This allosteric binding site can potentially be utilized to generate new classes of species-selective p97 inhibitors. Furthermore, these studies provide a resource for the development of alternative therapeutics for schistosomiasis and a workflow to identify potential drug targets in similar systems with few available molecular tools.},

  abstract     = {With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse enough to truly bolster collective creativity? We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, an automatic metric that measures the uniqueness of a plot element among alternative storylines generated using the same prompt under an LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations and across different LLMs, while plots from the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.},

  abstract     = {Street art murals are increasingly recognized as valuable contemporary artworks, often attaining significant artistic, historical, and social importance. As these murals become integral parts of cultural heritage, finding efficient strategies for their conservation is crucial. However, their typical large surface areas, heterogeneous materials, and high variability in exposure to environmental and pollution factors pose significant challenges in establishing appropriate analytical strategies to obtain the necessary information. This study proposes a multiscale and multitechnique noninvasive approach to investigate and monitor street art murals in situ. By combining portable point techniques—such as external reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy—with visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging, the mural’s composition across a square meter surface could be analyzed. Additionally, multispectral imaging mounted on a drone provided a global reconstruction and characterization of the overall mural. This method was complemented by microdestructive laboratory analyses of selected samples, using pyrolysis gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and tandem mass spectrometry, to further investigate selected samples and support noninvasive results. The approach was applied to the iconic mural “Musica Popolare” (2017) by Orticanoodles in Milan, Italy, revealing detailed information about its pigments, binders, fillers, and degradation. The findings demonstrate the potential of this integrated methodology for the effective material identification, conservation assessment, and short-and long-term monitoring of urban heritage.},

To explore the range of interactions between these two species, we utilized dual RNA-sequencing to transcriptionally profile both C. albicans and E. faecalis during coculture (compared with monoculture controls) under two conditions: 1) an in vitro setting that mimics certain features of the gut environment and 2) a gnotobiotic mouse gut model. RNA-seq analysis revealed a large number of gene expression changes induced by one species in the presence of the other. More specifically, both species highly upregulate citrate-metabolizing genes during coculture: C. albicans upregulates CIT1 (citrate synthase) which produces citrate, while E. faecalis upregulates its cit operon, which breaks down citrate. In vitro analysis showed directly that citrate cross-feeding (production of citrate by C. albicans and breakdown by E. faecalis) enhances growth of E. faecalis . A main byproduct of citrate metabolism in E. faecalis is formate, a short chain fatty acid toxic to fungi. Our RNA profiling revealed that C. albicans upregulates three formate dehydrogenases (FDHs) during coculture; we show that the FDH genes confer a growth advantage to C. albicans when E. faecalis (or simply formate) is present. These findings reveal a metabolically driven cycle between C. albicans and E. faecalis in the mouse gut and in vitro, where cross-feeding of citrate and detoxification of formate facilitates the growth of both species when they are cultured together.},

Using an erythrocyte FAD-dependent glutathione reductase activity assay, we identified individuals with flavin-deficient erythrocytes (FDE) in Ferrara, Italy (23% of 150 individuals screened), and in Huye, Rwanda (13% of 169 individuals). None of the individuals with FDE had a dietary riboflavin deficiency. Importantly, FDE from individuals in Ferrara, as well as erythrocytes depleted of flavins in vitro by riboflavin starvation, inhibited the intraerythrocytic proliferation of Plasmodium falciparum . We provide evidence that these erythrocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress, potentially explaining their inhibitory effect on parasite proliferation.

  abstract     = {Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO 2 -laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a nonlinear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam’s soap films (≠1 for CO 2 /air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.},

  abstract     = {Heparan sulfates are found in all animal tissues and have essential roles in living systems. This family of biomacromolecules modulates binding to calcium ions (Ca 2+ ) in low free energy reactions that influence biochemical processes from cell signaling and anticoagulant efficacy to biomineralization. Despite their ubiquity, the thermodynamic basis for how heparans and similarly functionalized biomolecules regulate Ca 2+ interactions is not yet established. Using heparosan (Control) and heparins with different positions of sulfate groups, we quantify how SO 3 − and COO − content and SO 3 − position modulate Ca 2+ binding by isothermal titration calorimetry. The free energy of all heparin-Ca 2+ interactions (Δ G rxn ) is dominated by entropic contributions due to favorable water release from polar, hydrophilic groups. Heparin with both sulfate esters ( O -SO 3 − ) and sulfamides ( N -SO 3 − ) has the strongest binding to Ca 2+ compared to heparosan and to heparin with only O -SO 3 − groups (~3X). By linking Ca 2+ binding thermodynamics to measurements of the interfacial energy for calcite (CaCO 3 ) crystallization onto polysaccharides, we show molecule-specific differences in nucleation rate can be explained by differences in water structuring during Ca 2+ interactions. A large entropic term (- T Δ S rxn ) upon Ca 2+ –polysaccharide binding correlates with high interfacial energy to CaCO 3 nucleation. Combining our measurements with literature values indicates many Ca 2+ –polysaccharide interactions have a shared thermodynamic signature. The resulting enthalpy–entropy compensation relationship suggests these interactions are generally dominated by water restructuring involving few conformational changes, distinct from Ca 2+ –protein binding. Our findings quantify the thermodynamic origins of heparin-specific interactions with Ca 2+ and demonstrate the contributions of solvation and functional group position during biomacromolecule-mediated ion regulation.},

  abstract     = {Exposure to infectious disease in early life may have long-term ramifications for health and lifespan. However, reducing pathogen exposure may not be uniformly beneficial. The rise of modern sanitation and reduction of infectious diseases has been implicated in increasing levels of allergy and immune dysregulation: termed, the “hygiene hypothesis.” This study leverages quasi-experimental variation from combining precampaign hookworm exposure with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission’s deworming campaign in the early 20th century to rigorously examine the impacts of childhood hookworm exposure on adult lifespan and morbidity. Findings show deworming before age five leads to 2.5 additional months of life in a large sample of adult death records. Further, decreasing hookworm exposure is related to improvements in biomarkers for inflammation and skin-tested allergies, in contrast to predictions of the “hygiene hypothesis.” Placebo tests using health outcomes that should not be affected by deworming do not show similar patterns. Overall, childhood deworming leads to improvements in morbidity and lifespan decades later.},

  abstract     = {Light scattering in biological tissue presents a significant challenge for deep in vivo imaging. Our previous work demonstrated the ability to achieve optical transparency in live mice using intensely absorbing dye molecules, which created transparency in the red spectrum while blocking shorter-wavelength photons. In this paper, we extend this capability to achieve optical transparency across the entire visible spectrum by employing molecules with strong absorption in the ultraviolet spectrum and sharp absorption edges that rapidly decline upon entering the visible spectrum. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency method enables optical transparency for imaging commonly used fluorophores in the green and yellow spectra. Notably, this approach facilitates tissue transparency for structural and functional imaging of the live mouse brain labeled with yellow fluorescent protein and GCaMP through the scalp and skull. We show that this method enables longitudinal imaging of the same brain regions in awake mice over multiple days during development. Histological analyses of the skin and systemic toxicology studies indicate minimal acute or chronic damage to the skin or body using this approach. This color-neutral and reversible tissue transparency technique opens opportunities for noninvasive deep-tissue optical imaging, enabling long-term visualization of cellular structures and dynamic activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and chronic tracking capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Membranes that selectively enhance target solute permeation while rejecting competing species are essential for precision separations. This study introduces charge-patterned mosaic membranes (CMMs) that selectively transport divalent asymmetric salts by leveraging a net-neutral membrane–solution interface. This mechanism, dictated by the charge ratio of positive and negative domains on the membrane surface and the balance of cations and anions in the salt, is supported by analytical, numerical, and experimental results. Analytical solutions identified cationic domain coverages ( f + ) of 33%, 50%, and 66% as optimal for the selective transport of +2:−1 salts, +1:−1 salts, and +1:−2 salts, respectively, under conditions where the pattern size ( L ) is significantly larger than the Debye length. Numerical simulations and experiments using CMMs with alternating charged-stripes inkjet-printed onto nanostructure copolymer substrates confirmed these findings. By varying stripe widths to control f + , pressure-driven filtration experiments demonstrated selective enrichment of MgCl 2 and K 2 SO 4 at the predicted f + values, with deviations from these values leading to salt rejection. These results highlight the pivotal role of a net-neutral interface in enabling asymmetric salt enrichment. This study positions CMMs as a versatile platform for tuning ion selectivity, addressing challenges in resource recovery, water treatment, and precision separations.},

Patients in this group are highly prone to develop embryonal tumors, most commonly medulloblastoma arising from the cerebellar granule cell progenitors (GCPs). GCPs undergo high proliferation in the postnatal cerebellum under Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) activation, but the type of DNA lesions that require the function of the BRCA2 to prevent tumorigenesis remains unknown. To identify such lesions, we assessed both GCP neurodevelopment and tumor formation using a mouse model with deletion of exons three and four of Brca2 in the central nervous system, coupled with global Trp53 loss. Brca2 Δex3-4 ;Trp53 −/− animals developed SHH subgroup medulloblastomas with complete penetrance. Whole-genome sequencing of the tumors identified structural variants with breakpoints enriched in areas overlapping putative G-quadruplexes (G4s). Brca2 -deficient GCPs exhibited decreased replication speed in the presence of the G4-stabilizer pyridostatin. Pif1 helicase, which resolves G4s during replication, was highly upregulated in tumors, and Pif1 knockout in primary medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in increased genome instability upon pyridostatin treatment. These data suggest that G4s may represent sites prone to replication stalling in highly proliferative GCPs and without BRCA2, G4s become a source of genome instability. Tumor cells upregulate G4-resolving helicases to facilitate rapid proliferation through G4s highlighting PIF1 helicase as a potential therapeutic target for treatment of BRCA2-deficient medulloblastomas.},

  abstract     = {Emergence of quantum orders with nontrivial quantum geometric properties in metals represent central issues in condensed matter physics. In this context, recently discovered chiral loop-current order in kagome metals has garnered significant attention. Particularly noteworthy is the giant electrical magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA) observed in CsV 3 Sb 5 , which provides compelling evidence for the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. However, the origin of the eMChA and its fundamental connection to the loop-current remain highly elusive, as the loop-current itself preserves inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that the loop-current phase breaks inversion symmetry in the presence of the experimentally observed stripe charge-density wave, leading to finite eMChA coefficient γ eM . In this mechanism, γ eM is proportional to the product of the loop-current-induced orbital magnetization, M orb 0 , and the lifetime of conduction electrons, τ . Therefore, γ eM is reversible by the magnetic fields, and it takes large value in kagome metals with τ v Fermi ≫ a 0 (=lattice constant). Surprisingly, the quantum metric, which defines a fundamental geometric aspect of Bloch wavefunctions, acquires significant momentum dependence in the loop-current phase, resulting in a dramatic enhancement of eMChA by ∼100 times. This research not only clarifies the fundamental symmetry-breaking states in kagome metals but also opens a path for exploring quantum metric–induced phenomena arising from exotic quantum phase transitions in various metals.},

  abstract     = {Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines (NSML) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 11) which encodes for the protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Approximately 85% of NSML patients develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Here, we show that SHP2 is recruited to tyrosyl phosphorylated protein-zero related (PZR) in NSML mice. This recruitment is required for the Iroquois homeobox (IRX) transcription factors 3 and 5 to suppress BMP10 which negatively regulates postnatal cardiac growth. The protein expression of IRX3 and IRX5 was elevated in hypertrophied NSML hearts. IRX3 and IRX5 upregulation was rescued in NSML mice harboring a knock-in mutation of PZR that fails to become tyrosyl phosphorylated and recruit SHP2. NSML mice treated with low-dose dasatinib also exhibited normalized IRX3 and IRX5 expression levels. Consistent with this, BMP10 expression levels were reduced in NSML mice and rescued in PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation-deficient and low-dose dasatinib-treated NSML mice. A crystal structure of the tandem SH2 domains of SHP2 bound to tyrosyl phosphorylated PZR reveals that recruitment constrains the open SHP2 conformation to facilitate cellular-Src (c-Src) binding. Disruption of c-Src binding to SHP2 abolished IRX activation and failure to suppress BMP10. Hence, NSML-associated SHP2 genetic variants disrupt IRX transcription factor signaling to BMP10, implicating this axis as a target for RASopathy-associated HCM.},

Here, we show using solution-scattering, steady-state kinetic, and crystallographic approaches that the protease from Thomasclavelia ramosa , representing the uncharacterized third family, has a truly modular and minimizable protein architecture. This analysis also revealed a unique metal-associated domain that likely functions as a molecular spacer and generated a working hypothesis detailing the structural mechanism behind the enzyme’s high substrate specificity.

Following widespread ratification of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, an unprecedented increase in area-based conservation is required to reach its target of conserving 30% of land, waters, and seas by 2030. These expansions prompt difficult trade-offs between conservation, social, and economic interests. A key factor in securing legitimacy and practical feasibility for expansion regimes is understanding what factors determine public support for them. Using survey and experimental data, we show that in eight countries across five continents, public opinion is 1) strongly in favor of the “30-by-30”-target and 2) highly consistent regarding policy priorities for the design of international- and domestic-level expansion regimes. We find that for international-level policy regimes, support increases with protection responsibilities equally split between countries, rich countries bearing higher costs, more countries actively cooperating, and placement trade not allowed. For domestic-level policy regimes, support generally increases when nature values are prioritized over social or economic values and, in many countries, decreases when costs are borne by a general tax increase, parks are managed by private companies, and when access to parks is restricted. Together, these results demonstrate how protected area expansion policies can be shaped to facilitate reaching 30% protected areas by 2030.},

Using dense behavioral recordings of mathematicians’ moment-to-moment activity, we find that their blackboard interactions (e.g., writing, gesturing; N = 4 , 653 ) became increasingly unpredictable before an insight, analogous to the critical fluctuations that anticipate transitions in physical and ecological systems. We explore analytically when this early warning signal applies to varied systems with discrete, symbolic dynamics. While bibliometric analyses offer a zoomed-out perspective on innovation, publications are a coarse-grained record of individuals’ insights. Explaining the sudden insights of innovators, from scientists to sculptors, requires attending to the local, distributed systems of their intellectual activity.},

Activin receptor-like kinase-2 (ALK2) is the only type I receptor among the seven TGF-β type I receptors that interacts with both activin and BMP ligands. With BMPs, ALK2 acts as a signaling receptor to activate small mothers against decapentaplegic 1 (SMAD1)/5/8 signaling. Alternatively, with activins, such as Activin A (ActA), ALK2 forms nonsignaling complexes that negatively regulate ALK2 and ActA signaling. To gain insight into how ALK2 interacts with two distinct classes of ligands, we resolved the cryoelectron microscopy structure of ALK2 in complex with the type II receptor, ActRIIB, and the ligand, BMP6, in parallel with the corresponding structure with ALK3 for direct comparison. These structures demonstrate that ALK2 and ALK3 utilize different mechanisms to interact with BMP6 at the wrist interface, with ALK2 relying on BMP6 glycosylation and ALK3 relying on a salt bridge. Modeling of ALK2:ActA reveals that binding relies on ActA’s fingertip region, mirroring the interaction of ActA with its other receptor, ALK4. Our results demonstrate that ALK2 is a “hybrid” receptor that incorporates features of BMP type I receptors such as ALK3 at the wrist interface and an activin type I receptor such as ALK4 at the fingertip.},

  abstract     = {Life thrives due to its remarkable ability to create complex structures through the self-assembly of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules. Achieving such complex assemblies with the same level of fidelity, reproducibility, and advanced functionality in synthetic systems, however, has remained a grand challenge. One outstanding problem is the presence of parasitic products and long-lived intermediate states that slow the reaction process and limit the yield of the final product. Biology overcomes this challenge by proofreading to recognize and disassemble parasitic products. Such local checks, however, are currently difficult to implement in available self-assembly platforms. Here, we overcome this challenge by implementing a proofreading mechanism in a self-assembly platform. Specifically, we design intermediate states that strongly couple to an external force but a final product that is decoupled and thus highly stable to external driving, such that application of external forces selectively dissociates parasitic products. To implement this idea, we introduce lithographically patterned magnetic dipoles and an applied magnetic field to drive an assembly process similar to thermal self-assembly, but with additional controls. By applying patterns of magnetic driving that selectively destabilize parasitic states, we effectively implement a proofreading strategy to enable high-yield, time-efficient self-assembly. This realization of a general proofreading mechanism bridges the gap between artificial and biological self-assembly, paving the way for advanced self-assembled materials, with applications in next generation responsive materials, biomimetic devices, and microscale machines.},

  abstract     = {Biological flyers periodically flap their appendages to generate aerodynamic forces. Extensive studies have made significant progress in explaining the physics behind their propulsion in cruising by developing scaling laws of their flight kinematics. Notably Strouhal number ( St ; ratio of flapping frequency times stroke amplitude to cruising speed) has been found to fall in a narrow range for animal cruising flights. However, St exhibits strong correlation to flight conditions; as such, its universality has been confined to preferred flight conditions. Since the leading-edge vortices (LEV) on flapping appendages generate the majority of propulsive forces, here we take the perspective of LEV circulation maximization, which generalizes the dimensionless vortex formation time to flapping flight. The generalized vortex formation time scales the duration of vorticity injection with the rate of total vorticity growth inside the LEV and the maximum vorticity allowed inside it. By comparing the new scaling with St of previously reported animal cruising flights of 28 species, we show that the generalized vortex formation time is consistent across different animals and cruising locomotion, independent of flight conditions. This finding advances the fundamental principles underlying the complex wing kinematics of biological flyers and highlights a unifying framework for understanding biolocomotion.},

  abstract     = {The oxygenation history of Earth’s surface environments has had a profound influence on the ecology and evolution of metazoan life. It was traditionally thought that the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event enabled the origin of animals in marine environments, followed by their persistence in aerobic marine habitats ever since. However, recent studies of redox proxies (e.g., Fe, Mo, Ce, I) have suggested that low dissolved oxygen levels persisted in the deep ocean until the Late Devonian, when the first heavily wooded ligniophyte forests raised atmospheric O 2 to modern levels. Here, we present a Paleozoic redox proxy record based on selenium enrichments and isotope ratios in fine-grained siliciclastic sediments. Our data reveal transient oxygenation of bottom waters around the Ediacaran–Cambrian boundary, followed by predominantly anoxic deep-water conditions through the Early Devonian (419 to 393 Ma). In the Middle Devonian (393 to 382 Ma), our data document the onset of permanent deep-ocean oxygenation, coincident with the spread of woody biomass across terrestrial landscapes. This episode is concurrent with the ecological occupation and evolutionary radiation of large active invertebrate and vertebrate organisms in deeper oceanic infaunal and epifaunal habitats, suggesting that the burial of recalcitrant wood from the first forests sequestered organic carbon, increased deep marine oxygen levels, and was ultimately responsible for the “mid-Paleozoic marine revolution.”},

  abstract     = {Black carbon (BC) aerosols exacerbate air pollution and climate warming, but their climatic impacts and sources are poorly constrained by bottom–up emission inventories (EIs). China’s Clean Air Action (CAA), which was launched in 2013, provides an excellent opportunity for investigating interannual variations in source contributions and validate the accuracy of EIs. Here, we present an 11-y (2008–2018) record of the BC concentration and its source-diagnostic radiocarbon ( 14 C) and stable carbon isotope ( 13 C) signatures at a receptor site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, South China. The results revealed that the implementation of the CAA (2014–2018) led to a 41% reduction in the BC concentration compared with that in the preaction period (2008–2013). There is a large and systemic discrepancy over the whole period in the contribution of biomass burning to BC in South China between predictions from technology-based EIs (4 to 9%) and these source-diagnostic dual-isotopic fingerprints of actual ambient aerosols (21 to 32%). Observational constraints by source-diagnostic δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope measurements revealed that the reduction in biomass burning contributed 22% to the decrease in BC associated with the CAA, whereas predictions from EIs assigned a much smaller fraction. These results emphasize the need for observation-based source diagnostics of changing BC emission sources. Detailed source apportionment using independent δ 13 C/Δ 14 C isotope methodology is crucial for refining air pollution control strategies and improving the accuracy of models used for assessing the air quality and climate effects of BC in China and elsewhere.},

These approaches have been successful for undirected graphs but directed edge information has not yet been dealt with in a satisfactory way. Here, we revisit the concept of directed communities as a mapping between sending and receiving communities. This translates into a definition that we term bimodularity. Using convex relaxation, bimodularity can be optimized with the singular value decomposition of the directed modularity matrix. Subsequently, we propose an edge-based clustering approach to reveal the directed communities including their mappings. The feasibility of the framework is illustrated on a synthetic model and further applied to the neuronal wiring diagram of the Caenorhabditis elegans , for which it yields meaningful feedforward loops of the head and body motion systems. This framework sets the ground for the understanding and detection of community structures in directed networks.},

  abstract     = {Inadequate response to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) frequently arises in prostate cancer, driven by cellular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell multiomics, and spatial transcriptomics to define the transcriptional, epigenetic, and spatial basis of cell identity and castration response in the mouse prostate. Leveraging these data along with a meta-analysis of human prostates and prostate cancer (PCa), we identified cellular orthologs and key determinants of ADT response and resistance. Our findings reveal that mouse prostates harbor lobe-specific luminal epithelial cell types distinguished by unique gene regulatory modules and anatomically defined androgen-responsive transcriptional programs, indicative of divergent developmental origins. Androgen-insensitive, stem-like epithelial populations—resembling human club and hillock cells—are notably enriched in the urethra and ventral prostate but are rare in other lobes. Within the ventral prostate, we also uncovered two additional androgen-responsive luminal epithelial cell types, marked by Pbsn or Spink1 expression, which align with human luminal subsets and may define the origin of distinct PCa subtypes. Castration profoundly reshaped luminal epithelial transcriptomes, with castration-resistant luminal epithelial cells activating stress-responsive and stemness programs. These transcriptional signatures are enriched in tumor cells from ADT-treated and castration-resistant PCa patients, underscoring their likely role in driving treatment resistance. Temporal tracking of cells will precisely map disease-associated cellular transitions, and our technical framework facilitates such interrogations. Collectively, our comprehensive cellular atlas of the mouse prostate illuminates the importance of lobe-specific contexts for PCa modeling and reveals potential therapeutic targets to counter castration resistance.},

  abstract     = {Soil microbial diversity is crucial to sustaining ecosystem productivity and improving carbon sequestration. Global temperature continues to rise, but how climate warming affects microbial diversity and its capacity to sequester soil organic carbon (SOC) remains uncertain. Here, by conducting a global meta-analysis with 251 paired observations from 102 studies, we showed that, on average, warming reduced bacterial and fungal diversity (measured by richness and Shannon index) by 16.0 and 19.7%, respectively, and SOC by 18.1%. The negative responses of both soil bacterial and fungal diversity to warming became more pronounced with increasing warming magnitude, experimental duration, and decreasing soil nitrogen availability. Under the worst-case climate warming scenario (2010 to 2070, 3.4 increase in °C), soil bacterial diversity and fungal diversity are projected to reduce by 56% and 81%, respectively, over 60 y. Importantly, in addition to the direct impact of warming on SOC, warming-induced declines in microbial diversity also contributed to SOC losses. We highlight that prolonged warming could substantially reduce soil microbial diversity and decrease SOC sequestration, accelerating future warming and underscoring the urgent need for decisive actions to mitigate global climate change.},

Here, we use the Drosophila ovary as a model to study the role of cytonemes in bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling–directed germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and dedifferentiation of germ cells to GSCs. We provide evidence that differentiating germ cell cysts extend longer cytonemes that are more polarized toward the niche during dedifferentiation to reactivate BMP signaling. The presence of additional somatic cells in the niche is associated with a failure of germ cell dedifferentiation, consistent with the formation of a physical barrier to cytoneme–niche contact and outcompetition of germ cells for BMP. Using BMP beads in vitro, we show that these are sufficient to induce cytoneme-dependent contacts in Drosophila tissue culture cells. We demonstrate that the Enabled (Ena) actin polymerase is localized to the tips of germ cell cytonemes and is necessary for robust cytoneme formation, as its mislocalization reduces the frequency, length, and directionality of cytonemes. During homeostasis, specifically perturbing cytoneme function through Ena mislocalization impairs GSC fitness by reducing GSC BMP signaling and niche occupancy. Disrupting cytonemes by targeting Ena during dedifferentiation reduces germ cell BMP responsiveness and the ability of differentiating cysts to dedifferentiate. Overall, our results provide evidence that cytonemes play a fundamental role in establishing polarized signaling and niche occupancy during stem cell maintenance and dedifferentiation.},

So far, a formal mathematical link between individual-level niches and higher organismal-level niches has been lacking, hampering the unification of ecological theories and more accurate forecasts of biodiversity change. To fill in this gap, we propose a bottom–up approach to derive population and higher organismal-level niches from individual niches. We demonstrate the power of our framework by showing that 1) the statistical properties of higher organismal-level niches (e.g., niche breadth, skewness, etc.) can be partitioned into individual contributions and 2) the species-level niche shifts can be estimated by tracing the responses of individuals. By using individual-level GPS (Global Positioning System) tracking data from three different species, we show that climate change could have contrasting consequences on population-level niche shift depending on individual niche compositions. Our method paves the way for a unifying niche theory and enables mechanistic assessments of organism–environment relationships across organismal scales.},

Recently, a method to measure the rates of individual mutations was applied to a narrow region in the human hemoglobin subunit beta ( HBB ) gene containing the site of the hemoglobin S (HbS) mutation as well as to a paralogous hemoglobin subunit delta ( HBD ) region, in sperm samples from sub-Saharan African and northern European donors [Melamed et al ., Genome Res. 32 , 488–498 (2022)]. The HbS mutation, which protects against malaria while causing sickle-cell anemia in homozygotes, originated de novo significantly more frequently in the HBB gene in Africans compared to the other three test cases combined (the European HBB gene and the European and African HBD gene). Here, we apply this approach to the human apolipoprotein L1 ( APOL1 ) gene containing the site of the G1 1024A→G mutation, which protects against African sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense while causing a substantially increased risk of chronic kidney disease in homozygotes. We find that the 1024A→G mutation is the mutation of highest de novo origination rate and deviates most from the genome-wide average rate for its type (A→G) compared to all other observable mutations in the region and that it originates de novo significantly more frequently in Africans than in Europeans—i.e., in the population where it is of adaptive significance. The results are unexpected given the notion that the probability of a specific mutational event is independent of its value to the organism and underscore the importance of studying mutation rates at the individual-mutation resolution.},

It lives obligatorily on gorgonian corals, mimicking their polyps with pink coloration and skin protuberances. Unique for seahorses, pygmy seahorses retain juvenile paedomorphic stunted snouts, resembling the coral’s polyps. We analyzed the tiny seahorse’s genome revealing the genomic bases of several adaptations to their mutualistic life including substantial reductions in conserved noncoding elements that are associated with genes in the vicinity of those CNEs that are known to play a role in growth and metamorphosis-related pathways. Comparative RNA- and ATAC-Seq analyses during their ontogeny suggest that their stunted snout might result from craniofacial remodeling associated with hoxa2b defunctionalization. This is consistent also with findings from in situ hybridization and CRISPR experiments. Their immune system shows extremely low numbers of MHC genes and additional considerable losses of other immune-related genes. This is likely facilitated by the host coral’s antimicrobial metabolites and by the earlier evolution of male pregnancy that requires immunotolerance.},

  abstract     = {We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension d in the language of β -function and renormalization group recently introduced in Vanoni et al. [C. Vanoni et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 121 , e2401955121 (2024)] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the β -function for the fractal dimension D 1 evolves smoothly from its d = 2 form, in which β 2 ≤ 0 , to its β ∞ ≥ 0 form, which is represented by the random regular graph (RRG) result. We show how the ϵ = d − 2 expansion and the 1 / d expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent y depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general nonequilibrium quantum systems.},

  abstract     = {Ferrous chloride–rich silicic fluid and melt infiltration led to the decarbonation of dolomitic marble in the Chinese Sulu ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic terrain under temperatures ranging from 670 to 800 °C, pressures from the aragonite + albite to calcite stability fields and the oxygen fugacities between the hematite–magnetite and pyrite–pyrrhotite–magnetite buffers, resulting in the formation of olivine marble and diopsidite. The inclusions in zircons trapped during the decarbonation process suggest that the H 2 -producing reaction 3FeCl 2 (aq) + 3CaCO 3 + H 2 O = Fe 3 O 4 (magnetite) + 3CaCl 2 (aq) + 3CO 2 + H 2 occurred and that it induced magnetite-catalyzed Fischer–Tropsch-type synthesis, as indicated by the presence of whewellite, disordered carbonaceous material, CH 4 , and CO in the inclusions. The results of this study highlight the role of aqueous Fe in generating H 2 and magnetite and have far-reaching implications for carbon speciation and solubility in deep fluids and for endogenic abiotic synthesis, which may be pivotal in the prebiotic occurrence of organic compounds on Earth.},

  abstract     = {Precise, noninvasive drug delivery to small but important brain regions is challenging and highly desired given the brain’s inherent complexity and heterogeneous nature. Here, we report an approach utilizing focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with nanobubbles to successfully navigate this challenge. Compared to traditional microbubbles, nanobubbles exhibit superior acoustic properties. The nanobubbles, when exposed to FUS, induce a highly localized and reversible opening of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) with significantly enhanced precision (up to fourfolds compared to microbubbles, as measured by the precision loss metric). Repeated multitarget FUS-NB precisely delivers macromolecular human-derived anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) into the small brain region within a 2-h half-life window per opening. Fluorescence images confirm HuMAb retention in the brain parenchyma for at least 10 d postadministration. With this approach, we targeted the lateral habenula, a small but effective brain target for antidepressant treatments, and significantly alleviated depression-like symptoms at least 2 wk in a mouse model (tail suspension test/forced swim test: P < 0.01/0.05). Moreover, minimal red blood cell extravasation (0.9‱ affected area) was observed in the treated region after multiple FUS treatments, indicating the safety and tolerability of FUS-nanobubble-mediated BBB opening. The enhanced delivery precision, coupled with a favorable safety profile, positions our approach as a promising strategy for antibody therapy with significant clinical translation potential.},

  abstract     = {Epidemiological evidence shows that some diseases tend to co-occur; more exactly, certain groups of patients with a given disease are at a higher risk of developing a specific secondary condition. Here, we develop an approach to generate a disease network that uses the accumulating RNA-seq data on human diseases to significantly match an unprecedented proportion of known comorbidities, providing plausible biological models for such co-occurrences and effectively mirroring the underlying structure of complex disease relationships. Furthermore, 64% of the known disease pairs can be explained by analyzing groups of patients with similar expression profiles, highlighting the importance of patient stratification in the study of comorbidities. These results solidly support the existence of molecular mechanisms behind many of the known comorbidities, with most captured co-occurrences implicating the immune system. Additionally, we identified new and potentially underdiagnosed comorbidities, providing molecular insights that could inform targeted therapeutic strategies. We provide a functional and comprehensive resource to explore diseases, disease co-occurrences, and their underlying molecular processes at different resolution levels at http://disease-perception.bsc.es/rgenexcom/ .},

  abstract     = {Global demand for wood products is increasing forest harvest. One understudied consequence of logging is that it accelerates mobilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from soils to aquatic ecosystems where it is more easily rereleased to the atmosphere. Here, we tested how logging changed DOM in headwaters of hardwood-dominated catchments in northern Ontario, Canada. We applied a before-after-control-impact experiment across four catchments for 3 y and measured DOM monthly during ice-free seasons. DOM concentration in streams from logged catchments quadrupled, on average, only for the first 2 mo postharvest, but resulting changes to the molecular composition of DOM persisted for at least 2 y. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that DOM composition within logged streams became more available for microbial use and chemically diverse than in controls, with novel highly unsaturated polyphenols, carboxylic-rich alicyclic, and nitrogen-containing formulae. The molecular composition of stream DOM measured fortnightly postharvest was most similar to the DOM composition of surrounding soils, likely due to increased hydrological connectivity. Alongside carbon being more likely to be released into the atmosphere, we estimate that selective logging increased the total flux of dissolved organic carbon in streams by 6.4% of the carbon extracted as timber. Although these estimates are short-lived, they should affect the millions of hectares that are logged annually. Carbon accounting of forestry, including as a natural climate solution, must now consider the transport and fate of DOM from land into water.},
