  abstract     = {Will-o’-the-wisps, ghostly blue flames seen at night in marshlands and long attributed to methane cool flames, have remained scientifically unexplained, a mystery caused by the lack of a known ignition mechanism. Here, we demonstrate that spontaneous electrical discharges, termed “microlightning”, can occur between rising methane-containing microbubbles in water. High-speed optical imaging reveals brief flashes between charged bubbles, arising from strong electric fields at curved gas–liquid interfaces. These discharges initiate nonthermal oxidation of methane, producing luminescence and measurable heat under ambient conditions. Our findings offer a scientific basis for ignis fatuus and reveal a general mechanism by which electrified interfaces can drive redox reactions in natural environments without the need for external ignition sources.},

  abstract     = {Putative metazoan body fossils from the Precambrian are curiously lacking morphological characteristics that link them unambiguously to extant animal phyla, including sponges. Chemical fossils such as the rare C 30 hydrocarbons 24- iso -propylcholestane (24- i pc) and 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), however, have been proposed as evidence for the Neoproterozoic emergence of the Demospongiae (Porifera) due to their prevalence in rocks of this age and the occurrence of their sterol precursors in contemporary demosponges. However, there are alternative hypotheses which posit that diagenetic alteration products of algal sterols, or those from Rhizaria or other protists, account for the enigmatic steroid distributions observed in these ancient sedimentary rocks. Here, we report additional support for the Neoproterozoic rise of demosponges through the chemical characterization of two previously unrecognized C 31 hydrocarbons—24- n -butylcholestane (24- n bc) and 24- sec -butylcholestane (24- sec bc). Precursor C 31 sterols from contemporary demosponges, as well as a suite of synthesized C 31 sterol standards were reduced to their sterane counterparts. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and collisionally activated dissociation mass spectra confirmed the presence of 24- n bc and 24- sec bc in well-preserved early Ediacaran rocks, and the coelution of these compounds with synthetic standards enhances the robustness of these findings. Co-occurrence of abundant 24- i pc and 24- sec bc was found for numerous Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rock/oil samples, closely mimicking the abundance patterns and high structural selectivity of major C 30 and C 31 sterols detected in numerous species of modern demosponges. These findings support the hypothesized first emergence of sponges during the Neoproterozoic Era.},

  abstract     = {Knowing the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter’s bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter’s atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential nonuniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter’s midlatitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A nonuniform water vapor distribution emerges in the midlatitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from subsolar to supersolar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter’s midlatitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a supersolar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the nonuniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) has two great topographic divisions—brain and spinal cord—that together integrate the body’s internal physiology and behavioral interactions with the environment. To clarify the architecture of intra-CNS connectivity supporting this integration in a mammal (rat), network science analyses were applied at the level of gray matter regions (nodes) connected by directed and weighted axonal projections. Neuroanatomical evidence indicates a bilateral, predominantly sexually monomorphic neuronal network of 840 nodes and a projected 81,434 direct interconnections (of the 704,760 possible connections), representing a projected network density of 12%; 32% of identified connections terminate contralaterally, and 41% of identified connections participate in bidirectionally linking a pair of nodes. Local network differentiations examined with unsupervised multiresolution consensus cluster analysis revealed a nested hierarchy of interconnected modules (clusters or subsystems) that were conservatively assigned putative functional roles. This structure–function hierarchy includes only three first-order modules, indicating a tripartite systems architecture (distinct from the bipartite brain-spinal cord topographic division): a bilaterally symmetric module pair centered in the forebrain-midbrain, associated with behavior control, cognition, and affect; and a single bilateral module centered in the rhombicbrain-spinal cord, associated with behavior execution and reflex integration. This modular spatial patterning suggests possible developmental and phylogenetic correlates. Additional analyses of the CNS’s basic structural network plan included global neuronal network features—specifically, measures of centrality, rich club, and small world topology—that transcend modular boundaries.},

  abstract     = {We previously demonstrated that the NO-stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC1), which produces cGMP, also has the ability to transfer S-nitrosothiols (SNO) to other proteins in a reaction involving oxidized Thioredoxin 1 (oTrx1). This transnitrosation cascade was established in vitro and involved Cys 610 (C610) of GC1 as the major SNO-donor. To assay the relevance of GC1 transnitrosation under physiological conditions and in oxidative pathologies, we studied a knock-in mouse in which C610 was replaced with a serine (KI αC 610S ) under basal or angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated conditions. Despite similar GC1 expression and NO responsiveness, the Ang II-treated KI mice displayed exacerbated oxidative pathologies including higher mean arterial pressure and more severe cardiac dysfunctions compared to the Ang II-treated WT. These phenotypes were associated with a drastic decrease in global S-nitrosation and in levels of SNO-Trx1 in the KI mice. To investigate the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of blood pressure, pressure myography and in vivo intravital microscopy were conducted to analyze the vascular tone of resistance vessels. Both approaches indicated that, even in the absence of oxidative stress, the single mutation C610S led to a significant disruption of the endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation while NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation remained unchanged. Mechanistically, the vasorelaxation defect was associated with decreased endothelial calcium influx and membrane hyperpolarization, independent of NO bioavailability. These findings indicate that the C610S mutation uncouples two NO signaling vasodilatory pathways (endothelial SNO and smooth muscle NO-cGMP) and suggest that GC1 transnitrosation activity is essential for endothelium-derived hyperpolarization.},

  abstract     = {Understanding processes driving local adaptation in wild species is a key goal in evolutionary biology, but linking genotype to phenotype to environmental drivers of natural selection remains challenging. Even more rare are empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to keep pace with environmental change. Here, we explore these connections by conducting an integrative study on the breeding range of the yellow warbler ( Setophaga petechia ). Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we first identify loci associated with variation in bill morphology and individual quality. We then employ gene–environment association (GEA) analyses and find that precipitation is a key environmental driver of putative selection on bill shape. Finally, we test whether contemporary individuals whose bill shapes deviate from the historical relationship with precipitation experience increased stress (measured by telomere length) as a result of maladaptation. We also use historical DNA to test whether local populations have shifted their ranges over the past century, confirming that the observed changes are not due to range shifts. Our results align with predictions from GWAS and GEA analyses, indicating that birds with shallower bills in increasingly arid regions suffer higher stress (i.e., shorter telomeres) because of maladaptation. Overall, this study links genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data with stress biomarkers to improve understanding of the process of local adaptation and the consequence of failing to keep pace with changing climate conditions.},

However, the existing spallation and accelerator-based photonuclear neutron sources employed in this spectroscopy are huge and immobile, restricting their application in specialized scenarios. Here, we demonstrate a compact short-pulsed photonuclear neutron source driven by a terawatt femtosecond laser–based electron accelerator. After moderation, this neutron source maintains an outstanding time-resolution of 0.8 μ s at 5 eV, and its energy resolution can be less than 3% at a flight distance 1.72 m. When this compact neutron resonance spectroscopy facility is utilized to examine silver (Ag) and indium (In) metal sheets with a high signal-to-noise ratio, it distinctly reveals the shape of resonance absorption peaks for 115 In at 1.46 eV and 109 Ag at 5.19 eV. This laser-driven electron accelerator offers a solution, overcoming traditional source drawbacks and holding great potential for on-site nuclear material analysis and high-precision nuclear data acquisition.},

  abstract     = {Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), especially GII.4 strains, are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, yet no approved vaccines or antivirals exist. The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wild-type and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to nonclustering strains and outcompete nonclustering strains in replication assays exhibited by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and an HBGA nonbinding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in postattachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and nonclustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.},

CD4-binding led to prepositioning of the bsAb at the site of viral fusion, enhancing its neutralization potency and achieving 95% breadth (IC80 < 5 μg/mL) against a panel of 119 pseudotyped, multiclade HIV-1 viruses. In the current study, we engineered a bsAb against NHR that also targets CCR5, one of two HIV-1 coreceptors on T cells. This optimized bsAb design further improves neutralization potency and achieves 100% neutralization breadth against the 119-member pseudotyped virus panel, including those resistant to CD4-binding iMab/D5_AR. Considering that nearly all initial HIV-1 infections occur via CCR5-tropic viruses, we expect our redesigned bsAb targeting CCR5 to be an effective prophylactic agent. These findings further support the rationale for pursuing the NHR as a therapeutic target for HIV-1 and lay the groundwork for a new class of engineered broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

Increasing amounts of pesticides are entering the soil ecosystem, yet their potential influence on phage-mediated ARG spread, particularly under conditions of global change, remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed a long-term field experiment simulating pesticide contamination under nitrogen deposition and examined the role of soil phages in ARG spread and host adaptation using metagenomic and viromic sequencing. Combined pesticide markedly elevated the abundance of phage-encoded ARGs under nitrogen deposition. By enhancing phage–host interactions and increasing the co-occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes with ARGs, phages may further facilitate the transfer of ARGs to bacterial hosts, conferring hosts a competitive edge in intensified microbial competition driven by combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition. The phage-driven mechanism was supported by in vitro cultivation experiments, demonstrating that phages harboring ARGs, shaped by long-term combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition, can infect bacterial hosts and confer resistance. Collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of phages in ARG mobilization under environmental stressors, reinforcing the importance of accounting for phage activity in ARG risk assessments under global change.},

  abstract     = {Adhesion G protein–coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are key cell-adhesion molecules involved in many cellular functions and contribute to human diseases, including cancer. aGPCRs are characterized by large extracellular regions that could serve as readily accessible antigens. However, the potential of aGPCRs as targets for biologic therapeutics has not been extensively explored. CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells. We generated a panel of synthetic human antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of CD97, from which we identified an antibody that was efficiently internalized. This antibody binds to all isoforms of human CD97 but not to its close homolog, EMR2. Structure determination by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy revealed that this antibody targets the CD97 GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, whose presence is conserved in aGPCRs, through an unconventional binding mode where it extensively utilizes the light chain framework for antigen recognition. Screening of conjugation methods and payloads resulted in a stable ADC that effectively killed AML and GBM cell lines, as well as patient-derived GBM stem cells, with minimal cytotoxicity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting CD97, as well as the aGPCR GAIN domain in general, and uncovers a previously unrecognized surface that an antibody can utilize for antigen recognition.},

  abstract     = {Granular materials under loading exhibit intermittent avalanches of varying sizes prior to full yielding, a hallmark of natural failure phenomena such as landslides and earthquakes. While continuum models for postyield plastic flow are well established, a unified framework connecting preyield avalanche dynamics to bulk rheology remains lacking. Here, we introduce a birefringent double-shear experiment that enables sustained probing of avalanche statistics and quasistatic flow behavior near the yielding transition. We find that the avalanche regime exhibits rate-weakening behavior, while the plastic regime is rate-independent, resulting in dual rheology under identical local shear rates and indicating hysteresis and mechanical instability. Within a stress-activated framework, we identify the mean normalized stress drop, a measure for mesoscale avalanche size, as a key field variable that bridges the two regimes. Incorporating this variable, we formulate a unified constitutive model that captures the entire yielding transition. These findings establish mesoscale avalanche evolution as a central mechanism underlying granular yielding rheology.},

  abstract     = {Understanding complex living systems requires identifying universal phenomenological laws that are independent of species and molecular-biological details. The Monod equation is a cornerstone of phenomenological microbial growth laws, depicting the growth rate as a saturating function of a single substrate. Because of its similarity in functional form to the Michaelis–Menten equation, cellular growth is often thought to be limited by a single reaction. However, cellular growth generically results from the coordination of thousands of metabolic reactions and diverse intracellular limited resources. Consequently, the mechanistic origins of the Monod equation remain controversial, and its extension has encountered limitations. Here, we propose the global constraint principle for cellular growth: As one nutrient becomes more available, other intracellular resources become limiting, driving transitions to distinct modes of resource allocation. Based on a general framework of constraint-based modeling and its dual formulations, we mathematically prove that, in general, microbial growth kinetics curves are monotonically increasing and concave with respect to nutrient availability. Numerical simulations using genome-scale Escherichia coli models with proteome allocation, molecular crowding, and membrane capacity constraints reproduce these features in a multiphasic manner. In contrast to the original Monod’s growth law, the global constraint principle also captures the dependence of microbial growth on the availability of multiple nutrients, by generalizing the Liebig’s law of the minimum, another phenomenological growth law for higher organisms, into a terraced landscape of diminishing returns. It thus integrates the classical phenomenological laws proposed by Monod and Liebig into a comprehensive theory of cellular growth.},

  abstract     = {Biological tissues exhibit sharp phase transitions where cells collectively transition from disordered to ordered states at critical densities. We demonstrate through bio-chemo-mechanical modeling that this emergent behavior arises from a nonmonotonic dependence on nonlinear extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics: mechanical communication between cells is optimized at intermediate stiffness values where cells can both generate sufficient forces and create strain-stiffened tension bands in the ECM. This balance establishes a critical cell spacing threshold for cell–cell communication ( ∼ 100 to 200 μ m) that is conserved across experimental observations for a broad range of cell types and collagen densities. Our model reveals that the critical stretch ratio at which fibrous networks transition from compliant to strain-stiffening governs this threshold through the formation of tension bands between neighboring cells. These mechanical communication networks drive collective phase transition in tissue condensation when cell density exceeds an effective percolation threshold. Our model explains how microscale cell–ECM interactions control emergent mechanical properties in biological systems and offers insight both into the physics of inhomogeneous materials under active stress, and into potential mechanical interventions for wound healing and fibrotic disorders.},

  abstract     = {Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, is characterized by sickle erythrocytes that are prone to hemolysis, leading to anemia and vaso-occlusion crises. In sickle erythrocytes, hemoglobin aggregation is followed by altered cation permeability and subsequent dehydration. Interventions that restore cation permeability can decrease hemolysis and ameliorate the symptoms associated with SCD. PIEZO1 is a nonselective mechanosensitive cation channel that regulates erythrocyte volume. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO1 cause hemolytic anemia by increasing cation permeability, leading to erythrocyte dehydration in humans and mice. Although PIEZO1 plays a key role in erythrocyte homeostasis, its role in SCD remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the function of the PIEZO1 channel is upregulated in sickle erythrocytes of humans and mice, and this enhancement can be restored through a dietary intervention. We found that PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes resembles that of the GOF mutation causing hemolytic anemia. A diet enriched in the ω -3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid decreases PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes, attenuates hemolysis, and reduces hypoxia-induced sickling. Furthermore, EPA reduces inflammatory markers. We propose that PIEZO1 contributes to the increase in nonselective cationic conductance (i.e., Psickle), which leads to dehydration downstream of hemoglobin polymerization. Our results suggest that reducing PIEZO1 function represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reestablishing normal cation permeability in SCD.},

  abstract     = {Tertiary plastids derived from diatoms in “dinotom” dinoflagellates offer a rare view of organellogenesis in action, while the genomic and metabolic processes underlying their conversion remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis of two dinotoms at different plastidial levels: Durinskia capensis at the kleptoplastidy state, alongside its kleptoplastid-source diatom Nitzschia captiva , and its close relative Durinskia kwazulunatalensis at an early permanent state. We show that in both dinotoms, the diatom nucleus retains high transcriptional autonomy, but its expression profile is plastid biased, signaling early host influence. In contrast, only D. kwazulunatalensis exhibits striking signs of genomic reconfiguration in the diatom nucleus: intron insertions, increased guanine (G) and cytosine (C) content, and growing nucleotide similarity to host transcripts. These shifts suggest an incipient nucleomorph-like transformation. Metabolically, only D. kwazulunatalensis expresses a complete hexose phosphate export pathway, suggesting deeper metabolic integration, while both species retain simpler carbohydrate transport routes. Additionally, we propose that diatom karyokinesis might be controlled by a dual mechanism via suppression of key transcription factors at the G1-S checkpoint and nitrate availability. Together, our findings reveal a continuum of plastid integration degrees, from temporary organelle theft to genomic accommodation and metabolic codependence. Dinotoms thus serve not only as evolutionary artifacts but as living laboratories, illuminating how kleptoplastids inch toward permanence.},

  abstract     = {Endogenous pathogens can constrain virulence to ensure survival in the host. Pathogenic state can be controlled by metabolic responses to the prevailing microenvironment; however, the coupling and effector mechanisms are not well understood. Flux through the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway can modulate virulence of the oral pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis , and here we show that this is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent differential partitioning of gingipain proteases. The OCM essential precursor pABA inhibits the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and consequently relieves inhibition of its cognate kinase, Ptk1. We found that in the absence of pABA, reduced Ptk1 kinase activity blocks extracellular release of gingipains. Surface retention of gingipains confers resistance to neutrophil mobilization and killing, and virulence in animal models of disease is elevated. Reciprocally, Ptk1 and gingipains are required for maximal flux through OCM, and Ptk1 can phosphorylate the OCM pathway enzymes GlyA and GcvT. Further, ALP, an alkaline phosphatase involved in synthesis of DHPPP, which combines with pABA to make DHP, is phosphorylated and activated by Ptk1. We propose, therefore, that although the primary function of Ptk1 is to maintain OCM balance, it mechanistically couples metabolism with tunable pathogenic potential through directing the location of proteolytic virulence factors.},

  abstract     = {T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen among vastly outnumbering noncognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen–TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multithread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multithread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.},

We report here our results of a follow-up analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a DS interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic DS candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, with the former being the second most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify, in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, a tentative feature ( S / N ∼ 2 ) indicative of the smoking gun signature of DSs: the He II λ 1640 absorption line. In view of ALMA’s recent identification of a probable O III nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated DS is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations, it would imply a DS embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of DSs, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.},

Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that BVRA physically and genetically interacts with nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor-like 2 (NRF2), a major transcriptional regulator of cellular redox signaling. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that BVRA and NRF2 coordinate the expression of antioxidant genes, many of which are typically dysregulated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, this noncanonical BVRA–NRF2 axis controls an essential pathway of redox signaling in neuroprotection.

Apoptosis is one example of a process that propagates through the cytoplasm via trigger waves. Curiously, in some contexts, like synaptic pruning, apoptotic caspase activation is confined to specific subcellular regions. We hypothesized that at junctions between a thin cytoplasmic extension, like a dendritic spine, and a thicker one, like a dendrite, trigger wave propagation may be blocked even though diffusion is not, as a result of the general properties of trigger waves and bistable systems. This hypothesis was explored theoretically through modeling studies and dimensional arguments, which confirmed that trigger wave compartmentalization was possible and that the critical channel width required for compartmentalization was likely to be biologically relevant. These predictions were then tested experimentally with undiluted Xenopus egg extracts that were induced to undergo apoptosis. We found that channels that are less than a few microns in diameter are small enough to compartmentalize apoptosis, and that the critical width is inversely proportional to trigger wave speed. Thus, cellular projections and tubules can allow for the compartmentalization of biochemical states within a spatially continuous cytoplasm, a fundamental yet previously overlooked mechanism for controlling biochemical signaling and cellular functions.},

We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a long-standing ambiguity by supporting a correspondence between macaque ML and human FFA and between AL and more anterior temporal cortex in humans. This result is consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.},

  abstract     = {Neurons process information by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs along their dendrites. Understanding the computational principles underlying neuronal information processing requires a reliable measure of synaptic conductance dynamics that accurately represents the input sources before signal integration and processing. Prevailing approaches to measuring synaptic conductances typically employ a voltage clamp at the soma of a neuron and assume the neuron as an isopotential point when processing electrical signals. However, owing to the presence of the well-known space clamp effect, the measurement of synaptic conductances through these methods often leads to significant errors, impeding the elucidation of dendritic signal features and subsequent signal integration processes. To address this issue, here we first develop a two-step clamp method at the soma that separately recovers the mean and time constant information of local synaptic conductance on the dendrite with high accuracy when a neuron receives a single synaptic input. Furthermore, under in vivo conditions of multiple synaptic inputs, we propose an intercept method to extract effective net excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from measurements of synaptic currents at the soma. Both methods are grounded in mathematical perturbation analyses of a conductance-based passive cable model and are validated across multiple biologically detailed multicompartment neuron models with active channels, including Purkinje neuron, pyramidal neuron, and fast-spiking interneuron. Results demonstrate that our methods effectively circumvent the space clamp effect, offering reliable means to assess the role of measured conductances and synaptic activity in neuronal information processing.},

  abstract     = {Hyperuniformity and giant number fluctuations represent opposite ends in a spectrum of statistical correlations found in physical systems outside of thermal equilibrium. Dynamic phase transitions exhibit critical points that are hyperuniform, while anomalously large fluctuations are often quoted as a hallmark of active matter. Here, we show that the apparently disordered state of active nematic defects exhibits suppression of fluctuations on scales as large as the system size, reminiscent of what is seen for ordered lattices. Modeling the nematic defects in terms of continuum densities, we show that their distribution becomes asymptotically hyperuniform in the limit where their proliferation is solely driven by activity, rather than by thermal fluctuations. When both effects are at play, the resultant hyperuniform structure is limited to a finite range of length scales, ℓ < ℓ × , with ℓ × → ∞ as thermal unbinding is suppressed. The system of active nematic defects can therefore be said to possess hidden order across scales provided ℓ is comparable to the system size. This organization is most pronounced when considering the subpopulation of either the positive or the negative defects, illustrating lack of multihyperuniformity. Our experimental findings are supported by hydrodynamic theory and agent-based simulations, which further allow elucidating the role of both creation/annihilation of defect pairs and of their mutual repulsion and attraction in achieving hyperuniformity.},

To further expand our understanding of structure–function relationships in this complex multiphase material system and provide a roadmap for transitioning this technology from a simple proof-of-concept to a viable large-scale energy storage alternative, we report insights into the nanoscale connectivity of the electrode’s conductive carbon network, explore different electrolyte compositions and material integration strategies, and highlight opportunities for device scaling. Through the use of FIB-SEM tomography, the electrode’s percolating fractal-like nano-carbon black network has been visualized at the nanoscale, providing insights into the theoretical energy storage capacity of this material. To reduce the required times for the production of functional electrodes, we also present a cast-in electrolyte approach, where centimeter-thick electrodes could be produced without the need for postcuring steps. In these prototypes, device performance scales linearly with electrode thickness and cell count, and a simple analytical model was developed to explain these scaling phenomena. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative ionic and organic electrolytes further contribute to improved electrochemical behavior, with the fabricated designs ultimately achieving a 10-fold increase in supercapacitor energy density compared to previous designs. Finally, we were able to fabricate a 12 V, 50 F supercapacitor module and a 9 V arch prototype that integrate energy storage into load-bearing architectural elements. These functional prototypes highlight the potential for real-time structural health monitoring, while demonstrating the potential of our ecˆ3 technology for the production of a scalable, high-voltage concrete energy-storing infrastructure.},

The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.},

Cryogenic electron microscopy analysis showed that 14-8 targeted the well-characterized central stem epitope, whereas 15-1 bound to a linear epitope spanning the HA1/HA2 junction. Additionally, while some porcine and human bnAbs targeted the central stem epitope via convergent molecular signatures, our results revealed a pig-specific recurring binding motif.

  abstract     = {One of the reproductive barriers between diverging populations during formation of a new species is the sterility of their hybrids. The Prdm9- driven hybrid male sterility of Mus musculus musculus × Mus musculus domesticus hybrids depends on the interaction between PRDM9, a histone methyltransferase that determines the positions of meiotic recombination hotspots, and an as yet unknown X-linked genetic factor within the Hybrid sterility X2 ( Hstx2 ) locus. Here, we report that the Mir465 microRNA (miRNA) gene cluster is the predicted Hstx2 hybrid sterility factor. We show that removal of the Mir465 genes restores the fertility of sterile hybrids and improves meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Mir465 knockout also restores spermatogenesis in sterile chromosomal translocation carriers, demonstrating that Mir465 acts as a meiotic checkpoint that can be activated independently of Prdm9 intersubspecific incompatibility. Furthermore, the Mir465 knockout increases the global recombination rate in hybrids and in parental Mus m. domesticus mice. This demonstrates that Mir465 is responsible for the phenotypes of the two overlapping genetic loci, the Hstx2 engaged in fertility of hybrids and the Meiotic recombination 1 ( Meir1 ) controlling the recombination rate. The finding of enlarged Mir465 clusters in all European Mus m. musculus samples tested and the identification of differentially expressed targets suggest that the reproductive barrier between the two subspecies is sensitive to copy number variation of Mir465 genes. Together, the underdominant interaction between Prdm9 and Mir465 provides a rare example of Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility in hybrids of closely related species, making it accessible for further analysis at the molecular level.},

A recent two-state model proposed for high-pressure potassium, which exhibits a similar melting anomaly, attributes this behavior to changes in the distribution of non-nuclear localized electrons (electrides), resulting in distinct liquid phases. To test this hypothesis for sodium, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine its atomic dynamics and electronic properties under high pressure. Our results reveal no discontinuities in atomic or electronic transport properties, nor any evidence of multiple inherent structural forms. Furthermore, the electronic screening potential governing liquid structure remains largely unchanged above 50 GPa. Instead, we find that the key parameter responsible for the melting anomaly arises from differences in the average number of electrons per non-nuclear maximum, which affects the relative packing densities of the liquid and solid phases.},

  abstract     = {With the learning from living protein polymerization in nature, achieving living/controlled supramolecular assembly of biopolymers such as proteins in vitro is a longstanding challenge for material design. Herein, we provide a thiol-regulated interfacial protein aggregation (TRIPA) for unfolded protein systems with typical living polymerization features. By triggering globule proteins into the unfolded state through a reversible exchange reaction of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl agents (R-SH), protein monomers are partially unfolded and assembled at the air–water/solid–water interface (AWI/SWI) through the entropy-driven adsorption and conformation transition. The process could be well repeated over time to form a two-dimensional (2D) nanofilm at the interface by following a pathway of monomer-oligomer-2D assembly. Similar to living polymerization, the film thickness exhibited a linear increase with the assembly conversion ratio of the monomers. With the stepwise addition of native protein into the reaction system, the thickness periodically increased in a linear manner. Such living/controlled supramolecular polymerization (LCSP) of protein at the interface leads to the synthesis of a nanofilm with well-defined flat morphology, ultrahigh modulus, and nano- to macroscale controlled thickness. The resultant protein nanofilm could then attach onto a variety of flexible and rigid material surfaces to produce a stable structural color coating. Compelling evidence in the present work thus underlines a demonstration of LCSP of biopolymers in vitro. It may hold a solid impact by opening a window for living/controlled polymerization of versatile biospecies such as proteins, saccharides, nucleic acids, and cells.},

Four metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed to produce one of four oxygenated precursors of BTEX—phenol, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, or 2,5-xylenol—from glucose or glycerol. After in situ two-phase extractive fermentation of the individual engineered strains using isopropyl myristate (IPM) as the organic solvent, the organic phase containing one of the oxygenated precursors was separated from the aqueous phase and subjected to distinct chemical deoxygenation reactions to reduce the precursor to the corresponding BTEX compound. This modular approach, based on the compatible organic solvent, streamlines biotransformation and consecutive chemical derivatization, providing a practical and viable route to sustainable BTEX production. The platform is extensible and provides a generalizable framework for integrating biosynthesis with chemical deoxygenation in hybrid bioprocessing.},

  abstract     = {Arguably, the most fundamental question in population ecology is what drives patterns in the abundance of populations? Small rodents exhibiting regular multiannual cycles in abundance have long been a test bed for addressing this question. The prevailing orthodoxy, the predation hypothesis, contends that nonmigratory, specialist predators are necessary, and specialist and generalist predators, combined, are both necessary and sufficient, for causing population cycles. Thus, variations in survival, from predation, are the key drivers of the cycles. However, this, and other competing theories, have hitherto lacked supportive demographic evidence and hence a solid evidential foundation. Here, we provide such evidence, analyzing 10 y of monthly data from a cyclic field vole population. We find, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, that recruitment, not survival, varied substantially from phase to phase in the cycles, made the major contribution to variations in population growth rate, and had cycle-phase-specific negative delayed density dependence. These results, their consistency with what is known from other systems, and the weak demographic foundations of the predation hypothesis, together suggest recruitment, specifically breeding-season length, not predation, as the cycles’ driving force. They therefore suggest that re-evaluation of the importance of the various determinants of population abundances, more generally, may be necessary.},

However, the regulatory mechanisms and functional consequences of newly identified lysine acylation modifications in cancer therapy remain to be elucidated. Here, we established diverse preclinical tumor models resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and focused on histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as it exhibited more pronounced alterations compared to other acylations. Next, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 as a key regulator responsible for the resistance-associated decrease in crotonylation levels. Furthermore, integrated crotonylomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling, supplemented by gene manipulation studies, revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance resulted from transcriptional suppression of HNF1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were regulated by reduced histone H3 lysine 56 crotonylation. Importantly, through pharmacological screening, we identified a histone decrotonylase inhibitor that enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity by activating epigenetic reprogramming through the selective upregulation of histone Kcr levels across multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism driven by crotonylation that contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, highlighting the potential of modulating crotonylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.},

  abstract     = {Site-specific DNA binding by proteins is critical for regulating transcriptional activity and cell fate decision. However, identifying proteins bound to specific genomic regions (e.g., promoter or enhancer regions) remains challenging. To address this, we developed a chemical epigenetic tool, named Site-specific noncanonical amino acid-mediated capture of protein (SCOPE), incorporating a photo-crosslinking amino acid into a nuclease-deficient dCas9 mutant. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying SCOPE enable the capture of proteins bound to, in theory, any genomic location, facilitating the study of the cell context–dependent DNA–protein interactions. Using SCOPE, we identified the OCT4/SOX2/CARHSP1 complex binding to the NANOG promoter to maintain pluripotency in hPSCs. During ectoderm differentiation, ZIC2 acts as a competitive inhibitor, binding the same promoter region to downregulate NANOG expression and promote differentiation. Additionally, SCOPE identified that ZNF8 binds to the distal regulatory region of OCT4 to maintain naïve pluripotency.

  abstract     = {Climate can vary spatially and temporally and is becoming increasingly unpredictable due to climate change. It can have a large impact on host–parasite interactions and investigating this effect is vital both for understanding current parasite distribution and epidemiology, and predicting how this will change in the future. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether temperature and precipitation have an overall effect on parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals. This is a phylogenetically controlled quantitative synthesis to assess parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals across contrasting temperatures and precipitation. We found large variation in the effect of temperature on parasite prevalence, precipitation on parasite prevalence, and temperature on infection intensity. This provides robust quantitative evidence against the controversial “warmer sicker world” hypothesis. There was no effect of climate on parasitism, irrespective of whether the parasite was an endoparasite or ectoparasite, or across different parasite lifecycles. Although some host and parasite taxa were understudied, we found no consistent taxonomic patterns. Importantly, we revealed large gaps in the literature, including the relationship between humidity, prevalence, and infection intensity. Ectoparasites and reptile hosts were also very underrepresented, and deserve further study. Focusing future research on these gaps will help to confirm whether certain types of host–parasite interactions are more or less sensitive to changes in climate, with implications for conservation.},

  abstract     = {The trans -Golgi network (TGN) is a crucial sorting station in the secretory pathway, where adaptor protein (AP) complexes ensure selective cargo packaging into transport vesicles. However, the complete repertoire of cargoes and regulators associated with individual AP complexes remains poorly defined. Intriguingly, AP-4-mediated TGN export operates independently of clathrin, suggesting the involvement of uncharacterized accessory factors in vesicle biogenesis. To address these gaps, we developed an in vitro vesicle formation assay using wild-type HeLa cells or cells deficient in AP1γ1 or AP4ε, reconstituting their roles in packaging their known clients, Vangl2 and ATG9A, respectively. Coupling this assay with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, we mapped distinct cargo profiles for AP-1 (which buds from the TGN and ARF1-positive endosomes) and AP-4, identifying the 45 kDa calcium-binding protein (CAB45) as an AP-1-dependent cargo and the Type-1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) as an AP-4-dependent cargo. Additionally, we uncovered PRRC1 and WDR44 as cytosolic regulators essential for AP-4-mediated TGN export. Our study advances the mechanistic understanding of AP-1 and AP-4 in secretory trafficking and provides a robust strategy to systematically identify cargo clients and accessory factors for specific adaptor complexes.},

  abstract     = {Approximately 58 million people worldwide are believed to be infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of chronic liver diseases. Hepacivirus ratti strain rn-1, which was discovered from Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and designated Norway rat hepacivirus 1 (NRHV1), shares similar properties with HCV in terms of genetic homology, target cell tropism, pathogenicity, and the immune response. In vivo infection systems for NRHV1 will help overcome the challenges in HCV research for vaccine development. However, the virological characteristics of NRHV1, such as the mechanisms of cell entry, remain largely unexplored, in part owing to a paucity of cell culture systems for NRHV1. Here, we identified the host factors that facilitate NRHV1 entry by profiling the gene expression of two cell lines with different susceptibilities to NRHV1 infection. NRHV1 employs rodent orthologues of HCV entry factors, including scavenger receptor class BI, CD81, and occludin, and utilizes claudin-3 (CLDN3) but not claudin-1. The expression of rat and mouse, but not human, CLDN3 facilitates the entry of NRHV1 into murine cell lines that are nonsusceptible to NRHV1 infection. The host-specific cell entry of CLDN3 is determined by two amino acid residues, Ile 44 and Trp 46 , in extracellular loop 1. These findings suggest that CLDN3 serves as an entry factor for rat hepacivirus.},

The separation between the viscous scale (the Kolmogorov scale) and the molecular mean free path ostensibly justifies a macroscopic description of reactive turbulence via the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. However, here we use molecular-level simulations to demonstrate that exothermic bimolecular reactions can cause the NS description of turbulence to break down in the near-continuum regime. Sufficiently energetic heat-releasing reactive collisions strongly distort the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution function, modifying not only the macroscopic chemical rate law but the kinetic-energy-transfer processes as well. This translational nonequilibrium ultimately introduces significant departures from the NS description in the kinetic energy spectra at scales orders of magnitude larger than both the molecular mean free path and the Kolmogorov length scale. These departures prove substantial enough to meaningfully alter integrated quantities, including the overall turbulence kinetic energy itself.},

What remains unresolved is how these processes interconnect and the wider implications for the cell in the restoration of homeostasis when heme concentrations change. We demonstrate a wide-ranging and coordinated response to changes in intracellular heme in HEK293 cells through a network of complementary mechanisms that extend well beyond the direct regulation of heme biosynthesis and degradation. These responses connect changes in heme homeostasis to mitochondrial function, including core metabolic processes such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as to enzymes involved in the control and storage of iron. Our findings demonstrate far-reaching consequences to perturbations of heme homeostasis and provide insights into the complexity of the cellular hemome.},

  abstract     = {There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.},

  abstract     = {The ideal delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) to specific sites requires evading immune clearance and selectively binding target cells. Wrapping NPs in cell-derived membranes has shown promise in improving targeted delivery, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Protein corona (PC) formation on NPs can significantly alter their biological identity to influence biodistribution, making its characterization on membrane-wrapped NPs (MWNPs) and unwrapped NPs crucial. In this study, we compared MWNPs incorporating membranes derived from megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 cells, which can accumulate in bone marrow (BM) and preferentially bind hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with unwrapped NPs. We investigated differences in PC composition, macrophage uptake, target cell uptake, and biodistribution in wild type (WT) mice and knockout mice that have low or absent expression of different opsonin proteins. In vitro, MWNPs with a PC exhibited increased target cell uptake and decreased macrophage uptake compared to unwrapped NPs with a PC. Proteomics revealed apolipoprotein B as the dominant opsonin on both NP types after incubation in mouse, bovine, or human serum, with other proteins like complement, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins also being present. Biodistribution studies indicated a complex interplay between the PC and targeting/clearance, where complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G adsorption on MWNPs led to macrophage clearance but also enabled HSPC targeting. Meanwhile, apolipoprotein E adsorption facilitated hepatocyte clearance but reduced immune cell uptake in the liver. Future research on PCs could determine whether these mechanisms are generalizable to other types of MWNPs, potentially revealing strategies to enhance their effectiveness as delivery systems.},

Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this, we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show that i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality. Overall, our findings illustrate the utility of the G. mellonella model system in conjunction with established in vivo models in studying infectious disease progression and treatment.},

Recycling REEs from industrial waste provides a sustainable alternative to mining, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impacts. The mainstay approaches for REE recovery, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods, can be inefficient, consuming high energy and generating large aqueous and acid waste streams. Here, we introduce flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl 2 ) as an efficient method for REE separation and recovery by capitalizing on the free energies of formation (ΔG form ) of the metal chlorides and the boiling points of those metal chlorides. FJH-Cl 2 enables high-purity (>90%) and high-yield (>90%) REE recovery from waste magnets in a single step. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis show that this process reduces the number of steps by 3× while reducing energy consumption by 87%, greenhouse gas emissions by 84%, and operating costs by 54% while eliminating water and acid use by 100% compared to traditional methods. This offers an environmentally friendly and economically viable pathway for sustainable REE recycling and recovery.},

Based on the knowledge of aluminum speciation, we elucidate four water interaction mechanisms in SAPOs, including Brønsted-acid interaction, coordination, reversible/irreversible hydrolysis, and capillary condensation. Contrary to conventional wisdom attributing SAPO degradation to Al-O-P hydrolysis, we clarify that desilication dominates structural collapse, establishing Si environments as catalyst durability descriptors.

  abstract     = {Nature offers a remarkable diversity of nanomaterials that have extraordinary functional and structural properties. Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green color. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris , develop as woven fibrillar structures, in contrast to the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibers, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue coloration. Our findings not only introduce a variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.},

  abstract     = {MEPAN ( M itochondrial E noyl CoA Reductase P rotein- A ssociated N eurodegeneration) is an early-onset movement disorder characterized by ataxia, dysarthria, and optic atrophy. Here, we report the creation of a mouse model of MEPAN with patient-similar compound heterozygous mutations in the Mecr gene. The MEPAN mouse recapitulates the major hallmarks of MEPAN, including a movement disorder, optic neuropathy, defects in protein lipoylation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the brain. MECR catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), and the mechanism by which loss of mtFASII leads to neurological disease is unknown. LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of Mecr mutant cerebella identified loss of subunits of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and subunits of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) complex. Native gels revealed altered OXPHOS complex and supercomplex formation and changes in binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to mitochondrial complexes. These results demonstrate that MECR plays a key role in the acylation of ACP which is necessary for ACP-LYRM-mediated supercomplex modulation and ISC biogenesis and suggest unique pathways for therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {The horizontal distribution and vertical stratification of tree crowns can affect light interception and tree growth, thus driving forest productivity and carbon storage. However, how canopy structure is affected by tree diversity and thus can mediate its effects on productivity remains unclear. Using 4-y consecutive unmanned aerial vehicle-borne light detection and ranging and ground-based growth measurements from 482 plots and 38,088 trees, 11 to 15 y after planting, within a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in southeast China, we found that increased canopy structural complexity consistently explains the positive effects of tree diversity on productivity. Species complementarity was the main mediator of diversity-enhanced productivity, with the positive complementarity effects strengthening over time. Our study underscores the importance of establishing multispecies forest communities with complex canopy structure to maximize productivity and carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is altering the timing of species’ life-cycle events (i.e., phenology), but the rates of phenological shifts vary across taxa. These mismatches in phenological response may disrupt interactions between interdependent species, such as plants and their pollinators, which may lead to reduced plant reproduction via pollen limitation and thus contribute to secondary extinction risks for plants. However, secondary extinction risk is rarely assessed under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we used ca. 15,000 crowdsourced specimen records of Viola species and their solitary bee pollinators, spanning 120 y across the eastern United States, and integrated climate data, phenological information, and species distribution models to quantify the risk of secondary plant extinction associated with phenological mismatch with their bee pollinators. We further examined geographical patterns in secondary extinction risk for plants and explored how their interactions between plants and generalist versus specialist pollinators influence such risk. Secondary local extinction risk of Viola spp. increases with latitude, indicating that future climate change will pose a greater threat to plant–bee pollinator networks at northern latitudes. Additionally, the sensitivity of secondary local extinction risk to phenological mismatch with both generalist and specialist bee pollinators varies by latitude, with specialist bees showing a sharper decline at higher latitudes. Our findings demonstrate that existing conservation priorities based solely on primary extinction risk directly caused by climate change may be insufficient to support self-sustaining populations of plants. Thus, incorporating secondary extinction risk resulting from ecological mismatches between plants and pollinators into future global conservation frameworks should be carefully considered.},

However, the function of these connections is unknown. To test whether CA2-CA1 connections might facilitate the interaction of social and episodic memories, we used models of behaving mice and in vitro electrophysiology that allow prior activation of CA2 by either novel social interaction or electrical stimulation before inhibitory avoidance training or induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1. We show that social novelty promotes consolidation of CA1-associated memory, which was blocked by the selective chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting CA2 neurons. In both cases, CA2 priming was time-dependent, involved direct CA2-CA1 connections, increased expression of plasticity protein protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), and promoted associativity via synaptic tagging and capture. Taken together, CA2-CA1 connections can significantly impact CA1 plasticity and memory consolidation. The inclusion of CA2 into hippocampal circuitry and function broadens the role of the hippocampus as an integrative memory hub.},

We fill this gap, utilizing 5 y of data on over seven million visits to veterinary practices across the United Kingdom. Leveraging within-city variation in daily monitor-measured air pollution levels, we find that increases in fine particulate matter (i.e., PM 2.5 ) are associated with significant increases in the number of vet visits for both cats and dogs. In aggregate, these estimates suggest that reducing ambient PM 2.5 levels to a maximum of 5 mg per cubic meter as recommended by the World Health Organization would result in a 0.7 to 2.5% reduction in vet visits.},

  abstract     = {Effective conservation genomics of endangered species requires realistic understanding of the fitness consequences caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in declining populations. We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution. By linking genotype to phenotype via advanced molecular biology tools in a non-model species of conservation concern, this study highlights the need to fully integrate genomics and molecular experimental approaches in modern conservation biology.},

Experiments on a propeller-driven underwater vehicle and numerical simulations reveal thrust reversal—a phenomenon where clockwise propeller rotation leads to backward motion—in the approximate range 1.3 ≲ Re ≲ 150 under specific conditions. Notably, counterclockwise rotation consistently results in backward motion. Simulations reveal that this behavior arises when centrifugal suction, an inward force along the axis caused by radial outward flow from the propeller’s rotation, dominates over fluid backward acceleration, the primary thrust mechanism at high Re . These findings provide critical insights into the unique dynamics of the intermediate Re regime and inform the design of efficient propulsion systems for miniature aquatic robots.},

The molecular basis for such kinetic coupling is incompletely understood, but one potential mechanism is through elongation rate–dependent alternative folding pathways of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). To search for RNA structures in nascent pre-mRNA, we modified Sequencing of Psoralen Crosslinked, Ligated And Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) [J. G. Ashley Aw et al. , Mol. Cell 62 , 603–617 (2016)] for use with C hromatin A ssociated R NA. We applied this method called Chromatin Associated RNA (CAR)-SPLASH to cells expressing wild-type and slow mutant RNA polymerase II and identified >3,000 intramolecular RNA duplexes of which >400 are proximal to splice sites. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) disruption of several such duplexes that sequester splice sites has a major impact on AS outcomes, even though the ASOs do not directly disrupt splice sites. ASO disruption of these regulatory elements that we designate “RNA kinetic switches” modified AS of NISCH Exon 18, GAK Exon 7, and MEGF8 Exon 14 in a way that depends on the rate of transcription elongation. We propose that these switches mediate kinetic coupling via the effects of transcription speed on folding of nascent RNA structures that modulate AS and that many nascent RNA structures can thereby serve as targets for splice-modifying ASOs.},

Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to assemble repressive chromatin. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3 deposition is regulated by the H3K36 methyltransferase ASH1 and components of constitutive heterochromatin including the H3K9me3-binding protein HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1). Hypoacetylated histones are a defining feature of both constitutive heterochromatin and PcG-repressed chromatin, but how histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to normal H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression within PcG-repressed chromatin is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen to identify HDACs required for repression of PRC2-methylated genes. In the absence of HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1 (HDA-1), PRC2-methylated genes were activated and H3K27me3 was depleted from typical PRC2-targeted regions. At constitutive heterochromatin, HDA-1 deficient cells displayed reduced H3K9me3, hyperacetylation, and aberrant enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. CHROMODOMAIN PROTEIN-2 (CDP-2) is required to target HDA-1 to constitutive heterochromatin and is also required for normal H3K27me3 patterns. Patterns of aberrant H3K27me3 were distinct in isogenic ∆ hda-1 strains, suggesting that loss of HDA-1 causes stochastic or progressive epigenome dysfunction. To test this, we constructed a new Δhda-1 strain and performed a laboratory “aging” experiment. Deletion of hda-1 led to progressive epigenome decay over hundreds of nuclear divisions. Together, our data indicate that HDA-1 is a critical regulator of epigenome stability in N. crassa.},

  abstract     = {Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) have been identified to associate with various neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. Damage to MLVs can exacerbate the pathological progression of these diseases and significantly impede therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, targeted repair of the damaged MLVs has emerged as an innovative strategy for treating these central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study, we find that inorganic Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles, rather than conventional endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), can repair the damaged MLVs to restore their structure and functions. These nanoparticles not only promote the growth and development of lymphatic vessels but also enhance the drainage capacity of impaired MLVs, thereby facilitating the transport of immune cells and macromolecules through these vessels. Unlike the conventional repair of damaged MLVs, this is an instance where inorganic nanoparticles have been explored to stimulate the expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3, thereby promoting the structural and functional recovery of these vessels. The enhanced drainage function of MLVs mediated by Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles significantly alleviates the symptoms of pre-formed fibrils (PFFs)-induced Parkinson’s disease in mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that inorganic nanoparticles can promote the growth and development of meningeal lymphatics like VEGF-C, providing a cost-effective and innovative strategy for repairing damaged MLVs to boost the therapeutic efficacy of CNS diseases.},

  abstract     = {Modularity among traits is thought to drive morphological evolution and diversification, with more modular species often showing greater morphological disparity and faster evolutionary rates. However, recent studies suggest this pattern is not universal, as higher integration can sometimes be linked to faster rates of evolution. In adaptive radiation, modularity likely facilitates morphological divergence, but its specific role in trait diversification within these events remains uncertain. Antarctic icefishes (Perciformes: Notothenioidei) have undergone adaptive radiation in the frigid Southern Ocean, yet the role of modularity in their craniofacial evolution remains poorly understood. Emerging from a common ancestor 22 Mya, these fishes developed unique morpho-physiological adaptations, such as antifreeze glycoproteins, that contributed to their evolutionary success, but the contribution of cranial modularity to their diversification is still unexplored. Here, we analyze skull shape across 172 perciform species using micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to investigate the tempo and mode of skull evolution in 80 notothenioids versus 92 perciform relatives. Notothenioids exhibit considerable cranial shape diversity, with skull shapes ranging from short to long faces. Fast rates of skull shape evolution occurred in smaller subclades following the emergence of cranial elongation, a derived trait within notothenioids. They also exhibit elevated evolutionary modularity relative to their perciform relatives, with reduced covariation among skeletal elements over time, likely corresponding with Miocene cooling events and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We propose that greater phenotypic modularity in notothenioid skulls represents a pivotal innovation, facilitating their evolutionary response to new ecological opportunities in the Antarctic.},

  abstract     = {The homeostatic link between the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitophagy plays a significant role in how cells respond to various physiological and pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia–reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.},

  abstract     = {Changes in bacterial colony morphology are common during chronic human infections and are thought to provide a survival advantage. In the human pathogen Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB), a unidirectional transition from a smooth (MAB S ) to rough (MAB R ) morphotype frequently occurs during chronic infection. This transition has profound clinical implications, as MAB R induces a heightened proinflammatory response, contributing to increased morbidity. To better understand this phenomenon, we used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes essential for the survival of MAB S and MAB R . Our analysis revealed distinct genetic requirements for growth in vitro, including several genes involved in responding to environmental stresses. Notably, some of these uniquely essential genes are therapeutic targets in mycobacteria. In a murine infection model, the divergence in essential gene profiles between MAB S and MAB R was even more pronounced, driven partly by the differing host immune responses elicited by each morphotype. These findings demonstrate that the transition from a smooth to rough morphotype not only impacts MAB’s survival strategies but also highlights the importance of considering morphotype-specific genetic and functional adaptations when developing therapeutic approaches. Our work underscores the critical need to incorporate morphotype conversion into the prioritization of drug targets, as targeting morphotype-specific vulnerabilities could improve treatment outcomes for infections caused by this pathogen.},

We found that specific anthracycline variants selectively disrupt chromatin looping anchors by interfering with CTCF binding, suggesting an additional therapeutic mechanism of anthracycline drugs targeting the 3D genome. Hi-C experiments in K562 cells treated with anthracycline drugs revealed widespread disruption of 3D chromatin organization, including altered long-range regulation at the Myc locus. Furthermore, AML patients treated with anthracycline drugs exhibited changes in chromatin structures near possible looping anchors, which were associated with distinct clinical outcomes. Together, our findings indicate that anthracycline drugs function as potent and selective epigenomic modulators, with the capacity to further target the 3D genome to exert anticancer effects, highlighting their potential for personalized therapy in tumors with aberrant 3D chromatin architecture.},

  abstract     = {One of the most fascinating mysteries in the field of origins of life concerns the driving force that led to the selection of today’s 20 universal L -alpha amino acids in biology. An essential aspect of life’s emergence involves the formation of compartments, which offer encapsulation for target molecules and provide protection from hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Thus, polymers capable of assembly may have had a chemical evolutionary advantage over polymers that lacked this ability. We postulated that primordial peptide assembly could be one of the driving forces that led to the chemical selection of alpha amino acids in life today. To test this hypothesis, we generated depsipeptides, oligomers composed of ester bonds and peptide bonds that form readily under mild drying conditions, as model prebiotic peptides. However, it is unknown whether depsipeptides form assemblies in an aqueous environment similarly to peptides and proteins. To test the hypothesis that depsipeptides with alpha backbones will form assemblies more readily than beta backbones, we synthesized depsipeptides using a matrix of eight alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and six alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids. The reaction products were analyzed by microscopy and a physical stability analyzer to study assembly formation as well as various analytical techniques for chemical analysis. Our results demonstrate assembly formation in depsipeptide systems containing hydrophobic hydroxy acids and indicate that depsipeptide assemblies containing alpha hydroxy acid backbones are significantly more stable than beta analogs. Overall, our results offer an assembly-driven mode of selection for the alpha backbone in present-day biology.},

We created numerous electrical models with diverse firing patterns. By analyzing these models, we identified intricate relationships between model parameters and electrical features. Our findings show that neuronal activity is often influenced by multiple biophysical model parameters, in a nonadditive (i.e. synergistic) fashion. When comparing this with single-cell RNAseq data, we found a contrasting structure: gene expression profiles were dominated by redundancy, reflecting differences in regulatory constraints and sampling diversity. This research sheds light on the complex links between biophysical parameters and neuronal phenotypes.},

  abstract     = {As climate change makes agricultural production shocks more frequent and severe, it is vital to understand their effect on farmer welfare, land use, and deforestation. Theoretically, a change in agricultural productivity could increase or decrease deforestation by changing demand for agricultural land and/or through the consumption of forests as a coping strategy. This paper uses the introduction of a crop pest to sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the effect of a negative agricultural productivity shock on deforestation. Using primary household data, we first find that farmers who were exposed to higher levels of fall armyworm saw substantial decreases in yield and food security. Using estimates of fall armyworm suitability in conjunction with machine-learning models of maize yields and deforestation, we find that the introduction of the fall armyworm induced a doubling of the deforestation rate in Zambia in the 3 y following the outbreak. This increase was driven both by increased agricultural land expansion and increased charcoal production as a coping strategy. These responses vary substantially over space. More remote areas experienced 23% lower FAW-induced deforestation compared with the sample average, suggesting that farmers with access to maize and charcoal markets may have increased deforestation as a response. Wealthier areas were also less likely to deforest in response to FAW pressure. In sum, our results suggest that negative agricultural productivity shocks may lead to a negative climate feedback, with farmers engaging in emissions-increasing strategies in response.},

Through interaction mapping, we show that DIORA1 binds three distinct modules of MRCK kinases, including the conserved kinase inhibitory motif, C1-PH, and citron homology domains. DIORA1 knockdown in human cells altered cellular phosphorylation patterns and reduced phosphorylation of known MRCK targets. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses revealed upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition genes and proteins, and functional analyses confirmed increased cell invasion, following knockdown of DIORA1. Together, these findings identify the autoimmunity-associated DIORA1 protein as an interactor of MRCK kinases and a regulator of cell motility.},

  abstract     = {Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains with explicit Coulomb interactions, also including counterions and salt ions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.},

Streamflow decline since the 1990s, driven by frequent and prolonged droughts, is 76% more intense than the 16th-century drought—the closest historical analogue. This drying exceeds natural variability, highlighting the dominant role of anthropogenic factors. Despite CMIP6 models projecting increased streamflow under warming scenarios, the recent decline indicates complexities associated with future water availability projections. Our findings underscore the urgent need to examine the interactions among the factors that control summer monsoon precipitation, including large−scale climate variability and anthropogenic forcings. Better constraints on these processes in climate models will be essential for improving future monsoon projections and implementing adaptive water management strategies to secure the Ganga basin’s freshwater availability under a changing climate.},

  abstract     = {The formation and organization of southeastern Tibetan river systems reflect feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and landscape evolution. However, our understanding of these interactions remains unclear. We approach this issue from the view that the river incision histories and their bedload provenance provide complementary evidence for reconstructing the evolution of the ancient river system. Zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from the middle Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River gorge reveal two episodes of accelerated river incision at 18-17 Ma and 8-7 Ma. The onset of the former incision event, coeval with other incision events along the upper-middle Jinsha and Lancang Rivers, implies their hydrological connection and formation of a south-flowing river system. Additionally, detrital geochronology and thermochronology data of late Oligocene–Miocene fluvial-alluvial sediments along the Red River valley provide constraints on their ages and provenance, suggesting emergence of a throughgoing paleo-Red River in the early-middle Miocene. This ancient Red River was disconnected from the upper Jinsha River but connected with Yalong River (upper Yangtze tributary), forming another south-flowing river system. Landscape evolution modelling supports the view that these south-flowing rivers were successively captured by the westward-propagating Yangtze River in the middle-late Miocene, giving birth to the modern drainages of southeastern Tibet. The resultant integration of the upper-middle and lower Jinsha River is manifested by the progressively upstream-propagating acceleration in river incision from 13-9 Ma to 6-5 Ma along the gorges. Our findings from southeastern Tibet suggest that orogen-scale topographic change, river reorganization, and a coeval increase in biodiversity were driven by extrusion tectonics.},

Yet in practice, prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, and even as prizes proliferate, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic’s historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners’ papers become more innovative than their matched peers. This difference widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to nonprizewinners, prizewinners’ collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The findings’ implications for innovation in science and the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.},

For example, repeated use of individual-level travel routeways (directionally constrained but imperfectly aligned routes), which results in spatial concentration of activity, can shape encounter-based processes including predation, mate finding, and disease transmission. However, how much variation in routeway usage exists across species remains unknown. By analyzing GPS movement tracks for 1,239 range-resident mammalian carnivores—representing 16 canid and 18 felid species from six continents—we found strong evidence of a clade-level difference in species’ reliance on repeatedly used travel routeways. Across the global dataset, tracked canids had a 15% (±7 CI) greater density of routeways within their home ranges than did felids, rising to 33% (±16 CI) greater in landscapes shared with tracked felids. Moreover, comparisons within species across landscapes revealed broadly similar home range routeway densities despite habitat differences. On average, canids also reused their travel routeways more intensively than did felids, with hunting strategies and spatial contexts also contributing to the intensity of routeway usage. Collectively, our results suggest that key aspects of carnivore routeway-usage have an evolutionary component. Striking interspecific and clade-level differences in carnivores’ reliance on reused travel routeways within home ranges identify important ways in which the movement patterns of real-world predators depart from classical assumptions of predator-prey theory. Because such departures can drive key aspects of human-wildlife interactions and other encounter-based processes, continued investigations of the relationships between movement mechanisms and space use are critical.},

  abstract     = {The prioritization of market over nonmarket values of nature is a key driver of the global biodiversity crisis. Recognizing nature’s diverse values in decisions is a fundamental lever for sustainability transformation. While economic valuation of nature has a long history, it has struggled to recognize the full suite of nature’s values, particularly the broad, relational, intrinsic, and shared values reflecting the complexity of human–nature relationships. We explore opportunities to expand the consideration of values within the economics of biodiversity by reviewing conventional and heterodox economic approaches. We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames. Our perspective transcends the dominant economic framing of nature as a passive, largely substitutable asset, to also consider nature as place, self, and harboring agency. This helps to overcome the limitations of conventional economic assumptions, better reflects peoples’ lived experiences, and supports transformations toward more just and sustainable futures.},
