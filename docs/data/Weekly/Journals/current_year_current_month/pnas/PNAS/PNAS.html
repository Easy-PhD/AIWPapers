  abstract     = {Mosquitoes have a substantial impact on human and animal health, but their deeper evolutionary relationships have been difficult to resolve. We inferred a time-calibrated phylogenetic history of mosquitoes using conserved genome-wide markers from representatives of major lineages. Our analyses revealed that codon bias and positive selection in subfamily Anophelinae contributed to a substantial level of branch attraction bias between Anophelinae and outgroup taxa, which in our view has misled previous phylogenetic analyses of mosquitoes. Accounting for this systematic phylogenetic bias led to a revised view of mosquito evolution, including the nonmonophyly of subfamily Culicinae. Similarly, we dated the origin of mosquitoes to the mid-Cretaceous (~106 Mya) and most extant genera to after the KPg boundary <66 Mya, 100 My younger than previous estimates and coincident with the origin of Plasmodium parasites. Our study provides a foundation for future analyses of the evolution of mosquito-borne disease.},

  abstract     = {Cutting onions often leads to tear-inducing aerosol release, yet the underlying mechanics remain poorly understood. In this work, via high-speed characterizations, we show that droplet formation occurs via a two-stage process: an initial high-speed outburst followed by slower ligament fragmentation. By systematically varying blade sharpness and speed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the number and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping reveals that the onion’s tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying mesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture. Developing a simplified bilayer model, we experimentally and theoretically capture the mechanism behind, with numerical calculations of the onion critical fracture forces matching independent Instron results. The work highlights the importance of blade sharpening routines to limiting ejected droplets infected with pathogens in the kitchen, which pack additional outburst energy due to vegetables’ outer strong casings.},

  abstract     = {Urbanization was one of the most significant transitions in human history, yet explanations for the rise and expansion of early cities remain contentious. Here, we propose that simple models from population ecology can integrate existing theories for the development of early cities. Using newly synthesized paleoclimatological, paleoecological, demographic, and historical data from across the Classic Period Maya Lowlands (250–1000 CE) integrated with piece-wise structural equation models, we show that climate downturns, intergroup conflict, and strong economies of scale interact to promote the coevolution of urbanism and patron–client relationships, fueling city expansion, urban institutions, and systemic inequality. In addition, we elucidate how these nonlinear pathways structure the persistence or dissolution of cities. This study underscores the importance of robust economies of scale in the development of early cities and provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the conditions that promote or hinder urbanization, offering insights applicable to both ancient and contemporary urban dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Nitrogen cycles in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii have historically been studied in the context of exogenous ammonium/nitrate availability and uptake. Recently, crystalline guanine has been identified, using Raman microscopy, in the cytoplasm of numerous microalgae, including C. reinhardtii . The signal level is influenced by availability of exogenous nitrogen, suggesting that the deposits serve as a nitrogen store. We report the visualization of these guanine crystals in C. reinhardtii and other microalgae using quick-freeze deep-etch electron microscopy. They prove to reside within cytoplasmic vacuoles: A membrane with a high density of small intramembranous particles surrounds a uniform, coarsely granular interior matrix within which stacks of flat crystals assemble, often in stunning abundance. We designate these as guanine storage vacuoles (GSVs). In C. reinhardtii and other members of the Chlamydomonadales, a discrete disc-shaped granular domain occupies the center of each GSV, and the crystals arise within or at the edges of this domain, suggesting that it represents an amorphous form of guanine. In C. reinhardtii , GSVs are numerous in log-phase cells, are not found in cells maintained in nitrogen-free medium, and reappear within 8 h after the cells are provided with nitrogen, initially as small disc-containing vacuoles. We compare this cycle with that of the polyphosphate granules localized in acidocalcisomes. Nineteen enzyme families and 10 transporters are predicted to participate in guanine-related pathways in C. reinhardtii , many showing strong upregulation with nitrogen starvation. These understandings will inform future studies on the contributions made by GSVs to the metabolism and physiology of eukaryotic microalga.},

Here, we demonstrate that spontaneous electrical discharges, termed “microlightning”, can occur between rising methane-containing microbubbles in water. High-speed optical imaging reveals brief flashes between charged bubbles, arising from strong electric fields at curved gas–liquid interfaces. These discharges initiate nonthermal oxidation of methane, producing luminescence and measurable heat under ambient conditions. Our findings offer a scientific basis for ignis fatuus and reveal a general mechanism by which electrified interfaces can drive redox reactions in natural environments without the need for external ignition sources.},

  abstract     = {Glycosylation is among the most common molecular modifications in living organisms, one that affects the function of myriad macromolecules: mostly proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides of various kinds but also a few specific noncoding RNAs that undergo glycosylation at an internal site. Here we expand the glycome by showing that protein-coding transcripts can also be glycosylated, but in the form of a 5′-terminal glucose cap. These caps are present on up to 30 to 40% of the 5′ ends of U-initiated mRNAs in Escherichia coli , a remarkably high level of noncanonical capping that requires no transcript or promoter characteristic other than a 5′-terminal U. By contrast, no N -acetylglucosamine caps are evident. Due to their resistance to enzymatic removal, glucose caps can greatly prolong the cellular lifetime of mRNA by impeding its degradation via a 5′-end-dependent mechanism. The prevalence and protective impact of glucose caps set them apart from other bacterial RNA caps. This epitranscriptomic modification has the potential to selectively increase the synthesis of bacterial proteins encoded by U-initiated transcripts, especially after transcription is downregulated.},

Amateurs are often seen as pragmatic “doers,” but also uncompromising, a combination at odds with governing systems where legislative progress depends on cross-party coalitions. Using the US Congress as a critical case, we evaluate these competing expectations by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million bill (co)sponsorship records. We find that electing amateurs intensifies partisan divisions: Districts that send amateurs to Congress yield representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their bills and less often support other-party legislation. Our results suggest that amateurs are unlikely to deliver on their promise for pragmatic governance, as they resist or undervalue the compromises essential to lawmaking.},

Despite numerous advances in multifunctional perceptions, e-skin with combined mechano- and thermosensation capabilities for accurately recognizing objects with similar characteristics is still challenging. Here, we report a multisensory e-skin with a skin-like multilayer construction for smart perceptions, which features the patterned protrusion texture mimicking the skin texture to enhance the pressure-sensing sensitivity, the temperature-sensing component mimicking the thermoreceptors, the pressure-sensing component mimicking the mechanoreceptors, and the heater mimicking the body heat source. This multisensory e-skin exhibits excellent decoupled sensing performances of pressure and temperature, enabling the development of a haptic perception system for evaluating some discernible characteristics (e.g., shape and size) and experience-driven features (e.g., modulus and thermal conductivity) of objects through a simple grasp. Demonstrations of accurate recognition and automatic classification of various objects even with extremely similar surface features highlight the significant potential of this multisensory e-skin in applications such as intelligent soft robotics, prosthetics, and other related fields.},

  abstract     = {Hydrogen (H 2 ) is a promising energy carrier for decarbonization. However, the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential of the H 2 supply and its adoption across various demand sectors in the US remains unclear. Here, we couple prospective life cycle assessment with a process-based integrated assessment model to evaluate the GHG mitigation of H 2 from supply and demand perspectives. Our results show the critical role of H 2 production mix in determining supply-side GHG mitigation potential. Without national carbon pricing or large-scale electrolysis in the near future, biomass-based H 2 (Bio-H 2 ) emerges as a critical transitional clean H 2 production technology. Bio-H 2 reduces the life cycle GHG emission intensity of the H 2 supply mix by 1.8 to 5.5 kg CO 2 kg −1 H 2 , resulting in a national reduction of 606 to 1,706 Mt CO 2 e from 2025 to 2050. This represents 1.6 to 2 times greater mitigation potential compared to scenarios without Bio-H 2 . On the demand side, we identify a misalignment: industrial sectors with high mitigation intensity (e.g., iron and steel, 147 Mt CO 2 e EJ −1 ) receive limited H 2 deployment (0.8 EJ), while the transportation sector accounts for 75% of H 2 use (e.g., passenger and light-duty vehicles, 10 EJ) despite their lower mitigation intensities (54 Mt CO 2 e EJ −1 ). While economy-wide climate policies (e.g., carbon prices) could direct more industrial H 2 usages, implementing these policies is challenging; sector-specific strategies can be more practical. Our results highlight the importance of near-term support for Bio-H 2 and sector-specific demand strategies to enhance the climate effectiveness of US H 2 deployment.},

  abstract     = {Protein folding, as commonly portrayed, involves exploration of a rough, high-dimensional landscape, ending with a final descent into a low-energy folded state. During that journey, the protein may visit shallow basins corresponding to metastable structures, potentially of biological importance. Structural characterization of transiently populated metastable states is challenging due to their low population, which limits traditional NMR, and also makes crystallization for X-ray diffraction difficult without stabilizing mutations, covalent modifications, or the addition of antibodies. Here, we report the structural characterization of the on-pathway folding intermediate of a pressure-sensitized ubiquitin mutant. The obtained non-native β-sheet registry was previously shown to be necessary in the PINK1 mitophagy pathway. We used fast pressure jumps to repeatedly initiate folding and advanced NMR measurements to probe the evolving ensemble of protein conformations. The results reported here demonstrate that the non-native β-sheet hydrogen bond registry can act as a metastable trap during protein folding. This work provides a template for future investigation of metastable conformations and protein folding with rich structural detail.},

  abstract     = {Chimeric RNA formation represents a critical mechanism for expanding protein functional diversity, yet its role in invertebrate immune adaptation remains poorly characterized. Here, we report that two C-type lectin genes ( MnLec2 and MnLec3 ) from distinct genomic loci in the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense undergo positionally flexible chimeric RNA formation via alternative trans-splicing and transcriptional slippage, generating 11 structurally diverse chimeric isoforms ( MnLec1 , MnLec4–13 ) with bidirectional exon joining. Crucially, pathogen challenges reprogram chimeric RNA frequencies to shift immune equilibrium, universally suppressing detrimental MnLec9 while promoting protective MnLec7 formation. Functional dissection confirms dual-action pathogen suppression, recombinant MnLec7 (rMnLec7) suppresses white spot syndrome virus replication by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and RNAi effectors, while accelerating Vibrio parahaemolyticus clearance and improving survival. Conversely, suppression of MnLec9 removes its immunosuppressive activity, synergistically enhancing host defense. This coordinated isoform rebalancing enables effective pathogen clearance. Thus, positional flexibility in chimeric RNA formation generates antagonistic isoforms that maintain immune homeostasis and deploy targeted defense upon infection, revealing an adaptive transcriptional strategy in arthropods.},

  abstract     = {Naïve CD4 + T cells differentiate into Th1 cells upon T-cell Receptor (TCR) stimulation in the presence of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and Interleukin 12 (IL-12). However, the intracellular signaling networks that temporally coordinate these inputs to reinforce Th1 lineage commitment remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify protein kinase A (PKA) as a time-gated regulator of IL-12 responsiveness and Th1 differentiation. Using a conditional knockout mouse model that deletes both catalytic PKA subunits in CD4 + T cells, we show that PKA is dispensable for early T cell activation but is essential for the late-phase induction of IL-12 receptor β2 ( Il12rb2 ) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT4). PKA-deficient CD4 + T cells fail to differentiate into Th1 cells in vitro and cannot induce Th1-mediated colitis in vivo. Instead, they adopt a Th2-skewed phenotype and drive eosinophilic lung inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, prolonged TCR stimulation induces the expression of the peptide hormone Adrenomedullin and its receptor component Ramp3, which activate PKA and its downstream effector cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Activated CREB drives Il12rb2 and Stat4 transcription, establishing a feedforward circuit that integrates signal duration with cytokine responsiveness. In the absence of PKA, this transcriptional program fails to initiate, leading to impaired IL-12 signaling and a loss of Th1 identity. These findings define a PKA–CREB signaling module that links sustained antigen stimulation to transcriptional and epigenetic commitment in CD4 + T cells, offering a mechanistic explanation for the temporal gating of Th1 differentiation and the prevention of Th2-driven tissue pathology.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates (BCs) are phase-separated viscoelastic hubs within demixed solutions enriched in proteins and nucleic acids. Such condensates, also called membraneless organelles, are increasingly observed in cells and serve as transient hubs for spatial organization and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Along with the transiency of formation and dissolution, their ability to sequester molecules has inspired us to develop BCs as potential vehicles to transport and deliver molecular cargo. We recently reported the design of disulfide bond cross-linked phase-separating peptide (PSP) condensates that spontaneously dissolve in reducing conditions. Based on the premise that the highly reducing cytoplasm could dissolve PSP condensates and release partitioned cargo, here, we demonstrate the ability of PSP condensates to deliver molecular cargo to the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. We show that PSP condensates deliver a variety of cargos that differ in their sizes and chemistries, including small molecules, peptides, GFP (31 kDa), DNA (1.7 kbp), and mRNA. The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent. With room to tailor the condensate properties based on cargo and cell types, these results showcase the potential of disulfide-cross-linked PSPs as effective and customizable cellular delivery vehicles, filling a critical demand gap for such delivery systems.},

Methanogenesis inhibitors such as 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) decrease methane emissions in ruminants when supplemented in feed. Yet we lack a system-wide, species-resolved understanding of how the rumen microbiota remodels following inhibition and how this influences animal production. Here, we conducted a large-scale trial with 51 dairy calves to analyze microbiota responses to 3-NOP, pairing host performance, emissions, and nutritional profiles with genome-resolved metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. 3-NOP supplementation decreased methane emissions by 62%, modulated short-chain fatty acid and H 2 levels, and did not affect dietary intake or animal performance. We created a rumen microbial genome catalogue (27,884 genomes) that mapped to the meta-omic data at high rates. There was a strong reduction of methanogens and stimulation of reductive acetogens, primarily uncultivated lineages such as “ Candidatus Faecousia.” However, there was a shift in major fermentative communities away from acetate production in response to hydrogen gas accumulation. In vitro incubations recapitulated these results and showed an enrichment of acetate from reductive acetogenesis. Altogether, the divergent responses of the fermentative and hydrogenotrophic communities lead to net hydrogen build-up and limit potential productivity gains from methane reduction. By linking ruminant greenhouse gas emissions and productivity to specific microbial species, this study emphasizes the importance of microbiota-wide analysis for optimizing methane mitigation strategies and identifies promising strategies to simultaneously reduce emissions while increasing animal production.},

The obstacles that prevented their use as H 2 oxidation catalysts in fuel cells are being removed one by one, thanks to the continuous discovery of hydrogenases that have unexpected catalytic properties, the development of new methods for their scalable production and matrices that protect them. Obtaining an efficient biohybrid electrode that is scalable and robust under a large range of experimental conditions is still challenging. The FeFe hydrogenase of Clostridium beijerinckii is a very active catalyst of H 2 evolution and can be handled under O 2 , and its production can potentially be scaled up. However, it was believed that it cannot be used for H 2 oxidation, as it is easily oxidized to an O 2 -stable but inactive state. Here, we show that when the enzyme is embedded into a redox-active film whose reduction potential is finely tuned to the equilibrium potential of the H + /H 2 couple, the potential that the enzyme experiences can be buffered in a sharp window that is actually compatible with enzyme-catalyzed H 2 oxidation and prevents anaerobic inactivation. This leads us to provide the demonstration of an FeFe hydrogenase-based system that can be used for H 2 oxidation and that can be repeatedly exposed to O 2 during and between operational cycles.},

In Arabidopsis , we identify phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) as an anchor that brings the receptors At GET1 and At GET2 into proximity within the ER membrane. At GET2 binds PI4P via an arginine residue in its transmembrane domain. Mutation of this residue disrupts At GET1 and At GET2 proximity at the ER, impairing GET complex function. This defect can be rescued by synthetic dimerization of A tGET1 and At GET2. The PI4P phosphatase RHD4 acts as a gatekeeper, converting PI4P to PI and enabling At GET1– At GET2 interaction, which influences TA protein insertion and root hair growth. Our findings establish the PI4P-RHD4 module as a crucial regulator of GET receptor dynamics, highlighting the interplay between phospholipids and protein trafficking in plants.},

  abstract     = {When bacteria form a biofilm, complex behaviors emerge. Biofilm bacteria differ from their free-living counterparts, exhibiting heterogenous, spatiotemporally patterned behavior. Can we explain these patterns by defining the rules that govern single-cell behavior in biofilms? By understanding these rules, can we explain emergent functions at the biofilm scale? Here we reveal how the architecture of extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the biofilm matrix is controlled by single-cell lysis during Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development. We extend single-cell imaging methods to capture complete biofilm development over 5+ d, characterizing the stages of biofilm development and visualizing eDNA matrix morphogenesis from start to finish. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of single-cell lysis events shows that cell lysis is spatiotemporally patterned, concentrated in a region 5 µm below the biofilm surface that moves with the biofilm as it grows. Using analytical modeling, we examined the consequences of patterning at the biofilm scale. Cell lysis patterning defines eDNA in the matrix: Patterned lysis is sufficient to explain the final eDNA distribution. Cell lysis and biofilm growth are coupled such that the amount of eDNA in the biofilm scales with its volume; this patterning results in a predominantly uniform eDNA matrix architecture, which could not occur without patterning. Finally, we find that patterning of cell lysis is self-organized by nutrient gradients, with maximal lysis occurring in regions where oxygen is present and carbon is limited. The ability of cells to use self-generated nutrient gradients as positioning cues to establish depth-based patterning is a striking feature of bacterial biofilm development.},

  abstract     = {Host determinants are critical for shaping the outcomes of viral mucosal infections and developing effective antiviral strategies. However, the regulatory roles of “nonsusceptible” mucosal cells remain unclear. Here, we show that while swine influenza and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV) viruses infect piglet nasal and intestinal epithelia, each virus establishes efficient infection only in its preferred mucosal niche. Goblet cell activity significantly influences mucosal infection outcomes; increased mucus secretion effectively blocks viral entry, while its reduction facilitates viral dissemination. Notably, PEDV activates acetylcholine-cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 signaling in submucosal enteric neurons to induce goblet cell-associated antigen passages. This mechanism enables the translocation of intestinal bacteria to the lamina propria in early infection, even when the epithelial barrier remains intact, triggering inflammation and exacerbating mucosal damage. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of goblet cells in controlling viral tropism and their potential as targets for developing effective broad-spectrum antiviral approaches.},

  abstract     = {One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope is to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. Unfortunately, such planets are at the detection limit. Estimating their statistical significance via false alarm probability (FAP) is crucial for their validation and has a large impact on the estimate of their occurrence rate, which is of central importance for future spectroscopic missions searching for life signatures. Current methods estimate FAP by light curve inverting or scrambling, but we show that both of these approaches are unsatisfactory. Here, we propose to modify the planet transit template by randomly shifting the transit times by small amounts. We show that the exoplanet search with the resulting null signal template (NST) has the same statistical properties as with the true periodic template, which enables assigning a reliable star-specific FAP to every candidate. We show on simulations and on the real data that the method is robust to unmodeled noise contamination. We reevaluate the statistical significance of all 47 previously proposed habitable Earth-like and super Earth Kepler candidates and assign them star-specific NST based FAP. We identify 29 candidates with FAP below 1%, 7 of whom are currently not considered confirmed. Among these are Kepler 452b with radius 1.5 R ⊕ , a period of 384 d, and KOI 2194.03 with radius 1.8 R ⊕ and a period of 445 d, both around Sun-like G stars. Several well-known candidates should be considered marginal or likely false alarms, including Kepler 186f with 20% FAP.},

Here, we characterize BteO–BtiO, a unique effector–immunity pair in Bacteroides fragilis that mediates antagonism via a nonenzymatic mechanism. Microscopy reveals that BteO exposure leads to cell elongation, membrane blebbing, and lysis in sensitive strains. Structural and biochemical analyses demonstrate that BteO disrupts cell wall homeostasis by binding to conserved C-terminal domains of OmpA-family proteins (OmpAs), which are critical for outer membrane integrity. The immunity protein BtiO neutralizes BteO by mimicking the OmpA-binding interface. We further show that bile salts enhance BteO-mediated killing in vitro and that BteO confers a competitive advantage in the mammalian gut. Remarkably, BteO exhibits broad-spectrum activity across Bacteroides species. These findings reveal a nonenzymatic strategy of bacterial antagonism and broaden our understanding of T6SS effector diversity within Bacteroides .},

It greatly contributes to natural carbon sinks by enhancing atmospheric CO 2 sequestration/mineralization in mineral ion-rich aqueous systems, which is demonstrated by freezing the solutions of Ca(OH) 2 , binary NaCl–CaCl 2 solutions, and artificial seawater. The acceleration is caused by the impacts of freezing on nucleation and growth processes of CaCO 3 crystals. Freezing accelerates nucleation by concentrating reactants within ice crystal boundaries, increasing supersaturation, and thus lowering the nucleation energy barrier. At the post–thaw stage where nuclei already form and reactant concentration is decreased, the crystals undergo the barrier-free growth process. Our findings reveal the freezing-enhanced CO 2 sequestration that is omitted in the current global carbon budget models and signal an urgent need to integrate cryogenic mineralization into climate predictions.},

To minimize vibration-related noise from velocity-modulated sources, we implement a multistage vibration isolation system, achieving a vibration-related noise reduction exceeding 700-fold.

Depletion of platelets markedly attenuated mast cell (MC) activation in a model of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) that depends on IL-33 and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). We demonstrate an IL-33-driven feed-forward loop between platelets and MCs. IL-33 neutralization prevented increases in cysLTs and CXCL7, a platelet activation marker, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from AERD-like mice in response to aspirin challenges. BAL fluid concentrations of PGD 2 correlated strongly with both CXCL7 and MC tryptase in subjects with severe asthma. Platelets amplified PGD 2 and LTC 4 productions by IL-33-stimulated mouse bone marrow–derived MCs (BMMCs), which induced release of CXCL7 and expression of CD62P by platelets. Deletions of MC-specific LTC 4 or platelet-specific type 2 cysLT receptor (CysLT 2 R) completely eliminated both platelet activation and the amplification of PGD 2 and LTC 4 generation by MCs. Platelet-derived ADP/ATP and MC-associated P2Y 1 receptors were essential.

Although the core components of this pathway are well characterized, its upstream regulatory networks remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the integrated stress response (ISR) as a negative regulator of the siRNA pathway, and demonstrate that the picorna-like virus CrPV (Cricket Paralysis Virus) exploits this mechanism for immune evasion. Mechanistically, the picorna-like virus triggers the ISR through transcriptional suppression of ppp1r15 , a key regulator of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) dephosphorylation. ISR activation subsequently induces the autophagy-lysosomal pathway by up-regulating Atg1 transcription in an ATF4-dependent manner. This process leads to selective degradation of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and other core components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), thereby suppressing the host RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and enhancing viral replication. Our findings uncover an unconventional immune evasion strategy employed by a picorna-like virus and establish a previously unrecognized crosstalk between the ISR and siRNA pathways.},

Exosomes contain a diverse range of cargo such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and small molecules but whether these contents have a biological function remains an area of intense investigation. Over the last decade, numerous studies have described the transcriptome of exosomes but very little is known about the RNA content of the MVBs, the source compartment for exosome biogenesis. Here, we determine the small-RNA transcriptome of highly purified MVBs and report that various classes of nuclear small regulatory RNAs such as small-Cajal body associated RNAs, small-nucleolar RNAs, and small-nuclear RNAs traffic to MVBs. We show that this RNA-trafficking requires the function of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery but is independent of canonical LC3 lipidation mediated selective autophagy. Furthermore, blocking the activity of a PI3K Class 3 enzyme, VPS34, required for recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to the endosome, prevents the turnover of these nuclear RNAs in MVBs. Our results provide a mechanism for targeting nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, such as Cajal bodies, for degradation and turnover by the cytoplasmic endo-lysosomal pathway.},

We used an ecosystem-scale manipulation to simulate hurricane-level flooding of a coastal forest and explore the individual and interactive impacts of inundation and salinity. Monitoring real-time soil conditions and tree physiological responses, we observed consistent impacts on soil biogeochemistry aligned with belowground drivers of tree mortality, but no consistent responses in aboveground vegetation immediately following flooding.

While disparities in air pollution exposure by income groups are well documented, how these inequalities translate into differential burdens of pollution-attributable premature mortality remains understudied. We utilize high-resolution estimates of secondary air pollutants, combined with income data, to investigate the relationship between global air pollution–attributable mortality and poverty across urban–rural contexts and air pollutants. We show that high-income countries face higher air pollution–attributable mortality owing to population aging, in contrast to the established exposure inequality pattern. While affluent populations within most countries also face higher mortality burdens, in several low-income countries, this pattern is reversed due to elevated exposures among impoverished rural populations. South Asia and Africa exhibit the highest levels of vulnerability to coincident mortality and poverty, where populations living in periurban transition zones bear disproportionate dual burdens. In many low-income countries, those living near wealthier urban centers also face elevated health burdens from air pollution: a “cost of opportunity” when air pollutant regulations are weak. Our findings emphasize the imperative for tailored policy interventions to mitigate amplified health risks in vulnerable communities.},

  abstract     = {Aridity thresholds shape ecosystem functions worldwide. Despite the importance of soil microbiomes in engineering ecosystem processes, the specific strategies employed by soil microbiomes to support ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across aridity gradients remain virtually unknown. Here, we investigated 474 soil samples across a continental-scale aridity gradient and identified an aridity threshold beyond which plot-level EMF declines sharply. Microbial habitat and decomposition functions were among the last to respond to aridity, with thresholds occurring under more arid conditions compared to plant productivity and soil fertility. Combining metagenomic sequencing with physiological assays to characterize microbial life history strategies of high yield (Y), resource acquisition (A), and stress tolerance (S), we introduce a microbial trait-based framework to mechanistically link community-level microbial life history strategies to EMF. Our results reveal that microbial Y-strategy is positively correlated with EMF across aridity gradients, A-strategy exhibits a negative association with EMF across aridity gradients, and S-strategy is negatively correlated with EMF in arid ecosystems. Collectively, this study offers empirical evidence and insights into how aridification interacts with soil microbiomes in shaping EMF, highlighting the pivotal role of microbial life history strategies in understanding the mechanisms behind EMF variation in an increasingly arid world.},

  abstract     = {The prolonged production of juvenile traits and an associated reduction or loss of adult traits during development (neoteny) can either arise from a change in genes that mediate the timing of the shift between juvenile and adult traits (timing genes) or from changes in genes that are necessary for the development of adult traits (target genes). To date, the relative contribution of each developmental mechanism to the origins of neoteny remain unclear. We examined this question in the plant genus, Acacia Mill., which contains species that undergo the juvenile-to-adult vegetative transition (vegetative phase change) early in shoot development, as well as species that remain permanently juvenile, or have delayed vegetative phase change. Mapping the timing of vegetative phase change onto a molecular phylogeny of Acacia revealed that permanent juvenility has evolved multiple times and is sometimes associated with a delay in vegetative phase change in related species. In three cases, the absence or delay in vegetative phase change was associated with either higher amounts or a delayed decline in the level of miR156, the master regulator of vegetative phase change in plants. These findings support the hypothesis that neoteny in Acacia has evolved not by a loss in the capacity to produce the adult leaf phenotype but by a change in the timing of genes that promote juvenile leaf identity.},

  abstract     = {During origin licensing, the origin recognition complex (ORC) loads two Mcm2-7 helicases onto DNA in a head-to-head conformation, establishing the foundation for subsequent bidirectional replication. Single-molecule experiments support a helicase-loading model in which one ORC loads both Mcm2-7 helicases at origins. For this to occur, ORC must release from its initial Mcm2-7 and DNA binding sites, flip over the helicase, and bind the opposite end of the Mcm2-7 complex and adjacent DNA to form the MO complex. Importantly, this binding-site transition occurs without ORC releasing into solution. Using a single-molecule FRET assay, we show that the N-terminal half of Orc6 tethers ORC to the N-terminal region of Mcm2 during ORC’s binding-site transition. This interaction involves both the folded Orc6 N-terminal domain (Orc6N) and the adjacent unstructured linker and forms before ORC releases from its initial Mcm2-7 interaction. The absence of this interaction increases the rate of ORC release into solution, consistent with a tethering function. CDK phosphorylation of ORC inhibits the tethering interaction, providing a mechanism for the known CDK inhibition of MO complex formation. Interestingly, we identify mutations in the Orc6 linker region that support MO complex formation but prevent double-hexamer formation by inhibiting stable second Mcm2-7 recruitment. Our study provides a molecular explanation for a one-ORC mechanism of helicase loading and demonstrates that Orc6 is involved in multiple stages of origin licensing.},

  abstract     = {Early-life social experiences can shape adult behavior, yet the underlying neural mechanisms of this plasticity remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans larvae reared at high density develop into adults that exhibit exploratory behavior in the associative-learning paradigm known as thermotaxis. While animals grown at low density prefer the temperature previously associated with food, those exposed to high density during larval stages instead disperse from this temperature. The high-density experience alters the neural representation of thermal valence, a process that requires a gap junction network spanning multiple neural circuit layers. This network connects density-sensing neurons to the circuit that processes temperature information. Furthermore, these gap junction components also control the decision to enter developmental diapause in response to high density. Our results suggest that the multilayered gap junction network enables early social experience to influence adult behavior and is essential for developmental and behavioral plasticity in social contexts.},

In humans, defective radial spokes can cause a genetic disorder known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), resulting in respiratory defects and infertility. Despite their critical role in ciliary motility, the molecular composition and related physiological functions remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify EF-hand calcium-binding domain protein 10 (EFCAB10) and adenylate kinase (AK8) as radial spoke proteins and describe their roles in mouse motile cilia. Using Efcab10 −/− and Ak8 −/− mice, we show that loss of either protein can affect ciliary motility and lead to PCD-related phenotypes in mice. Interestingly, ciliary AK8 is completely absent in Efcab10 −/− cilia, but the loss of AK8 has no effect on ciliary EFCAB10. Further biochemical analyses reveal that EFCAB10 interacts with AK8 and RSPH3B, which fastens AK8 to the radial spoke. Overall, our findings demonstrate the essential role of EFCAB10 as a radial spoke protein in maintaining the integrity of the radial spoke and provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of related ciliopathies.},

  abstract     = {Aciniform silk is a remarkably tough and elastic protein fiber primarily used by spiders to wrap prey and construct the inner layers of egg sacs. While the formation of ampullate and eggcase silks has been extensively studied, the molecular mechanism underlying the self-assembly of the aciniform spidroin, AcSp1, remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered linkers of AcSp1 play a critical role in driving spidroin assembly through liquid–liquid phase separation in solution. The N-terminal domain (NTD) exhibits pH-independent dimerization over a physiological pH range (5.0 to 7.0) and undergoes concentration-dependent tetramerization. Quaternary structure of AcSp1-NTD shows a hierarchical assembly process mediated by both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, which enhances phase separation in both salt-free and salt-containing solutions. Finally, inspired by this mechanistic insight, we developed a fully aqueous spinning method to fabricate artificial aciniform fibers with excellent extensibility and toughness. These findings uncover a pivotal molecular strategy that transforms our understanding of diverse molecular mechanisms governing spidroin assembly and establish a foundation for designing and manufacturing elastic and tough silk-based biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Development requires the coordinated action of many genes across space and time, yet numerous species can develop discrete, alternate phenotypes. Such complex balanced polymorphisms are often controlled by supergenes: multiple tightly linked loci that function together to control development of a complex phenotype. Supergenes are widespread in nature. However, the evolution and functions of supergene alleles remain obscure because the identities of the functional loci, and the causative variation between them, remain essentially unknown. The doublesex supergene controls mimicry polymorphism in the swallowtail butterflies Papilio polytes and Papilio alphenor. Alternate alleles cause development of discrete mimetic or nonmimetic wing patterns. We found that the mimetic allele evolved by gaining six new cis -regulatory elements (CREs) and an inversion that locked those CREs together with dsx and the novel noncoding gene U3X . At least four of these new CREs are essential for dsx expression and mimetic pattern development. Genome-wide assays of DSX binding suggest that dsx controls mimetic pattern development by directly regulating the expression of both itself and a handful of unlinked genes. The dsx supergene thus contains multiple functional genetic elements, each required for the phenotype switch and linked together by an inversion, and likely exerts its effects on color pattern development through direct regulation of unlinked “modifier” genes. Our results therefore support classic theories of supergene evolution, but update those ideas to match what we have learned about gene regulation since their development over a half century ago.},

  abstract     = {How sleep maintains our healthy brain function has remained one of the biggest mysteries in neuroscience, medical settings, and daily lives. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during sleep has been implicated in metabolic waste reduction in animals, how CSF dynamics are driven in the healthy human brain during deep sleep remains elusive. A myriad of research has shown that crucial cognitive processing manifests in slow-wave and rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, suggesting that a key to maintaining brain functions lies in deep sleep. By leveraging a simultaneous sparse-functional MRI and polysomnography method, we demonstrate that deep sleep–specific CSF dynamics are associated with spontaneous brain oscillations in healthy young human participants. Slow waves and sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep are tightly linked to short-cycle, frequent, and moderate CSF fluctuations. In contrast, slow waves during light sleep and arousals produce slow, infrequent, and steep CSF signal changes. Rapid eye movements and sawtooth waves during REM sleep are also linked to CSF signal changes. Furthermore, CSF signals are significantly faster in frequency during deep than light sleep. These brain oscillations during light and deep sleep recruit essentially different brain networks, with deep sleep involving memory and homeostatic circuits. Thus, human deep sleep has a unique way of facilitating CSF dynamics that are distinctive from arousal mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {We present a flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system’s linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system’s score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework’s versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system’s characteristics: i) a clustering-based algorithm (K-means Gaussian Mixture Modeling) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier–Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system’s response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.},

In the rodent brain, the prefrontal cortex is limited to this earlier agranular stage and is often referred to as the “medial prefrontal cortex.” The primate mid-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is critical for the monitoring of information in working memory, including the monitoring of the precise serial order of flexible randomly varying sequences of stimuli. Thus, a fundamental question arises: what are the functional limits of serial order processing in the rodent brain which, anatomically, possesses only the earlier stage in the evolution of the prefrontal cortex? The present study examined the ability of normal rats to monitor the serial order of sequences of spatial stimuli (locations). The normal rodent brain can code accurately the order of directional left-to-right or right-to-left sequences of locations. However, the serial order of nondirectional randomly varying sequences can be processed only to a limited extent: when performance relies considerably on the salient memory of the most recent stimulus to code an approximate order of the earlier stimuli within working memory. Thus, the development of the granular prefrontal cortex in the primate brain provides an additional higher level of executive control permitting precise coding of the order of stimuli in working memory that is essential to manipulate information to plan action.},

  abstract     = {Multispecies sensory networks, where different species prioritize different sensory modalities and then use heterospecific information in a likely noncooperative fashion, may allow animals to improve foraging over large areas for cryptic prey. We test this hypothesis in procellariiform seabirds that forage in mixed flocks, where both prey odors and visual cues provided by other foraging hetero- and conspecifics might improve success rates. Using agent-based models, we explored the impact of social strategies on olfactory foraging for Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ). Our results suggest that social foraging enables species with different sensory adaptations to achieve similar success rates. Additionally, our results indicate that foraging is more successful in mixed-species rather than single-species flocks, where individuals can monitor the activity of other birds that are using different sensory foraging strategies than themselves to find prey. These results suggest that sensory-based foraging networks may be more critical to their survival than previously assumed. Finally, we show that success rates decrease at low population densities. As seabird populations continue to decline, understanding and preserving these social foraging networks may be essential for their conservation and ecological success. Overall, our study provides insights into the critical role of multispecies sensory networks to foraging success, wherein different species have different sensory adaptations for locating prey. While we used empirical anatomical and behavioral data specific to procellariiforms to inform our models, our approach and results may have broader implications for other species as well.},

  abstract     = {For several decades, it was widely believed that a noninteracting disordered electronic system could only undergo an Anderson metal–insulator transition due to Anderson localization. However, numerous recent theoretical works have predicted the existence of a disorder-driven non-Anderson phase transition that differs from Anderson localization. The frustration lies in the fact that this non-Anderson disorder-driven transition has not yet been experimentally demonstrated in any system. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we present a case study of observing the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition by visualizing the electronic structure of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi on surfaces with varying amounts of disorder. Our observations reveal that strong disorder can effectively suppress all surface states in the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi, including the topological surface Fermi arcs. This disappearance of surface Fermi arcs is associated with the vanishing of the topological invariant, indicating a quantum phase transition from a Weyl semimetal to a diffusive metal. These observations provide direct experimental evidence of the non-Anderson disorder-driven transition occurring in real quantum systems, a finding long anticipated by theoretical physicists.},

  abstract     = {The early olfactory system is canonically described by a “one-receptor-to-one-neuron” model: each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses a single type of olfactory receptor (OR). Although the olfactory systems of many model organisms approximately follow this canonical organization, a number of exceptions are known. In particular, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes coexpress multiple types of ORs in many OSNs. Why do some olfactory systems follow the canonical organization while others violate it? We approach this question from the normative perspective of efficient coding. We find that the canonical and noncanonical organizations optimally encode odor signals in different types of olfactory environment. Noncanonical olfaction is beneficial when relevant sources emit correlated odorants and the environment contains odorants from ethologically irrelevant odor sources. Our theory explains previous observations of receptor coexpression and provides a framework from which to understand the structure of early olfactory systems.},

  abstract     = {Heterogeneous gene expression enables the coexistence of virulent phages with populations of isogenic bacteria comprising both phenotypically phage-resistant and susceptible cells. However, the evolvability of phages and the fitness cost they impose on susceptible bacteria challenge the evolutionary stability of the coexistence. Understanding this dynamic is critical for predicting phage–bacteria coevolution with implications for phage therapy, where resistance hinders treatment success. To address this point, we built on the discovery that heterogeneously expressed alterations of the O-antigen (phase variation) enable phenotypic resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium ( S .Tm) against the T5-like phage 37 (Φ37). We observed that phase variation allowed prolonged phage–bacteria coexistence in liquid medium. In contrast, phase variation only delayed the fixation of genetically phage-resistant S .Tm mutants when the phage–bacteria interaction took place in the gut of infected mice. The emergence of evolved phages capable of infecting both phenotypically susceptible and resistant phase variants of wild-type S .Tm selected for genetically resistant S .Tm mutants. Experimental in vitro evolution in a viscous medium recapitulated the short-lived coexistence of phages with susceptible S .Tm observed in the gut. This demonstrates that conditions in the gut increase the evolvability of phages by potentiating the effect of mutations that increase the phage host range, thereby negating the protection conferred by phase variation.},

  abstract     = {Tumor-targeted T cell therapies of various types have been booming, but T cell therapy is limited by its inability to penetrate the collagen barrier surrounding tumors. The destruction of tumor collagen is significant because collagen both suppresses T cells and contributes to the formation of the extracellular matrix. Our previously reported cell-surface vimentin (CSV)–targeted and membrane-anchored interleukin 12-armed (attIL12) T cells can reduce collagen production by killing cancer-associated fibroblasts, but fail to reduce collagen expression by tumor cells, resulting in resistance to attIL12-T cell treatment. In this study, we found that CCKAR directly boosts collagen production by tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. attIL12-modified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) disabled collagen production by CCKAR-high autologous tumor cells in vitro and sarcoma patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) in vivo. This disruption of collagen production by tumor cells by attIL12-TILs overcomes resistance to attIL12-T cell treatment and required a simultaneous interaction between the CSV on autologous tumor cells, which is targeted by attIL12, and human leukocyte antigen-T cell receptor on attIL12-TILs; When either interaction was abrogated, collagen production and CCKAR expression were not shut down. Mechanistically, the interaction between attIL12-TILs and autologous tumor cells induced interferon gamma production synergistically, which in combination with CCKAR downregulation reduced collagen expression through suppression of both transforminggrowth factor beta-stimulated SMAD activation and CCKAR-AKT signaling. Diminishing collagen expression from tumor cells significantly increased T cell infiltration and improved tumor growth inhibition in PDX sarcomas. Thus, this attIL12-TIL therapy holds great clinical potential for boosting T cell infiltration in high-grade, collagen-rich tumors.},

While cell line engineering and bioprocess optimization have yielded high protein titers for some recombinant proteins, many remain difficult to express. Here, we investigated factors influencing protein expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, expressing 2,135 Human Secretome Project proteins. While the abundance of mRNA from recombinant proteins explained less than 1% of observed variation in secretion titers, analysis of 218 biochemical and biophysical descriptors uncovered intrinsic protein features that account for ~15% of secretion variability, pinpointing key drivers such as molecular weight, cysteine content, and N-linked glycosylation, and establishing a roadmap for rational design of difficult-to-express proteins. We subsequently analyzed RNA-Seq data from 95 CHO cell cultures, each expressing a distinct recombinant protein, spanning a wide range of titers. Host cell transcriptomic signatures showed strong correlations with titer, thereby providing insights into cellular processes that covary with expression. Cells failing to produce proteins exhibited increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, including ER-associated degradation; whereas high-producing cells demonstrated enhanced lipid metabolism and a stronger response to oxidative stress, suggesting these factors may support successful recombinant protein productions. Together, using this resource, we quantified the contributions of various protein and cellular factors that correlate with the expression of diverse recombinant human proteins in a heterologous host, thereby providing insights for next-generation CHO cell engineering.},

  abstract     = {The brown planthopper (BPH) is the most devastating insect pest in rice, posing a serious threat to global rice production. One attractive control strategy would be based on the understanding of the virulence mechanisms of BPH at the molecular level and then designing targeted methods to neutralize such mechanisms. Salivary proteins of BPH are important players in mediating rice–BPH interactions. Here, we describe a pivotal role of a watery saliva protein, Nilaparvata lugens Annexin-like5 ( Nl ANX5), in the rice–BPH interaction. RNA interference (RNAi) of NlANX5 greatly compromised BPH feeding performance and survival rate on rice plants. NlANX5 -RNAi BPH triggered a rapid calcium ion influx in rice cells. The feeding and survival defects of NlANX5 -RNAi BPH can be restored in NlANX5 -expressing transgenic rice plants. Nl ANX5 targets rice annexin ( Os ANN) proteins, including Os ANN2 and Os ANN8. Further analysis with Nl ANX5 and Os ANN2 as well as Os ANN8 showed that Nl ANX5 displaces Os ANN2 and Os ANN8 from the rice cell membrane. The osann2 osann8 mutant rice plants are hypersusceptible to BPH infestation. In contrast, enhanced expression of OsANN2 and OsANN8 genes resulted in robust rice resistance against BPH. This study highlights a successful example of identifying and augmenting the expression of the host targets of a major BPH virulence effector as a promising antivirulence strategy against an important crop pest.},

  abstract     = {Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are crucial for animal reproductive success, with Sfp-encoding genes believed to be evolutionarily young due to heightened rates of gene loss and gain and rapidly evolving at the sequence level relative to other genes. Using estimates of the phylogenetic origin of each Drosophila melanogaster Sfp gene, based on genomic resources that include outgroup species to the Drosophila genus, we examined the functional attributes and evolutionary characteristics of 357 Sfp genes relative to their evolutionary age. Contrary to the perception that many Sfp genes are evolutionarily young, 62% existed in the genome of the ancestor to this genus. These ancient genes have broader expression profiles, more expansive biological roles, and have more interactions with non-Sfp genes. This increased pleiotropy has imposed constraints on the rate of sequence evolution in ancient Sfp genes compared to younger ones. Notably, these younger Sfp genes evolve substantially faster as a result of both adaptive and nonadaptive evolutionary forces. Within the Sfp interactome, we identified a fast-evolving core subnetwork of younger genes with more restricted tissue expression and functions. Our systematic approach has uncovered a large set of ancient Sfp genes with distinct genomic, functional, and evolutionary characteristics compared to the younger, more commonly studied Sfp genes. With increased refined genomic and functional data acquisition across a wider variety of taxa, our approach and results serve as proof of the importance of systemic strategies applied to broadly defined gene sets based on their time of evolutionary origination.},

  abstract     = {Tumor genomic profiling has uncovered many cancer drivers whose implications in terms of tumor biology and therapeutic actionability remain understudied. Hotspot mutations in SF3B1 induce widespread transcriptomic alterations and occur across multiple cancer types. Despite this, the biological and clinical consequences of SF3B1 mutations remain elusive. Characterization of the largest SF3B1 mutant breast cancer clinical cohort to date identifies SF3B1 driver mutations in approximately 2.5% of HR+ HER2- breast cancer, with strong enrichment of K700E substitutions, substantial variation in variant allele fraction (VAF), and significantly improved overall survival due to enrichment in Luminal A disease. In vitro and in vivo studies in representative cell models suggest several of the most prevalent SF3B1 mutations have deleterious effects on cell growth, leading to selective loss of the mutation over time, providing a rationale for the low frequency and low VAF of SF3B1 mutations in breast cancer. Though all introduced hotspot mutations limit growth and are reverted to wildtype (WT) over time, mutations at position R625 have a more pronounced phenotype than K700E, providing an explanation for the clinically observed skew in mutation frequencies. RNA and DNA sequencing analyses were used to identify characteristic pathway-level transcriptomic changes in SF3B1 -mutant cells and identify copy number alterations as a mechanism of both improved mutation tolerability and a means to eliminate the mutation over time. These data suggest that while SF3B1 mutations are enriched in some clinical contexts, their role in breast tumorigenesis is highly complex and dependent on secondary events that overcome their deleterious effects on cell growth and survival.},

  abstract     = {Like many viruses, HIV relies on the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton for successful infection. MT-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate MT functions and thus bear the potential to modulate viral infection. However, while several MAPs are known to exert proviral effects on HIV, little is known about antiviral ones. We previously described the Tripartite motif protein 69 (Trim69) as an innate immune factor that remodels MTs, leading to inhibition of a broad spectrum of viruses, including HIV. Through in silico modeling, TIRF microscopy, and cell-based assays, we determine that Trim69 binding to MTs is determined by a basic surface in its SPRY domain that interacts with the C-terminal tails of tubulins. This surface is conserved among mammalian Trim69s and is critical for its functions. We demonstrate that by binding and remodeling MTs, Trim69 inhibits the docking and the migration of virion cores on MTs by promoting the stalling of the dynein/dynactin motor complexes. Altogether, these findings shed light on a mechanism of viral defense that involves an innate immune regulation of the MT cytoskeleton.},

  abstract     = {Communities in southeastern Louisiana are subject to disproportionate environmental health burdens, including elevated risk for cancer, from emissions of industrial hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). However, there are few ambient measurements (or none) of various HAPs in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans (BR-NO). We measured 17 carcinogenic volatile organic compounds using fast-response in situ instrumentation aboard a mobile laboratory. Using spatially resolved concentrations, we estimate cancer risk in 15 census tracts along an 81 km-long stretch of the BR-NO corridor. In 14 of 15 tracts, our estimates of total cancer risk were higher (range: 0.9 to 11.6 × ; median: 5 × ) than those from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA) 2020 Air Toxics Screening Assessment (AirToxScreen). Our maximum estimate for total tract-level cancer risk was 560-in-one million excess cancer cases, far exceeding the upper limit of USEPA’s acceptable risk range (100-in-one million). This discrepancy is largely explained by differences between measured vs. modeled ethylene oxide concentrations, though there are important contributions from a number of additional HAPs. Our risk estimates are dominated by ethylene oxide, which contributes between 39.5 and 92.2% of total cancer risk across all tracts; chloroprene (0.2 to 36.8%); and formaldehyde (4.1 to 14.6%). AirToxScreen also identifies these three compounds as primary drivers of risk in this location. Together, these three compounds account for between 63 and 96.9% of total cancer risk. There is substantial spatial variability in total cancer risk and the relative contribution of each HAP, both between and within tracts. These data substantiate claims that the region has high HAPs-related cancer risk and quantify which individual HAPs are of highest concern.},

  abstract     = {Cholinesterase (ChE) enzymes terminate action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at synapses and neuromuscular junctions throughout the body. Noninvasive strategies for monitoring these enzymes could be important for studying basic biology of cholinergic systems and disorders that affect their function. To address this goal, we developed an imaging probe that allows activity of ChE to be detected using MRI. The probe, called ChERT, undergoes enzymatic processing that reduces its solubility, promoting accumulation near sites of cholinesterase activity. Following wide-field brain delivery, ChERT produces MRI contrast changes in brain regions known to be enriched in cholinesterases; these are suppressed in the presence of a selective enzymatic inhibitor, confirming their specificity. After abdominal delivery, ChERT labels regions of the gut where ChE expression is expected. In both the brain and periphery, colocalization of ChERT with ChE could be confirmed and visualized at higher resolution by fluorescence microscopy, owing to optical properties of the probe architecture. The ChERT agent thus provides a potentially versatile basis for assessment of cholinergic phenotypes throughout the body.},

  abstract     = {Self-organization of individual organisms at a very small scale may result in recognizable functional ecosystem structures at a larger spatial scale. Drylands, which cover almost half of emerged lands, host some of the most remarkable vegetation patterns on Earth, including “disordered hyperuniformity,” a recently defined class of such emergent self-organization structures. Yet, the extent, causes, and consequences of disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns in drylands remain virtually unknown. Here, we analyzed high-resolution remote sensing images of 425 spot-like drylands across the globe and found that disordered hyperuniformity shapes vegetation patterns in about one out of ten drylands, with the distribution of plants appearing to be “disordered” to the naked eye, but supporting highly recognizable (uniform) patterns at larger scales ( ca. 50 to 500 m). Using mathematical models, we identify three potential mechanisms that can generate disordered hyperuniform vegetation patterns. These mechanisms are not limited to the well-studied Turing patterns and represent key general processes with respect to plant–plant or plant–sediment interactions. Further modeling indicates that disordered hyperuniformity enhances ecosystem functioning in terms of water retention use, and expands the range of aridity conditions under which the system can maintain itself, but may slow recovery of vegetation structure from disturbances. In a wider context, we also show that disordered hyperuniformity is likely to pertain to diverse dryland systems, such as termite-mound or fairy-circle landscapes. Our findings highlight that exploring disordered hyperuniformity of vegetation pattern of drylands (and potentially other large-scale systems) offers insights into the organization and resilience of ecosystems globally.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the computational principles of the brain and translating them into neuromorphic hardware and modern deep learning architectures is critical for advancing neuro-inspired AI (NeuroAI). Here, we develop an experimentally constrained, biophysically realistic model of neocortical microcircuits in the mouse primary visual cortex (layers 2 to 3) to examine how four major interneuron classes—Parvalbumin, Somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and LAMP5—interact within a competitive–cooperative motif to implement soft winner-take-all (sWTA) circuit dynamics. In a conductance-based network grounded in in vitro physiology, we show that this circuit motif selectively amplifies strong inputs while suppressing, without silencing, weaker ones, enabling gain modulation, signal restoration, and context-dependent multistability. Using a gain-matching strategy, we mapped the motif onto IBM’s TrueNorth neuromorphic chip, revealing a principled correspondence between cell-type-specific roles and hardware primitives. Sparse coupling of sWTA modules generated persistent up-states and a two-state neural machine approximating working memory. We then embedded the sWTA circuit as a preprocessing filter in a Vision Transformer, which significantly enhanced out-of-distribution generalization across diverse tasks, including zero-shot digit classification, cross-domain transfer between digit datasets, and nighttime semantic segmentation. The sWTA filter boosted accuracy on unseen data by up to ~20% and reduced training compute by directing learning toward salient features, without additional data or architectural changes. By unifying biophysically grounded circuit models, neuromorphic implementation, and state-of-the-art AI architectures, this work outlines a generalizable roadmap for embedding cortical computation into next-generation NeuroAI systems that combine biological principles with practical AI performance gains.},

  abstract     = {Mineral dissolution is typically thought to occur by the detachment of monomeric building blocks of the crystal structure, although direct evidence is rare. Using in situ high-speed atomic force microscopy to examine step-edge retreat dynamics at high resolution, we report that the dissolution of gibbsite in alkaline solutions occurs mainly by the release of aluminate dimers, which subsequently dissociate into the monomeric species that dominate the solution. The observed dissolution anisotropy is readily explained by this mechanism, which was further supported by density functional tight-binding simulations of detachment activation energies. Recognition that such polynuclear dissolution mechanisms exist may enable an improved understanding of processes regulating mineral dissolution rates in nature and industry.},

  abstract     = {Lab studies of bacteria usually focus on cells in spatially extended, nutrient-replete settings, such as in liquid cultures and on agar surfaces. By contrast, many biological and environmental settings—ranging from mucus in the body to ocean sediments and the soil beneath our feet—feature multicellular bacterial populations that are confined to tight spots where essential metabolic substrates (e.g., oxygen) are scarce. What influence does such confinement have on a bacterial population? Here, we address this question by studying suspensions of motile Escherichia coli confined to quasi two-dimensional (2D) droplets. We find that when the droplet size and cell concentration are both large enough, the initially uniform suspension spatially self-organizes into a concentrated, immotile inner “core” that coexists with a more dilute, highly motile surrounding “shell.” By simultaneously measuring cell concentration, oxygen concentration, and motility-generated fluid flow, we show that this behavior arises from the interplay between oxygen transport through the droplet from its boundary, uptake by the cells, and corresponding changes in their motility in response to oxygen variations. Furthermore, we use biophysical theory and simulations to quantitatively describe this interplay. Our work thus sheds light on the rich collective behaviors that emerge for bacterial populations in confined environments, with implications for understanding ecological niches and engineering artificial systems.},

  abstract     = {Putative metazoan body fossils from the Precambrian are curiously lacking morphological characteristics that link them unambiguously to extant animal phyla, including sponges. Chemical fossils such as the rare C 30 hydrocarbons 24- iso -propylcholestane (24- i pc) and 26-methylstigmastane (26-mes), however, have been proposed as evidence for the Neoproterozoic emergence of the Demospongiae (Porifera) due to their prevalence in rocks of this age and the occurrence of their sterol precursors in contemporary demosponges. However, there are alternative hypotheses which posit that diagenetic alteration products of algal sterols, or those from Rhizaria or other protists, account for the enigmatic steroid distributions observed in these ancient sedimentary rocks. Here, we report additional support for the Neoproterozoic rise of demosponges through the chemical characterization of two previously unrecognized C 31 hydrocarbons—24- n -butylcholestane (24- n bc) and 24- sec -butylcholestane (24- sec bc). Precursor C 31 sterols from contemporary demosponges, as well as a suite of synthesized C 31 sterol standards were reduced to their sterane counterparts. Gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis and collisionally activated dissociation mass spectra confirmed the presence of 24- n bc and 24- sec bc in well-preserved early Ediacaran rocks, and the coelution of these compounds with synthetic standards enhances the robustness of these findings. Co-occurrence of abundant 24- i pc and 24- sec bc was found for numerous Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rock/oil samples, closely mimicking the abundance patterns and high structural selectivity of major C 30 and C 31 sterols detected in numerous species of modern demosponges. These findings support the hypothesized first emergence of sponges during the Neoproterozoic Era.},

Sci. 26 , 607–621 (2022).] that “Humans do not integrate new information objectively.” The claim is based on fitting to human data a Q -learning model with different (and temporally constant) learning rates for positive and negative reward prediction errors. However, we find that even if the agent updates its belief via, arguably objective, Bayesian inference, fitting the above model demonstrates both the biases. This finding seems particularly surprising, as Bayesian inference, when written as an effective Q -learning algorithm, is described by unbiased (and temporally decreasing) learning rates. In this article, we explain the reasons behind this observation, by studying the stochastic dynamics of these learning systems using Master equations. In particular, we show that both confirmation bias and unbiased but temporally decreasing learning rates have the same behavioral signature: decreased action switching probabilities, as compared to temporally constant and unbiased learning rates. Our analysis underscores the need for modeling temporally varying learning rates in subjects before any claims can be made about their choices being biased.},

  abstract     = {As critical executors of the immune system, neutrophils provide an immediate inflammatory response for the clearance of debris and microbes, which is essential for the protection of health. Developmentally, neutrophils and macrophages share common progenitors, whose fate is tightly controlled by transcriptional programs. Dysregulation of these programs causes severe hematological disorders, including neutropenia, neutrophilia, leukemia, and inflammatory disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of neutrophils through these programs are poorly understood. Here, we revealed that Ikzf1 and Myb were enriched in neutrophils. Overactivation of Ikzf1 promoted neutrophil generation while suppressing macrophage emergence. Conversely, the simultaneous loss of Ikzf1 and Myb, but not the individual mutations, drastically impaired neutrophil production and enlarged the macrophage pool in both zebrafish and mice. Mechanistically, Ikzf1 and Myb formed a complex that targeted irf8 and induced the expression of a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), irf8-2 , through a regulatory element. LncRNA irf8-2 biased neutrophil commitment by modulating irf8 dosage via Zfp36l1. The deletion of irf8-2 resulted in defective neutrophil development and enhanced macrophage production. However, a partial ratio of neutrophils and macrophages was restored when Ikzf1, Myb, and Irf8 were all compromised. Overall, our study reveals that Ikzf1 and Myb cooperatively bias neutrophil development against Irf8 via the lncRNA irf8 -2 and Zfp36l. This study provides previously uncharacterized insights into the conserved molecular balance between neutrophil and macrophage development during myelopoiesis, with potential implications for understanding and treating myeloid disorders.},

Their numbers are believed to be in decline due to numerous anthropogenic threats; however, their conservation is hindered by numerous knowledge gaps. In particular, the dearth of genetic data, unique among all big cat species, hinders a full understanding of their population structure, historical population size, and current levels of genetic diversity. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing data for 41 snow leopards (37 newly sequenced) to offer insights into these unresolved aspects of snow leopard biology. Among our samples, we find evidence of a primary genetic divide between the northern and southern part of the range around the Dzungarian Basin—as previously identified using landscape models and fecal microsatellite markers—and a secondary divide south of Kyrgyzstan around the Taklamakan Desert. Most noteworthy, we find that snow leopards have the lowest genetic diversity of any big cat species, likely due to a persistently small population size throughout their evolutionary history rather than recent inbreeding. We also find that snow leopards have significantly less highly deleterious homozygous load compared to numerous Panthera species, suggesting effective purging during their evolutionary history at small population sizes. Without a large population size or ample standing genetic variation to help buffer them from any forthcoming anthropogenic challenges, snow leopard persistence may be more tenuous than currently appreciated.},

In a quasi-experimental, regression discontinuity design study, we examined associations of affirmative action in local governments for a historically marginalized group in India with health and education outcomes, using administrative health data, primary data in schools, and interviews. Exposure was 60 village clusters with, and nonexposure was 60 village clusters without, local leadership reserved for scheduled caste (SC) in 2021 local elections. Primary outcomes were infant mortality rate (IMR) and student test scores. Secondary outcomes were prenatal visits, mother tetanus vaccinations, prenatal supplement, infant vaccination, and teacher engagement in schools. Groups did not differ on socioeconomic, geographic, and service delivery indicators in 2020 (baseline). In 2023, 2.5 y after elections, exposure village clusters had lower IMR (0.46 IRR; [0.30 to 0.69]; P < 0.001), and exposure village clusters had significantly higher odds of two prenatal visits, two tetanus vaccinations, and prenatal supplement received by the second trimester. Exposure was not associated with maternal care in the first trimester or infant vaccination. Exposure was not associated with test scores, but teacher engagement was lower in exposure village clusters. Exposure group leaders reported higher discrimination than nonexposure group, and in follow-up interviews, they described more difficulty in working with teachers. Affirmative action in local governments in India predicted greater infant survival and improved prenatal health services, indicating benefits of addressing structural inequities. Lack of benefits for education outcomes might reflect social inequity of discrimination experienced by SC leaders.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in biotechnologies enable monitoring of biological systems with unprecedented resolution, yet identifying and interpreting biological signals remains a major challenge in clinical and research settings. Classically, biomarkers are measurable indicators of the state of biological processes. Given the large number of molecules in modern datasets, a major challenge is identifying the best biomarkers for a particular setting. Here, we apply observability theory to establish a general methodology for biomarker selection. We demonstrate that observability identifies biologically meaningful sensors in a range of time series transcriptomics data. To address unique biological constraints, we introduce the method of dynamic sensor selection to maximize observability over time, thus enabling observability over regimes where system dynamics themselves are subject to change. Our observability-guided biomarker discovery framework extends to multiple data modalities, as demonstrated with the joint use of transcriptomics and chromosome conformation data. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by evaluating the observability of neural activity measured in movies and electroencephalograms. These applications highlight the broad utility of observability-guided biomarker selection, spanning agriculture, biomanufacturing, and neural systems.},

  abstract     = {Lanthanide 4f electrons are strongly influenced by spin–orbit coupling, resulting in well-defined J multiplets, which are further split by the crystalline electric field in condensed matter. While the anisotropy of 4f electrons is closely linked to material properties, direct experimental observation of the 4f electron distribution in real space remains a significant challenge. Here, we present an approach for visualizing the anisotropic distribution of lanthanide 4f electrons in pyrochlore oxides by combining high-photon-energy X-ray diffraction and valence electron density (VED) analysis based on the core differential Fourier synthesis (CDFS) method. The observed VED distributions around the lanthanide site reveal the parameters of the ground-state wavefunction, which roughly agree with point-charge calculations for the trigonal crystal electric field under the LS coupling scheme. This CDFS-based VED observation method not only provides insights into the anisotropic nature of 4f electrons but also opens a pathway for studying the 4f states in a wide range of crystalline materials.},

  abstract     = {As experiments advance to record from tens of thousands of neurons, statistical physics provides a framework for understanding how collective activity emerges from networks of fine-scale correlations. While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information—providing a better description of the population—than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.},

With recent summers, like that of 2022, projected to become the new norm, there is a pressing need to further develop heat-health warning systems to help society adapt to a warming climate. Here, we forecast heat-related mortality by applying a statistical epidemiological framework to temperature forecasts extending up to 2 wk in advance. Focusing on two recent and exceptional summers in Europe, namely 2022 and 2023, we evaluate the skill of the daily heat-related mortality forecasts, and assess its association with temperature. For most of Europe, milder temperatures, close to the minimum mortality temperature, are associated with more skillful heat-related mortality forecasts. However, some of the hottest regions in Europe instead showed enhanced forecast skill associated with higher temperatures. This suggests that heat-related mortality forecasts can provide valuable information in European regions associated with high levels of heat-related mortality. Consequently, we advocate for local health authorities to include information from forecasts of heat-related mortality in their heat warning systems.},

  abstract     = {Autophagy is a crucial intracellular pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It involves forming double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, which deliver cytosolic cargoes to the lysosomes/vacuoles for degradation. Biogenesis of autophagosomes is a membrane-intensive process wherein the membrane expansion steps are poorly understood. The tethering complex, exocyst, canonically implicated in secretion, also participates in autophagosome biogenesis in yeast, plants, and mammals. However, the contribution of the exocyst complex in autophagosome biogenesis is unclear. In this study, using yeast temperature-sensitive mutants of the exocyst, we observed the accumulation of multiple abortive PAS incapable of autophagosome biogenesis. These dysfunctional abortive structures were enriched with core autophagy proteins involved in initiation and membrane expansion. However, the membrane expansion ability required for cargo capture was severely compromised in these mutants. Further investigations, including a comprehensive epistasis analysis, revealed that the exocyst plays a role downstream of the Atg1 complex. However, it was required at a stage before phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K complex I), Atg2–Atg18, and Atg12–Atg5–Atg16 complexes. Taken together, we show that productive PAS formation and membrane expansion during autophagosome biogenesis are exquisitely orchestrated by the autophagy-specific exocyst subcomplex, which excludes Exo70.},

Disrupted retinal homeostasis contributes to various ocular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinitis pigmentosa. However, noninvasive in vivo imaging methods to study the pathogenesis of these disorders remain limited. Here, we developed a two-photon microscopy technique for real-time, transpupillary in vivo visualization of the retinal neurovascular unit in mice. Our approach integrates systematic head fixation, a custom-made polymethyl methacrylate contact lens, and a glycerin immersion objective lens with an extended working distance and a higher numerical aperture, specifically designed for two-photon microscopy. This method enabled us to visualize dynamic microglial process activity around retinal blood vessels. Our results revealed that retinal microglia exhibit enhanced surveillance under diabetic conditions, which is undetectable by static confocal microscopy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist commonly used for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, reversed the enhanced microglial behaviors in the diabetic retina. Our simple yet effective approach mitigates the need for advanced optical systems like adaptive optics, providing an effective tool for real-time imaging of the retina. This method offers a valuable resource for visual neuroscience research and holds great potential for clinical applications, particularly in the early diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring of retinal diseases.},

  abstract     = {In the United States, like in other countries, the agrifood supply chain faces challenges from a growing population and less predictable weather conditions. Extreme weather events such as droughts decrease agricultural yield and harvested areas, impact the domestic trade of agricultural products and, in turn, food manufacturing. We investigate this relationship at the state level by estimating the food manufacturing production function in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation process. We first assess how drought affects trade in animals and fish, cereal grains, and all other crop products. Next, we estimate a nested production function for processed food. Our findings indicate that the impact of a drought is far from being confined to the area where it happens. At the national level, we find that a 1% increase in drought in the states producing agricultural commodities reduces their exports to other states by 0.5% to 0.7% which, in turn, reduces food manufacturing production by an average of 0.04%. The capacity to shift the origin of import flows, adjust their volume, and substitute agricultural inputs supports the resilience of the food manufacturing sector. We further estimate the 48 × 48 pairwise dependence across states and by commodity group. While cereal grain production is more spatially concentrated than other crops, the agrifood supply chain can enhance its resilience by sourcing from geographically diverse counties within key supplier states and improving multistate coordination. These findings provide important insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders willing to reduce the food system vulnerability to extreme weather events.},

  abstract     = {Oceanic islands are hotspots of both species extinctions and introductions, which led to marked changes in species composition. This may disrupt key ecological interactions, such as animal-mediated seed dispersal, with potential long-term impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning. While some recent studies on individual taxa and islands report functional shifts, there has been no globally comprehensive study of how these changes vary in intensity and direction across islands. Importantly, it remains unclear how changes in traits of animal communities actually translate to ecologically relevant mismatches with native plant species. We report widespread functional remodeling of frugivore communities based on frugivory-specific traits of all native, extinct, and introduced vertebrate frugivores (birds, mammals, reptiles) from 120 islands in 22 archipelagos. There is a trend for taxonomic and functional substitution, mainly of nonvolant terrestrial mammalian omnivores replacing large-gaped flying frugivores, which caused a mismatch between gape size and seed size. This shift in seed dispersal potential risks underestimation in single-taxon studies. Overall, vertebrate introductions outnumbered extinctions both in terms of species (44 vs. 23%) and islands affected (92 vs. 76%). Moreover, introductions have driven stronger shifts in frugivore trait space compared to extinctions. However, the general patterns are modulated by substantial spatial variation and idiosyncratic functional shifts within frugivore communities on some islands. This, coupled with differences in plant seed size distributions, leads to variability in realized functional mismatches among islands. These results emphasize challenges with predicting functional responses to anthropogenic activities, while highlighting that remodeling of ecosystem interactions is a global concern.},

  abstract     = {Activating the adra2a receptors of the brain’s norepinephrine (NE) system produces NREM-like sleep and hypothermia. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α2 receptor ( adra2a ) agonist, is an important drug used in intensive care for arousable sedation. But for some patients, even slight decreases in body temperature during sedation could pose health risks such as increasing the likelihood of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Where are the adra2a receptors at which DEX acts to induce hypothermia? A popular theory is that inhibitory adra2a receptors expressed on norepinephrinergic locus coeruleus (LC) neurons are DEX’s prime targets. To examine this, we genetically lesioned galanin ( gal )-expressing norepinephrinergic LC neurons in adult mice. In these ΔLC mice, baseline sleep–wake levels were unchanged, but surprisingly, core body temperatures were lower. Maintaining body temperature depended on NE/ gal projections from the LC to the medial preoptic (MPO) hypothalamus. Furthermore, without these LC neurons, DEX induced hypothermia more strongly. Knockdown with adra2a shRNA revealed that DEX induces hypothermia via adra2a receptors on MPO glutamate cells. When ΔLC mice were kept warm, DEX could induce the same amount of NREM-like sleep as well as it did for mice with an intact LC, and this sleep-like state in ΔLC mice had a higher delta frequency power than in control mice. Our results emphasize that inhibition of the LC by DEX is not required to induce robust sedation. By contrast, the LC likely has a fortuitous background action in protecting against drug-induced hypothermia and speeds recovery from hypothermia.},

  abstract     = {Photosynthetic organisms rely on sophisticated photoprotective mechanisms to prevent oxidative damage under high or fluctuating solar illumination. Cyanobacteria, which have evolved a unique, water-soluble light-harvesting complex—the phycobilisome—achieve photoprotection through a photoactivatable quencher called the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Phycobilisomes are highly symmetric and modular, formed by hierarchical assembly of conserved subunits into diverse geometries ranging from simple bundles to elaborate fan- or bouquet-like macromolecular architectures. Although OCP is known to provide photoprotection across species of cyanobacteria with different phycobilisome structures, it is not known whether or how these structural variations relate to changes in the photoprotective function of OCP. For example, OCP was recently discovered to bind as a dimer at two specific instances of an abundant structural motif on the tricylindrical phycobilisome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, yet these sites are sterically inaccessible on a more common pentacylindrical phycobilisome ( Anabaena sp. PCC 7120). To understand how structural modularity and binding specificity contribute to conservation of OCP binding sites and function across different phycobilisome architectures, here we compare experimentally measured photophysical states accessible to these prototypical tricylindrical and pentacylindrical phycobilisomes, with and without OCP, at the single-molecule level. Together with Monte Carlo simulations of exciton transfer in OCP-quenched phycobilisomes, our results suggest that OCP binds at distinct and specific sites in each type of phycobilisome, yet provides nearly identical quenching strength to both phycobilisomes. Our findings highlight the utility of modular phycobilisome structures in balancing robust conservation of photoprotective function with adaptability of site-specific binding across species.},

  abstract     = {Knowing the composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is crucial for constraining Jupiter’s bulk metallicity and formation history. Yet, constraining Jupiter’s atmospheric water abundance is challenging due to its potential nonuniform distribution. Here, we explicitly resolve the water hydrological cycle in Jupiter’s midlatitudes using high-resolution simulations. Falling precipitation leads to a significant large-scale depletion of water vapor beneath the lifting condensation level. A nonuniform water vapor distribution emerges in the midlatitude simulation with a changing Coriolis parameter across latitudes and spatially uniform cooling and heating. Water abundance at the 7-bar level varies by up to a factor of ten across latitudes, from subsolar to supersolar values. We propose that nonlinear large-scale eddies and waves tend to drift air parcels across latitudes along constant potential vorticity (PV) surfaces, thereby sustaining latitudinal dependencies in water vapor and the interplay between water distribution and large-scale dynamics. Therefore, water distribution is influenced by the vertical structure of density stratification and changing Coriolis parameter across Jupiter’s midlatitudes, as quantified by PV. Additionally, the water hydrological cycle amplifies the specific energy of air parcels through the latent heat effect, thereby slowing down vertical mixing with a latent heat flux. The horizontal gradient of water is expected to be more pronounced with a supersolar water abundance. We suggest that similar interplays between precipitating condensates, planetary rotation, and distribution of condensable species generally exist in the weather layer of fast-rotating giant planets. The ongoing Juno mission and future Uranus mission may further reveal the nonuniform distribution of condensed species and their interplay with large-scale dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Interferon-inducible Myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) proteins are known to restrict influenza A virus (IAV) transcription/replication process. Herein, we show that this early restriction was only partial against human IAVs, with later replication stages more strongly inhibited. Murine (Mm)Mx1 induced an abnormal nuclear accumulation of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) at late time points postinfection. This block was observed to a lower extent with human (Hs)MX1; however, HsMX1 strongly impacted cytoplasmic trafficking of de novo synthesized viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). Indeed, live imaging experiments revealed a transient association of HsMX1 with Rab11a-associated vRNPs, which induced their clustering and their dynein-dependent retrograde transport toward the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). There, vRNPs remained sequestrated together with cellular cofactors YBX1 and Rab11a in large clusters, while MX1 dissociated from them. Dynein inhibition prevented the vRNP clustering and sequestration and significantly rescued infectious IAV production in the presence of HsMX1. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of IAV vRNPs being rerouted and accumulated away from the plasma membrane through the coordinated action of HsMX1 restriction factor, dynein, and the microtubule network.},

  abstract     = {AI models have shown great potential in structure-based drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical prior: Atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid atomic collision, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such atomic collisions, we propose NucleusDiff. It enforces spatial distance constraints between atomic nuclei and auxiliary mesh points placed on a spherical surface around each atom, approximating van der Waals boundaries to reduce atomic collisions. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces collision rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing atomic collisions and improving binding affinities.},

By incorporating a scalable transformer architecture and a diffusion module for building block selection, SynFormer surpasses existing models in synthesizable molecular design. We demonstrate SynFormer’s effectiveness in two key applications: 1) local chemical space exploration, where the model generates synthesizable analogs of a query molecule, and 2) global chemical space exploration, where the model aims to identify optimal molecules according to a black-box property prediction oracle. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach via the improvement in performance as more computational resources become available. With our code and trained models openly available, we hope that SynFormer will find use across applications in drug discovery and materials science.},

Here, we first experimentally measure its thermal transport behavior from 20 to 300 K, after synthesizing Cs 3 Bi 2 I 6 Cl 3 single crystals. Using path-integral molecular dynamics simulations driven by machine learning potentials, we reveal that Cs 3 Bi 2 I 6 Cl 3 has large lattice distortions at low temperatures, which may be related to the large atomic size mismatch. Employing the Wigner formulation of thermal transport, we reproduce the experimental thermal conductivities based on lattice-distorted structures. This study thus provides a framework for predicting and understanding glassy thermal transport in materials with strong lattice disorder.},

The model, dubbed strongly constrained and appropriately normed-machine learning (SCAN-ML), reproduces accurately the potential energy surface derived from ab initio density-functional theory within the SCAN approximation for the exchange and correlation functional. A broad range of properties have been calculated relevant to ions in solution, solid phases, and the calcite/water interface. Careful comparison with results from experiments and semiempirical force fields shows that SCAN-ML provides an excellent description of this system, surpassing state-of-the-art force fields for many properties, while providing a benchmark for many quantities that are currently beyond the reach of direct ab initio molecular dynamics. A key feature of SCAN-ML is its ability to capture chemical reactions, which reveals that calcium carbonate ion pair formation occurs predominantly via binding of calcium to bicarbonate, with the subsequent loss of a proton to water, rather than by direct association. Our model thus paves the way for the ab initio study of reactive crystallization pathways in biominerals, which are currently poorly understood.},

  abstract     = {Modern machine learning (ML) models of chemical and materials systems with billions of parameters require vast training datasets and considerable computational efforts. Lightweight kernel or decision tree-based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized convolutional many-body distribution functionals (cMBDF) as highly compute and data-efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atomic densities weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on predefined grids. In the generalized form, each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo–lumo gaps, heat capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures, and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9, and VQM24 datasets. Due to its compactness, model training and testing times are reduced from 23 h to 8 min, implying a corresponding reduction in carbon footprint.},

Using this dataset, we train separate graph neural network models to predict the total number and individual identities of ligand coordinating atoms with high accuracy and precision. Interpreting each model in terms of the learned molecular representations uncovers trends aligned with our understanding of coordination chemistry as well as chemical insights. Next, we integrate the trained models with the high-throughput screening software molSimplify and illustrate their utility by generating 1,175 TMCs and validating their geometries with density functional theory calculations. We anticipate these models will accelerate computational screening of TMCs with de novo combinations of metals and ligands in physically realistic coordination.},

Over the course of the last several years, the artificial neural networks community has developed a class of networks called group-equivariant neural nets that can efficiently “bake-in” such symmetries into the structure of the network itself. Equivariant neural nets leverage ideas from group representation theory and express all variables in the generalized Fourier space corresponding to the underlying group. In this article, we review this formalism and derive the general form of operations allowable in equivariant neural networks. Specifically, we discuss why the Clebsch–Gordan transform appears in such architectures, and how it can play the role of an equivariant nonlinearity.},

It then covers widely used generative AI methods, including autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, flow models, and language models, and highlights their selected applications in diverse areas including force field development, and protein/RNA structure prediction. A key focus is on the challenges these methods face before they become truly predictive, particularly in predicting emergent chemical phenomena. We believe that the ultimate goal of a simulation method or theory is to predict phenomena not seen before and that generative AI should be subject to these same standards before it is deemed useful for chemistry.

  abstract     = {Although many internalized G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) continue to signal, the mechanisms and outcomes of intracellular GPCR signaling are uncertain due to the challenges of measuring organelle-specific signals and of selectively antagonizing receptors in intracellular compartments. Herein, genetically encoded biosensors targeted to the plasma membrane and early endosomes were used to analyze compartmentalized signaling of protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR 2 ); the propensity of nanoparticles (NPs) to accumulate in endosomes was leveraged to preferentially antagonize intracellular PAR 2 signaling of pain. PAR 2 agonists evoked sustained activation of PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 in early endosomes and activated extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) in the cytosol and nucleus, measured with targeted biosensors. Fluorescent dendrimer and core-shell polymeric NPs accumulated in endosomes of HEK293T cells, colonic epithelial cells, and nociceptors, detected by confocal microscopy. NPs efficiently encapsulated and slowly released AZ3451, a negative allosteric PAR 2 modulator. NP-encapsulated AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, rapidly and completely reversed PAR 2 , Gαq, and β-arrestin-1 activation in early endosomes and ERK activation in the cytosol and nucleus. When administered into the mouse colon lumen, fluorescent dendrimer NPs accumulated in endosomes of colonocytes and polymeric NPs accumulated in neurons, sites of PAR 2 expression. Both NP formulations of AZ3451, but not unencapsulated AZ3451, caused long-lasting analgesia and normalized aberrant behavior in preclinical models of inflammatory bowel disease. These results provide evidence that PAR 2 endosomal signaling mediates pain and that nanomedicines that antagonize PAR 2 in endosomes effectively relieve pain. NP-mediated delivery may improve the efficacy of other GPCR antagonists for treatment of diverse diseases.},

We implement the model using NVIDIA’s BioNeMo framework and validate its performance in retrospective functional prediction and prospective functional design. The model identifies a phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme with 2.5× catalytic activity over wild-type, and a γ -carbonic anhydrase enzyme with a melting temperature elevation of ΔT m = +61 ° C relative to the most thermostable sequence reported to date and activity in 23% v/v methyl diethanolamine at pH 11.25 and 93 ° C corresponding to industrially relevant conditions for enzymatic carbon capture technologies.

  abstract     = {The vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) has two great topographic divisions—brain and spinal cord—that together integrate the body’s internal physiology and behavioral interactions with the environment. To clarify the architecture of intra-CNS connectivity supporting this integration in a mammal (rat), network science analyses were applied at the level of gray matter regions (nodes) connected by directed and weighted axonal projections. Neuroanatomical evidence indicates a bilateral, predominantly sexually monomorphic neuronal network of 840 nodes and a projected 81,434 direct interconnections (of the 704,760 possible connections), representing a projected network density of 12%; 32% of identified connections terminate contralaterally, and 41% of identified connections participate in bidirectionally linking a pair of nodes. Local network differentiations examined with unsupervised multiresolution consensus cluster analysis revealed a nested hierarchy of interconnected modules (clusters or subsystems) that were conservatively assigned putative functional roles. This structure–function hierarchy includes only three first-order modules, indicating a tripartite systems architecture (distinct from the bipartite brain-spinal cord topographic division): a bilaterally symmetric module pair centered in the forebrain-midbrain, associated with behavior control, cognition, and affect; and a single bilateral module centered in the rhombicbrain-spinal cord, associated with behavior execution and reflex integration. This modular spatial patterning suggests possible developmental and phylogenetic correlates. Additional analyses of the CNS’s basic structural network plan included global neuronal network features—specifically, measures of centrality, rich club, and small world topology—that transcend modular boundaries.},

Conserved ExoN determinants for remdesivir recognition and excision underpin ExoN-mediated resistance across all coronaviruses. These findings inform the design of next-generation antivirals and combination therapies capable of overcoming ExoN-mediated resistance.},

  abstract     = {We previously demonstrated that the NO-stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC1), which produces cGMP, also has the ability to transfer S-nitrosothiols (SNO) to other proteins in a reaction involving oxidized Thioredoxin 1 (oTrx1). This transnitrosation cascade was established in vitro and involved Cys 610 (C610) of GC1 as the major SNO-donor. To assay the relevance of GC1 transnitrosation under physiological conditions and in oxidative pathologies, we studied a knock-in mouse in which C610 was replaced with a serine (KI αC 610S ) under basal or angiotensin II (Ang II)-treated conditions. Despite similar GC1 expression and NO responsiveness, the Ang II-treated KI mice displayed exacerbated oxidative pathologies including higher mean arterial pressure and more severe cardiac dysfunctions compared to the Ang II-treated WT. These phenotypes were associated with a drastic decrease in global S-nitrosation and in levels of SNO-Trx1 in the KI mice. To investigate the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of blood pressure, pressure myography and in vivo intravital microscopy were conducted to analyze the vascular tone of resistance vessels. Both approaches indicated that, even in the absence of oxidative stress, the single mutation C610S led to a significant disruption of the endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation while NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation remained unchanged. Mechanistically, the vasorelaxation defect was associated with decreased endothelial calcium influx and membrane hyperpolarization, independent of NO bioavailability. These findings indicate that the C610S mutation uncouples two NO signaling vasodilatory pathways (endothelial SNO and smooth muscle NO-cGMP) and suggest that GC1 transnitrosation activity is essential for endothelium-derived hyperpolarization.},

  abstract     = {Understanding processes driving local adaptation in wild species is a key goal in evolutionary biology, but linking genotype to phenotype to environmental drivers of natural selection remains challenging. Even more rare are empirical examples of what happens when genotype and phenotype fail to keep pace with environmental change. Here, we explore these connections by conducting an integrative study on the breeding range of the yellow warbler ( Setophaga petechia ). Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we first identify loci associated with variation in bill morphology and individual quality. We then employ gene–environment association (GEA) analyses and find that precipitation is a key environmental driver of putative selection on bill shape. Finally, we test whether contemporary individuals whose bill shapes deviate from the historical relationship with precipitation experience increased stress (measured by telomere length) as a result of maladaptation. We also use historical DNA to test whether local populations have shifted their ranges over the past century, confirming that the observed changes are not due to range shifts. Our results align with predictions from GWAS and GEA analyses, indicating that birds with shallower bills in increasingly arid regions suffer higher stress (i.e., shorter telomeres) because of maladaptation. Overall, this study links genetic, phenotypic, and environmental data with stress biomarkers to improve understanding of the process of local adaptation and the consequence of failing to keep pace with changing climate conditions.},

  abstract     = {Epithermal neutron resonance spectroscopy is a key nondestructive approach for discerning material properties. However, the existing spallation and accelerator-based photonuclear neutron sources employed in this spectroscopy are huge and immobile, restricting their application in specialized scenarios. Here, we demonstrate a compact short-pulsed photonuclear neutron source driven by a terawatt femtosecond laser–based electron accelerator. After moderation, this neutron source maintains an outstanding time-resolution of 0.8 μ s at 5 eV, and its energy resolution can be less than 3% at a flight distance 1.72 m. When this compact neutron resonance spectroscopy facility is utilized to examine silver (Ag) and indium (In) metal sheets with a high signal-to-noise ratio, it distinctly reveals the shape of resonance absorption peaks for 115 In at 1.46 eV and 109 Ag at 5.19 eV. This laser-driven electron accelerator offers a solution, overcoming traditional source drawbacks and holding great potential for on-site nuclear material analysis and high-precision nuclear data acquisition.},

  abstract     = {Human noroviruses (HuNoVs), especially GII.4 strains, are the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide, yet no approved vaccines or antivirals exist. The pandemic GII.4 Sydney 2012 strain enters cells via membrane wounding and clathrin-independent carrier-mediated endocytosis, but it is unclear whether this entry mechanism is conserved across GII.4 variants. We compared early binding and entry of multiple GII.4 variants using wild-type and mutant GII.4 virus-like particles (VLPs) and modified human intestinal enteroid cultures. Only a subset of GII.4 variants, including GII.4 Sydney, form distinct, histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-dependent capsid clusters on the cell surface. Clustering strains display significantly enhanced membrane wounding and endocytosis compared to nonclustering strains and outcompete nonclustering strains in replication assays exhibited by complete inhibition of GII.4 Sydney replication. Using mutant VLPs and an HBGA nonbinding mutant (R345A), we identified two residues, V333 and R339, in the VP1 protruding domain as critical mediators of clustering and entry. Mutations of these residues disrupt clustering and endocytosis without affecting HBGA binding, suggesting a role in postattachment processes. While clustering and endocytosis are contingent upon VLP binding to HBGAs, inhibitor studies show they are independent of host protein glycosylation and are driven by lipid raft remodeling regulated by cholesterol and ceramides. Quantitative analyses across multiple GII.4 variants reveal an apparent dichotomy between clustering and nonclustering phenotypes, with clustering variants exhibiting higher entry competence. This distinction offers insight into strain-specific cell entry mechanisms and may aid in identifying the elusive proteinaceous HuNoV cellular receptor(s) supporting targeted therapeutic development.},

We previously developed a bispecific antibody (bsAb), iMab/D5_AR, directed toward both the gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR) that is exposed within the HIV-1 PHI and toward CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells. CD4-binding led to prepositioning of the bsAb at the site of viral fusion, enhancing its neutralization potency and achieving 95% breadth (IC80 < 5 μg/mL) against a panel of 119 pseudotyped, multiclade HIV-1 viruses. In the current study, we engineered a bsAb against NHR that also targets CCR5, one of two HIV-1 coreceptors on T cells. This optimized bsAb design further improves neutralization potency and achieves 100% neutralization breadth against the 119-member pseudotyped virus panel, including those resistant to CD4-binding iMab/D5_AR. Considering that nearly all initial HIV-1 infections occur via CCR5-tropic viruses, we expect our redesigned bsAb targeting CCR5 to be an effective prophylactic agent. These findings further support the rationale for pursuing the NHR as a therapeutic target for HIV-1 and lay the groundwork for a new class of engineered broadly neutralizing antibodies.},

Increasing amounts of pesticides are entering the soil ecosystem, yet their potential influence on phage-mediated ARG spread, particularly under conditions of global change, remains poorly understood. In this study, we performed a long-term field experiment simulating pesticide contamination under nitrogen deposition and examined the role of soil phages in ARG spread and host adaptation using metagenomic and viromic sequencing. Combined pesticide markedly elevated the abundance of phage-encoded ARGs under nitrogen deposition. By enhancing phage–host interactions and increasing the co-occurrence of auxiliary metabolic genes with ARGs, phages may further facilitate the transfer of ARGs to bacterial hosts, conferring hosts a competitive edge in intensified microbial competition driven by combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition. The phage-driven mechanism was supported by in vitro cultivation experiments, demonstrating that phages harboring ARGs, shaped by long-term combined pesticide exposure under nitrogen deposition, can infect bacterial hosts and confer resistance. Collectively, our findings underscore the pivotal role of phages in ARG mobilization under environmental stressors, reinforcing the importance of accounting for phage activity in ARG risk assessments under global change.},

  abstract     = {Adhesion G protein–coupled receptors (aGPCRs) are key cell-adhesion molecules involved in many cellular functions and contribute to human diseases, including cancer. aGPCRs are characterized by large extracellular regions that could serve as readily accessible antigens. However, the potential of aGPCRs as targets for biologic therapeutics has not been extensively explored. CD97, also known as ADGRE5, is an aGPCR that is upregulated in various cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma (GBM), and their respective cancer stem cells. Here, we developed antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting CD97 and assessed their efficacy against AML and GBM cells. We generated a panel of synthetic human antibodies targeting distinct epitopes of CD97, from which we identified an antibody that was efficiently internalized. This antibody binds to all isoforms of human CD97 but not to its close homolog, EMR2. Structure determination by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy revealed that this antibody targets the CD97 GPCR autoproteolysis-inducing (GAIN) domain, whose presence is conserved in aGPCRs, through an unconventional binding mode where it extensively utilizes the light chain framework for antigen recognition. Screening of conjugation methods and payloads resulted in a stable ADC that effectively killed AML and GBM cell lines, as well as patient-derived GBM stem cells, with minimal cytotoxicity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of targeting CD97, as well as the aGPCR GAIN domain in general, and uncovers a previously unrecognized surface that an antibody can utilize for antigen recognition.},

While continuum models for postyield plastic flow are well established, a unified framework connecting preyield avalanche dynamics to bulk rheology remains lacking. Here, we introduce a birefringent double-shear experiment that enables sustained probing of avalanche statistics and quasistatic flow behavior near the yielding transition. We find that the avalanche regime exhibits rate-weakening behavior, while the plastic regime is rate-independent, resulting in dual rheology under identical local shear rates and indicating hysteresis and mechanical instability. Within a stress-activated framework, we identify the mean normalized stress drop, a measure for mesoscale avalanche size, as a key field variable that bridges the two regimes. Incorporating this variable, we formulate a unified constitutive model that captures the entire yielding transition. These findings establish mesoscale avalanche evolution as a central mechanism underlying granular yielding rheology.},

  abstract     = {Understanding complex living systems requires identifying universal phenomenological laws that are independent of species and molecular-biological details. The Monod equation is a cornerstone of phenomenological microbial growth laws, depicting the growth rate as a saturating function of a single substrate. Because of its similarity in functional form to the Michaelis–Menten equation, cellular growth is often thought to be limited by a single reaction. However, cellular growth generically results from the coordination of thousands of metabolic reactions and diverse intracellular limited resources. Consequently, the mechanistic origins of the Monod equation remain controversial, and its extension has encountered limitations. Here, we propose the global constraint principle for cellular growth: As one nutrient becomes more available, other intracellular resources become limiting, driving transitions to distinct modes of resource allocation. Based on a general framework of constraint-based modeling and its dual formulations, we mathematically prove that, in general, microbial growth kinetics curves are monotonically increasing and concave with respect to nutrient availability. Numerical simulations using genome-scale Escherichia coli models with proteome allocation, molecular crowding, and membrane capacity constraints reproduce these features in a multiphasic manner. In contrast to the original Monod’s growth law, the global constraint principle also captures the dependence of microbial growth on the availability of multiple nutrients, by generalizing the Liebig’s law of the minimum, another phenomenological growth law for higher organisms, into a terraced landscape of diminishing returns. It thus integrates the classical phenomenological laws proposed by Monod and Liebig into a comprehensive theory of cellular growth.},

  abstract     = {Biological tissues exhibit sharp phase transitions where cells collectively transition from disordered to ordered states at critical densities. We demonstrate through bio-chemo-mechanical modeling that this emergent behavior arises from a nonmonotonic dependence on nonlinear extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics: mechanical communication between cells is optimized at intermediate stiffness values where cells can both generate sufficient forces and create strain-stiffened tension bands in the ECM. This balance establishes a critical cell spacing threshold for cell–cell communication ( ∼ 100 to 200 μ m) that is conserved across experimental observations for a broad range of cell types and collagen densities. Our model reveals that the critical stretch ratio at which fibrous networks transition from compliant to strain-stiffening governs this threshold through the formation of tension bands between neighboring cells. These mechanical communication networks drive collective phase transition in tissue condensation when cell density exceeds an effective percolation threshold. Our model explains how microscale cell–ECM interactions control emergent mechanical properties in biological systems and offers insight both into the physics of inhomogeneous materials under active stress, and into potential mechanical interventions for wound healing and fibrotic disorders.},

  abstract     = {Sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disorder caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene, is characterized by sickle erythrocytes that are prone to hemolysis, leading to anemia and vaso-occlusion crises. In sickle erythrocytes, hemoglobin aggregation is followed by altered cation permeability and subsequent dehydration. Interventions that restore cation permeability can decrease hemolysis and ameliorate the symptoms associated with SCD. PIEZO1 is a nonselective mechanosensitive cation channel that regulates erythrocyte volume. Gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in PIEZO1 cause hemolytic anemia by increasing cation permeability, leading to erythrocyte dehydration in humans and mice. Although PIEZO1 plays a key role in erythrocyte homeostasis, its role in SCD remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the function of the PIEZO1 channel is upregulated in sickle erythrocytes of humans and mice, and this enhancement can be restored through a dietary intervention. We found that PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes resembles that of the GOF mutation causing hemolytic anemia. A diet enriched in the ω -3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acid decreases PIEZO1 activity in sickle erythrocytes, attenuates hemolysis, and reduces hypoxia-induced sickling. Furthermore, EPA reduces inflammatory markers. We propose that PIEZO1 contributes to the increase in nonselective cationic conductance (i.e., Psickle), which leads to dehydration downstream of hemoglobin polymerization. Our results suggest that reducing PIEZO1 function represents a promising therapeutic strategy to reestablishing normal cation permeability in SCD.},

  abstract     = {Tertiary plastids derived from diatoms in “dinotom” dinoflagellates offer a rare view of organellogenesis in action, while the genomic and metabolic processes underlying their conversion remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis of two dinotoms at different plastidial levels: Durinskia capensis at the kleptoplastidy state, alongside its kleptoplastid-source diatom Nitzschia captiva , and its close relative Durinskia kwazulunatalensis at an early permanent state. We show that in both dinotoms, the diatom nucleus retains high transcriptional autonomy, but its expression profile is plastid biased, signaling early host influence. In contrast, only D. kwazulunatalensis exhibits striking signs of genomic reconfiguration in the diatom nucleus: intron insertions, increased guanine (G) and cytosine (C) content, and growing nucleotide similarity to host transcripts. These shifts suggest an incipient nucleomorph-like transformation. Metabolically, only D. kwazulunatalensis expresses a complete hexose phosphate export pathway, suggesting deeper metabolic integration, while both species retain simpler carbohydrate transport routes. Additionally, we propose that diatom karyokinesis might be controlled by a dual mechanism via suppression of key transcription factors at the G1-S checkpoint and nitrate availability. Together, our findings reveal a continuum of plastid integration degrees, from temporary organelle theft to genomic accommodation and metabolic codependence. Dinotoms thus serve not only as evolutionary artifacts but as living laboratories, illuminating how kleptoplastids inch toward permanence.},

  abstract     = {Endogenous pathogens can constrain virulence to ensure survival in the host. Pathogenic state can be controlled by metabolic responses to the prevailing microenvironment; however, the coupling and effector mechanisms are not well understood. Flux through the one-carbon metabolism (OCM) pathway can modulate virulence of the oral pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis , and here we show that this is controlled by tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent differential partitioning of gingipain proteases. The OCM essential precursor pABA inhibits the low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and consequently relieves inhibition of its cognate kinase, Ptk1. We found that in the absence of pABA, reduced Ptk1 kinase activity blocks extracellular release of gingipains. Surface retention of gingipains confers resistance to neutrophil mobilization and killing, and virulence in animal models of disease is elevated. Reciprocally, Ptk1 and gingipains are required for maximal flux through OCM, and Ptk1 can phosphorylate the OCM pathway enzymes GlyA and GcvT. Further, ALP, an alkaline phosphatase involved in synthesis of DHPPP, which combines with pABA to make DHP, is phosphorylated and activated by Ptk1. We propose, therefore, that although the primary function of Ptk1 is to maintain OCM balance, it mechanistically couples metabolism with tunable pathogenic potential through directing the location of proteolytic virulence factors.},

  abstract     = {T cells can recognize a few molecules of cognate antigen among vastly outnumbering noncognate ligands. The T cell receptor (TCR) differentiates antigens based on antigen–TCR binding dwell time through a kinetic proofreading process. Historically, this has been modeled as the ligated receptor undergoing a series of reactions before producing a signal. In such a sequential mechanism, the number of steps is a key determinant of discrimination fidelity. Here, we consider two features of the molecular mechanism of TCR activation that diverge from a sequential process and suggest that an alternative kinetic proofreading mechanism may be at play. First, activation processes of multiple ITAM domains of the TCR represent parallel reaction sequences taking place on a single TCR molecule. Second, the states of the parallel proofreading reactions are integrated to produce a binary output from each TCR in the form of a discrete LAT condensation event, which may or may not occur. We examine a revised kinetic proofreading scheme based on parallel reactions followed by an integration step (multithread scheme) and compare its performance with the sequential scheme in a stochastic setting. A distinct difference in a multithread scheme is that multiplicity of the parallel reaction threads provides an additional means to increase discrimination fidelity. This relieves the need for fine-tuned kinetics among chemically distinct reaction steps, which is a major hurdle for physical implementation of a sequential mechanism. Lastly, we reinterpret previously reported experimental observations and find that various proofreading behaviors are well described as proofreading through parallel reaction threads.},

  abstract     = {Dark Stars (DSs), i.e., early stars composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium but powered by Dark Matter (DM), could form in zero metallicity clouds located close to the center of high redshift DM halos. In 2023, three of us identified (in a PNAS work) the first three photometric DS candidates: JADES-GS-z11-0, JADES-GS-z12-0, and JADES-GS-z13-0. We report here our results of a follow-up analysis based on available NIRSpec JWST data. We find that JADES-GS-z11-0 and JADES-GS-z13-0 are spectroscopically consistent with a DS interpretation. Moreover, we find two additional spectroscopic DS candidates: JADES-GS-z14-0 and JADES-GS-z14-1, with the former being the second most distant luminous object ever observed. We furthermore identify, in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, a tentative feature ( S / N ∼ 2 ) indicative of the smoking gun signature of DSs: the He II λ 1640 absorption line. In view of ALMA’s recent identification of a probable O III nebular emission line in the spectrum of JADES-GS-z14-0, the simple interpretation of this object as an isolated DS is unlikely. If both spectral features survive follow-up observations, it would imply a DS embedded in a metal rich environment, requiring theoretical refinements of the formation of evolution of DSs, which in previous studies were assumed to form in isolation, without any companions.},

  abstract     = {Biliverdin reductase A (BVRA), the terminal enzyme in heme catabolism, generates the neuroprotective and lipophilic antioxidant bilirubin. Here, we identify a nonenzymatic role for BVRA in redox regulation. Through phylogenetic, genetic, biochemical, and enzymatic assays, we found that BVRA exerts critical nonenzymatic antioxidant activity. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that BVRA physically and genetically interacts with nuclear factor erythroid-derived factor-like 2 (NRF2), a major transcriptional regulator of cellular redox signaling. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses reveal that BVRA and NRF2 coordinate the expression of antioxidant genes, many of which are typically dysregulated in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, this noncanonical BVRA–NRF2 axis controls an essential pathway of redox signaling in neuroprotection. Our findings position BVRA as a dual-function integrator of antioxidant defense across both lipophilic and hydrophilic compartments, bridging these two distinct modes of redox protection in the brain.},

  abstract     = {Trigger waves, self-regenerating fronts of biochemical activity that spread without losing speed or amplitude, are widespread in cell signaling. Apoptosis is one example of a process that propagates through the cytoplasm via trigger waves. Curiously, in some contexts, like synaptic pruning, apoptotic caspase activation is confined to specific subcellular regions. We hypothesized that at junctions between a thin cytoplasmic extension, like a dendritic spine, and a thicker one, like a dendrite, trigger wave propagation may be blocked even though diffusion is not, as a result of the general properties of trigger waves and bistable systems. This hypothesis was explored theoretically through modeling studies and dimensional arguments, which confirmed that trigger wave compartmentalization was possible and that the critical channel width required for compartmentalization was likely to be biologically relevant. These predictions were then tested experimentally with undiluted Xenopus egg extracts that were induced to undergo apoptosis. We found that channels that are less than a few microns in diameter are small enough to compartmentalize apoptosis, and that the critical width is inversely proportional to trigger wave speed. Thus, cellular projections and tubules can allow for the compartmentalization of biochemical states within a spatially continuous cytoplasm, a fundamental yet previously overlooked mechanism for controlling biochemical signaling and cellular functions.},

This is especially true for the higher-order cortex, where functional interpretations are constrained by narrow hypotheses and anatomical landmarks are often nonhomologous. We present a data-driven approach for mapping functional correspondence across species using rich, naturalistic stimuli. By directly comparing macaque electrophysiology with human fMRI responses to 700 natural scenes, we identify fine-grained alignment based on response pattern similarity, without relying on predefined tuning concepts or hand-picked stimuli. As a test case, we examine the ventral face patch system, a well-studied but contested domain in cross-species alignment. Our approach resolves a long-standing ambiguity by supporting a correspondence between macaque ML and human FFA and between AL and more anterior temporal cortex in humans. This result is consistent with full-brain anatomical warping but inconsistent with prior studies limited by narrow functional hypotheses. These findings show that natural image-evoked response patterns provide a robust foundation for cross-species functional alignment, supporting scalable comparisons as large-scale primate recordings become more widespread.},

  abstract     = {Neurons process information by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs along their dendrites. Understanding the computational principles underlying neuronal information processing requires a reliable measure of synaptic conductance dynamics that accurately represents the input sources before signal integration and processing. Prevailing approaches to measuring synaptic conductances typically employ a voltage clamp at the soma of a neuron and assume the neuron as an isopotential point when processing electrical signals. However, owing to the presence of the well-known space clamp effect, the measurement of synaptic conductances through these methods often leads to significant errors, impeding the elucidation of dendritic signal features and subsequent signal integration processes. To address this issue, here we first develop a two-step clamp method at the soma that separately recovers the mean and time constant information of local synaptic conductance on the dendrite with high accuracy when a neuron receives a single synaptic input. Furthermore, under in vivo conditions of multiple synaptic inputs, we propose an intercept method to extract effective net excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances from measurements of synaptic currents at the soma. Both methods are grounded in mathematical perturbation analyses of a conductance-based passive cable model and are validated across multiple biologically detailed multicompartment neuron models with active channels, including Purkinje neuron, pyramidal neuron, and fast-spiking interneuron. Results demonstrate that our methods effectively circumvent the space clamp effect, offering reliable means to assess the role of measured conductances and synaptic activity in neuronal information processing.},

  abstract     = {Hyperuniformity and giant number fluctuations represent opposite ends in a spectrum of statistical correlations found in physical systems outside of thermal equilibrium. Dynamic phase transitions exhibit critical points that are hyperuniform, while anomalously large fluctuations are often quoted as a hallmark of active matter. Here, we show that the apparently disordered state of active nematic defects exhibits suppression of fluctuations on scales as large as the system size, reminiscent of what is seen for ordered lattices. Modeling the nematic defects in terms of continuum densities, we show that their distribution becomes asymptotically hyperuniform in the limit where their proliferation is solely driven by activity, rather than by thermal fluctuations. When both effects are at play, the resultant hyperuniform structure is limited to a finite range of length scales, ℓ < ℓ × , with ℓ × → ∞ as thermal unbinding is suppressed. The system of active nematic defects can therefore be said to possess hidden order across scales provided ℓ is comparable to the system size. This organization is most pronounced when considering the subpopulation of either the positive or the negative defects, illustrating lack of multihyperuniformity. Our experimental findings are supported by hydrodynamic theory and agent-based simulations, which further allow elucidating the role of both creation/annihilation of defect pairs and of their mutual repulsion and attraction in achieving hyperuniformity.},

Through the use of FIB-SEM tomography, the electrode’s percolating fractal-like nano-carbon black network has been visualized at the nanoscale, providing insights into the theoretical energy storage capacity of this material. To reduce the required times for the production of functional electrodes, we also present a cast-in electrolyte approach, where centimeter-thick electrodes could be produced without the need for postcuring steps. In these prototypes, device performance scales linearly with electrode thickness and cell count, and a simple analytical model was developed to explain these scaling phenomena. Furthermore, the exploration of alternative ionic and organic electrolytes further contribute to improved electrochemical behavior, with the fabricated designs ultimately achieving a 10-fold increase in supercapacitor energy density compared to previous designs. Finally, we were able to fabricate a 12 V, 50 F supercapacitor module and a 9 V arch prototype that integrate energy storage into load-bearing architectural elements. These functional prototypes highlight the potential for real-time structural health monitoring, while demonstrating the potential of our ecˆ3 technology for the production of a scalable, high-voltage concrete energy-storing infrastructure.},

The emerging darkening of the NH relative to the SH is associated with changes in hemispheric differences in aerosol–radiation interactions, surface albedo, and water vapor changes. Cloud changes also contribute to a greater ASR hemispheric contrast, but the magnitude is small due to opposing trend differences in the tropics and extratropics. The break in hemispheric symmetry in ASR challenges the notion that clouds naturally compensate for forced hemispheric asymmetries in noncloud properties. Hemispheric (a)symmetry in radiation is linked with the atmosphere–ocean general circulation. How clouds respond to this hemispheric imbalance has important implications for future climate.},

  abstract     = {One of the reproductive barriers between diverging populations during formation of a new species is the sterility of their hybrids. The Prdm9- driven hybrid male sterility of Mus musculus musculus × Mus musculus domesticus hybrids depends on the interaction between PRDM9, a histone methyltransferase that determines the positions of meiotic recombination hotspots, and an as yet unknown X-linked genetic factor within the Hybrid sterility X2 ( Hstx2 ) locus. Here, we report that the Mir465 microRNA (miRNA) gene cluster is the predicted Hstx2 hybrid sterility factor. We show that removal of the Mir465 genes restores the fertility of sterile hybrids and improves meiotic synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Mir465 knockout also restores spermatogenesis in sterile chromosomal translocation carriers, demonstrating that Mir465 acts as a meiotic checkpoint that can be activated independently of Prdm9 intersubspecific incompatibility. Furthermore, the Mir465 knockout increases the global recombination rate in hybrids and in parental Mus m. domesticus mice. This demonstrates that Mir465 is responsible for the phenotypes of the two overlapping genetic loci, the Hstx2 engaged in fertility of hybrids and the Meiotic recombination 1 ( Meir1 ) controlling the recombination rate. The finding of enlarged Mir465 clusters in all European Mus m. musculus samples tested and the identification of differentially expressed targets suggest that the reproductive barrier between the two subspecies is sensitive to copy number variation of Mir465 genes.

  abstract     = {Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the fundamental electronic origin of compressed sodium’s melting temperature reversal under pressure, characterized by a maximum and a minimum in its melting curve, remains unclear. A recent two-state model proposed for high-pressure potassium, which exhibits a similar melting anomaly, attributes this behavior to changes in the distribution of non-nuclear localized electrons (electrides), resulting in distinct liquid phases. To test this hypothesis for sodium, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to examine its atomic dynamics and electronic properties under high pressure. Our results reveal no discontinuities in atomic or electronic transport properties, nor any evidence of multiple inherent structural forms. Furthermore, the electronic screening potential governing liquid structure remains largely unchanged above 50 GPa. Instead, we find that the key parameter responsible for the melting anomaly arises from differences in the average number of electrons per non-nuclear maximum, which affects the relative packing densities of the liquid and solid phases.},

  abstract     = {With the learning from living protein polymerization in nature, achieving living/controlled supramolecular assembly of biopolymers such as proteins in vitro is a longstanding challenge for material design. Herein, we provide a thiol-regulated interfacial protein aggregation (TRIPA) for unfolded protein systems with typical living polymerization features. By triggering globule proteins into the unfolded state through a reversible exchange reaction of disulfide bonds and sulfhydryl agents (R-SH), protein monomers are partially unfolded and assembled at the air–water/solid–water interface (AWI/SWI) through the entropy-driven adsorption and conformation transition. The process could be well repeated over time to form a two-dimensional (2D) nanofilm at the interface by following a pathway of monomer-oligomer-2D assembly. Similar to living polymerization, the film thickness exhibited a linear increase with the assembly conversion ratio of the monomers. With the stepwise addition of native protein into the reaction system, the thickness periodically increased in a linear manner. Such living/controlled supramolecular polymerization (LCSP) of protein at the interface leads to the synthesis of a nanofilm with well-defined flat morphology, ultrahigh modulus, and nano- to macroscale controlled thickness. The resultant protein nanofilm could then attach onto a variety of flexible and rigid material surfaces to produce a stable structural color coating. Compelling evidence in the present work thus underlines a demonstration of LCSP of biopolymers in vitro. It may hold a solid impact by opening a window for living/controlled polymerization of versatile biospecies such as proteins, saccharides, nucleic acids, and cells.},

To promote de novo production of BTEX from renewable feedstocks, we developed a chemobiological platform that integrates microbial biosynthesis with chemical deoxygenation. Four metabolically engineered Escherichia coli strains were constructed to produce one of four oxygenated precursors of BTEX—phenol, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, or 2,5-xylenol—from glucose or glycerol. After in situ two-phase extractive fermentation of the individual engineered strains using isopropyl myristate (IPM) as the organic solvent, the organic phase containing one of the oxygenated precursors was separated from the aqueous phase and subjected to distinct chemical deoxygenation reactions to reduce the precursor to the corresponding BTEX compound. This modular approach, based on the compatible organic solvent, streamlines biotransformation and consecutive chemical derivatization, providing a practical and viable route to sustainable BTEX production. The platform is extensible and provides a generalizable framework for integrating biosynthesis with chemical deoxygenation in hybrid bioprocessing.},

  abstract     = {Arguably, the most fundamental question in population ecology is what drives patterns in the abundance of populations? Small rodents exhibiting regular multiannual cycles in abundance have long been a test bed for addressing this question. The prevailing orthodoxy, the predation hypothesis, contends that nonmigratory, specialist predators are necessary, and specialist and generalist predators, combined, are both necessary and sufficient, for causing population cycles. Thus, variations in survival, from predation, are the key drivers of the cycles. However, this, and other competing theories, have hitherto lacked supportive demographic evidence and hence a solid evidential foundation. Here, we provide such evidence, analyzing 10 y of monthly data from a cyclic field vole population. We find, contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy, that recruitment, not survival, varied substantially from phase to phase in the cycles, made the major contribution to variations in population growth rate, and had cycle-phase-specific negative delayed density dependence. These results, their consistency with what is known from other systems, and the weak demographic foundations of the predation hypothesis, together suggest recruitment, specifically breeding-season length, not predation, as the cycles’ driving force. They therefore suggest that re-evaluation of the importance of the various determinants of population abundances, more generally, may be necessary.},

  abstract     = {Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) on histones play critical roles in cellular processes, including gene expression and tumorigenesis. However, the regulatory mechanisms and functional consequences of newly identified lysine acylation modifications in cancer therapy remain to be elucidated. Here, we established diverse preclinical tumor models resistant to epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) and focused on histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), as it exhibited more pronounced alterations compared to other acylations. Next, we identified acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 2 as a key regulator responsible for the resistance-associated decrease in crotonylation levels. Furthermore, integrated crotonylomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiling, supplemented by gene manipulation studies, revealed that EGFR-TKI resistance resulted from transcriptional suppression of HNF1A and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which were regulated by reduced histone H3 lysine 56 crotonylation. Importantly, through pharmacological screening, we identified a histone decrotonylase inhibitor that enhanced EGFR-TKI sensitivity by activating epigenetic reprogramming through the selective upregulation of histone Kcr levels across multiple models in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a previously unrecognized epigenetic mechanism driven by crotonylation that contributes to EGFR-TKI resistance, highlighting the potential of modulating crotonylation as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in lung cancer.},

  abstract     = {Site-specific DNA binding by proteins is critical for regulating transcriptional activity and cell fate decision. However, identifying proteins bound to specific genomic regions (e.g., promoter or enhancer regions) remains challenging. To address this, we developed a chemical epigenetic tool, named Site-specific noncanonical amino acid-mediated capture of protein (SCOPE), incorporating a photo-crosslinking amino acid into a nuclease-deficient dCas9 mutant. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying SCOPE enable the capture of proteins bound to, in theory, any genomic location, facilitating the study of the cell context–dependent DNA–protein interactions. Using SCOPE, we identified the OCT4/SOX2/CARHSP1 complex binding to the NANOG promoter to maintain pluripotency in hPSCs. During ectoderm differentiation, ZIC2 acts as a competitive inhibitor, binding the same promoter region to downregulate NANOG expression and promote differentiation. Additionally, SCOPE identified that ZNF8 binds to the distal regulatory region of OCT4 to maintain naïve pluripotency. In summary, SCOPE provides a robust system for uncovering cell context–dependent, site-specific genome regulators, offering valuable insights into gene regulation networks driving cell fate transitions.},

It can have a large impact on host–parasite interactions and investigating this effect is vital both for understanding current parasite distribution and epidemiology, and predicting how this will change in the future. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether temperature and precipitation have an overall effect on parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals. This is a phylogenetically controlled quantitative synthesis to assess parasite prevalence and infection intensity in terrestrial animals across contrasting temperatures and precipitation. We found large variation in the effect of temperature on parasite prevalence, precipitation on parasite prevalence, and temperature on infection intensity. This provides robust quantitative evidence against the controversial “warmer sicker world” hypothesis. There was no effect of climate on parasitism, irrespective of whether the parasite was an endoparasite or ectoparasite, or across different parasite lifecycles. Although some host and parasite taxa were understudied, we found no consistent taxonomic patterns. Importantly, we revealed large gaps in the literature, including the relationship between humidity, prevalence, and infection intensity. Ectoparasites and reptile hosts were also very underrepresented, and deserve further study. Focusing future research on these gaps will help to confirm whether certain types of host–parasite interactions are more or less sensitive to changes in climate, with implications for conservation.},

However, the complete repertoire of cargoes and regulators associated with individual AP complexes remains poorly defined. Intriguingly, AP-4-mediated TGN export operates independently of clathrin, suggesting the involvement of uncharacterized accessory factors in vesicle biogenesis. To address these gaps, we developed an in vitro vesicle formation assay using wild-type HeLa cells or cells deficient in AP1γ1 or AP4ε, reconstituting their roles in packaging their known clients, Vangl2 and ATG9A, respectively. Coupling this assay with label-free quantitative mass spectrometry, we mapped distinct cargo profiles for AP-1 (which buds from the TGN and ARF1-positive endosomes) and AP-4, identifying the 45 kDa calcium-binding protein (CAB45) as an AP-1-dependent cargo and the Type-1 angiotensin II receptor-associated protein (ATRAP) as an AP-4-dependent cargo. Additionally, we uncovered PRRC1 and WDR44 as cytosolic regulators essential for AP-4-mediated TGN export. Our study advances the mechanistic understanding of AP-1 and AP-4 in secretory trafficking and provides a robust strategy to systematically identify cargo clients and accessory factors for specific adaptor complexes.},

Hepacivirus ratti strain rn-1, which was discovered from Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and designated Norway rat hepacivirus 1 (NRHV1), shares similar properties with HCV in terms of genetic homology, target cell tropism, pathogenicity, and the immune response. In vivo infection systems for NRHV1 will help overcome the challenges in HCV research for vaccine development. However, the virological characteristics of NRHV1, such as the mechanisms of cell entry, remain largely unexplored, in part owing to a paucity of cell culture systems for NRHV1. Here, we identified the host factors that facilitate NRHV1 entry by profiling the gene expression of two cell lines with different susceptibilities to NRHV1 infection. NRHV1 employs rodent orthologues of HCV entry factors, including scavenger receptor class BI, CD81, and occludin, and utilizes claudin-3 (CLDN3) but not claudin-1. The expression of rat and mouse, but not human, CLDN3 facilitates the entry of NRHV1 into murine cell lines that are nonsusceptible to NRHV1 infection. The host-specific cell entry of CLDN3 is determined by two amino acid residues, Ile 44 and Trp 46 , in extracellular loop 1. These findings suggest that CLDN3 serves as an entry factor for rat hepacivirus.},

The separation between the viscous scale (the Kolmogorov scale) and the molecular mean free path ostensibly justifies a macroscopic description of reactive turbulence via the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations. However, here we use molecular-level simulations to demonstrate that exothermic bimolecular reactions can cause the NS description of turbulence to break down in the near-continuum regime. Sufficiently energetic heat-releasing reactive collisions strongly distort the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution function, modifying not only the macroscopic chemical rate law but the kinetic-energy-transfer processes as well. This translational nonequilibrium ultimately introduces significant departures from the NS description in the kinetic energy spectra at scales orders of magnitude larger than both the molecular mean free path and the Kolmogorov length scale. These departures prove substantial enough to meaningfully alter integrated quantities, including the overall turbulence kinetic energy itself.},

We demonstrate a wide-ranging and coordinated response to changes in intracellular heme in HEK293 cells through a network of complementary mechanisms that extend well beyond the direct regulation of heme biosynthesis and degradation. These responses connect changes in heme homeostasis to mitochondrial function, including core metabolic processes such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, as well as to enzymes involved in the control and storage of iron.

  abstract     = {There is a widespread belief, in both the scholarly literature and the popular press, that polygyny prevents large numbers of men from marrying by skewing the sex ratio of the marriage market. In turn, the exclusion of men from marriage is thought to lead to negative outcomes, e.g., by fueling crime and armed conflict. In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects. First, using a demographic model, we show that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine, under a range of realistic demographic scenarios, to sustain some level of polygyny without locking any men out of marriage. Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South. Overall, these findings challenge a dominant narrative linking polygyny to negative social outcomes. Drawing on existing evidence, we suggest that the observed patterns may be explained by an underlying association between the prevalence of polygyny and the strength of promarriage norms.},

  abstract     = {The ideal delivery of therapeutic nanoparticles (NPs) to specific sites requires evading immune clearance and selectively binding target cells. Wrapping NPs in cell-derived membranes has shown promise in improving targeted delivery, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Protein corona (PC) formation on NPs can significantly alter their biological identity to influence biodistribution, making its characterization on membrane-wrapped NPs (MWNPs) and unwrapped NPs crucial. In this study, we compared MWNPs incorporating membranes derived from megakaryoblastic CHRF-288-11 cells, which can accumulate in bone marrow (BM) and preferentially bind hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with unwrapped NPs. We investigated differences in PC composition, macrophage uptake, target cell uptake, and biodistribution in wild type (WT) mice and knockout mice that have low or absent expression of different opsonin proteins. In vitro, MWNPs with a PC exhibited increased target cell uptake and decreased macrophage uptake compared to unwrapped NPs with a PC. Proteomics revealed apolipoprotein B as the dominant opsonin on both NP types after incubation in mouse, bovine, or human serum, with other proteins like complement, immunoglobulins, and apolipoproteins also being present. Biodistribution studies indicated a complex interplay between the PC and targeting/clearance, where complement component 3 and immunoglobulin G adsorption on MWNPs led to macrophage clearance but also enabled HSPC targeting. Meanwhile, apolipoprotein E adsorption facilitated hepatocyte clearance but reduced immune cell uptake in the liver. Future research on PCs could determine whether these mechanisms are generalizable to other types of MWNPs, potentially revealing strategies to enhance their effectiveness as delivery systems.},

  abstract     = {Critical to our understanding of infections and their treatment is the role the innate immune system plays in controlling bacterial pathogens. Nevertheless, many in vivo systems are made or modified such that they do not have an innate immune response. Use of these systems denies the opportunity to examine the synergy between the immune system and antimicrobial agents. In this study, we demonstrate that the larva of Galleria mellonella is an effective in vivo model for the study of the population and evolutionary biology of bacterial infections and their treatment. To do this, we test three hypotheses concerning the role of the innate immune system during infection. We show that i) sufficiently high densities of bacteria are capable of saturating the innate immune system, ii) bacteriostatic drugs and bacteriophages are as effective as bactericidal antibiotics in preventing mortality and controlling bacterial densities, and iii) minority populations of bacteria resistant to a treating antibiotic will not ascend. Using a highly virulent strain of Staphylococcus aureus and a mathematical computer-simulation model, we further explore how the dynamics of the infection within the short term determine the ultimate infection outcome. We find that immune activation in response to high densities of bacteria leads to a strong but short-lived immune response which ultimately results in a high degree of mortality. Overall, our findings illustrate the utility of the G. mellonella model system in conjunction with established in vivo models in studying infectious disease progression and treatment.},

  abstract     = {Rare earth elements (REEs) are indispensable in modern technologies, but their supply chain faces challenges due to limited geographical availability and political difficulties. Recycling REEs from industrial waste provides a sustainable alternative to mining, promoting a circular economy and reducing environmental impacts. The mainstay approaches for REE recovery, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods, can be inefficient, consuming high energy and generating large aqueous and acid waste streams. Here, we introduce flash Joule heating (FJH) combined with chlorination (FJH-Cl 2 ) as an efficient method for REE separation and recovery by capitalizing on the free energies of formation (ΔG form ) of the metal chlorides and the boiling points of those metal chlorides. FJH-Cl 2 enables high-purity (>90%) and high-yield (>90%) REE recovery from waste magnets in a single step. Life cycle assessment and techno-economic analysis show that this process reduces the number of steps by 3× while reducing energy consumption by 87%, greenhouse gas emissions by 84%, and operating costs by 54% while eliminating water and acid use by 100% compared to traditional methods. This offers an environmentally friendly and economically viable pathway for sustainable REE recycling and recovery.},

Based on the knowledge of aluminum speciation, we elucidate four water interaction mechanisms in SAPOs, including Brønsted-acid interaction, coordination, reversible/irreversible hydrolysis, and capillary condensation. Contrary to conventional wisdom attributing SAPO degradation to Al-O-P hydrolysis, we clarify that desilication dominates structural collapse, establishing Si environments as catalyst durability descriptors. These mechanistic insights decipher the nature of SAPO interacting with water and its fundamental differences from aluminosilicate zeolite.},

  abstract     = {Nature offers a remarkable diversity of nanomaterials that have extraordinary functional and structural properties. Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green color. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris , develop as woven fibrillar structures, in contrast to the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibers, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue coloration. Our findings not only introduce a variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.},

The MEPAN mouse recapitulates the major hallmarks of MEPAN, including a movement disorder, optic neuropathy, defects in protein lipoylation, and reduced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in the brain. MECR catalyzes the last step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), and the mechanism by which loss of mtFASII leads to neurological disease is unknown. LC–MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of Mecr mutant cerebella identified loss of subunits of complex I of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and subunits of the iron–sulfur cluster assembly (ISC) complex. Native gels revealed altered OXPHOS complex and supercomplex formation and changes in binding of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) to mitochondrial complexes. These results demonstrate that MECR plays a key role in the acylation of ACP which is necessary for ACP-LYRM-mediated supercomplex modulation and ISC biogenesis and suggest unique pathways for therapeutics.},

  abstract     = {Climate change is altering the timing of species’ life-cycle events (i.e., phenology), but the rates of phenological shifts vary across taxa. These mismatches in phenological response may disrupt interactions between interdependent species, such as plants and their pollinators, which may lead to reduced plant reproduction via pollen limitation and thus contribute to secondary extinction risks for plants. However, secondary extinction risk is rarely assessed under future climate-change scenarios. Here, we used ca. 15,000 crowdsourced specimen records of Viola species and their solitary bee pollinators, spanning 120 y across the eastern United States, and integrated climate data, phenological information, and species distribution models to quantify the risk of secondary plant extinction associated with phenological mismatch with their bee pollinators. We further examined geographical patterns in secondary extinction risk for plants and explored how their interactions between plants and generalist versus specialist pollinators influence such risk. Secondary local extinction risk of Viola spp. increases with latitude, indicating that future climate change will pose a greater threat to plant–bee pollinator networks at northern latitudes. Additionally, the sensitivity of secondary local extinction risk to phenological mismatch with both generalist and specialist bee pollinators varies by latitude, with specialist bees showing a sharper decline at higher latitudes. Our findings demonstrate that existing conservation priorities based solely on primary extinction risk directly caused by climate change may be insufficient to support self-sustaining populations of plants. Thus, incorporating secondary extinction risk resulting from ecological mismatches between plants and pollinators into future global conservation frameworks should be carefully considered.},

To test whether CA2-CA1 connections might facilitate the interaction of social and episodic memories, we used models of behaving mice and in vitro electrophysiology that allow prior activation of CA2 by either novel social interaction or electrical stimulation before inhibitory avoidance training or induction of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in CA1. We show that social novelty promotes consolidation of CA1-associated memory, which was blocked by the selective chemogenetic silencing of CA1-projecting CA2 neurons. In both cases, CA2 priming was time-dependent, involved direct CA2-CA1 connections, increased expression of plasticity protein protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ), and promoted associativity via synaptic tagging and capture. Taken together, CA2-CA1 connections can significantly impact CA1 plasticity and memory consolidation. The inclusion of CA2 into hippocampal circuitry and function broadens the role of the hippocampus as an integrative memory hub.},

  abstract     = {Effective conservation genomics of endangered species requires realistic understanding of the fitness consequences caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in declining populations. We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution. By linking genotype to phenotype via advanced molecular biology tools in a non-model species of conservation concern, this study highlights the need to fully integrate genomics and molecular experimental approaches in modern conservation biology.},

  abstract     = {This study investigates propeller hydrodynamics at intermediate Reynolds numbers ( Re ), crucial for small-scale robotic systems but still uncharted. Experiments on a propeller-driven underwater vehicle and numerical simulations reveal thrust reversal—a phenomenon where clockwise propeller rotation leads to backward motion—in the approximate range 1.3 ≲ Re ≲ 150 under specific conditions. Notably, counterclockwise rotation consistently results in backward motion. Simulations reveal that this behavior arises when centrifugal suction, an inward force along the axis caused by radial outward flow from the propeller’s rotation, dominates over fluid backward acceleration, the primary thrust mechanism at high Re . These findings provide critical insights into the unique dynamics of the intermediate Re regime and inform the design of efficient propulsion systems for miniature aquatic robots.},

  abstract     = {Pre-mRNA splicing is kinetically coupled to transcription as shown by the widespread effects of transcription speed on alternative splicing (AS) outcomes. The molecular basis for such kinetic coupling is incompletely understood, but one potential mechanism is through elongation rate–dependent alternative folding pathways of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). To search for RNA structures in nascent pre-mRNA, we modified Sequencing of Psoralen Crosslinked, Ligated And Selected Hybrids (SPLASH) [J. G. Ashley Aw et al. , Mol. Cell 62 , 603–617 (2016)] for use with C hromatin A ssociated R NA. We applied this method called Chromatin Associated RNA (CAR)-SPLASH to cells expressing wild-type and slow mutant RNA polymerase II and identified >3,000 intramolecular RNA duplexes of which >400 are proximal to splice sites. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) disruption of several such duplexes that sequester splice sites has a major impact on AS outcomes, even though the ASOs do not directly disrupt splice sites. ASO disruption of these regulatory elements that we designate “RNA kinetic switches” modified AS of NISCH Exon 18, GAK Exon 7, and MEGF8 Exon 14 in a way that depends on the rate of transcription elongation. We propose that these switches mediate kinetic coupling via the effects of transcription speed on folding of nascent RNA structures that modulate AS and that many nascent RNA structures can thereby serve as targets for splice-modifying ASOs.},

  abstract     = {Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form chromatin modifying complexes that stably repress lineage- or context-specific genes in animals, plants, and some fungi. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) to assemble repressive chromatin. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, H3K27me3 deposition is regulated by the H3K36 methyltransferase ASH1 and components of constitutive heterochromatin including the H3K9me3-binding protein HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1). Hypoacetylated histones are a defining feature of both constitutive heterochromatin and PcG-repressed chromatin, but how histone deacetylases (HDACs) contribute to normal H3K27me3 and transcriptional repression within PcG-repressed chromatin is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen to identify HDACs required for repression of PRC2-methylated genes. In the absence of HISTONE DEACETYLASE-1 (HDA-1), PRC2-methylated genes were activated and H3K27me3 was depleted from typical PRC2-targeted regions. At constitutive heterochromatin, HDA-1 deficient cells displayed reduced H3K9me3, hyperacetylation, and aberrant enrichment of H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. CHROMODOMAIN PROTEIN-2 (CDP-2) is required to target HDA-1 to constitutive heterochromatin and is also required for normal H3K27me3 patterns. Patterns of aberrant H3K27me3 were distinct in isogenic ∆ hda-1 strains, suggesting that loss of HDA-1 causes stochastic or progressive epigenome dysfunction. To test this, we constructed a new Δhda-1 strain and performed a laboratory “aging” experiment. Deletion of hda-1 led to progressive epigenome decay over hundreds of nuclear divisions. Together, our data indicate that HDA-1 is a critical regulator of epigenome stability in N. crassa.},

  abstract     = {Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) have been identified to associate with various neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. Damage to MLVs can exacerbate the pathological progression of these diseases and significantly impede therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, targeted repair of the damaged MLVs has emerged as an innovative strategy for treating these central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In this study, we find that inorganic Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles, rather than conventional endogenous vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), can repair the damaged MLVs to restore their structure and functions. These nanoparticles not only promote the growth and development of lymphatic vessels but also enhance the drainage capacity of impaired MLVs, thereby facilitating the transport of immune cells and macromolecules through these vessels. Unlike the conventional repair of damaged MLVs, this is an instance where inorganic nanoparticles have been explored to stimulate the expression of VEGF-C and its receptor VEGFR3, thereby promoting the structural and functional recovery of these vessels. The enhanced drainage function of MLVs mediated by Cu 2− x Se nanoparticles significantly alleviates the symptoms of pre-formed fibrils (PFFs)-induced Parkinson’s disease in mice. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that inorganic nanoparticles can promote the growth and development of meningeal lymphatics like VEGF-C, providing a cost-effective and innovative strategy for repairing damaged MLVs to boost the therapeutic efficacy of CNS diseases.},

  abstract     = {Modularity among traits is thought to drive morphological evolution and diversification, with more modular species often showing greater morphological disparity and faster evolutionary rates. However, recent studies suggest this pattern is not universal, as higher integration can sometimes be linked to faster rates of evolution. In adaptive radiation, modularity likely facilitates morphological divergence, but its specific role in trait diversification within these events remains uncertain. Antarctic icefishes (Perciformes: Notothenioidei) have undergone adaptive radiation in the frigid Southern Ocean, yet the role of modularity in their craniofacial evolution remains poorly understood. Emerging from a common ancestor 22 Mya, these fishes developed unique morpho-physiological adaptations, such as antifreeze glycoproteins, that contributed to their evolutionary success, but the contribution of cranial modularity to their diversification is still unexplored. Here, we analyze skull shape across 172 perciform species using micro-CT scanning and geometric morphometrics to investigate the tempo and mode of skull evolution in 80 notothenioids versus 92 perciform relatives. Notothenioids exhibit considerable cranial shape diversity, with skull shapes ranging from short to long faces. Fast rates of skull shape evolution occurred in smaller subclades following the emergence of cranial elongation, a derived trait within notothenioids. They also exhibit elevated evolutionary modularity relative to their perciform relatives, with reduced covariation among skeletal elements over time, likely corresponding with Miocene cooling events and the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We propose that greater phenotypic modularity in notothenioid skulls represents a pivotal innovation, facilitating their evolutionary response to new ecological opportunities in the Antarctic.},

  abstract     = {The homeostatic link between the production of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and mitophagy plays a significant role in how cells respond to various physiological and pathological conditions. However, it remains unclear how cells translate oxidative stress signals into adaptive mitophagy responses. Here, we show that mtROS act as signaling molecules that activate the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-cell cycle checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), a DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. When activated, CHK2 regulates three critical steps in mitophagy. First, CHK2 phosphorylates mitochondrial membrane protein ATAD3A at Ser371, which inhibits the transport of PINK1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane and leads to the accumulation of PINK1 and the commencement of mitophagy. Second, activated CHK2 targets the autophagy adaptor OPTN at Ser177 and Ser473, thereby enhancing the targeting of ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes. Finally, CHK2 phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser90 and Ser93, hence promoting the formation of autophagosomal membranes. Consistent with these effects, Chk2 −/− mice show impaired mitophagic induction and impaired recovery in a ROS-dependent model of renal ischemia–reperfusion. Our study reveals a mtROS-triggered adaptive pathway that coordinates mitophagic induction, in order to protect cells and tissues exposed to pathophysiological stress-induced damage.},

  abstract     = {Changes in bacterial colony morphology are common during chronic human infections and are thought to provide a survival advantage. In the human pathogen Mycobacteroides abscessus (MAB), a unidirectional transition from a smooth (MAB S ) to rough (MAB R ) morphotype frequently occurs during chronic infection. This transition has profound clinical implications, as MAB R induces a heightened proinflammatory response, contributing to increased morbidity. To better understand this phenomenon, we used transposon insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes essential for the survival of MAB S and MAB R . Our analysis revealed distinct genetic requirements for growth in vitro, including several genes involved in responding to environmental stresses. Notably, some of these uniquely essential genes are therapeutic targets in mycobacteria. In a murine infection model, the divergence in essential gene profiles between MAB S and MAB R was even more pronounced, driven partly by the differing host immune responses elicited by each morphotype. These findings demonstrate that the transition from a smooth to rough morphotype not only impacts MAB’s survival strategies but also highlights the importance of considering morphotype-specific genetic and functional adaptations when developing therapeutic approaches. Our work underscores the critical need to incorporate morphotype conversion into the prioritization of drug targets, as targeting morphotype-specific vulnerabilities could improve treatment outcomes for infections caused by this pathogen.},

  abstract     = {One of the most fascinating mysteries in the field of origins of life concerns the driving force that led to the selection of today’s 20 universal L -alpha amino acids in biology. An essential aspect of life’s emergence involves the formation of compartments, which offer encapsulation for target molecules and provide protection from hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Thus, polymers capable of assembly may have had a chemical evolutionary advantage over polymers that lacked this ability. We postulated that primordial peptide assembly could be one of the driving forces that led to the chemical selection of alpha amino acids in life today. To test this hypothesis, we generated depsipeptides, oligomers composed of ester bonds and peptide bonds that form readily under mild drying conditions, as model prebiotic peptides. However, it is unknown whether depsipeptides form assemblies in an aqueous environment similarly to peptides and proteins. To test the hypothesis that depsipeptides with alpha backbones will form assemblies more readily than beta backbones, we synthesized depsipeptides using a matrix of eight alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and six alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amino acids. The reaction products were analyzed by microscopy and a physical stability analyzer to study assembly formation as well as various analytical techniques for chemical analysis. Our results demonstrate assembly formation in depsipeptide systems containing hydrophobic hydroxy acids and indicate that depsipeptide assemblies containing alpha hydroxy acid backbones are significantly more stable than beta analogs. Overall, our results offer an assembly-driven mode of selection for the alpha backbone in present-day biology.},

We created numerous electrical models with diverse firing patterns. By analyzing these models, we identified intricate relationships between model parameters and electrical features. Our findings show that neuronal activity is often influenced by multiple biophysical model parameters, in a nonadditive (i.e. synergistic) fashion. When comparing this with single-cell RNAseq data, we found a contrasting structure: gene expression profiles were dominated by redundancy, reflecting differences in regulatory constraints and sampling diversity.

  abstract     = {As climate change makes agricultural production shocks more frequent and severe, it is vital to understand their effect on farmer welfare, land use, and deforestation. Theoretically, a change in agricultural productivity could increase or decrease deforestation by changing demand for agricultural land and/or through the consumption of forests as a coping strategy. This paper uses the introduction of a crop pest to sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the effect of a negative agricultural productivity shock on deforestation. Using primary household data, we first find that farmers who were exposed to higher levels of fall armyworm saw substantial decreases in yield and food security. Using estimates of fall armyworm suitability in conjunction with machine-learning models of maize yields and deforestation, we find that the introduction of the fall armyworm induced a doubling of the deforestation rate in Zambia in the 3 y following the outbreak. This increase was driven both by increased agricultural land expansion and increased charcoal production as a coping strategy. These responses vary substantially over space. More remote areas experienced 23% lower FAW-induced deforestation compared with the sample average, suggesting that farmers with access to maize and charcoal markets may have increased deforestation as a response. Wealthier areas were also less likely to deforest in response to FAW pressure. In sum, our results suggest that negative agricultural productivity shocks may lead to a negative climate feedback, with farmers engaging in emissions-increasing strategies in response.},

  abstract     = {Genetic association links disordered autoimmunity 1 (DIORA1) to numerous autoimmune rheumatic diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyositis, and systemic sclerosis. However, its cellular function has remained unknown. Here, we identify the Myotonic Dystrophy Kinase-Related Cdc42-Binding Kinases (MRCK kinases) family of serine/threonine kinases—key regulators of actomyosin contractility and cell motility—as direct interactors of DIORA1. Through interaction mapping, we show that DIORA1 binds three distinct modules of MRCK kinases, including the conserved kinase inhibitory motif, C1-PH, and citron homology domains. DIORA1 knockdown in human cells altered cellular phosphorylation patterns and reduced phosphorylation of known MRCK targets. RNA-sequencing and proteomic analyses revealed upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition genes and proteins, and functional analyses confirmed increased cell invasion, following knockdown of DIORA1. Together, these findings identify the autoimmunity-associated DIORA1 protein as an interactor of MRCK kinases and a regulator of cell motility.},

  abstract     = {Monoclonal antibodies are among the most promising therapeutic agents in modern medicine, yet their formulation into high-concentration solutions for subcutaneous self-administration poses a major challenge. A key obstacle is the marked increase in viscosity often observed under these conditions. To gain deeper insights into this phenomenon, coarse-grained models derived from soft matter physics have been widely employed. However, these models have yet to be fully leveraged for analyzing the rheological collective properties of such systems. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we directly compute the antibody solution viscosity by starting from commonly used models in which electrostatic interactions are treated through effective screened Coulomb potentials. We demonstrate that this approach fails to reproduce experimental evidence and we show, by analyzing stress correlations in the system, that it is necessary to treat the heterogeneously charged domains with explicit Coulomb interactions, also including counterions and salt ions. By thoroughly analyzing the microscopic structure of the system, we further reveal the presence of transient strongly correlated antibodies which would not be present if charges were treated implicitly, thus pointing to a prominent role of electrostatics in determining the increase in viscosity at high concentrations. By taking advantage of our realistic treatment, new approaches can be devised to ensure that antibody solutions exhibit the desired characteristics for their intended broad use and effective deployment.},

  abstract     = {The Ganga River basin, critical to over 600 million people, is experiencing a severe and unprecedented drying trend, threatening water and food security. Using streamflow reconstructions spanning 1,300 y (700–2012 C.E.) from instrumental data, paleohydrological records, and hydrological modeling, we show that drying from 1991 to 2020 is unmatched in the past millennium. Streamflow decline since the 1990s, driven by frequent and prolonged droughts, is 76% more intense than the 16th-century drought—the closest historical analogue. This drying exceeds natural variability, highlighting the dominant role of anthropogenic factors. Despite CMIP6 models projecting increased streamflow under warming scenarios, the recent decline indicates complexities associated with future water availability projections. Our findings underscore the urgent need to examine the interactions among the factors that control summer monsoon precipitation, including large−scale climate variability and anthropogenic forcings. Better constraints on these processes in climate models will be essential for improving future monsoon projections and implementing adaptive water management strategies to secure the Ganga basin’s freshwater availability under a changing climate.},

  abstract     = {The formation and organization of southeastern Tibetan river systems reflect feedbacks between tectonics, climate, and landscape evolution. However, our understanding of these interactions remains unclear. We approach this issue from the view that the river incision histories and their bedload provenance provide complementary evidence for reconstructing the evolution of the ancient river system. Zircon and apatite (U-Th)/He data from the middle Jinsha (upper Yangtze) River gorge reveal two episodes of accelerated river incision at 18-17 Ma and 8-7 Ma. The onset of the former incision event, coeval with other incision events along the upper-middle Jinsha and Lancang Rivers, implies their hydrological connection and formation of a south-flowing river system. Additionally, detrital geochronology and thermochronology data of late Oligocene–Miocene fluvial-alluvial sediments along the Red River valley provide constraints on their ages and provenance, suggesting emergence of a throughgoing paleo-Red River in the early-middle Miocene. This ancient Red River was disconnected from the upper Jinsha River but connected with Yalong River (upper Yangtze tributary), forming another south-flowing river system. Landscape evolution modelling supports the view that these south-flowing rivers were successively captured by the westward-propagating Yangtze River in the middle-late Miocene, giving birth to the modern drainages of southeastern Tibet. The resultant integration of the upper-middle and lower Jinsha River is manifested by the progressively upstream-propagating acceleration in river incision from 13-9 Ma to 6-5 Ma along the gorges. Our findings from southeastern Tibet suggest that orogen-scale topographic change, river reorganization, and a coeval increase in biodiversity were driven by extrusion tectonics.},

  abstract     = {Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena. Yet in practice, prizes may inadvertently divert resources from similarly impactful but less celebrated scholars. Despite this paradox, and even as prizes proliferate, knowledge of how prizewinning relates to innovation is nascent. Analyzing 2,460 worldwide prizes, we compared the innovativeness of over 23,000 prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners whose performance records were statistically equivalent up to the prize year. First, we find that prizewinners are more innovative. Their research is more likely to combine existing ideas in new ways, integrate a topic’s historical and contemporary thinking, and incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives. Second, although prizewinners and matched nonprizewinners have statistically equivalent impact and productivity records up to the prize year, at about five years before the prize, prizewinners’ papers become more innovative than their matched peers. This difference widens each year, peaks during the prize year, and then persists for the remainder of their careers. Third, network embeddedness predicts unusual innovativeness. Compared to nonprizewinners, prizewinners’ collaborations are shorter in duration, encompass wider exposure to unfamiliar topics, and involve coauthors whose networks minimally overlap with each other. The findings’ implications for innovation in science and the efficacy of reward systems and innovation in science are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Diverse factors, including environmental features and cognitive processes, can drive animals’ movements and space use, with far-reaching implications. For example, repeated use of individual-level travel routeways (directionally constrained but imperfectly aligned routes), which results in spatial concentration of activity, can shape encounter-based processes including predation, mate finding, and disease transmission. However, how much variation in routeway usage exists across species remains unknown. By analyzing GPS movement tracks for 1,239 range-resident mammalian carnivores—representing 16 canid and 18 felid species from six continents—we found strong evidence of a clade-level difference in species’ reliance on repeatedly used travel routeways. Across the global dataset, tracked canids had a 15% (±7 CI) greater density of routeways within their home ranges than did felids, rising to 33% (±16 CI) greater in landscapes shared with tracked felids. Moreover, comparisons within species across landscapes revealed broadly similar home range routeway densities despite habitat differences. On average, canids also reused their travel routeways more intensively than did felids, with hunting strategies and spatial contexts also contributing to the intensity of routeway usage. Collectively, our results suggest that key aspects of carnivore routeway-usage have an evolutionary component. Striking interspecific and clade-level differences in carnivores’ reliance on reused travel routeways within home ranges identify important ways in which the movement patterns of real-world predators depart from classical assumptions of predator-prey theory. Because such departures can drive key aspects of human-wildlife interactions and other encounter-based processes, continued investigations of the relationships between movement mechanisms and space use are critical.},

  abstract     = {The prioritization of market over nonmarket values of nature is a key driver of the global biodiversity crisis. Recognizing nature’s diverse values in decisions is a fundamental lever for sustainability transformation. While economic valuation of nature has a long history, it has struggled to recognize the full suite of nature’s values, particularly the broad, relational, intrinsic, and shared values reflecting the complexity of human–nature relationships. We explore opportunities to expand the consideration of values within the economics of biodiversity by reviewing conventional and heterodox economic approaches. We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames. Our perspective transcends the dominant economic framing of nature as a passive, largely substitutable asset, to also consider nature as place, self, and harboring agency. This helps to overcome the limitations of conventional economic assumptions, better reflects peoples’ lived experiences, and supports transformations toward more just and sustainable futures.},
