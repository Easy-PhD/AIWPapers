  abstract     = {The Poisson regression model is widely used in statistical data modeling in diverse fields, such as epidemiology, economics, engineering, and sports. Its popularity stems from its ability to effectively describe the relationship between a statistical response variable and a set of explanatory variables. However, multicollinearity among predictors and outliers in the data can severely affect the reliability of parameter estimation, leading to inflated variances and biased results. Multicollinearity increases the sensitivity of estimators to small changes in the data, while outliers can disproportionately affect the model fit, especially in the maximum likelihood estimation framework. To address these issues, robust biased estimation techniques, such as the ridge estimator and modified ridge-type estimator, have been introduced to mitigate multicollinearity by introducing shrinkage parameters. However, the transformed M-estimator remains sensitive to outliers. In this study, we propose robust and non-robust modified Liu estimators for the Poisson regression model. The non-robust method reduces the effect of multicollinearity by developing a Liu estimator, while the proposed robust method combines transformed M-estimation with a modified form of the Liu estimator to simultaneously address multicollinearity and reduce the influence of outliers. We derive the theoretical properties of the estimators and investigate their performance through extended Monte Carlo simulations. The results indicate that the non-robust modified Liu estimator provides more stable and accurate estimates than maximum likelihood estimation, ridge estimator, and modified ridge-type estimators in the case of multicollinearity, but the robust version of the modified Liu estimator generally outperforms, especially in the presence of both multicollinearity and outliers. We also analyze a real-world dataset to demonstrate the practical value of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the widespread increase of online reviews, sentiment classification is now a fascinating study in both academic and industrial research. Annotated training data is difficult to obtain, so reviews help in many domains. Numerous methods have been created for sentiment classification, but the process of retrieving information is not exact, less effective, and has a slower rate of convergence. To overcome these problems, this research proposes and evaluates a novel technique for information retrieval and sentiment classification called Dynamically Stabilized Recurrent Neural Network Optimized with Binary Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA). This approach seeks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment analysis by integrating advanced optimization techniques and also to address the challenges such as slow convergence and inefficiency in sentiment analysis, ultimately achieving superior performance metrics. The input data is gathered through Amazon unlocked mobile reviews database and telecom tweets for sentiment categorization with information retrieval. Afterward, the data is fed to the preprocessing. By using the Unscented Trainable Kalman Filter, the preprocessing process removes noise from reviews by fixing typos and removing ellipsis. These pre-processed data is fed to Adaptive and Concise Empirical Wavelet Transform (ACEWT) to extract the features, such as elongated words, punctuation, hash tag, numerical values. The extracted features are given to the DSRNN which classifies the sentiment, like neutral, positive and negative. In general, DSRNN does not show any optimization adaption methods to determine the optimum parameter to offer accurate sentiment classification. Therefore, Binary Emperor Penguin Optimization Algorithm (BEPOA) is proposed to optimize the DSRNN classifier that categorizes the sentiment precisely. Attention Enhanced Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (AETGCN) method is used to extract the necessary review. The proposed SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA is implemented in MATLAB. To classify the sentiment, the performance metrics, like Precision, Accuracy, F1-score, Recall (Sensitivity), Specificity, Error rate, Computation time, False Alarm Rate, RoC is considered. The performance of the SCIR-DSRNN-BEPOA approach attains 20.11%, 21.12%, 27.73% higher accuracy, 11.13%, 23.04%, 9.51% lesser computation time, 15.29%, 19.43%, 12.45% greater ROC, 28.65%, 23.98%, 27.03% lower false alarm rate when compared with existing methods: Deep Learning improved spider monkey crow optimization algorithm for sentiment analysis and information recovery (SCIR-DRNN), Deep Learning topical level sentiment analysis of social media data (SCIR-LSTM), and a machine learning-based term weighting and feature selection strategy for sentiment analysis of online product evaluations (SCIR-ENN).},

  abstract     = {In recent days, e-commerce platforms have grown at an unexpected level worldwide. These sites usually rely on recommendation algorithms, which employ user terms to identify related goods or products. Most e-commerce applications are based on customer reviews, which are knowledge-based recommendations. Moreover, customers wish for an interactive platform to buy their needs, where interactions increase interest. In general, recommendations based on images that solve the interaction problem are rarely studied in the literature. Hence, the proposed paper focuses on an Image-Based Recommendation System using Deep Feature Extraction and Ensemble Machine Learning Approach. In the technique, initially, the image is pre-processed by removing the background using Adaptive Otsu thresholding-based segmentation. Secondly, the Stacked ResNET pyramid dilated convolution (PDC-ResNET) model is employed to extract the high-level features from the images. The extracted features are then selected using Binary Hunger Games search optimization (BHGO). Lastly, the product’s class or kind is categorized using a voting-based Ensemble of AdaBoost XG-Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (AX-BDT). There are two main levels in the suggested recommendation system: Level 1 and Level 2. The suggested model determines the product’s class and category at Level 1. The suggested recommendation algorithm in Level 2 retrieves products that are closely matched and similar. Two datasets, the Fashion product dataset and the Amazon product dataset, are used to assess the suggested approach. In the fashion product dataset, the proposed model results in 96.99% accuracy. In the Amazon product dataset, the proposed model results in 97.94% accuracy.},

However, in actual production and life, many data are difficult to collect and cannot obtain accurate values, such as carbon dioxide emissions. In the case of imprecise data, the FDH model cannot evaluate the efficiency of DMU. In this context, a new uncertain FDH model based on uncertainty theory is proposed. In this paper, the uncertain FDH model is solved precisely by means of the uncertain chance constraint method and the expected value method. Finally, an application example of measuring the efficiency of 30 banks in China in 2019 is given to documenting the feasibility of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {The prediction of the stock market is still a complicated task to pursue in the field of machine learning as it relies on previous and past data, which is generally unstable and noisy. Existing methods of predicting the stock market are usually supervised approaches in which the prior labeling of the data as negative as well as positive moments is necessary to provide accurate results. However, this method of training the machine learning algorithms is complicated as it is vulnerable to overfitting issues as the behavior of the market usually relies on certain constraints like political events, marketing trends, and so on. The functioning of the actual portfolio optimization framework can be enhanced by fusing the return prediction in the conventional time series systems in the process of generating portfolios. Thus, the implementation of a better portfolio optimization system, which has a return prediction system integrated along with making the investors obtain more stable profits, is the major goal of this work. The modeling of the return forecasting model initially begins with the gathering of past stock marketing data. Then, the returns are estimated with the development of the Serial Cascaded Deep Residual Networks (SCDRN), where the deep learning models are utilized for predicting the future return of each stock. The risk level of each stock is also determined during the return prediction process. Then, with the aid of the developed optimization strategy named Enhanced Heap-based optimizer (EHO), the optimal portfolio is formulated, where the up-to-date market conditions are captured to rebalance the portfolio. The optimal selection of asset trading systems functions on the basis of the Sharpe ratio, and it maximizes the profit relative to the risk taken. An extensive analysis is executed to test the efficacy of the proposed portfolio optimization model regarding several baseline works with heuristic strategies.},

  abstract     = {The ability to evaluate the damage to buildings both accurately and precisely is essential for disaster recovery, planning, and rescue services. This paper proposes a new approach based on integrating machine learning algorithms in building damage classification. To achieve higher precision in classifying the level of building damage, this research proposes a new technique that employs machine learning strategies. The researchers were able to train the model to be able to differentiate the different levels of building damage and the feature extraction was performed through machine learning. The model effectively extracts and learns multiple complex signals which represent different degrees of damage from a well picked database which include several degrees of damage. In a single pass, the Siamese U-Net can perform feature extraction and similarity measurement between two different images. The efficiency and effectiveness of the Siamese U-net model can be increased by reducing inference time, thus increasing its ability to deliver faster predictions while also improving its accuracy. The suggested Enhanced U-Net (EU-Net) could greatly increase the accuracy of building-level classification. As it turned out, the results are very promising and reach beyond traditional approaches with bringing more sample opportunities of machine learning integration in the building damage assessment context. Additionally, this study believes that the accuracy of building damage classification can be further enhanced demonstrating the usefulness of machine learning in disaster management.},

Using a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) image dataset, this effort aims to develop a Regional Edge detection with a Fully Connected Network Model (RED-FCN) approach that uses deep learning to locate missing teeth. In this investigation, five hundred CBCT pictures were used. After pre-processing, the samples are randomly split into training, validation and testing data. In this study, RED-FCN models that have already been trained are used. Furthermore, tests were conducted on the suggested models, both with and without the segmentation technique. With precision scores greater than 0.90, the recommended pre-trained DL models fared well in the average teeth class. Average teeth class is a generalized category representing common tooth characteristics, such as shape, size, or structure, based on an averaged dataset. Additionally, the trial outcomes validated RED-FCN benefit with a precision of 0.98. In addition, the precision values were 95%. With 95% segmentation accuracy and 94% classification accuracy for missing tooth areas, the RED-FCN model demonstrated strong performance across the various detection stages.

A dataset of 568,630 transactions from European cardholders in 2023 was utilized, featuring 30 attributes. Pre-processing techniques such as feature scaling and class balancing were applied to balance the data and improve accuracy. Detailed data analysis was performed to identify important patterns among the features. Each algorithm underwent training and optimization through hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. Performance was evaluated using precision, accuracy, recall, F1 score, and Area under the ROC Curve (AUC). Results indicated that RF and LR performed best. High accuracy and AUC values were attained by RF, whereas LR successfully identified fraudulent and authentic transactions. These insights highlight the value of ML in enhancing fraud detection systems. As credit card use continues to grow, these tools will be essential for improving financial security.},

Presently, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models are applied for developing a competent IDS and in numerous domains. Automated detection of malicious attacks in a timely manner is the purpose of IDS. Advanced cyber security solutions are required for continuous detection of malicious threats. Hence, investigators are generating an effective IDS for this research problem due to complex malicious attacks. In this article, an integrated DL model comprising of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) are applied to generate a fusion IDS to predict and classify malicious attacks. In the proposed Integrated Convolutional Restricted Boltzmann Machine Intrusion Detection System (ICRBM_IDS), the CNN executes convolution to hold local features and RBM captures the temporal features to enhance the performance of Intrusion Detection and Prediction. The ability of the ICRBM_IDS model is assessed based on the ID data present widely. The experiments were conducted on CSE-CIC-DS2018 dataset which is the result of collaborative project between Communications security Establishment (CSE) and the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity (CIC) that is currently used and realistic.

Factors like satisfaction, stress, and the detection of emotions from various situations are essential in analyzing the sequential evaluation for specific functions. The computer vision method of emotion detection is a prominent technique of recognizing emotions from visual media such as videos and images of a person’s activities. The present models used only a simple concatenation feature to analyze the emotion. Thus, they should have observed the essential complementary gains between the context data in the video files and face, which is highly required to address the issues of misunderstanding and confusion. The proposed technique concentrates on the inter-feature interaction data, which helps us completely exploit the complex data between the context features and the face. We addressed a novel Convolutional Emotion Network (CEmoNet) model to obtain exact detection using high-definition video files. It captures the complex context and facial expression features by operating a network method. An individual channel’s feature maps are customized by applying the ReLU and Max_pool block. The hierarchical encoding contains the Conv_1 to Conv_4 block to obtain the favourable weights of the feature fusion and acquire the features of adaptive emotions through the weighting operation of the hybrid feature. Finally, the deep fusion block cooperates with the available features of adaptive emotions to forecast an individual’s emotion recognition.

  abstract     = {This paper examines a binary classification issue in fraud detection using several neural network methodologies, including the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and SMOTE combined with Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN). This work underscores the pressing need for improved detection approaches due to the rising incidence of fraud in financial institutions. Several configurations were tested on a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to tackle class imbalance with class weighting, undersampling, oversampling (SMOTE), and SMOTE + ENN SMOTE + ENN SMOTE+ENN . The results demonstrated that SMOTE + ENN SMOTE + ENN SMOTE+ENN successfully addressed the imbalance problem, leading to further investigation of models that integrate SMOTE + ENN SMOTE + ENN SMOTE+ENN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forest (RF). Finally, a hybrid model combining the balancing techniques of SMOTE + ENN SMOTE + ENN SMOTE+ENN with the neural network architectures of FNN + LSTM FNN + LSTM FNN+LSTM was developed to harness the strengths of both approaches. The FNN + SMOTE + ENN FNN + SMOTE + ENN FNN+SMOTE+ENN achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.99% with an ROC-AUC score of 0.9678, showcasing its strong performance in the classification task. In contrast, the LSTM model reached an accuracy of 99.91% and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9424. While LSTM performed well, it faced challenges in effectively distinguishing the minority class.},

  abstract     = {The research field in Internet of Things (IoT) is exponentially developing, however yet susceptible to privacy and security risks. Due to resource constraints and decentralized architecture, conventional privacy and security solutions are inoperable for IoT devices. Integrating cryptography and IoT can create a secure environment for data transmission. It is essential to understand the complexities faced in past research before building and executing a cryptography-based approach that can be integrated with IoT. The authentication of each IoT device is required before it can be added to the network. It also enables IoT devices to verify the identity of trustworthy services and smart e-health networks before entrusting them with session and group keys. With mutual authentication between all of the devices in the multicast group, group keys can be safely disseminated for encrypted group communication. There is a growing need for information interchange among patients, providers, and payers, as well as greater usage of digital patient information and stricter regulations, greater consolidation of health practitioners, and improved data security. In order to ensure that electronic health data can be accessed quickly, a multi-key server strategy is employed to distribute the workload among several servers. A new method for managing keys has been proposed to further improve the security of healthcare information. To provide an environment for secure data transmission, a Priority based Group Key Management with Cryptography Linked Approach (PbGKM-CLA) is proposed. The proposed model handles key generation and distribution generated by using the cryptography model. The proposed model is compared with the traditional models and the results exhibit that the proposed model performance is efficient.},

The proposed hybrid image fusion network develops a Near-Infrared and visible image fusion system using a multicategory adversarial mechanism within the feature space. Compared to current methods, this approach’s fusion rules are more rational and perform better. An autoencoder network, trained with spatial and channel attention, extracts feature and reconstructs images. A Generative Adversarial Network then derives fusion rules from the trained encoder’s feature space. The hybrid network includes a feature fusion network (generator) that combines features from the source image and a multiclassifier (discriminator) ensuring the fused features match the probability distribution of both Near-Infrared and visible modes. The trained decoder reconstructs the fused image, preserving salient features. Experimental results show the proposed hybrid network surpasses contemporary techniques like GTF, MDLatLRR, DenseFuse, FusionGAN, and U2Fusion in subjective quality.},

Algorithms are introduced by placing the mobile nodes in specially identified positions will improve the participation of nodes in the network, thus making the network contribute with better results. To address the energy management, we introduce semi-chain protocols that significantly prolong network lifespan and reduce complexity. By integrating Delaunay Triangulation in chain construction, we simplify the process of nearest neighbor identification, minimizing the energy expenditure of individual nodes.

Therefore, in this paper, we use Hampel estimation to calculate the parameters of the uncertain autoregressive (UAR) model. The sum of sample errors (SSE) function is used to determine the parameters in Hampel estimation before fitting the UAR model. In addition, the residuals are analysed, and future trends in the data are predicted. Finally, numerical examples comparing the Hampel estimation with the LSE estimation, the least absolute deviation (LAD) estimation, and the Huber estimation illustrate the validity and stability of the Hampel estimation, as well as its applicability in predicting carbon dioxide emissions in China.},

The logistic chaotic sequence generates a more uniformly distributed population, while the nonlinear inertia weight controls the algorithm’s step size. The crisscross strategy enhances the position-updating mechanism, and the horizontal crossover operation improves global optimization capability. Furthermore, the vertical crossover operation allows for dimension mutation in some individuals, reducing susceptibility to local optima. Extensive testing against 11 CEC benchmark functions, complemented by the Wilcoxon rank sum test, confirms the effectiveness of the approach. Results demonstrate the SSALC’s fast convergence, high accuracy, and improved global search ability in addressing both unimodal and multimodal optimization challenges.},

  abstract     = {Twitter is one of the popular social media websites. It is a great resource to gain knowledge about other feelings, sentiments, and opinions. Experts developed algorithms to assess the general vibe of tweets and identify positive or negative messages. In this research work, Optimized Complex-Valued Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data (CVSTGCN-SA-TD) is proposed. Here, the input data is gathered from the SST-2 dataset. The input data is fed to the pre-processing stage, where the Multi-Window Savitzky-Golay Filter (MWSGF) removes irrelevant items, such as retweets, punctuation, URLs, symbols, and numbers. Then the preprocessed data is given to Revised Tunable Q-Factor Wavelet Transform (RTQFWT) to extract the relevant features. Then the extracted features are fed into a neural network called CVSTGCN to classify the tweet as positive and negative. Generally, CVSTGCN does not adapt any optimization strategies to determine the optimal parameters to guarantee accurate efficiency of Twitter sentiment analysis. Therefore, High level Target Navigation Pigeon Inspired Optimization (HLTNPIO) is proposed to improve the weight parameter of CVSTGCN that classifies the tweet as positive and negative accurately. The efficiency of the proposed CVSTGCN-SA-TD approach is analyzed under some metrics, like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Specificity, F1-score, ROC, Computational Time. The proposed CVSTGCN-SA-TD method attains 22.36%, 25.42% and 18.27% better accuracy, 21.36%, 26.42%, 18.27% better recall, 21.36%, 22.42%, 19.27% better precision compared with existing methods: Twitter sentiment analysis depending on elephant herd optimization along hybrid deep learning strategy on online food services (TSA-OFS-EHO), Sentiment analysis utilizing Twitter information: a comparative appliance of lexicon-also machine learning-dependent method (SATD-CAL-ML), Twitter sentiment analysis utilizing ensemble dependent deep learning towards COVID-19 in India and Europe countries (TSA-DL-IEC) respectively.},

Initially, the data is taken from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) stock dataset. Then, methodological pointers such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI), Commodity Channel Index (CCI), Rate of Change (RoC), Momentum, Williams Percent Range, Moving Average of n days, on balance volume and Stochastic Oscillator are calculated.

The effectiveness of the suggested method is evaluated in comparison to the various current methods. The proposed stock price prediction methodology provides improved performance in terms of different performance metrics such as accuracy (99.97%), F1-score (99.24%), precision (99.25%), Mean Squared Error (MSE) (0.0027), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) (0.0219), Recall (99%), Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve (AUC) (99.25%), processing time (3.528 seconds) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.052).},

Therefore, it is particularly important to reasonably select and utilize relevant online rumor refutation platforms, which can help the public participate in rumor governance and deepen network ecological governance. However, there are many uncertain factors in the entire process of debunking rumors, such as the promotional debunking abilities of different levels of online rumor refutation platforms, while also considering various practical constraints. In order to consider the influence of uncertain factors during the refutation process to improve the effectiveness of refutation, and explore the applicability of uncertainty theory in practice, this paper studies a new mode of refutation information promotion led by social managers such as the government and collaborated by various online refutation platforms, and proposes an uncertain refutation information propagation (URIP) model by considering multiple realistic constraints. Specifically, we characterize the uncertain factors as uncertain variables in the refutation process, such as the debunking ability of online refutation platforms, and solve for the optimal solution by maximizing the expected value of refutation propagation effectiveness. Subsequently, based on the relevant knowledge of uncertainty theory, we derive an equivalent deterministic model for the URIP model. Finally, in order to enable decision-makers to better apply the URIP model in practice, a numerical example is applied to compare the URIP model proposed in this paper with the URIP model without realistic constraints, which proves the superiority of our model.},

  abstract     = {Research Highlights Cybersecurity includes protecting computer networks and systems from unauthorized access, harm, and fraud, employing various techniques and technologies such as barriers, antivirus software, and cryptography. Regular system updates, employee training, and adherence to best practices are crucial for maintaining confidentiality and ensuring reliable IT services in both corporate and public sectors. This paper introduces a GA-AFCM technique, which enhances intrusion detection and cybersecurity tasks by combining the strengths of Genetic Algorithms and Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means Clustering. The study began with data collection and preprocessing using Z-score normalization, followed by feature extraction through Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA). The GA-AFCM approach was compared with traditional methods such as K-Means, Density Peaks, GMM, and MKKM-IC. The results demonstrate the TPR (91%), FPR (4%) precision (83.56%), accuracy (95.6%), and F1-score (87%) are used to examining and interpreting quickly and dynamically generated data streams efficiently solved by the proposed approach. The GA-AFCM method significantly enhances detection rates to over 95% while substantially reducing false positives, establishing it as a robust solution for cybersecurity in the big data era.},

  abstract     = {A significant role is played by clustering approaches in data mining processes, which becomes more challenging because of the rising dimension of the available databases. Clustering strategies are employed in various sectors like information retrieval, social network analytics, image processing, and so on. Clustering assists the user to understand dissimilarity and similarity among objects. The big data concept has collected incredible attention from various research areas, like government and industry within a short lifetime. In this paper, a Deep Fractional Calculus-Improved Invasive Weed Optimization fuzzy clustering (Deep FC-IIWO fuzzy clustering) based scheme is developed to cluster big data. The map-reduce architecture is employed to tackle the over-fitting obstacles occurring in the clustering of big data. The features are extracted using the mapping function which is followed by clustering in the reducer stage. Furthermore, the selection of features is essential for further clustering process. Here, the Minkowski distance measure is applied for selecting the most prominent features. The approach of clustering is executed with the help of the devised Deep FC-IIWO fuzzy clustering model. The implemented FC-IIWO framework is newly created by integrating Fractional Calculus (FC) and Improved Invasive Weed Optimizer (IIWO). The proposed Deep FC-IIWO fuzzy clustering scheme performed better than other prevailing models concerning the rand coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, and clustering accuracy of 0.9563, 0.9379, and 0.9522, correspondingly.},

However, classic SVR is feeble if data are imprecise or low-quality. Hence, the uncertainty theory emerged as the times require, which can process the imprecise observations well. In this study, a novel SVR model be introduced into uncertainty theory, termed v -SVR with imprecise observations, designed to handle imprecise or low-quality data. Unlike the conventional ε -SVR with imprecise observations approach, v -SVR offers an automated computation of the accuracy parameter ε , thereby eliminating the need for manual selection. This results in improved performance with simplified parameter tuning. The effectiveness of the approach in this paper be demonstrated through a numerical example.},

In this paper, we propose a graph-based generalization of Semi-Supervised Dimensionality Reduction (SSDR) algorithm that uses stochastic distances (Kullback-Leibler, Bhattacharyya and Cauchy-Schwarz divergences) to compute the similarity between local multivariate Gaussian distributions along the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) graph build from the samples in the input high-dimensional space. In summary, there are two variants of the proposed method: one which uses only a fraction of the labeled samples (10%) and another that also uses a clustering method (Gaussian Mixture Models) to estimate the labels of the minimum spanning tree of the KNN graph, incorporating more information into the process. Experimental results with several real datasets show that the proposed method is able to improve the classification accuracy of several supervised classifiers and also the quality of the obtained clusters (Silhouette Coefficients) in comparison to the regular SSDR algorithm, making it a viable alternative for pattern classification problems.},

  abstract     = {Humans’ learning involves remembering patterns of the past to better understand recurring concepts as their knowledge grows. However, a key issue that arises from these cases is that previous knowledge in deep neural networks could be gradually forgotten when they are trained for a new concept. We address this problem by learning a general representation that can remember the previous information and promote future learning. In this pursuit, a new controller is introduced by the meta-learning strategy that guides the network to keep the balance between the previously learned concepts and the new concept, hence it avoids catastrophic forgetting. Compared to previous online incremental learning for evolving data streams, our approach is dedicated to handling recurring concepts. When encountering recurring concepts, the model can remember and recall the previous knowledge and can quickly adapt to this change. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Alternating Meta-learning approach for recurring concepts (BLAML), which emphasizes the hidden representation learning of different concepts in model-level learning, and obtains a set of shared parameters through the global meta-learning strategy. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proved.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose an efficient regression algorithm based on primal formulation of twin support vector machine. This is an efficient approach to solve the optimization problem leading to reduced computation time. The proposed method is termed as twin parametric insensitive support vector regression (UPTPISVR). The optimization problems of the proposed (UPTPISVR) are a pair of unconstrained convex minimization problems. Moreover, the objective functions of UPTPISVR are strongly convex, differentiable and piecewise quadratic. Therefore, an approximate solution is obtained in primal variables instead of solving the dual formulation. Further, an absolute value equation problem is solved by using a functional iterative algorithm for UPTPISVR, termed as FUPTPISVR. The objective function of the proposed formulation involves the plus function which is non-smooth and therefore, smooth approximation functions are used to replace the plus function, termed as SUPTPISVR. The Newton-Armijo algorithm is then used to iteratively obtain the solutions, thus eliminates the requirement of any optimization toolbox. Various numerical experiments on synthetic and benchmark real-world datasets are presented for justifying the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed UPTPISVR. The results clearly indicate that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) on most datasets.},

To do so, we first propose an uncertain mean-risk index model based on uncertainty theory where the security return and MBR are regarded as uncertain variables and give the deterministic form of the model. Then for further analysis, we discuss the critical constraint and optimality condition of the model. Based on the discussion, we study the influence of uncertain MBR on the investors’ decisions.

  abstract     = {Subspace clustering is an effective way to analyze high-dimensional data. The main problems of the conventional subspace clustering techniques are as follows: first, conventional clustering methods can not describe categorical attribute space in more detail; second, most subspace-clustering techniques failure to process dynamic data effectively; finally, lack of effective noise recognition leads to the decline of the efficiency of incremental subspace-clustering analysis. We address the above problems by an incremental subspace-clustering algorithm — called ICE . With attribute subspace constructed by a rough set-based weight computing method, ICE obtains clustering results through initial and incremental clustering stage. Utilizing the original cluster results generated from initial clustering stage, we adopt merging and splitting operation to dynamic adjust cluster-structure in incremental clustering stage. Before achieving the final results, a polymerization-based noise recognition technique is employed to automatically identify noise from sparse clusters without human threshold intervention. We implement ICE on synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results reveal that incremental subspace-clustering method can achieves satisfactory performance on extensibility, accuracy and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a growing area of emotional computing that involves analyzing data from three different modalities. Gathering data from Multimodal Sentiment analysis in Car Reviews (MuSe-CaR) is challenging due to data imbalance across modalities. To address this, an effective data augmentation approach is proposed by combining dynamic synthetic minority oversampling with a multimodal elicitation conditional generative adversarial network for emotion recognition using audio, text, and visual data. The balanced data is then fed into a granular elastic-net regression with a hybrid feature selection method based on dandelion fick’s law optimization to analyze sentiments. The selected features are input into a multilabel wavelet convolutional neural network to classify emotion states accurately. The proposed approach, implemented in python, outperforms existing methods in terms of trustworthiness (0.695), arousal (0.723), and valence (0.6245) on the car review dataset. Additionally, the feature selection method achieves high accuracy (99.65%), recall (99.45%), and precision (99.66%). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MSA approach, even with three modalities of data.},

  abstract     = {Instead of storing data in rows, a columnar database is a type of Database Management System (DBMS). To speed up the processing and reply to a question, a columnar database’s job is to efficiently write and read data to and from hard disc storage. One of the most crucial methods in the creation of column-oriented database systems is compression. For columns with Zero-length string types, all heavier and light-in-weight compression techniques have limitations. Processing of transactions online, these databases are substantially more effective for online analytical processing than for online transactional processing. This indicates that although they are made to examine transactions, they are not very effective at updating them. To overcome these issues a Zero Length Recurrent based Fruit Fly Optimization (ZLRFF) model is used. Additionally, a reduction technique is known as ZLRFF was designed to achieve a high compression ratio and allow straight lookups on compressed material without decompression first. ZLRFF’s main goal is to divide a Zero-length string written column vertically into smaller columns that can each be compressed using a separate lightweight compression technique. To search directly on compressed data, we also provide a search technique we call FF-search. Extensive testing demonstrates that ZLRFF supports direct searching on compressed data in addition to achieving a decent compression ratio, which enhances query performance.},

  abstract     = {A schema database functions as a repository for interconnected data points, facilitating comprehension of data structures by organizing information into tables with rows and columns. These databases utilize established connections to arrange data, with attribute values linking related tuples. This integrated approach to data management and distributed processing enables schema databases to maintain models even when the working set size surpasses available RAM. However, challenges such as data quality, storage, scarcity of data science professionals, data validation, and sourcing from diverse origins persist. Notably, while schema databases excel at reviewing transactions, they often fall short in updating them effectively. To address these issues, a Chimp-based radial basis neural model (CbRBNM) is employed. Initially, the Schemaless database was considered and integrated into the Python system. Subsequently, compression functions were applied to both schema and schema-less databases to optimize relational data size by eliminating redundant files. Performance validation involved calculating compression parameters, with the proposed method achieving memory usage of 383.37 Mb, a computation time of 0.455 s, a training time of 167.5 ms, and a compression rate of 5.60%. Extensive testing demonstrates that CbRBNM yields a favorable compression ratio and enables direct searching on compressed data, thereby enhancing query performance.},
