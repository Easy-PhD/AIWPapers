  abstract     = {The significance of predicting the trustworthiness of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in the context of sustainable AI-based catalyst screening lies in ensuring the reliability and interpretability of AI-driven decisions in catalysis research. Trustworthy XAI can enhance the transparency and accountability of AI models, crucial for gaining the confidence of scientists and stakeholders in the findings. By accurately predicting the performance and reliability of catalysts, XAI aids in identifying the most promising candidates efficiently, reducing the need for extensive experimental trials, thus saving time and resources. Moreover, trustworthy XAI facilitates better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving catalyst performance, leading to more informed and targeted research directions. In sustainable AI-based catalyst screening, where environmental and economic considerations are paramount, the integration of XAI ensures that AI models are not only accurate but also aligned with sustainable development goals. This fosters the development of greener and more efficient catalytic processes, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable technologies. The ability to predict and ensure the trustworthiness of XAI in catalyst screening thus represents a critical step towards leveraging AI for sustainable and impactful scientific advancements. This review discusses various techniques commonly used in sustainable AI for catalyst screening, highlighting different XAI methods with their benefits and drawbacks in the catalyst screening process. It suggests integrating multiple XAI tools to overcome individual limitations and presents significant findings in catalyst screening. The review also addresses challenges and explores future directions in this field.},

  abstract     = {Neural operators (NOs) employ deep neural networks to learn the mappings between infinitedimensional function spaces. Deep operator network (DeepONet), a popular NO architecture, has demonstrated success in the real-time prediction of complex dynamics across various scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we introduce a random sampling technique to be adopted during the training of DeepONet, aimed at improving the generalization ability of the model, while significantly reducing the computational time. The proposed approach targets the trunk network of the DeepONet model that outputs the basis functions corresponding to the spatiotemporal locations of the bounded domain on which the physical system is defined. While constructing the loss function, DeepONet training traditionally considers a uniform grid of spatiotemporal points at which all the output functions are evaluated for each iteration. This approach leads to a larger batch size, resulting in poor generalization and increased memory demands, due to the limitations of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. The proposed random sampling over the inputs of the trunk net mitigates these challenges, improving generalization and reducing the memory requirements during training, resulting in significant computational gains. We validate our hypothesis through three benchmark examples, demonstrating substantial reductions in training time while achieving comparable or lower overall test errors relative to the traditional training approach. Our results indicate that incorporating randomization in the trunk network inputs during training enhances the efficiency and robustness of DeepONet, offering a promising avenue for improving the frameworkâ€™s performance in modeling complex physical systems.},
