  abstract     = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have increasingly transformed the healthcare sector, promoting the development of models aimed at improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostic processes, with significant applications in medical imaging. Specifically, in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer, accurate staging typically requires pathological examination. This study aims to develop and evaluate an AI-based approach for automating this process, utilizing a combination of object detection and image classification models. The YOLOv4 model was employed to localize the endometrium in medical images, followed by image classification using Inceptionv3, EfficientNet-b0, and MobileNetv2 for performance comparison. The YOLOv4 algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score > 0 . 9 , indicating high localization accuracy. In the classification task, all three models achieved training accuracies > 9 0 % and test accuracies > 7 5 % . The proposed approach, combining YOLOv4 for localization and Inceptionv3 for classification, achieved a test accuracy of 77.64%. This study presents an AI-driven method for automated endometrial cancer staging, integrating YOLOv4-based localization with deep learning-based classification. The model demonstrates potential for assisting obstetricians and gynecologists in the early identification of endometrial cancer, improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy in clinical settings.},

In this research, we have introduced a VLP system tailored to align with the hospital setting. We have developed the power delay profile for the received signal and subsequently assessed the presence of the line-of-sight (LoS) link by extracting the root mean square (RMS) delay spread. Following this, we presented a modified deep Gaussian process (MDGP) that employs multiple kernels to accurately estimate user locations in scenarios where the LoS link is not available.

It remains a serious threat to the world, particularly affecting children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The fractional-order pneumonia model has been developed in this study to determine the disease dynamics in the system. The model stability is proved for the existing equilibrium points. Global sensitivity analysis was carried out utilizing Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) to find the key parameters influencing disease transmission. Control analysis is considered as an effective strategy for preventing the spread of the disease pneumonia. It is often necessary to combine timely treatment, immunization, and boosting immunity. However, eliminating this disease in the population will be challenging if control strategies aren’t given at the appropriate time and in sufficient quantity. We conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of four optimal control strategies utilizing numerical methods. Our findings indicate that vaccination is the most cost-effective and efficient control intervention among the strategies compared.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in Taiwan, and it is also the type of cancer with the largest incidence worldwide. Early detection and treatment can effectively reduce mortality. In Taiwan, mammography is widely used to screen for microcalcifications in early breast cancer lesions. However, the characteristics of microcalcifications are difficult to observe, and helping radiologists more quickly and effectively identify microcalcifications is an important challenge. This article proposes a method for automatic lesion prediction and image segmentation using microcalcification cluster labeling data. U-Net and V-Net, two convolutional network architectures, are used for comparison, combining the standardized convolutional network architectures dropout and binary cross-entropy (BCE) with Dice as a loss function to detect microcalcification groups. Other preprocessing methods are used to optimize detection results, including window adjustment, image preprocessing, and data augmentation. Finally, the trained model is applied to mammography images to predict lesions through the image segmentation of microcalcification groups, thereby assisting radiologists in making diagnoses. The experimental results on the private dataset show that U-Net outperforms V-Net with an accuracy rate of 72% when using the original images for training, rising to 81% for training using preprocessed images, and 85% when applying the composite method to preprocessed images. V-Net training with preprocessed images only achieves 70% accuracy, rising to 72% by applying the composite method to preprocessed images.},

Recent advances in sepsis prediction have attempted to incorporate machine learning (ML) methods and traditional clinical diagnosis to identify and intervene early in the care process. This review compares supervised learning approaches, such as decision trees and support vector machines, with unsupervised approaches, including clustering and anomaly detection, to identify sepsis in complex, multimodal, real-time clinical datasets. Supervised learning approaches generally yield higher predictive accuracy when trained on labeled datasets. However, unsupervised learning approaches have the utility of identifying new patterns and subtle physiological changes without labeled training data, resulting in improved sensitivity of the system. Given the acute and time-sensitive nature of sepsis, sensitivity is the most critical performance measure, as missing a valid case can be deadly. Overall accuracy is also essential, as is model interoperability (the ability for various systems to integrate, likely due to the heterogeneous nature of health systems). These elements are crucial for scalability and trust in the clinical workspace. In this review, we further compare and contrast these ML approaches to traditional scoring/boundary biomarker approaches, discuss the difficulties of integration, and suggest ways for developing clinically deployable, interpretable, and sensitive sepsis detection systems.},

The current open testing environment relies on two distinct technologies—an incubator and a cell culture hood—which necessitate the use of full personal protective equipment (PPE). However, prolonged exposure to potentially infectious materials increases the risk to healthcare workers during sample handling. To address this, we developed a novel Mini-Cult System that integrates both an incubator and a fume hood into a single compact unit. This system revolutionizes laboratory workflows by providing a sterile, contamination-free environment for both cell culture and microbiological applications. It supports essential parameters such as CO 2 concentration, temperature, and humidity, ensuring optimal conditions for cell growth while enabling rapid sample processing. By combining these functions, the Mini-Cult eliminates the need for culture transfers between devices—one of the primary sources of contamination. Its space-saving design enhances laboratory efficiency, and the integrated fume hood offers continuous protection against airborne contaminants.

  abstract     = {Intraoperative cardiovascular surgery demands fast and precise decision-making utilizing patient data in real time. Unfortunately, centralized artificial intelligence (AI) models have inherent drawbacks, including high latency, scalability such as low scalability, and privacy related to sharing raw patient data. This study outlines a federated learning (FL)-powered real-time decision support system (FDSS) capable of functioning over multiple distributed surgical nodes while ensuring the privacy of patient information. We developed a federated real-time surgical decision support (FRSDS) algorithm, which embodies the operational logic of the FDSS framework. The FDSS includes individual model training at the edge, differentially private updates, secure aggregation using Federated Averaging (FedAvg), and real-time inference at the surgical site. The framework was evaluated under multicenter cardiovascular datasets. We assess performance through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and system performance is assessed through latency and communication overhead. FDSS achieved 95.4% accuracy, 94.6% sensitivity, 95.0% specificity, 93.2% precision, and an AUC-ROC of 0.98. The averages exceeded those of centralized and baseline FL benchmark models. The average inference latency in real time was 120 ms, which is appropriate for intraoperative use. The expected convergence was very strong; communication overhead was lessened with top-k gradient compression, and differential privacy was maintained with ( ∈ = 1 . 2 , δ = 1 0 − 5 ) protection. The system proposed with the FDSS framework is an inoperative cardiovascular care option for supporting surgical performance that preserves patient privacy. And, because no raw patient data is transferred internally with the system, the FRSDS algorithm provides rapid inference and enables real-time, scalable decision-support policymaking capability even in intraoperative circumstances poised with patient risk.},

This article aims to improve the limitations of MAFFT in solving the MSA problem by using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to enhance the quality of the iterative search. To this end, a new three-objective model is defined, and a novel MOEA is proposed to optimize this model. Four mutation and two crossover operators are designed to generate promising offspring individuals during the evolutionary process. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, computational experiments are conducted on 60 instances randomly selected from the BAliBASE 3.0 database. The results show that the proposed method can improve the quality of the iterative search and output alignment of MAFFT in terms of the Q and TC metric scores.

  abstract     = {Segmentation of brain tumors in low-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a challenge, especially in resource-limited regions such as sub-Saharan Africa. Variations in MRI data quality lead to poor model generalization, and low-quality data is difficult to acquire and annotate. To address these issues, this article proposes a few-shot cross-domain segmentation model, BrainAdaptNet, aimed at improving segmentation performance from high-quality to low-quality MRI. BrainAdaptNet uses DinoV2 as a self-supervised feature extraction backbone, enhancing dataset adaptability through contrastive learning and simulating image quality degradation with wavelet transform style transfer to improve the model’s robustness to changes in image distribution. In the data preprocessing phase, CutMix augmentation is introduced for feature fusion, reducing the distribution gap between source and target data. Additionally, a task-adaptive cross-attention (TACA) feature transformation module is designed to further enhance the interaction and alignment of features between the support and query sets, optimizing segmentation performance under few-shot conditions. To rigorously evaluate the proposed method, fivefold cross-validation was conducted on data migration tasks with BraTS 2021 and BraTS 2020 as the source domains and BraTS Africa as the target domain. Experimental results show that, compared to the baseline model PATNet, BrainAdaptNet achieved a 1.5–2.0 percentage point improvement in the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and a 4.8–5.2 percentage point reduction in Hausdorff distance (HD95) in cross-dataset segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of BrainAdaptNet on low-quality MRI data.},

  abstract     = {Background and Objectives: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a prevalent malignant hematologic tumor with no current cure, highlighting the pressing need for novel drug development. Biochemical approaches to drug development involve extensive and costly biological experiments, underscoring the urgency to integrate new technologies for enhanced efficiency. Materials and Methods: This article presents a mathematical model to assess MM drug efficacy, aiming to guide drug development strategies and improve drug development efficiency. The model employs ordinary differential equations to simulate interactions among osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and MM cells within the bone microenvironment, as well as changes in the NF- κ B and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways post-MM invasion. Our study investigates the role of the first-line drugs denosumab and bisphosphonates, which are clinical treatments for bone-related complications caused by MM, and compares the effects of the drugs DTP3 and Japonicone A (JA), currently under development for the treatment of MM. Results: Our findings regarding denosumab align with existing experimental data, thus validating the model. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that denosumab exhibits the same anti-MM effect as bisphosphonates but reveals that denosumab acts more quickly due to its direct action on RANKL through monoclonal antibodies, whereas bisphosphonates act more slowly by targeting osteoclasts. Additionally, both DTP3 and JA effectively inhibit MM cell proliferation, positioning them as potential therapeutic agents, with DTP3 displaying superior efficacy compared to JA. Conclusions: We utilize mathematical models as alternatives to biological models to investigate the effects of drugs. These models not only elucidate the mechanisms of action of clinically used medications but also enhance our understanding of drug utilization, providing valuable guidance for physicians in their decision-making. Additionally, for drugs in development, these models can assess both efficacy and side effects, informing the drug development process. They also facilitate comparisons between different drugs to identify less effective options, thereby reducing costs. For example, in the case of DTP3 and JA, where DTP3 proves superior, the models help reduce research and development (R&D) costs associated with JA, saving both resources and time.},

  abstract     = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare systems holds transformative potential to redefine healthcare delivery and accelerate progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the socioeconomic and ethical implications of AI adoption remain underexplored, particularly in real-world deployment contexts. This study aims to bridge this gap by examining AI’s impact on healthcare efficiency, cost savings, and workforce dynamics while addressing barriers to equitable access and ethical concerns such as data privacy, transparency, and algorithmic bias. A mixed-methods approach, including statistical modeling, economic analysis, and stakeholder interviews, was employed to evaluate AI’s potential to enhance healthcare delivery and mitigate disparities. Key findings demonstrate AI’s capacity to improve health outcomes, drive economic growth, and optimize resource allocation but underscore the need for robust governance frameworks to ensure ethical and inclusive AI adoption. These insights offer actionable recommendations for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and technology developers seeking to harness AI for sustainable healthcare transformation.},

  abstract     = {The eradication of Triatoma infestans and similar vector species has been the focus of the fight against Chagas disease for several decades. The standard control method continues to be the fumigation with pyrethroids, which has led to the emergence of resistant bug populations in many regions of South America and, especially, in the Gran Chaco. It is therefore essential to develop alternative methods of T. infestans control. Paint with microcapsules containing organophosphate substances has been shown to have a positive impact on the reduction of house infestation. In this study, we investigate the effects of the application of organophosphate-based insecticidal paints on a T. infestans population in a chicken coop, the recovery of this population, and the frequencies of application required to control the insect under realistic conditions. We extended a recently proposed model of all stages of T. infestans populations in chicken coops to include paint-induced mortality. Considering climate and bug migration variations, we find the paint application frequencies that guarantee low levels of infestation. A strong and stable decrease in the triatomine population can be achieved by paint applications separated by 4 years or more. This work, taken together with previous experimental results, strongly suggests that painting with organophosphate microcapsules would be a highly efficient method to control T. infestans in regions where it has developed immunity to pyrethroids.},

The structure is novel based on the silkworm-derived protein, in such a manner as to render its controlled release possible, increasing efficacy and consistency for drugs. Besides, the addition of silk-derived materials in drug formulation can address crucial problems such as drug solubility and site-specific delivery.

  abstract     = {Brucellosis is a prevalent zoonotic infection, primarily in the developing world. Treatment regimens for brucellosis involve multiple medications, including doxycycline (DOX), which regulates the immune system and macrophage activity. Nevertheless, the treatment of Brucella infection is constrained by its presence within macrophages, which exhibit unique anti-immune mechanisms. The internal pathway for DOX against Brucella melitensis and its molecular docking is crucial for targeting macrophages, for enhancing efficacy, and decreasing the dose and time of treatment. Method: This research aimed to accurately predict the targeting efficiency of doxycycline-loaded chitosan alginate (DOX-N) nanoparticles to macrophages. Mannose-decorated chitosan–sodium alginate nanoparticles were chosen for this purpose. In silico analysis was performed to predict the targeting efficacy of the nanocarrier. Result: The study found that Nano DOX and macrophage mannose receptors exhibited binding interactions on their surfaces. The ligand DOX interacted with hydrogen bonds to the macrophage target receptor with a −7.5 kcal/mol interaction and four hydrogen bonds on the mannose receptor of the macrophage. Similarly, sodium alginate exhibited a (−6.2 kcal/mol) docking score, while conventional DOX was (−5.1 kcal/mol). The computational study confirmed that DOX-N has the potential to be a promising lead molecule for regulating the incidence of brucellosis infections. The binding affinity and efficacy of DOX-N loaded on chitosan and sodium alginate were designed and assessed. Conclusion: The results indicated that Nano DOX had a strong affinity for the specific macrophage receptor and specific protein site in B. melitensis .},

The article shares a model of IvE, which includes the establishment and expansion of design studios as hands-on prototyping spaces for technology design, curricular integration of active learning and problem-based learning across engineering departments, and establishment of innovation ecosystem partnerships. Invention Education is a novel, transdisciplinary approach to engineering education that fosters technical innovation, improves health outcomes, and reduces poverty. While global evidence of IvE’s impact in high-income settings is well-documented, few successful models have been developed by and collaboratively created with universities in Africa. Our multi-institutional team, representing institutions from Malawi, Nigeria, Tanzania, the United States, and Ethiopia, has developed a scalable IvE model designed to empower engineering students in sub-Saharan Africa to solve real-world challenges. This article presents key outcomes of the IvE model, including the establishment of design studios as hubs for innovation, curricular integration of active learning methodologies, and the strengthening of partnerships within local innovation ecosystems. Drawing on 8 years of implementation, this work provides critical insights into the advancement of engineering education and innovation ecosystems in a geographical region that has untapped potential for these models.

It examines relevant studies in the telecommunication sector, with a focus on technologies that enhance connectivity, performance, and innovative applications across industries. The review highlights advancements such as fifth-generation (5G) networks, which offer faster data speeds, lower latency, and increased network capacity, enabling the development of applications like autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT devices are increasingly connecting physical objects, driving innovation in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing. Edge computing, by enabling real-time processing and reducing latency, supports IoT applications requiring immediate responses. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are being integrated to optimize network resources, improve spectrum management, and facilitate intelligent decision-making. Technologies such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) enhance spectral efficiency, network capacity, and interference reduction. Millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies are being explored for high-speed wireless communication, enabling multi-gigabit data rates and applications in 5G, wireless backhaul, and ultra-high-definition video streaming. Software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) enable centralized management and greater network flexibility, while beam steering improves signal quality and coverage by directing wireless signals toward specific receivers. Quantum communication, leveraging quantum principles, provides secure communication channels, while quantum key distribution (QKD) ensures data confidentiality. Visible light communication (VLC) utilizes visible light for high-speed data transfer in environments where RF-based communication is not feasible. Despite the potential of these technologies, the article identifies challenges such as limited practical implementation, standardization issues, resource constraints, security and privacy concerns, and sustainability challenges. It concludes by discussing the practical implications of these emerging technologies, including enhanced data transfer speeds, improved network capacity, low-latency communication, IoT connectivity, ubiquitous coverage, industry transformation, and the security and privacy considerations that accompany these advancements.},

  abstract     = {Rapid growth of medical data in both hospitals and healthcare industries has made data handling increasingly challenging. Fast access to relevant medical information in an emergency is essential, but the huge data in databases makes this difficult. The management of data in the public domain is made more difficult by privacy and security concerns, which calls for the creation of a safe data handling system. The primary objective of this research is to propose and implement an intelligent framework, Smart MedDB, for real-time tracking of medical records. The framework highlights privacy and security considerations while addressing the difficulties of managing massive medical databases effectively and providing prompt access to individual patient information. The platform also aims to make e-Token booking with healthcare providers easier and simplify the process of filing health insurance claims. The proposed methodology involves the development and implementation of Smart MedDB, an intelligent framework that employs advanced data handling techniques to ensure quick and secure access to medical records. Patient databases can only be handled or shared by authorized personnel thanks to the integration of authentication measures. Smart MedDB makes use of state-of-the-art protocols and technology to automate the health insurance claim procedure. User experience and system responsiveness are taken into consideration while evaluating the framework’s qualitative capacity to offer rapid and secure access to medical records. The quantity of medical records increased five times, and then the responsiveness and bandwidth of the present medical data handling system increased to 60 seconds and 1,200 KB. However, the proposed system maintains almost the same level throughout the entire operation since it is stream-based. Metrics including data processing speed, security precautions, and retrieval time are quantified and contrasted with current systems. This framework presents an effective way to expedite medical data access by resolving privacy, security, and efficiency concerns. It ensures prompt and safe retrieval during emergencies and automates associated activities for improved healthcare services.},

The research question is “How is lignin used in drug release?” Within the scope of the study, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Research, PubMed, Google Scholar, etc., the principal accepted indexes in the literature, were used. As a result of scanning these indexes, only 13 out of approximately 30-studies were selected. Keywords chosen as selection criteria: Lignin, extraction methods of lignin, place of lignin in drug release, use of lignin in drug release, materials produced with lignin in drug release. After the selection, the relevant studies were grouped and classified. Even lignin, which is used in different forms for drug release, has also been mentioned. This is a mini-review about the potential for use of lignin in drug release. As a result of the examination, it was understood that there are restrictions on the drug release use of lignin due to the problem of water dissolution. However, it is understood that it is a very suitable material for drug release due to its large amount, easy availability, and biocompatibility. Therefore, at the end of the study, it was recommended that the water-dissolved form of lignin and even the nano-sized form would benefit drug release for researchers who want to work in this field. In this respect, studies on lignin as a natural drug release product will accelerate. It will also be more beneficial for drug release of lignin in nanosize. These suggestions will guide researchers who want to work in this field. In the future, the researchers will study lignin for drug release.},

This scoping review examines how artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied in breast surgery for older women with breast cancer over the past decade. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore databases was conducted for studies published between January 2015 and February 2025. Studies were included if they investigated AI applications in breast surgery and provided age-stratified analysis for women aged 65 and above. The findings were thematically analyzed to identify trends and gaps in the field. Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were categorized into two themes: AI-Driven Diagnostics and Risk Prediction (two studies) and AI-Guided Treatment and Decision Support (four studies). Deep learning (DL)- and radiomics-based models demonstrated superior accuracy in predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis (area under curve [AUC] 0.906) compared to traditional clinical models. AI-guided treatment decision support tools showed improved survival outcomes, with one study reporting a 12% lower mortality rate for patients following AI recommendations. However, no studies specifically addressed AI applications in intraoperative decision-making for older women. While AI shows promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning for older women with breast cancer, significant gaps exist, particularly in intraoperative applications. Future research should focus on prospective validation of AI models, standardization of AI development, and investigation of AI’s potential in real-time surgical decision-making for this vulnerable population.},

  abstract     = {Organ-on-a-chip platforms have been widely promoted as imminent replacements for animal research, a theme prominently featured in Science (August 14, 2025, pp. 676–679). This commentary critically examines these claims in light of the current evidence base. While microphysiological systems provide useful adjunctive data, their predictive scope is limited by selective validation, material sorption effects, reliance on nonspecific endpoints, and unverified assumptions about metabolic competence. Economic projections of industry-wide savings rest on optimistic modeling rather than empirical demonstration. Moreover, premature policy initiatives to phase out animal studies risk undermining patient safety. This article argues for cautious integration of new approach methodologies (NAMs) alongside, rather than instead of established animal research, with emphasis on independent multisite validation and global regulatory harmonization.},

  abstract     = {The current investigation is to study the experimental analysis of wear and frictional force behavior on Al6063-T6 with zinc oxide (ZnO) and magnesium (Mg) nanoparticles. ZnO nanoparticles were extracted using Punica granatum peels by a green synthesis process. The extraction process of the nanoparticles was monitored with special temperature, time duration, and care of the extraction of the peels. This technique served as a representation of surface stabilization and a reducing agent for the fabrication of spherical ZnO nanoparticles. The aluminum (6063-T6) was combined with the optimized zinc (Zn) nanoparticles that had been produced. In general, aluminum has a low density and is lightweight, which increases its bearing strength and heat conductivity. The weight fractions of the Mg (1%, 1.5%, and 2.0%) and Zn (1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0%) nanoparticles were mixed with aluminum. The mechanical properties of aluminum (Al6063-T6) with ZnO and Mg nanoparticles were determined experimentally at various volume fractions. Comparisons were made between the experimental outcomes with and without the addition of nanoparticles to the aluminum. The experimental findings show that Al6063-T6 with Zn and Mg nanoparticles can be employed in applications requiring wear resistance.},
