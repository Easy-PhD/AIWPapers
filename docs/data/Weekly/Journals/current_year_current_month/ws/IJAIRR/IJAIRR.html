  abstract     = {Previous animatronic faces struggle to express emotions effectively due to hardware and software limitations. On the hardware side, earlier approaches either used rigid-driven mechanisms, which provided precise control but were difficult to design within constrained spaces, or tendon-driven mechanisms, which are more space-efficient but challenging to control. In contrast, we propose a hybrid actuation approach that combines the best of both worlds. The eyes and mouth– key areas for emotional expression — are controlled using rigid mechanisms for precise movement, while the nose and cheek, which convey subtle facial microexpressions, are driven by strings. This design allows us to build a compact yet versatile hardware platform capable of expressing a wide range of emotions. On the algorithmic side, our method introduces a self-modeling network that maps motor actions to facial landmarks, allowing us to automatically establish the relationship between blendshape coefficients for different facial expressions and the corresponding motor control signals through gradient backpropagation. We then train a neural network to map speech input to corresponding blendshape controls. With our method, we can generate distinct emotional expressions such as happiness, fear, disgust, and anger, from any given sentence, each with nuanced, emotion-specific control signals — a feature that has not been demonstrated in earlier systems. We release the hardware design and code at https://github.com/ZZongzheng0918/Morpheus-Hardware and https://github.com/ZZongzheng0918/Morpheus-Software .},

  abstract     = {Intelligent operating mechanisms have so far emerged spontaneously in biology. At the beginning of life on Earth, completely ignorant beings gradually became able to understand their environment by building a knowledge base from their own experiences. In this paper, we attempt to outline the above process by observing the operation of artificial beings in an artificial world. The shape of this experimental world is a torus where squared fields are on the surface. The size can be changed, and any number of beings can be launched into it. There are energy sources and energy sinks in it. The creatures require energy and thus step from field to field to get energy. At the beginning of the process, beings are ignorant. They have no experience, but remember everything that happened to them. During the simulation, we observe the progress, destruction, or rise of the creatures. We examined their knowledge base, and the boom, or extinction of groups, families, and clans. In a completely hostile world, it is impossible to survive, but in a slightly hostile or friendly world, viable populations will certainly develop, that can use their knowledge base to assert themselves. The intelligence appears always if the circumstances are not too hostile and the existing entities can remember events that happened to them. The spontaneous emergence of intelligence is not exceptional, but natural.},

  abstract     = {Estimates of price series for a wide variety of commodities have historically been depended on by investors and governments. This research examines the complex task of projecting scrap steel prices, which are released for the central China market upon a daily basis, using time-series data spanning 08/23/2013–04/15/2021. Prior studies have not adequately considered forecasts for this important commodity price indicator. In this case, cross-validation procedures and Bayesian optimization techniques are used to construct Gaussian process regression strategies, which are then used to provide price projections. With the relative root mean square error being 0.3211%, this empirical prediction framework offers rather precise price projections throughout the out-of-sample time frame extending from 09/17/2019 to 04/15/2021. Using price research models, governments and investors may make educated judgments about local scrap steel markets.},

  abstract     = {Large language models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning as transformative tools have been widely used across both academic and industrial domains. This paper reviews the current landscape of LLM applications, examining their principles, methodologies, strengths, and limitations. Beginning with an overview of the evolution from traditional feature engineering to prompt-based approaches, it highlights the applications of LLMs in diverse fields, including bioinformatics, materials science, and drug discovery. The review further examines the technical intricacies of prompt-based learning, contrasting hard and soft prompt techniques and their respective contributions to optimizing model performance. Real-world implementations are analyzed, with a focus on applications in bioinformatics and financial technology, alongside a discussion of pressing challenges related to data security and privacy. This paper also investigates the economic value generated by LLMs and their potential societal and workforce impacts, such as industry disruption and new job creation. The anticipated trajectory of LLMs and their broader societal implications are discussed, emphasizing the need for continued research and policy to guide its responsible development.},
