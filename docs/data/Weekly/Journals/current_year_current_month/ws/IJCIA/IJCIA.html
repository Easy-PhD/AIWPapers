To address the challenges of inadequate user historical data extraction and the cold start problem inherent in traditional movie recommendation systems, we present a novel personalized movie recommendation model known as “movie recommendation with starring roles and ratings” (MSR). By incorporating a multi-head attention mechanism, the model captures intricate relationships among diverse data fields within users’ viewing records and facilitates the extraction of user features through the basic information-rating joint attention network (BRJA). The gate mechanism efficiently integrates fundamental movie information and average score into the movie representation vector, thereby generating candidate movie features. MSR can effectively provide recommendations even when confronted with limited user information, effectively mitigating the cold start problem. Comparative experiments on the movie lens dataset and ablation experiments focusing on key modules demonstrate the effectiveness of MSR in improving movie recommendations.},

This paper proposes a real-time pose detection algorithm based on deep learning, which can effectively perform real-time tracking and detection of single and multiple individuals in different indoor and outdoor environments and at different distances. First, a corresponding pose recognition dataset for complex scenes was created based on the YOLO network. Then, the OpenPose method was used to detect key points of the human body. Finally, the Kalman filter multi-object tracking method was used to predict the state of human targets within the occluded area. Real-time detection of human postures (sitting, stand up, standing, sit down, walking, fall down, and lying down) is achieved with corresponding alarms to ensure the timely detection and processing of emergencies.},

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes an Informer based method for stock intraday price prediction. Informer based on attention mechanism can efficiently capture precise long-range dependencies between input and output to increase the prediction capacity. In this research, historical K-line data of traditional securities in China’s financial market are collected. Based on this data set, the intraday stock price prediction performance of Informer and Long Short-Term Memory neural network (LSTM) is compared. The experiment also uses the three-day K-line model to perform pattern recognition on the K-line data of candidate stocks. The results show that the prediction performance of Informer is significantly higher than that of LSTM, and the data information after three-day K-line pattern recognition can improve the prediction accuracy of Informer and reduce time and space overhead of Informer.},

Initially, the Swin Transformer is employed in the capacity of an encoder for extracting images, while feature enhancement is adopted to gather additional image feature information. Subsequently, a multi-stage image and semantic fusion module is constructed to utilize the semantic information from past time steps.

  abstract     = {The microservice architecture breaks through the traditional cluster architecture mode based on virtual machines and uses containers as carriers to interact through lightweight communication mechanisms to reduce system coupling and provide more flexible system service support. With the expansion of the system scale, a large number of system logs with complex structures and chaotic relationships are generated. How to accurately analyze the system logs and make efficient fault prediction is particularly important for building a safe and reliable system. By studying neural network technology, this paper proposes an Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (Bi-LSTM). Combined with the dual channel convolutional neural network model (DCNN), it uses the attention mechanism to explore the differences between dimensional features, realizes multi-dimensional feature fusion, and establishes a BiLSTM-DCNN deep learning model that integrates the attention mechanism. From the perspective of social network analysis, a data preprocessing method is proposed to process fault redundant data and improve the accuracy of fault prediction under Microservices. Compare BiLSTM-DCNN with the mainstream system log analysis machine learning models SVM, CNN and Bi-LSTM, and explore the advantages of BiLSTM-DCNN in processing microservice system log text. The model is applied to simulation data and HDFS data set for experimental comparison, which proves the good generalization ability and universality of BiLSTM-DCNN.},

  abstract     = {Mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) face significant challenges due to the lack of centralized infrastructure and efficient routing techniques, which hinder optimal data transfer. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a Centralized Infrastructure-Aware, Reliable Data Transaction Model for IoT-enabled MANETs in a cloud environment. The model incorporates novel approaches to enhance network efficiency and security, including the Learning-based Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm (LDMOA) and Extended Long-Short Term Recurrent Neural Network (ELRNN). The proposed framework operates in several stages: node initialization, optimal cluster head selection using LDMOA, and clustering. Multipath generation and path detail extraction follow, after which a hash tree is constructed and stored on a fog server. The trustworthiness of each path is evaluated using the KT-Fuzzy decision-making algorithm. If the trust is high, LDMOA selects the optimal path for data transfer, which is then encrypted using the Extended Particle Collision Chaos (EPCC) algorithm. The path’s hash code is verified in the fog server, and the data undergoes intrusion detection. The data path is re-configured if an attack is detected; otherwise, secure data are forwarded to the cloud server. The intrusion detection process involves data collection, feature extraction, and classification, with ELRNN used to predict potential attacks. The proposed ELRNN model achieves an accuracy of 98.42%, significantly outperforming traditional methods such as RNN, RBM, DBN, and DNN, which have maximum accuracies of around 93.57%. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of the ELRNN in detecting intrusions in Blockchain-based IoT devices, showcasing enhanced performance in precision, recall, and overall reliability compared to existing techniques.},

To overcome these disadvantages, a multi-strategy artificial electric field algorithm (MAEFA) is proposed in this paper. For the MAEFA algorithm, the global optimal solution information is utilized to improve the diversity of population and global search ability. Then, the adaptive Coulomb’s constant is configured to balance the global exploration and local search. Also, a restart strategy is designed to further alleviate the premature convergence. To validate the effectiveness of MAEFA, it is compared with three AEFA algorithms and several other evolutionary algorithms on 14 test problems presented in CEC 2005 and 13 basic benchmark functions. Furthermore, a wind power prediction model based on MAEFA algorithm and back-propagation (BP) neural network is established to investigate its application ability. Experiments show that MAEFA is significantly superior to other algorithms in tackling these benchmark functions with different dimensions. Furthermore, in terms of wind power prediction, the BP neural network model optimized by MAEFA algorithm also provides higher prediction accuracy.},

Thus, methods for detecting Deepfake are crucial. The recent methods for Deepfake detection have performed well in distinguishing real content from fake content. Some research employed the Transformer technique, commonly used in natural language processing (NLP), to enhance performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deepfake detection method that transforms extracted features into words and utilizes NLP techniques for deepfake classification. We employed a fine-tuned pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to extract features from the face images in the videos. These extracted features are labeled based on grouping methods, such as mean and standard deviation (SD). Tokenization and classification are then performed using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Additionally, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is used as another tokenizer and classifier to compare the performance of deepfake detection between the traditional model and the NLP model. The result states that the method using BERT as a tokenizer and classifier with Mean and SD grouping method shows better efficiency, achieving 99.57% on the Roc Curve, 99.58% Accuracy, 99.18% Precision, 100.00% recall, and 99.59% F -measure.},

Due to differences between flight trajectories and other kinds trajectories and difficult access to data and complex domain knowledge, MFTP in FOQA is much more challenging than Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) in Air Traffic Control (ATC) and other trajectory prediction. In this work, a deep Koopman neural operator-based multi-dimensional flight trajectory prediction framework, called Deep Koopman Neural Operator-Based Multi-Dimensional Flight Trajectories Prediction (FlightKoopman), is first proposed to address this challenge. This framework is based on data-driven Koopman theory, enables to construct a prediction model using only data without any prior knowledge, and approximate operator pattern to capture flight maneuver for downstream tasks. The framework recovers the complete state space of the flight dynamics system with Hankle embedding and reconstructs its phase space, and combines a fully connected neural network to generate the observation function of the state space and the approximation matrix of the Koopman operator to obtain an overall model for predicting the evolution. The paper also reveals a virgin dataset Civil Aviation Flight University of China (CAFUC) that could be used for MFTP tasks or other flight trajectory tasks. CAFUC Datasets and code is available at this repository: https://github.com/CAFUC-JJJ/FlightKoopman .

Researchers are focusing on predicting ASD using image-processing techniques due to its neurological nature. The proposed novel Hybrid Convolutional Bilateral filter-based Deep Dual Swin Axial Generator Attention with Gooseneck Barnacle Optimization (FCB-DDSATGA-GBO) accurately predicts ASD. The facial image dataset is the input data source. The Hybrid Fast Convolutional Bilateral Filter (HFCBF) is used to pre-process the data. Dual Deep Autoencoder and Split Generative Adversarial Network (DDASGAN) is used to extract static features. Additionally, Swin-Gated Axial Attention Transformer (SGAAT) is used to segment the image. To forecast ASD, DDASGAN is used and optimized with Gooseneck Barnacle Optimization (GBO). The performance of the suggested methodology can be assessed using measures such as accuracy, recall, precision, sensitivity, f-score, and error, and compared to existing methods. The suggested FCB-DDSATGA-GBO model outperforms the current techniques, offering an enhanced f1-score of 99.66%, recall of 99.66%, accuracy of 99.67%, specificity of 99.67%, and precision of 99.66% when utilizing facial images.},

  abstract     = {The integration of solar photovoltaic (SPV) systems with modular multiport converters (MMPC) enables efficient energy conversion and distribution, enhancing the overall performance and reliability of renewable energy systems (RES). However, the complexity of the control algorithms and potential issues related to the dynamic response can pose challenges in achieving optimal performance and stability in varying operating conditions. This paper proposes a hybrid method for integrating SPV systems with MMPC to achieve efficient power management in modern renewable energy grids. The proposed hybrid method is the combined execution of the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA) and Relational Bi-level Aggregation Graph Convolutional Network (RBAGCN). Hence it is named as OOA-RBAGCN technique. The aim is to ensure optimal power transfer, minimize total harmonic distortion (THD), maintain voltage stability under dynamic operating conditions, and ultimately improve the overall energy efficiency, reliability, and performance of SPV-based RES within smart grid applications. The OOA is used to optimize the control parameter of the proportional-integral (PI) controller. The RBAGCN is used to predict these optimized parameters. By then, the proposed approach is used on the MATLAB platform and compared with other approaches such as Starling Murmuration Optimization (SMO), Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO), Improved Harris Hawks Optimization (IHHO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed method achieves a high efficiency of 98.1%, and a reduced THD of 2.9% significantly surpassing all existing methods.},

  abstract     = {The rising incidence of heart disease requires effective and robust prediction algorithms, especially in Internet of Things (IoT)-cloud-based smart healthcare frameworks. This study presents a novel method for forecasting cardiovascular disease using superior data preprocessing, feature selection, and deep learning techniques. First, preprocessing is done using the Z-score min–max normalization technique to ensure consistent data scaling and standardize the dataset. After preprocessing, an innovative hybrid feature selection technique that combines Black Widow Optimization (BWO) and Influencer Buddy Optimization (IBO) is utilized. By achieving equilibrium between invention and execution, the BWO-IBO technique enhances feature selection and extracts the most pertinent information for heart disease prediction. The Gates-Controlled Deep Unfolding Network (GCDUN), which is based on the Crayfish Optimization Algorithm (COA), is an innovative framework for prediction. Through the use of a gates-controlled mechanism and a COA component that speeds up network parameter tuning based on crayfish behavior, GCDUN-COA increases feature representation and enhances the decision plane. The fusion of the IoT and a cloud-based framework takes the present data collection, processing, and remote monitoring a notch higher, thus making the system highly scalable and efficient for clinical use. When predicting cardiac disease, the method recommended shows improved F1-score, specificity, accuracy, recall, and precision continuously achieving above 99% across all performance metrics. By providing prompt diagnosis and intervention via an intelligent, adaptive prediction system, an IoT-driven cloud-based medical technology has the potential to revolutionize cardiac care.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge-based visual question answering relies on open-ended external knowledge and a fine-grained comprehension of both the visual content of images and semantic information. Existing methods for utilizing knowledge have the following limitations: (1) Language pre-training methods output answers in the form of plain text, which only understand shallow visual content; (2) The knowledge retrieved by image objects as labels is represented as first-order logic, making it difficult to infer complex questions. To address the above problems, this paper integrates visual-textual multimodal information, accumulates domain-specific and external multi-modal knowledge, introduces and supplements external objective facts, and proposes a multimodal knowledge graph construction and fact-assisted reasoning network (MKGFA). The network consists of three parts: the multimodal knowledge graph construction module (MKGC), the objective fact-assisted reasoning module (FAR), and the answer inference module. The MKGC engages in the coarse-to-fine-grained learning of triplet representations for multimodal knowledge units. The FAR establishes deep cross-modal relations between visual objects and factual words for correlating real answers. The answer inference module makes the final decision based on the results of both. Among them, the former two modules employ a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, systematically accumulating foundational and domain-specific knowledge. Compared with the state-of-the-arts, MKGFA achieves 1.09% and 0.7% higher accuracy on the two challenging OKVQA and KRVQA datasets, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the complementary advantages of the integration of the two modules.},

  abstract     = {In the medical field, Internet of Things (IoT) applications allow for real-time diagnosis and remote patient monitoring, commonly called Internet of Health Things (IoHT). However, cybersecurity attacks may interrupt hospital operations and threaten patients’ health and well-being due to this integration. Hence, developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) suited explicitly for healthcare systems is essential to ensure efficiency and accuracy. Nevertheless, it is challenging to integrate anomaly-based IDS frameworks in healthcare systems as they necessitate additional processing time, temporal feature retention, and increased complexity. Therefore, a deep learning system based on SqueezeNet and NasNet is presented in this paper to detect intrusions in a healthcare setting. In this, SqueezeNet is employed to extract more significant features. On the other hand, network breaches while data transmission across distinct locations are detected by the NasNet-based classifier. In addition, the Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA) is applied to adjust the classifier’s hyperparameters, guaranteeing that it would accurately detect attacks. Moreover, the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) approach is integrated into the proposed framework to avoid data imbalance. Applying different performance constraints, the proposed approach is thoroughly assessed on three publicly available datasets (TON-IoT, ECU-IoHT, and WUSTL-EHMS). The results show that the proposed deep learning-based cybersecurity model outperforms traditional methods and produces better outcomes.},

In recent years, numerous researchers have combined GANs with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to address the issue of meteorological super-resolution. However, these models do not take into account the spatial variations of meteorological sequences. In this paper, we propose a super-resolution method named RN-STLSTM-GAN, which combines GANs with RN-STLSTM and ESA networks to learn the spatiotemporal features of meteorological sequences. Specifically, we first apply the RN-STLSTM at the initialization of the generator and discriminator to learn the spatiotemporal relationships between sequential images. Second, an ESA network is combined with the RN-STLSTM structure to enhance the learning of spatial features. Thirdly, LeakyReLU is used as the activation function for both the generator and discriminator to minimize the loss of image data during model training. Experiments conducted on the NJU-CPOL datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods and can generate realistic and temporally consistent super-resolution sequences for datasets at different heights.},

  abstract     = {Biotechnological analysis of DNA microarray genes provides valuable insights into the discovery and treatment of diseases such as cancer. It may also be crucial for the prevention and treatment of other genetic diseases. However, due to the large number of features and dimensions in a DNA microarray, the “curse of dimensions” problem is very common. Many machine learning methods require an effective subset of input genes to achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, extracting features (genes) is an inherently NP-hard problem. Recently, the use of metaheuristics to overcome the NP-hardness of the feature extraction problem has attracted the attention of many researchers. In this paper, we use the combination of fuzzy entropy and Giza Pyramid Construction (GPC) for feature selection. First, redundant features in the microarray dataset are removed using the fuzzy entropy approach. GPC is then used to reduce the execution time. This results in the selection of a near-optimal subset of genes for cancer detection. Dimensionality reduction with GPC followed by classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) creates a synergy to increase efficiency. The proposed method is tested on five well-known cancer patient datasets: leukemia, lymphoma, MLL, ovarian, and SRBCT. The performance of CNN was also measured with four well-known classifiers, including K-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayesian, decision tree, and logistic regression. Our results show that, on average, CNN has the highest accuracy, recall, precision, and F-measure in all datasets.},

However, existing research encounters challenges including low estimation accuracy, a deficiency of frequency domain features, and difficulty in integrating time domain and frequency domain features. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework called the Dual-Stream Fusion Network (DSFN). This framework combines the Time Domain Encoding (TDE) module, the Frequency Domain Hierarchical-Split Encoding (FDHSE) module, and a Two-Stage Feature Fusion (TSF) module. Specifically, the temporal stream of the framework employs the TDE module to capture deep temporal features that reflect the complex dynamic variations in time-series data. The frequency domain stream introduces the FDHSE module, which extracts frequency domain features using a multi-level, multi-scale approach, ensuring a comprehensive and diverse representation of frequency information. Through this dual-stream architecture, our model effectively learns both time and frequency domain features, addressing the limitations of frequency domain features observed in prior studies. Additionally, we propose the TSF module to fully integrate time and frequency domain features, effectively overcoming the challenge of fusing these two types of features. We conducted experiments on two public datasets, namely the GOTOV dataset (elderly people) and the JSI dataset (young people). Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance across different age groups. Compared to the baseline models, the proposed DSFN significantly improves the accuracy of human energy expenditure estimation.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid growth of the rural tourism industry, traditional tourism recommendation technologies can no longer meet the necessary requirements. To address the issue of rural tourist attraction recommendations, a rural tourist attraction recommendation model is constructed based on a multi-feature fusion graph neural network. First, construct a feature map based on the relationship between tourists’ preferences and tourist attractions, and incorporate the attention mechanism to enhance the model’s learning capabilities. Second, utilize a two-part graph model to extract positive and negative preference features of tourists, and a conversation graph model to extract tourists’ transfer preference features. Finally, various features are utilized to generate suggested content by computing scores for tourists’ travel preferences. To address the problem of recommending tourist groups, suitable features for random group matching are collected and the cosine function is employed to identify users with similar random group features. Finally, the multi-features are merged, and the tourists’ interest preferences are scored to arrive at content recommendations. In the experiment on individualized attraction recommendations, data from the Chengdu area were used to test the proposed model. The accuracy of the model’s recommendations was 0.822 for five recommendations which outperformed the other models. In the experiment for group-based attraction recommendations, this experiment tested the Chengdu dataset. The proposed model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.972 when the group size was 70, outperforming the other two models. Additionally, with regards to different numbers of recommendations, the proposed model’s accuracy was 0.5241, which was the best performance among the three models when the number of recommendations was set to five. The proposed recommendation model performs optimally in suggesting tourist attractions and meets the needs of rural tourism.

  abstract     = {Music composition, an intricate blend of human creativity and emotion, presents substantial challenges when generating melodies from lyrics which hinders effective learning in neural networks and the inadequate depiction of harmonic structure that fails to encapsulate the complex relationships between lyrics and melodies. The existing methods often struggle to balance emotional depth and structural coherence, leading to compositions that lack both the intended emotional resonance and musical consistency. To overcome these issues, this research introduces a novel approach named Dual Interactive Wasserstein Fourier Acquisitive Generative Adversarial Network (DIWFA-GAN), which integrates innovative techniques like swish activation functions and the Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO) for parameter optimization. Meanwhile, the GTO, inspired by the movement patterns of the Giant Trevally fish, provides efficient and effective parameter optimization, improving the model’s convergence speed and accuracy. Comparative analysis against recent existing models reveals superior performance for both the LMD-full MIDI and Reddit MIDI datasets, with impressive metrics including inception scores of 9.36 and 2.98, Fréchet inception distances of 35.29 and 135.54 and accuracies of 99.98% and 99.95%, respectively. The DIWFA-GAN significantly outperforms existing models in generating high-fidelity melodies, as evidenced by superior inception scores, Fréchet inception distances, and accuracies on both datasets.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a bi-population competition adaptive interior search algorithm (BCAISA) based on a reinforcement learning strategy is proposed for the classical flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) to optimize the makespan. First, the scheduling solution is represented using a machine-job-based two-segment integer encoding method, and various heuristic rules are then applied to generate the initial population. Secondly, a bi-population mechanism is introduced to partition the population into two distinct sub-populations. These sub-populations are specifically tailored for machine assignment and operation permutation, employing different search strategies respectively, aiming to facilitate an efficient implementation of parallel search. A competition mechanism is introduced to facilitate the information exchange between the two sub-populations. Thirdly, the ISA is adapted for the discrete scheduling problem by discretizing a series of search operators, which include composition optimization, mirror search, and random walk. A Q-learning-based approach is proposed to dynamically adjust a key parameter, aiming to strike a balance between the capacity for global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted based on 10 well-known benchmark instances of the FJSP. The design of the experiment (DOE) method is employed to determine the algorithm’s parameters. Based on the computational results, the effectiveness of four improvement strategies is first validated. The BCAISA is then compared with fifteen published algorithms. The comparative data demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other algorithms in 50% of benchmark instances. Additionally, according to the relative percentage deviation (RPD) from the state-of-the-art results, the BCAISA also exhibits superior performance. This highlights the effectiveness of our algorithm for solving the classical FJSP. To enhance the practical application, the scope of the ISA will be broadened in future work to more complex problems in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In pattern mining, high-utility itemset mining (HUIM) is useful for discovering high-utility patterns. The study of HUIM using heuristic techniques reflects issues in producing better offspring. It is ineffective in terms of search space organization, population diversity, and utility calculation, which impact runtime and accuracy. It is observed that very few researchers have experimented with genetic algorithm (GA) and are still facing the same issues as mentioned before. To overcome these problems, a novel approach is proposed for HUIM using modified GA and optimized local search (HUIM-MGALS) with six potential contributions. First is linking the utility with the Bitmap dataset to reduce utility access time, leading to effective search space organization. Second, HUIM-MGALS employs a fitness scaling strategy to avoid redundancy. Third, a high-utility itemset (HUI) revision strategy is employed to explore significant HUIs. Modified population diversity maintenance strategy and iterative crossover help to preserve significant HUIs and improve search capability as fourth and fifth contributions. Sixth, the use of multiple mutations refines the wasted individuals to boost accuracy. Extensive experimentation showed that HUIM-MGALS significantly outperforms the presented algorithms, up to 8.6 times faster. It also demonstrates superior HUI discovery capabilities for both sparse and dense datasets. This is supported by the modified population diversity maintenance strategy, which is proved to be the most impactful modification for HUI discovery in HUIM-MGALS.},

  abstract     = {In response to the security management issues of student apartments, a study is conducted on a student apartment access control system based on multitasking cascaded convolutional networks and FaceNet. Firstly, a face detection model is built based on an improved multi-task cascaded convolutional network, and then a face recognition model is built using FaceNet. The results showed that the detection accuracy of the multi-task cascaded convolutional network using the improved non-maximum suppression algorithm was 98.7%, which was higher than the traditional multi-task cascaded convolutional network and effectively improved the detection performance of the multi-task cascaded convolutional network. The face detection model based on the improved multi-task cascaded convolutional network had the shortest average detection time of 361 s, the highest average detection accuracy of 90.3%, an accuracy of 99%, a recall rate of 98.5%, and an F 1 value of 99%. While maintaining high detection efficiency, it also ensured the accuracy of detection. The average accuracy of the mask detection method based on the MobileNet V2 network was relatively high, at 98.96%. The facial recognition model based on FaceNet achieved a recognition accuracy of 99.15% for faces without masks and 92.04% for faces with masks, with the highest accuracy and recall rates of 99.3% and 99.6%. The model constructed in the study has good application effects in face detection, which helps to improve the security of the student apartment access control system.},

  abstract     = {In the research of deep learning, an Unsupervised deep convolution-generated Generated Adversarial Network (UGAN) usually needs a large number of data samples to train. However, when faced with some small samples, the performance of the algorithm is often degraded due to over-fitting. Combined with specially designed data enhancement methods, a generated adversarial network optimization algorithm based on adaptive data augmentation (AdauGAN) is proposed. The adaptive data augmentation module is added before the discriminant network, and a spatial transformation is carried out simultaneously at the probability distribution level of generated data and real data. To alleviate the over-fitting phenomenon in the training process, the current enhancement intensity is adjusted adaptively after the over-fitting occurs. The proposed algorithm is verified on SVHN, CelebA and CIFAR-10 data sets. The Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of AdauGAN achieve 22.10, 23.94, 34.87, respectively, which is close to or even higher than the training results of Deep Convolution Generated Adversarial Network (DCGAN) under all data. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed Adaugan has an excellent performance in small samples. Besides, in some cases, it can catch up with the large sample results of existing algorithms.},
