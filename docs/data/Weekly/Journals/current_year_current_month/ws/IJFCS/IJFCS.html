For 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k ‚àí 1 , the minimum i -degree Œ¥ i ( G ) of G is the minimum integer such that every i vertices are contained in at least Œ¥ i ( G ) edges. Let c i ( n , F ) be the largest minimum i -degree among all n -vertex k -uniform hypergraphs that have no F -covering. In this paper, we mainly consider the F -covering problem in 3 -uniform hypergraphs. When F is a generalized triangle T , we give the exact value of c 2 ( n , T ) and asymptotically determine c 1 ( n , T ) . Moreover, when F is a linear k -path P k or a star S k , we provide bounds of c i ( n , P k ) and c i ( n , S k ) for k ‚â• 3 , where i = 1 , 2 .},

A batch of jobs can be processed simultaneously in some available processing time interval as long as the total size of these jobs doesn‚Äôt exceed the machine capacity. The processing time of a job batch is the largest processing time of the jobs contained in this batch and the production progress is non-resumable. Our objective is to minimize the last maintenance completion time. For the case where jobs have unit processing times, we show the problem is strongly NP-hard and present a 2 -approximation algorithm. For the case where jobs have unit sizes, we show the problem is also strongly NP-hard and provide a 3 2 -approximation algorithm. Finally, we study the general case where jobs have non-identical processing times and sizes and propose a 3 -approximation algorithm.},

Each batch can process up to B jobs, and each job has a load l j > 0 . The start time of the jobs in the same batch is the same, and the completion time of the jobs in the same batch is the same. If the start time of job J j is t , then its actual load is l j = a j t . The load of a batch is the load of the longest job in the batch, i.e., the load of a batch is the load of the job with the largest deterioration rate in the batch. The processing time of a batch on machine M i is the ratio between the load of a batch and the speed s i .

One is the truss decomposition problem, which is to compute the truss number of every edge; the other is the truss maintenance problem, which is to update the truss numbers of the affected edges in a dynamic graph while avoiding the truss number recomputation of all edges. However, few results are known on edge-weighted graphs. In this paper, we focus on the truss maintenance problem on edge-weighted graphs. Firstly, we propose a basic algorithm for the truss decomposition problem on edge-weighted graphs. Then we propose two indices, weighted growth potential support (WGPS) and weighted remaining potential support (WRPS), to help find the edges with potential changes on their truss numbers. Finally, we propose algorithms for the truss maintenance problem on edge-weighted graphs.},

In this paper, we observe that NDE is caused by different diffusion heights (the number of fins) between two adjacent cells, and consider reducing the number of height differences in single row to reduce NDE violations. Ignoring the movement of the cells, we first propose a Hamiltonian-completion-based algorithm that reorders the cells in the row such that the number of NDE violations is reduced to a near-optimal value. Then, for a given fixed integer Œ∑ > 0 , we devise an algorithm to compute the new positions of cells, such that the number of NDE violations is bounded by Œ∑ + 1 and the maximum displacement is minimized. Moreover, we extend our algorithm for legalization in multiple rows against mixed-height cells. Experimental results show that our algorithm reduces the NDE violations to a near-optimal minimum without any area overheads while achieving a better practical running time compared to baselines conforming with the theoretical analysis.},

The concept of LPS function was proposed to describe the properties of some discrete functions or nonconvex continuous functions. It is a generalization of the lattice submodular function. For the real LPS maximization problem, we design the monotone Pseudo Frank-Wolfe (PFW) algorithm by taking advantage of the second derivative bound. The PFW algorithm iterates by constantly optimize linear gradient function v T ‚àá œï ( x ) , and finally outputs the solution. We theoretically prove that PFK algorithm has an approximation ratio of ( 1 ‚àí e ‚àí ( Œ≤ Œ≤ + 1 ) 2 ) (where Œ≤ ‚àà ( 0 , 1 ] ), and it needs at least O ( n Œ∂ ) rounds (where Œ∂ is a parameter given in advance).

PMMS is an important concept in the fair division. However, whether PMMS for indivisible items exists is still open. This work concentrates on PMMS by proving the existence of PMMS on linear graphs with binary valuation functions. Besides, this paper designs an algorithm to approximate PMMS in the case where different agents have identical valuations among the same items, achieving a ratio strictly greater than 0.8, which outperforms the state-of-the-art ratio of 0.781 from Kurokawa [22].

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study the single-machine scheduling problems with DeJong‚Äôs learning effect and deteriorating maintenance activity, where DeJong‚Äôs learning effect is a special position-based learning effect and the duration of the deteriorating maintenance activity is a linear increasing function of its starting time. Our goal is to determine the job sequence of all jobs and the position of the maintenance activity to minimize some performance measures. When the performance measures are the makespan and the total completion time, we show that both of them can be solved in polynomial time. When the performance measure is the total weighted completion time, we develop a pseudo-polynomial time dynamic programming algorithm under a special case. When the performance measure is the maximum lateness, we show that the earliest due date first (EDD) order is a bad algorithm for the general case, and develop a polynomial time algorithm under a special case.},

In this paper, we study the edge-weighted version of the Sparse Cut Problem, which minimizes the ratio of the total weight of edges between blocks and the total weight of edges incident to vertices in one block. We first prove that the problem is even NP-hard for an edge-weighted graph with bridges. Then, we combine and generalize submodular functions and principal partition to design a graph algorithm to improve the initial bipartition, which runs in polynomial time by using network flow as its subroutines.},

  abstract     = {Unsupervised image clustering is a challenging task in computer vision. Recently, various deep clustering algorithms based on contrastive learning have achieved promising performance and some distinguishable features representation were obtained only by taking different augmented views of same image as positive pairs and maximizing their similarities, whereas taking other images‚Äô augmentations in the same batch as negative pairs and minimizing their similarities. However, due to the fact that there is more than one image in a batch belong to the same class, simply pushing the negative instances apart will result in inter-class conflictions and lead to the clustering performance degradation. In order to solve this problem, we propose a deep clustering algorithm based on supported nearest neighbors (SNDC), which constructs positive pairs of current images by maintaining a support set and find its k nearest neighbors from the support set. By going beyond single instance positive, SNDC can learn more generalized features representation with inherent semantic meaning and therefore alleviating inter-class conflictions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show that the performance of SNDC is superior to the state-of-the-art clustering models, with accuracy improvement of 6.2% and 20.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-Dogs respectively.},

  abstract     = {The rapid expansion of infrastructure topology, especially noticeable in high-performance computing systems and data center networks, significantly increases the likelihood of failures in network components. While traditional (edge) connectivity has long been the standard for measuring the reliability of interconnection networks, this approach becomes less effective as networks grow more complex. To address this, two innovative metrics, named matroidal connectivity and conditional matroidal connectivity, have emerged. These metrics provide the flexibility to impose constraints on faulty edges across different dimensions and have shown promise in enhancing the edge fault tolerance of interconnection networks. In this paper, we explore (conditional) matroidal connectivity of the k k k -dimensional folded Petersen network F P k F P k FPk , which is constructed by iteratively applying the Cartesian product operation on the well-known Petersen graph and possesses a regular, vertex- and edge-symmetric architecture with optimal connectivity and logarithmic diameter. Specifically, the faulty edge set F F F is partitioned into k k k subsets according to the dimensions of F P k F P k FPk . We then arrange these subsets by their cardinality, imposing the restriction whereby the cardinality of the i i i th largest subset dose not exceed 3 ‚ãÖ 1 0 i ‚àí 1 3 ‚ãÖ 1 0 i ‚àí 1 3‚ãÖ10i‚àí1 for 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ k 1‚â§i‚â§k .

Here we investigate properties of kernels of general language families and operations defined thereon as well as kernels of (deterministic) (linear) context-free languages with a focus on Boolean operations. While the closures of language families are unique, this uniqueness is not obvious for kernels. We consider properties of language families and of operations that yield unique and non-unique, i.e. a set, of kernels. For the latter case, the question whether the union of all kernels coincides with the language family, or whether there are languages that do not belong to any kernel is addressed. Additionally, languages that are mandatory for each (Boolean) kernel and languages that are optional for (Boolean) kernels are studied. That is, we consider the intersection of all Boolean kernels as well as their union. The expressive capacities of these families are addressed leading to a hierarchical structure. Further closure properties are considered. Furthermore, we study descriptional complexity aspects of these families, where languages are represented by context-free grammars with proofs attached. It turns out that the size trade-offs between all families in question and deterministic context-free languages are non-recursive. That is, one can choose an arbitrarily large recursive function f , but the gain in economy of description eventually exceeds f when changing from the latter system to the former.},

We revise the deterministic complexity upper bounds of the quotient operation, and we also address the nondeterministic case. Specifically, the revised deterministic upper bound is shown to be more accurate for all hard streams of regular languages. When both languages R and L are regular, we give algorithms to construct their quotient in four ways. If the two languages are given via NFAs, the first algorithm produces an NFA for the desired quotient. If the two languages are given via regular expressions, we present an algorithm that produces a regular expression for the quotient both using ordinary derivatives and using partial derivatives. Finally, we consider regular expressions with a quotient operator and define the set of partial derivatives for regular expressions with this operator. Thus, using the partial derivative automaton, one can directly produce an NFA for the quotient. We have implemented all algorithms and present here experimental results.},

  abstract     = {We study one-way nondeterministic pushdown automata ( N P D A ), optionally with reversal-bounded counters. Finite-turn pushdown automata are pushdown automata with a bound on the number of switches between pushing and popping. We give new characterizations for finite-turn pushdown automata, and for finite-turn pushdown automata augmented with reversal-bounded counters. The first is in terms of multi-tape nondeterministic finite automata ( N F A ), and the second is in terms of multi-tape N F A with reversal-bounded counters. We then use the characterizations to determine the complexity of the languages defined by these automata. In particular, we show that languages accepted by finite-turn N P D A augmented with reversal-bounded counters are in N L O G . For the non-finite-turn case, the languages are in D S P A C E ( log 2 n ) and in P . We also look at the space complexity of languages accepted by two-way machines. In particular, we show that every language accepted by a two-way N P D A with reversal-bounded counters that makes a polynomial (resp., exponential) number of input head reversals is in D S P A C E ( log 2 n ) (resp., D S P A C E ( n 2 ) ). This remains true if the pushdown can flip its contents a bounded number of times.},

Also these lower bounds are matched exactly by witness languages, for each œÉ , Œº , ‚Ñì . If the length of the loop is fixed, the size of the preamble is bounded by O ( œÉ / log œÉ ) .

In this paper, we generalize the LIS problem to the longest wave subsequence (LWS) problem, which encompasses two versions: LWSt and LWSr. Given a numeric sequence A of distinct values and a target trend sequence T , the LWSt problem aims to identify the longest subsequence of A that preserves the trend of the prefix of T . And, the LWSr problem aims to find the longest subsequence of A within r segments, alternating increasing and decreasing subsequences. We propose two efficient algorithms for solving the two versions of the LWS problem. For the LWSt problem, the time complexity of our algorithm is O ( n log n ) , where n represents the length of the given numeric sequence A . Additionally, we propose an O ( r n log n ) -time algorithm for solving the LWSr problem. In both algorithms, we utilize the priority queues for the insertion, deletion, and successor operations.},

  abstract     = {Soft set theory is a mathematical approach to address the challenges of handling vague or uncertain information. It is a more advanced version of classical set theory that deals with imprecise elements and enables the flexible representation of uncertain data. It involves categorizing the elements of the universe based on specific parameters. Semigraph is a generalization of a graph which is different from a hypergraph. A hypergraph extends the concept of a graph by allowing any subset of vertices to form an edge. Semigraphs, on the other hand, distinguish themselves from hypergraphs by imposing a specific order on the vertices within each edge. Soft semigraphs were developed using the principles of soft set theory applied to semigraphs. This study introduces Eulerian and Hamiltonian soft semigraphs. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a soft semigraph to be Eulerian, relying on parameters such as p -part consecutive adjacent degree, p -part end degree, and the p -part consecutive adjacency graph. Additionally, we provide the conditions for a soft semigraph to be Hamiltonian. We introduce the concept of maximal non-Hamiltonian p -part. Finally, we define the closure of a soft semigraph and demonstrate the relationship between a Hamiltonian soft semigraph and its closure.},

A set of vertices in a graph G , say S , is a paired dominating set if the following two conditions are satisfied: (i) every vertex of G has a neighbor in S and (ii) the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching. The paired domination integrity of G , denoted by P D I ( G ) , is defined as P D I ( G ) = m i n { | S | + m ( G ‚àí S ) : S is¬†a¬†paired¬†dominating¬†set¬†of¬†G } , where m ( G ‚àí S ) is the order of the largest component in the induced subgraph of G ‚àí S .

  abstract     = {The Maximum Independent Set problem is well-studied in graph theory and related areas. An independent set of a graph is a subset of non-adjacent vertices of the graph. A maximum independent set is an independent set of maximum size. This paper studies the Maximum Independent Set problem in some classes of geometric intersection graphs in a distributed setting. More precisely, we study the Maximum Independent Set problem on two geometric intersection graphs, interval and axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, and present deterministic distributed algorithms in a model that is similar but a little weaker than the local communication model. We compute the maximum independent set on interval graphs in O ( k ) rounds and O ( n ) messages, where k is the size of the maximum independent set and n is the number of nodes in the graph. We provide a matching lower bound of Œ© ( k ) on the number of rounds, whereas Œ© ( n ) is a trivial lower bound on message complexity. Thus, our algorithm is both time and message-optimal. We also study the Maximum Independent Set problem in interval count l graphs, a special case of the interval graphs where the intervals have exactly l different lengths. We propose an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that runs in O ( l ) round. For axis-parallel segment intersection graphs, we design an 1 2 -approximation algorithm that obtains a solution in O ( D ) rounds. The results in this paper extend the results of Molla et al. [J. Parallel Distrib. Comput. 2019].},

The minimal polynomial and the linear complexity of the proposed sequences are determined in most cases under the assumption that r q ‚àí 1 ‚â¢ 1 ( mod q 2 ) . The result shows that each of the sequences has large linear complexity.},

  abstract     = {The Wiener index is the sum of distances of all pairs of nodes in a graph; and the Zagreb index is defined as the sum of squares of the degrees of nodes in a rooted tree. In this note, we calculate the first two moments of the Wiener and Zagreb indices of random exponential recursive trees (random ERTs) from two systems of recurrence relations. Then, by an application of the contraction method, we characterize the limit law for a scaled Zagreb index of ERTs. Via the martingale convergence theorem, we also show the almost sure convergence and quadratic mean convergence of an appropriately scaled Wiener index that is indicative of the distance of two randomly chosen nodes.},

The function h is called an outer-independent double Roman dominating function (OIDRDF) if the following conditions are satisfied. The outer-independent double Roman domination number of G is defined by Œ≥ o i d R ( G ) = min ‚àë v ‚àà V h ( v ) : h is an OIDRDF OF G . We prove that the decision problem MOIDRDP, corresponding to Œ≥ o i d R ( G ) is NP-complete for split graphs.

Finally, we show that the MOIDRDP and domination are not equivalent in computational complexity aspects.},

  abstract     = {The existence of multiple edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (EDHCs for short) is a desirable property of interconnection networks. These parallel cycles can provide an advantage for algorithms that require a ring structure. Additionally, EDHCs can enhance all-to-all data broadcasting and edge fault tolerance in network communications. In this paper, we investigate the construction of EDHCs in the balanced hypercube, which is a variant of the hypercube with many attractive properties, such as strong connectivity, regularity, and symmetry. In particular, each processor in the balanced hypercube has a backup processor that shares the common neighbors, enabling fault tolerance and efficient system reconfiguration. In 2019, L√º et al. provided an algorithm to construct two EDHCs in an n -dimensional balanced hypercube B H n for n ‚â• 2 . We further study this topic and give some construction schemes to construct 2 ‚åä log 2 n ‚åã EDHCs in B H n for n ‚â• 2 . Since B H n is 2 n -regular, our result is optimal for n = 2 r ( r ‚â• 1 ). In addition, we simulate the fault-tolerant data broadcasting through these parallel cycles as transmission channels.},
