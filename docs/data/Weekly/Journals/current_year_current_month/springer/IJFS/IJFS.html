  abstract     = {In the dynamic landscape of tourism development, competitiveness hinges on the continuous progress of visitor destinations. This manuscript intricately navigates the dynamics of tourism, directing efforts toward the sustainable development and meticulous planning of tourism cities tailored to accommodate various forms of tourism. Within the inherent uncertainty of these dynamic scenarios, the theory of linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets emerges as a potent tool, surpassing conventional fuzzy set theories. This manuscript extends the utility of linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets by introducing the concept of bipolarity, giving rise to the innovative bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy model. The model seamlessly integrates bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets, providing a versatile extension of existing fuzzy set theories and enabling the effective handling of more generalized information. Precision in decision-making is heightened through the incorporation of negative linguistic-valued membership degrees, adeptly addressing preferences among parameters. Furthermore, the manuscript introduces aggregation operators, including bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted averaging and geometric operators, delving into their properties and presenting impactful results. Validation of the proposed model is achieved through a rigorously tested multi-attribute decision-making algorithm applied to sustainable development and planning in tourism cities. A comprehensive comparative analysis with existing approaches meticulously showcases the advantages of the introduced model in effectively addressing challenges posed by the development of touristic cities. The results unequivocally affirm the superiority of the proposed bipolar linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy approach, endowing decision-makers with an enhanced capacity to navigate a diverse array of situations effectively. This scholarly contribution not only enhances tourism cities tailored to different forms of tourism but also catalyzes the sustainable development of tourism cities.},

  abstract     = {This paper designs a robust control scheme with optimal adaptive fuzzy approximation and variable structure nonlinear dynamic inversion (VSNDI) to solve the problems of multi-mode variable structure flight and unknown combined concurrent disturbances of hypersonic morphing vehicle (HMV). First, an VSNDI controller is proposed in the affine HMV. Then fuzzy approximation estimates the nonlinear parameters, where the iterative optimization strategy minimizes the estimation errors and makes the nonlinear parameters accurate enough to ensure the VSNDI’s effectiveness. Aiming at the combination disturbances formed by the approximation errors and external multi-disturbances, the variable structure adaptive law in each channel is proposed to adjust the amplitudes of the fuzzy free parameter weights, thence combining the independently designed fuzzy robust compensator to real-time suppress disturbances. The variable structure residual adaptive laws for cross-channel nonlinear matrices in VSNDI solve the coupling problem of the combined concurrent disturbances caused by sea-skimming flight. Finally, variable structure and fuzzy control scheme enable HMV to achieve accurate tracking under multi-mode and complex disturbances. The system stability is proved by Lyapunov theory, and the effectiveness of the method is proved by simulation experiment.},

  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) have become a crucial option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing the reliance on fossil fuels and promoting the use of renewable energy. However, many research efforts have overlooked the detailed analysis of EV characteristics and charging networks, leading to scalability issues, inefficiencies in the charging process, and increased energy consumption. To address these challenges, this study introduces the Fuzzy Discrete Squirrel Search (FDSS) algorithm, which is designed to enhance charging capacity and reduce pollution. While EV manufacturing and network simulation models continue to evolve, there is a need for further optimization. This study summarizes key research findings related to EVs, including their market penetration, design methodologies, and innovative technologies. The primary objective of this work is to uncover the hidden benefits of EV charging characteristics using the Discrete Squirrel Search (DSS) optimization algorithm in combination with a fuzzy logic controller. The FDSS algorithm has been selected to improve performance and effectively identify the latent advantages of EV charging. In developing countries, this research is particularly significant, as it addresses critical obstacles such as inadequate charging infrastructure. Additionally, the concept of “vehicle-to-grid” provides a backup power source when renewable energy is unavailable. Our conclusion emphasizes the importance of recognizing the unique characteristics of EVs to enhance their mobility and overall effectiveness.},

State feedback controller is converted to fault-tolerant control and control gain matrices are derived to improve system stability in the presence of faults. Using Lyapunov-krasovskii functional and Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs), this study establishes precise stability proofs and analytical constraints to ensure stochastic mean-square stability. The use of LMIs enables the systematic design of fault-tolerant controllers and provides a formal framework for handling faults while maintaining system performance. Moreover, numerical simulations using a MATLAB LMI toolbox validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control strategy under various fault scenarios, highlighting its practical applicability in complex dynamical networks.},

  abstract     = {Because several groups of decision makers participate in modern fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems, membership functions and linguistic terms may be simultaneously utilized by decision makers to represent assessments of alternatives. Due to linguistic terms mean different things to different decision makers in natural language, unifying membership functions and linguistic terms is a difficult problem in assessments aggregation process. Based on conceptual structure of Zadeh’s computing with words and decision makers’ individual semantics of linguistic terms, the formal linguistic concepts of linguistic terms in fuzzy decision environment are proposed in the paper, which provide a framework to uniformly represent various fuzzy assessments of alternatives. Then the representatives of extensions of formal linguistic concepts are generated by aggregating decision makers’ individual semantics of linguistic terms, which can be regarded as decision makers’ common recognition on meanings of linguistic terms. In essence, computing with linguistic terms in the decision process is to compute meanings of linguistic terms, which depends on precisiation of meanings of linguistic terms. However, precisiation of meaning is an open problem in Zadeh’s computing with words, the representatives of meanings of linguistic terms are reasonable substitutions to correctly understand and compute linguistic terms of mixed decision making problems. Meanwhile, the formal linguistic concepts of linguistic terms also present a new transformation method between membership functions and linguistic terms, which can be utilized to transform a mixed decision matrix into a linguistic decision matrix or a fuzzy decision matrix. Then the mixed decision making problems can be managed by existing linguistic or fuzzy number decision making methods. Based on the designed algorithm of the mixed decision analysis, a mixed decision making problem is employed to verify the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed methods, furthermore our method in mixed decision making problem is compared with the 2-tuple linguistic decision making method and the fuzzy number decision making method.},

Compared with the previous MFD convexification method, this improved convexification method removes the positive restriction imposed on the slack matrices, so it reduces the conservatism of the analysis results and helps to expand the system feasible area. In addition, this improved convexification method can also be extended to the saturated PPF systems (SPPF), and together with the convexification method proposed for the nonconvex estimation conditions of the polyhedron domain of attraction (DOA), the more relaxed results can be derived to obtain a larger estimation of DOA. In both cases, without and with input saturation constraints, a numerical example is used to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controller design methodology and novel convexification methods in enlarging the feasible area and estimation of DOA.},

  abstract     = {With the development of information technology, Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) has had a profound impact on the traditional college English teaching model with its rich learning content, innovative learning forms, and open learning resources. However, it itself has the shortcomings of an incomplete management system, difficulty in achieving credit recognition, serious resource waste, and a vague platform development path. Therefore, adopting a simple replacement approach is not feasible. Integrating traditional teaching models with MOOC teaching models is essential. By developing a distinctive English curriculum system, utilizing flipped classroom teaching methods, adapting to information-based online teaching models, and fostering positive learning concepts, MOOC can fully leverage its advantages under the guidance of traditional teaching models. This integration allows both models to complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, thereby enhancing the reform of college English curriculum teaching. The evaluation of college English teaching quality based on MOOC involves Multi-Attribute Group Decision Making (MAGDM). Currently, methods such as Exponential TODIM (ExpTODIM) and MABAC are employed to implement MAGDM. Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) are used to represent fuzzy information during the evaluation of college English teaching quality based on MOOC. This study introduces the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ExpTODIM–MABAC (IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC) approach for MAGDM under IVIFSs. Finally, a numerical example for college English teaching quality evaluation based on MOOC is provided to validate the IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC approach. The major contributions of this study are as follows: (1) The ExpTODIM–MABAC method was extended to incorporate IVIFSs along with Entropy model; (2) Entropy is used to determine the weights under IVIFSs; (3) The IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC approach is proposed for MAGDM under IVIFSs; (4) numerical example and various comparative analyses for college English teaching quality evaluation based on MOOC are conducted to validate the IVIFN–ExpTODIM–MABAC approach.},

The main contribution of this study is as follows. First, a mixed fleet strategy is introduced, integrating fuel hazmat vehicles (FHVs) and electric hazmat vehicles (EHVs) to boost efficiency and cut emissions. Second, this study develops a bi-objective Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) model with fuzzy time windows for flexible scheduling. Third, an adaptive intuitionistic fuzzy large neighborhood search (AIFLNS) algorithm is proposed, using intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) to refine scoring mechanisms and operation selection. In this way, this study not only enhances the efficiency of hazmat transportation, but also promotes green logistics in port hinterlands. Finally, experimental results show that the AIFLNS reduces transportation costs and enhances service satisfaction, outperforming adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS), and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on simplifying the use procedure and calculation of general type-2 fuzzy systems by way of extracting their the interpolation functions. Firstly, four kinds of fuzzification methods with special laws are designed to construct the general type-2 fuzzy sets in the antecedents and consequents of type-2 inference rules. On this basis, together with the KM algorithm, $$\alpha $$ -plane representation and interpolation conclusions of interval type-2 fuzzy systems, three types of interpolation functions of general type-2 fuzzy systems are obtained. In the meantime, all of the interpolation functions have been proved as universal approximators. It can be seen that in future applications of general type-2 fuzzy systems, interpolation functions can be applied directly instead of conventional blocks. Because of the ingenious design of the general type-2 fuzzy sets on operations, the computation of general type-2 fuzzy systems has been greatly reduced. In order to verify the validity and superiority of the proposed methods, simulation results with a type-1 fuzzy system, an interval type-2 fuzzy system and two general type-2 fuzzy systems for the approximation problem of dynamic systems are presented. The simulations exhibit that the suggested approaches have good and desired performance.},

  abstract     = {The smart substations is the core part of smart grids which affect the development of the economy and people’s livelihood. This paper constructs a comprehensive benefit evaluation index system of smart substation construction project from four dimensions: intelligent benefit, economic benefit, green benefit, and safe benefit to meet the requirements of national development. The attribute value of the evaluation index is hybrid information including language variable, exact number, and normal distribution interval number, which can handle the complex sources of information. On this basis, this study constructs a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model for hybrid information based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory, subjective and objective weighting method, and improved TOPSIS evaluation method. Firstly, the model uses different transformation rules to unify the hybrid information into the form of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory. Secondly, based on the cooperative game model, this paper uses a weighting method which combines subjective weighting method (group eigenvalue method) and objective weighting method (intuitionistic fuzzy entropy) to determine the comprehensive weight of indicators, which can avoid the limitations of using single weighting method and makes the weights more scientific and reasonable. Thirdly, an improved TOPSIS evaluation model based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets is proposed. The Euclidean distance in traditional TOPSIS method is replaced by cosine similarity, which overcomes the shortcoming of using Euclidean distance. Finally, this paper analyzes 10 cases of smart substation construction projects and puts forward improvement strategies based on the results, the results prove that the model is feasible and it can assist decision makers in making scientific decisions based on different situations. In addition, this hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model is compared with three other models, which proves that the proposed model has good robustness and sensitivity.},

  abstract     = {The $$p,q-$$ quasirung orthopair fuzzy sets represent an innovative advancement in fuzzy set theory, addressing the constraints inherent in $$q-$$ rung orthopair fuzzy sets. This new extension has gained considerable traction in multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) scenarios. The Combinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) method is designed to enhance the multi-criteria selection process by maximizing both Euclidean and Taxicab distances relative to negative ideal solutions. In the literature, different extensions are proposed. However, these extensions are unable to address situations where decision makers may employ varying term levels for membership degrees. To bridge this gap, this paper enhances the traditional CODAS method by incorporating $$p,q-$$ quasirung orthopair fuzzy ( $$p,q-$$ QOF) numbers to effectively solve multi-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM) problems with incomplete weight information. The proposed CODAS approach enables decision makers to set distinct term levels (p and q) for membership and non-membership, enhancing evaluation precision. To illustrate the application of the proposed approach, a numerical example pertaining to retail location selection is presented. The comparative study demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach over several relevant methods. In addition, a sensitivity analysis of the proposed CODAS method, conducted by varying the criteria weights, reveals a high degree of stability in the results.},

Compared with existing results, this article investigates a category of nonlinear strict-feedback systems, and real system states as well as real control inputs is not available under FDI attacks, which renders the controller design extremely complicated. To counteract the impact caused by sensor attacks, a fuzzy adaptive defense mechanism is constructed by the variable separation technique. Furthermore, actuator attacks are addressed by the Nussbaum function. In order to decrease the communication load on the control channel, a dynamic event-triggered strategy is introduced. Moreover, all signals of the closed-loop systems under the proposed control method are bounded, and output consensus with asymptotic convergence is realized in the case of FDI attacks. Finally, simulation studies are offered to assess the feasibility of the presented control method.},

  abstract     = {In social network group decision-making (SNGDM), it is difficult for decision-makers (DMs) to reach a consensus owing to individuals’ opinions being influenced by others and evolving over time. Moreover, the existing social trust functions are incapable for depicting uncertainty and interference effect of trusts simultaneously, which are driven by the unpredictable human cognition. To address these problems, this study proposes a novel complex intuitionistic fuzzy trust propagation-based group consensus model with opinion evolution under bilayer coupled social network. Firstly, the novel concept of complex intuitionistic fuzzy trust (CIFT) function is put forward to model the direct trust between DMs in SNGDM. Secondly, trust propagation operator on CIFTs is presented based on Einstein operations to derive the indirect trust between DMs. Then, a novel quantum weighted averaging trust aggregation operator considering interference effect is proposed to aggregate multiple trust propagation paths into a collective one. Thirdly, the propagation and aggregation of CIFTs under bilayer coupled social network are explored by obtaining the projection of the two-layer network. In addition, degree-centrality and clustering coefficient are further calculated to derive DMs’ weights. Fourthly, the network partition algorithm is conducted to divide the projection network into several sub-networks and a novel consensus optimization model with opinion evolution is developed to guide leaders on adjusting their opinions during consensus reaching process. Eventually, an illustrative case on joint venture capital is provided to show the feasibility of above methods. The superiority and rationality of our proposal are further revealed by a series of simulations and comparative analysis.},

ANOVA and the ReliefF algorithm were used to select significant features (mRNAs). Additionally, a novel Graph Attention Network (GAT) model based on the Fuzzy theory was introduced, incorporating the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for the attention mechanism. The proposed Graph Fuzzy Attention Network (GFAT) model, as part of the proposed classifier, was utilized to classify two groups: PCa patients with and without metastasis.

Both controllers are designed using Matlab/Simulink and tested through trajectory tracking simulations in the CoppeliaSim environment. In addition, a non-linear model predictive controller (NMPC) is proposed and compared against the fuzzyPID controllers. The impact of tunable parameters on NMPC’s tracking accuracy is thoroughly examined. We also present plots of the step-response characteristics and noise rejection experiments for each controller. Simulation results validate the precision and effectiveness of NMPC over fuzzyPID controllers while trading computational complexity.

Data from China’s financial markets is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed portfolio optimization models. The performance of optimal portfolios differs with respect to investors’ coherent perceptions and outperforms the benchmark models. Rational investors assign equal importance to lower and upper return-risk ratios in the optimal portfolio, selecting a robust investment strategy in the first period. Optimistic investors prioritize upper ratios and choose an aggressive investment strategy while pessimistic investors prefer lower ratios and choose a conservative investment strategy. Due to the different sensitivity to risk, rational and optimistic investors reduce the proportions of high-risk assets, while pessimistic investors increase the proportions of high-risk assets during next periods. The findings demonstrate that the model offers diverse investment strategies and serves as a valuable reference for different categories of investors to engage in multi-period asset allocation and risk management.},

In this case, Shadowed Sets theory is implemented in Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Sets to approximate the secondary membership functions, in this way reducing the number of $$\alpha $$ -planes to only two and contributing to the development of more efficient models based on Type-3 Fuzzy Logic.
