  abstract     = {This paper proposes a new method to regulate the voltage generated by a vehicle alternator using a fuzzy neural network (FNN) regulator. Variations of alternator loads and rotation speeds in a vehicle and different characteristics of alternators influence the regulated voltages of an alternator. To address this problem, this paper employs an FNN-based automatic voltage regulation (AVR) method to reduce regulated voltage fluctuations. The FNN regulator has three inputs: alternator speed expressed as revolutions per minute, load voltage, and ripple amplitude from an alternation rectifier bridge. Based on the three inputs, the FNN determines the duty cycle of pulse width modulation that switches on and off the alternator field to maintain a constant regulated voltage. The FNN comprises Takagi-Sugeno-type fuzzy rules built through structure and parameter learning. After learning, the FNN is implemented in a microcontroller unit. An alternator testing equipment is used to verify actual voltage regulation performances of the proposed FNN-based AVR. Experimental results show that the FNN helps determine optimal duty cycles to regulate the regulator voltages of different alternators under varying operating conditions, ensuring robust charging voltage. Comparisons with different AVR methods show the advantage of the proposed FNN-based AVR method.},

  abstract     = {Compared with general fault-tolerant control (FTC), fault-tolerant control with state constraints often requires more communication resource, making fault-tolerant control more challenging. This study investigates the adaptive fuzzy FTC problem for non-strict multi-agent systems (MASs) with asymmetric time-varying state constraints (ATVSCs). An adaptive fuzzy FTC based on distributed sliding-mode estimator is proposed to solve the control problem of systems with asymmetric time-varying state constraints when actuator and sensor faults occur. We desing the control strategy of this paper based on backstepping method. Firstly, because the tracking error of MASs contains the state information of neighbor nodes and its structure is complex, it is difficult to directly design time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (BLF). So the error structure is simplified by estimating the leader’s signal with the distributed sliding-mode estimator. Secondly, Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLSs) are used to approximate the unknown part of nonlinearity. Next, Nussbaum function is used to deal with the unknown control direction of the controller. Finally, the compensation function is designed to avoid repeated derivation of virtual control signals. At the same time, only one adaptive law needs to be constructed for each agent system, which reduces the computational complexity of the controller. The proposed adaptive fuzzy control strategy ensures all signals under restriction and bounded, and the tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood. Thus, the stability of the system is significantly improved. At last, the effect of the designed controller is demonstrated through simulation result.},

  abstract     = {In this article, we are proposing a novel fuzzy method that we call Type-3 Mediative Fuzzy Logic (T3MFL), as an extension of a previous construct called Mediative Fuzzy Logic (MFL) that was built with type-1 fuzzy sets and that handles imperfect knowledge in a wider fashion than Intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IFL). MFL was proposed to handle non-contradictory, doubtful, and contradictory information, offering a mediated solution, and this is why it was called it “Mediative.” Now we are extending MFL to the realm of type-3 and it is called T3MFL. The idea is to combine the capabilities of handling different kinds of uncertainty that type-3 and MFL possess on their own in one framework (T3MFL). The implementation of T3MFL to build type-3 mediative fuzzy systems was made by designing the general algorithm for efficiently constructing these systems. A comparative of T3MFL, MFL, IFL, and Fuzzy logic (FL), with some examples and an illustrative application, to show the advantages of the proposed T3MFL systems is presented. In the application, it is shown that T3MFL has the potential to outperform the previous approaches with type-3, type-2, type-1, and intuitionistic systems.},

Firstly, the original nonlinear systems are approximated using fuzzy modeling, while the zero-sum game framework is employed to solve the optimal control problem of singularly perturbed systems. Therefore, the nonlinear optimal control problem is reduced to designing fuzzy control policies by solving game algebraic Riccati equations. Subsequently, a model-free hybrid iteration approach is developed that removes the requirement for system dynamics. Furthermore, the hybrid iteration method does not rely on initial stabilizing control policies and has a faster convergence rate than value iteration.

In order to avoid full state violating constraints, a barrier Lyapunov function is constructed in each backstepping step. Specifically, a sufficient and necessary condition is provided to facilitate the stability analysis. An inequality about the fractional derivative of a certain convex function is derived, which can be applied to stability analysis of fractional systems with state constraints. According to fractional-order Lyapunov stability analysis, the proposed controller together with fractional adaptive laws, can ensure that not only system output tracks reference signal, but also all states are bounded and do not violate the full state constraints.

Meanwhile, T-S fuzzy singular semi-Markov jump systems are utilized to characterize nonlinear stochastic CPS. Furthermore, to address the asynchronous difficulties, we use the Hidden-Markov-Model to express the asynchronous state between the security controller and the original system. Furthermore, it is assumed that the conditional probability is only partially known. The physical layer of actuator defects is added to imitate the real scenario of the process of production. Then, using the random Lyapunov functional and the free weighting matrix approach, the closed-loop system’s regular, impulse free, and stochastically stable conditions are determined.

Frequency hopping is also employed to avoid unstable frequency bands. The proposed algorithm enables nodes to reduce power consumption and extend the system’s lifespan, while maintaining stable communication.

Since the DoS attacks result in the instability of MASs, to study the adaptive fuzzy secure consensus control (SCC) problem for nonlinear MASs under DoS attacks is a very important issue. This paper investigates the adaptive fuzzy output-feedback SCC issue for nonlinear MASs with directed topology under DoS attacks and intermittent actuator faults. Because the considered nonlinear MASs contain unknown nonlinear dynamics, fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are used to approximate unknown nonlinear functions. Then, a switching-type fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unknown system states under DoS attacks. Based on the proposed switching-type fuzzy sate observer, an adaptive fuzzy SCC method is proposed by combining Lyapunov stability theory with an average dwell time (ADT) method. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded and each follower’s output is able to track the leader. Finally, simulation and comparison results show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

After introducing the collision-free kinematic controller, the raised dynamic controller is designed in two stages: one is the smooth dynamic controller using fractional-order sliding-mode control to achieve finite-time stability and the other is the proposed FO-PID-SMC-FNLSTM-RBLS controller to deal with modeling uncertainties and exogenous disturbances. Comparative simulations and experimental results are conducted to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FO-PID-SMC-FNLSTM-RBLS control method for trajectory tracking of the 4ISIDW-AMR compared with other six controllers in slanted linear and circular trajectory tracking.},

  abstract     = {Gyroscopes play a crucial role in an extensive range of applications such as navigation systems, motion control, virtual reality, and many electronic devices. The efficiency of gyroscopes relies on the accurate measurement and control of rotational motion. Gyroscopes exhibit nonlinear behavior, especially at high angular velocities or high temperatures. Also, the performance of gyroscopes is violated by various disturbances such as vibration, electromagnetic interference, integration with other sensors, cross-axis sensitivity, temperature changes, mechanical imperfections, and aging components. To cope with these challenges, in this paper, an applied hybrid controller is developed. First, a basic linear quadratic regulator (LQR) is designed using the basic dynamics of the gyroscope. The dynamics uncertainties are modeled by the use of type-3 (T3) fuzzy logic systems (FLSs), and then a modified sliding mode controller (SMC) is designed. A soft switching mechanism is introduced based on adaptive T3-FLSs. The parameters of the T3-FLS in the identification sections and the T3-FLS in the switching section are online updated through a stability theorem. The feasibility is demonstrated by an experimental implementation. Also, by several simulations, the accuracy of tracking and robustness are examined. It is demonstrated that the suggested hybrid controller results in good efficiency in both simulation and real-world environments. (see the video of the experimental implementation at here )},

However, these two objectives are incompatible, and it is difficult to achieve their optimal values at the same time. This work presents a unique CDTA design technique based on the Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and the Fuzzy logic-based TOPSIS algorithm. The offered scheme treats the CDTA design as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) and achieves simultaneous power consumption minimization and transconductance gain maximization by optimizing the CDTA circuit’s transistor aspect ratio and biasing current. The NSGA-II-based CDTA design scheme is implemented and simulated using MATLAB R2008a and the PSPICE EDA tool. The simulation environment also takes into account the 130 nm TSMC MOSIS Level-49 model file. When compared to the existing CDTA design, the results show a 12% improvement in transconductance gain and a 39% reduction in power consumption.},

The methodology commences by representing the closed-loop system of the PFM with the fuzzy controller based on parallel distributed compensation in a descriptor form. After that, a multiple Lyapunov function is applied to obtain more relaxed results for the stability analysis of the optimum control design. The optimum control design aims to minimize the upper bound of a given objective function. Besides considering practical situations, the study also integrates the input constraints into the optimum control design. The validity of the proposed design is substantiated through the provision of three simulation instances. Through the first two instances, it becomes apparent that the proposed design surpasses conventional optimum control design approaches for the PFM, yielding superior and more relaxed results. In the third instance, applying a bicycle dynamic model with an input constraint underscores the superior applicability of the proposed optimum control design approach in comparison to other existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Modern approaches to mining massive volumes of review data for actionable insights are required to keep up with the ever-increasing volume of user-generated content and the burgeoning tourist industry. The nuance and complexity of human emotions are difficult for traditional methods of review analysis to capture. User reviews are one of the quality and service-improving ways in the tourism industry that express the experience and recommendations from travellers. Analysing such review data improves emotion analysis and public/private service industry hospitality management. This article introduces a Hybrid Review Analytical Method (HRAM) by assimilating the conventional short-term memory and fuzzy control algorithm. This method analyses positive and negative reviews using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) under repeated traveller presence. The user’s presence under different review fields is analysed using their interconnected dependencies. The reviews are validated for one-time service validation if the dependencies are unavailable. The fuzzy process is responsible for extracting the type of emotion (such as joy, anger, happiness, etc.) for further dependency estimation. The varying emotion dependencies are, thus, identified using the fuzzy process for augmenting LSTM validations. This process is recurrent until multiple emotions are analysed using the dependencies and non-dependencies across various user reviews under different tourism services. Improving the emotional analysis of travel evaluations is the goal of this study, which suggests combining LSTM networks with a fuzzy control algorithm. Together, the LSTM’s strength in sequential data processing and the fuzzy logic system’s capacity to handle imprecise inputs provide a sentiment analysis tool that is both more accurate and more nuanced. Improving customer services and experiences is the goal of this innovative strategy, which seeks to change how players in the tourist sector understand and respond to consumer input.},

  abstract     = {Earthquakes are amongst the most destructive natural hazards, posing substantial risks to urban populations and infrastructure. As cities grow and modernise, identifying optimal locations for Urban Earthquake Emergency Shelters (UEES) becomes key for ensuring public safety. However, this process involves complex, multi-faceted criteria that must be carefully evaluated. This paper introduces a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework thatffiga integrates ontology with the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to prioritise potential locations. A key contribution is the use of an ontology to model and interconnect the diverse criteria necessary for UEES site selection, providing a structured perspective that enhances both the theoretical understanding and practical decision-making in urban emergency management. The designed ontology structures and analyses the selection criteria, which are then processed using the FAHP to prioritise potential sites. This framework was validated through a case study in Beijing, where the Shijingshan and Haidian districts were identified as the most suitable locations due to high safety levels, economic benefits, and infrastructure interactions. The results also highlight key challenges in planning and construction across different sites. By combining ontology with FAHP, this framework optimises UEES location selection and supports the digital transformation of urban emergency management systems, offering a holistic, data-driven approach to disaster preparedness.},

Traditional fuzzy SVMs have effectively minimized the impact of outliers by assigning appropriate fuzzy memberships to each data point. Nevertheless, these models often overlook how outliers influence the positioning of class centers. In response to this issue, our paper introduced a novel fuzzy membership function which was applied to both linear and nonlinear fuzzy SVM. This approach identified outliers before establishing class centers. Additionally, samples positioned near the hyperplane were assigned increased decision weights. Such a strategy significantly reduced the influence of outliers on class centers, thereby boosting the effectiveness of the fuzzy SVM. The experimental results validated the efficacy of our method. The tailored approach not only mitigated the impact of outliers but also markedly enhanced classification accuracy and generalization capabilities. This confirmed the contribution of our enhanced fuzzy SVM to the field of heart disease diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Two-stage decision making is commonly observed in practical multi-attribute risk decision making. Decision makers face unpredictable risk forecasts and must engage in multi-attribute decision making while being limited by external circumstances in both the preceding and subsequent stages. The outcomes of the initial phase of decision making influence the level of risk that arises in the subsequent phase and directly affect the outcomes of the subsequent phase. The R-numbers two-stage multi-attribute group decision-making (R-TSMAGDM) approach is based on the advantages of R-numbers in effectively representing risk. An expert weight determination model is created using distance measures of R-numbers, inspired by the ideas of TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The R-numbers weighted Muirhead mean (RNWMM) operator, capable of handling multiple attributes with correlations, is introduced and its correlation qualities are investigated. Furthermore, a model for determining attribute weight is proposed specifically for the entropy-based method within the R-numbers environment. The two-stage decision-making approach is implemented using the inverse-order method. This method first prioritizes the alternatives in the later stage using regret theory. Then, it calculates the ideal alternative in the previous stage based on the three-way decision (3WD). The case study of risk assessment of base station network failures effectively demonstrates the adaptability and usefulness of the R-TSMAGDM approach.},

The harmful effects of mobile tower radiation on living organisms, including humans, birds, and bees, can be mitigated through the proper investigation of installing tower locations based on various scientific criteria. Additionally, implementing proper regulations and guidelines for the construction and maintenance of mobile towers can also help minimize the negative impact of radiation on the environment. However, the fulfillment of these regulations poses several challenges, such as ensuring safety in terms of structural integrity, fire hazards, and aviation regulations, addressing concerns regarding radiation exposure, maintaining appropriate dimensions and weight for tower design, considering the signal range based on the area of operation, and numerous other criteria. This paper determines the optimal selection of mobile locations in scenarios where radiation emissions are uncertain through Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs). FFSs address the inherent imprecision associated with determining the optimal location. To measure the distance between two FFSs, the normalized distance ( $$E_\textrm{d}$$ ) and normalized Hamming distance ( $$H_\textrm{d}$$ ) metrics are utilized. Decision experts identify the most suitable locations for placing mobile towers, such as forested regions, public spaces, residential areas, and educational and healthcare institutions, to maximize their positive impacts. By focusing on these potential positive impacts, this research paper aims to instill hope and optimism in the reader about the future of mobile tower installation.},

A new event-triggering mechanism is proposed based on a newly proposed process threshold method, so that the event-triggering number in the control process is greatly reduced, and the implementing problems of performance constraint control in programmable logic controller (PLC) are solved. Aiming at the situation that the output of the manipulator may be directly perturbed and exceeds the prescribed performance boundary, a new restartable performance constraint function is proposed, and it can also adjust the convergence speed of the performance function more flexibly. Specifically, the design of the function is independent of the initial position of the system. At the same time, the proposed control strategy combines with the design method with a zero initial control input, a fuzzy adaptive prescribed performance event-triggered controller with a startup buffer ability is obtained by adding an input buffer function, which solves both the problem of prescribed performance control for the manipulator with arbitrary initial position and the startup problem with a load. The designed controller can stabilize the manipulator system under lower triggering number, and let the manipulator system track the expected trajectory accurately within a given finite time. The control strategy is easy to apply in real industrial systems.},
