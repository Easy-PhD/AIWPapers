Our method also yields an analogous result for rank-one CAT(0) groups and hierarchically hyperbolic groups with Morse elements. Finally, we prove that Morse elements are generic in every Cayley graph of groups that are quasi-isometric to (well-behaved) hierarchically hyperbolic groups. This gives a quasi-isometry invariant theory of counting group elements in groups beyond relatively hyperbolic groups.},

We deduce this from a stronger compatibility result for the canonical $G(\mathbb{Q}_{\ell })$ -valued local systems on connected Shimura varieties inside $\mathrm{Sh}_{K_{0}}(G, X)$ .

  abstract     = {The first target of this article is the local well-posedness question for 1D quasilinear Schrödinger equations with cubic nonlinearities. The study of this class of problems, in all dimensions, was initiated in pioneering work of Kenig-Ponce-Vega for localized initial data, and then continued by Marzuola-Metcalfe-Tataru for initial data in Sobolev spaces. Our objective here is to fully redevelop the study of this problem in the 1D case, and to prove a sharp local well-posedness result. The second goal of this article is to consider the long-time/global existence of solutions for the same problem. This is motivated by a broad conjecture formulated by the authors in earlier work, which reads as follows: “Cubic defocusing dispersive one dimensional flows with small initial data have global dispersive solutions”; the conjecture was initially proved for a class of semilinear Schrödinger type models. Our work here establishes the above conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schrödinger flows. Precisely, we show that if the problem has phase rotation symmetry and is conservative and defocusing, then small data in Sobolev spaces yields global, scattering solutions. This is the first result of this type for 1D quasilinear dispersive flows where no localization condition is imposed on the data. Furthermore, we prove the global well-posedness at the minimal Sobolev regularity as in our local well-posedness result. The defocusing condition is essential in our global result. Without it, the authors have conjectured that small, $\epsilon $ size data yields long-time solutions on the $\epsilon ^{-8}$ time-scale. A third goal of this paper is to also prove this second conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schrödinger flows, also at minimal regularity.},

Typical pairs of points in the directed landscape are connected by a unique geodesic. However, there are exceptional pairs of points connected by more complicated geodesic networks. We show that, up to isomorphism, exactly 27 geodesic networks exist in the directed landscape. We also find Hausdorff dimensions in a scaling-adapted metric on $\mathbb{R}^{4}_{\uparrow }$ for the sets of endpoints of each of these networks.},

We prove a property called ${{A}(\infty )}$ which includes an extendibility statement, known previously in all types not $\mathrm {D} $ (Theorem A). Our methods blend here Shintani descent ideas introduced for type $\mathrm{B}$ with an analysis of semisimple classes in the dual group $G^{*}$ . The property ${{A}(\infty )}$ originates in the program to prove the McKay conjecture using the classification of finite simple groups. Theorem C establishes the McKay conjecture for the prime 3.},

This is an important model in which singularities arise. Even though the singular set does not exhibit any form of convexity a priori, we prove its higher order regularity by developing novel methods, which also have many other applications. Notably, our results are achieved without requiring any convexity of the source domain. This aligns with Caffarelli’s celebrated regularity theory.},
