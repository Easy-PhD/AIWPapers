  abstract     = {Robot swarms provide a robust approach for performing common tasks in which the emergence of collective capabilities outperforms the addition of the individual ones. They are frequently used in surveillance or defence systems where resilience is a must. In this article we propose a swarm of drones capable of surrounding and escorting different types of targets such as a rogue drone or a ground vehicle. We use swarm intelligence and evolutionary optimisation to support the swarm self-organisation using a set of optimal parameters. Our experiments were focused on analysing the properties of the swarm of drones as well as assessing its scalability and fault tolerance. We have used computer simulations to test a variety of different initial drone positions and target trajectories. Additionally, we have validated our proposal through experiments using real-world drones. The achieved results show that our formation system has successfully built stable formations when it was properly configured. It has worked with swarms of five, ten, and twenty drones, and has also been able to recover in the majority of cases in which some drones have failed.},

  abstract     = {This paper conducts a comparative study of stochastic optimization strategies to enable multi-robot systems to search for and track an unknown number of targets. Each robot is equipped with a noisy sensor that has a limited field of view. The robots use a distributed version of the probability hypothesis density filter to estimate both the number and states of the targets. This online target estimate is used by the different search strategies to select actions for each robot. We compare Lloyd’s algorithm, a traditional method for distributed search, with four stochastic optimization techniques: Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization, and Artificial Immune Systems. Each of the methods is adapted from the traditional case of finding a single global optimum to locate all the local maxima (i.e., targets). We demonstrate through extensive simulations that these techniques offer superior coverage of the search area and more accurate target localization compared to the baseline Lloyd’s algorithm when the ratio of robots to targets is low and that Lloyd’s algorithm performs best when the ratio of robots to targets is high. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of each method, assisting practitioners in the selection of the most appropriate strategy based on specific operational factors, such as the communication load in a multi-robot system.},

  abstract     = {Collective decision-making is an important problem in swarm robotics arising in many different contexts and applications. The Weighted Voter Model has been proposed to collectively solve the best-of-n problem, and analysed in the thermodynamic limit. We present an exact finite-population analysis of the best-of-two model on complete as well as regular network topologies. We also present a novel analysis of this model when agent evaluations of options suffer from measurement error. Our analytical results allow us to predict the expected outcome of best-of-two decision-making on a swarm system without having to do extensive simulations or numerical computations. We show that the error probability of reaching consensus on a suboptimal solution is bounded away from 1 even if only a single agent is initialised with the better option, irrespective of the total number of agents. Moreover, the error probability tends to zero if the number of agents initialised with the best solution tends to infinity, however slowly compared to the total number of agents. Finally, we present bounds and approximations for the best-of-n problem.},
