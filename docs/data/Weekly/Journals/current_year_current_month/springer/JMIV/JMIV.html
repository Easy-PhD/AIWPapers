  abstract     = {We consider a bilevel learning framework for learning linear operators. In this framework, the learnable parameters are optimized via a loss function that also depends on the minimizer of a convex optimization problem (denoted lower-level problem). We utilize an iterative algorithm called ‘piggyback’ to compute the gradient of the loss and minimizer of the lower-level problem. Given that the lower-level problem is solved numerically, the loss function and thus its gradient can only be computed inexactly. To estimate the accuracy of the computed hypergradient, we derive an a-posteriori error bound, which provides guides for setting the tolerance for the lower-level problem, as well as the piggyback algorithm. To efficiently solve the upper-level optimization, we also propose an adaptive method for choosing a suitable step size. To illustrate the proposed method, we consider a few learned regularizer problems, such as training an input-convex neural network.},

  abstract     = {Score-based diffusion methods provide a powerful strategy to solve image restoration tasks by flexibly combining a pre-trained foundational prior model with a likelihood function specified during test time . Such methods are predominantly derived from two stochastic processes: reversing Ornstein–Uhlenbeck, which underpins the celebrated denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM), and the Langevin diffusion process. The solutions delivered by DDPM and DDIM are often remarkably realistic, but they are not always consistent with measurements because of likelihood intractability issues and the associated required approximations. Alternatively, using a Langevin process circumvents the intractable likelihood issue, but usually leads to restoration results of inferior quality. This paper presents a novel and highly computationally efficient image restoration method that carefully embeds a foundational DDPM denoiser within an empirical Bayesian Langevin algorithm, which jointly calibrates key model hyper-parameters as it estimates the model’s posterior mean. Extensive experimental results on three canonical tasks (image deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting) demonstrate that the proposed approach improves on state-of-the-art strategies both in image estimation accuracy and computing time.},

  abstract     = {We propose a means of computing fitted frames on the boundary and in the interior of objects and using them to provide the basis for producing geometric features from them that are not only alignment-free but most importantly can be made to correspond locally across a population of objects. We describe a representation targeted for anatomic objects which is designed to enable this strong locational correspondence within object populations and thus to provide powerful object statistics. It accomplishes this by understanding an object as the diffeomorphic deformation of the closure of the interior of an ellipsoid and by using a skeletal representation fitted throughout the deformation to produce a model of the target object, where the object is provided initially in the form of a boundary mesh. Via classification performance on hippocampi shape between individuals with a disorder vs. others, we compare our method to two state-of-the-art methods for producing object representations that are intended to capture geometric correspondence across a population of objects and to yield geometric features useful for statistics, and we show notably improved classification performance by this new representation, which we call the evolutionary s-rep. The geometric features that are derived from each of the representations, especially via fitted frames, are discussed.},

  abstract     = {Mathematical morphology is a part of image processing that employs a moving window to modify pixel values through the application of specific operations. The supremum and infimum are pivotal concepts, yet defining them in a general sense for high-dimensional data such as colour is a challenging endeavour. As a result, a number of different approaches have been taken to try to find a solution, with certain compromises being made along the way. In this paper, we present an analysis of a novel approach that replaces the supremum within a morphological operation with the LogExp approximation of the maximum for matrix-valued colours. This approach has the advantage of extending the associativity of dilation from the one-dimensional to the higher-dimensional case. Furthermore, the minimality property is investigated and a relaxation specified to ensure that the approach is continuously dependent on the input data.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on identifying vertex characteristics in 2D images using topological asymptotic analysis. Vertex characteristics include both the location and the type of the vertex, with the latter defined by the number of lines forming it and the corresponding angles. This problem is crucial for computer vision tasks, such as distinguishing between fore- and background objects in 3D scenes. We compute the second-order topological derivative of a Mumford–Shah-type functional with respect to inclusion shapes representing various vertex types. This derivative assigns a likelihood to each pixel that a particular vertex type appears there. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},
