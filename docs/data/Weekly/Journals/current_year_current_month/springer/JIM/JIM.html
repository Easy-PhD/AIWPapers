The complexity of the parcel system and the variety of colours and shapes of the target objects significantly affect the quality of the results. To establish an effective in-truck parcel depalletisation system, it is crucial to develop a method that can automatically recognise parcels in a 3D environment and guide robots during unloading tasks. To address these requirements, this study proposes a system for detecting geometric point clouds in parcels that uses regression knn to find the nearest pick-up point of a detected parcel box by calculating the minimum Euclidean distance, thereby improving detection accuracy. The validation of the robotic system underlines its practical utility, demonstrating its potential to replace humans and reduce labour costs in factory environments.},

  abstract     = {Welding defects recognition based on machine vision provides a reliable basis for robot arc welding. However, due to such factors as severe noise interference of welding images, slight morphological differences of same defect, and restricted computational capacity of on-site devices, it has been a challenge to learn distinguishable characteristics from various weld seam defects as well as to improve defects recognition accuracy and model generalizability, with a lightweight network. Consequently, we propose a welding defects recognition approach by designing a novel DCP-MobileViT network to address this challenge. First, the denoised image and its corresponding transmission map are obtained by Dark Channel Prior (DCP) algorithm and served as two inputs of the proposed network. Then, a dual-branch network is designed to adaptively extract and merge feature information of two input images through the convolution and transformer mechanism. Finally, the proposed DCP-MobileViT model is tested and compared with three other models using datasets from different welding scenarios. The results indicate that the DCP-MobileViT model achieves superior welding defects recognition accuracy compared to the other models, demonstrating its excellent generalizability in different welding scenarios.},

  abstract     = {In machining, especially in milling, chatter refers to self-induced vibrations that arise and grow due to the dynamic interaction of the cutting process. It can result in poor surface finish, inaccurate dimensions, and increased tool wear. Although the development of strategies for extracting chatter features in milling processes has improved over time, the milling environment’s complexity continues to pose challenges. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) is a commonly employed method for extracting features from chatter signals and has gained widespread use. However, the optimal determination of critical VMD parameters, such as the parameter of penalty (α) and the modes (K), is challenging because they significantly affect the decomposition result. To address this limitation, the basic VMD algorithm is embedded into the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm (BO), called the VMD-BO algorithm, to automatically select the best parameter combination of (α) and (K). To enhance the capabilities of extracting chatter features, the VMD-BO algorithm is combined with slope entropy (SlopEn), and the decision tree (DT) algorithm is used to intelligently detect the severity level of chatter. Therefore, this study introduces a novel hybrid method for extracting chatter features, combining VMD-BO, SlopEn, and DT algorithms to enhance intelligent chatter detection. Optimization results of the simulation chatter indicate that the VMD-BO algorithm achieves the highest kurtosis value, demonstrating superior decomposition performance compared to existing optimization methods. Additionally, results of the experiment with the measured vibration signals reveal that SlopEn outperforms three other entropy measures—fuzzy entropy (FuzzEn), sample entropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PermEn)—in terms of detection accuracy. However, its detection rate can be improved with an increase in the number of features. Finally, the proposed method can outperform other methods with two features, where the achievement of classification accuracy on the validation set is 96.67%. In addition, a milling test is done on a stepped work-piece with varying machining conditions to confirm the efficacy of chatter detection for online monitoring. In model application, the built model accurately identifies all machining states, including those in transition.},

Optimizing the relationship between build time and material usage in ME is challenging but essential for improving production performance. This study aims to find the ideal parameter settings to minimize both time and material consumption. Machine learning (ML) models and a multidisciplinary evolution algorithm were used to predict and optimize the fused deposition process parameters. A definitive screening design (DSD) was conducted on 14 process parameters to identify those that significantly affect the output. Using the response surface method, a dataset of these influential parameters was created for the ML models. The prediction accuracy of the ML models was evaluated using regression metrics. It has been found that the random forest algorithm has a prediction accuracy greater than 90% over the other models after training and testing the dataset. To further optimize the process, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm was utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing machine-learning model. The results showed that using the optimal parameter settings identified by NSGA-II, build time was reduced by 37% and material usage by 40% compared to standard print settings. A statistical two-way ANOVA test confirmed that these optimized settings significantly (p < 0.05) reduced both time and material consumption.},

  abstract     = {Traditional closed-set diagnostic methods assume identical label spaces for the source and target domains. Nevertheless, unlike the source domain, the target domain can include emerging unknown categories, and the target known categories are usually the subset of the source known categories. To deal with this open-set diagnostic problem, the paper presents a new open-set domain adaptation fusion approach using weighted adversarial learning (OSDAF). The OSDAF method requires no threshold judgment, and integrates three sub-models to achieve higher accuracy. An adaptive weighted learning strategy is developed and introduced to two adversarial learning classifiers for the first sub-model. The output difference between the constructed classifiers is maximized to identify target unknown category. Also, the output discrepancy is minimized to align target known-category samples with the same category of the source known-category samples. Then, three binary cross-entropy strategies and an entropy minimization scheme are designed to promote the discrepancy between known and unknown categories, thereby generating discriminant features and establishing the decision boundaries. For the other two sub-models, discriminant features are extracted from the first sub-model and applied to two different label propagation methods, so as to enhance the diversity of the recognition sub-models and facilitate the identification of the target samples. Finally, the efficiency and advantage of the presented approach are assessed using three machinery datasets. The comparison results reveal that the presented OSDAF is an effective method and outperforms typical closed-set and open-set diagnostic methods.},

  abstract     = {Mainstream transfer learning techniques are highly effective in addressing the issue of limited target domain samples in fault diagnosis. However, when there are insufficient samples in the source domain, the transfer results are often poor. Meta-learning is a method that involves training models by constructing meta-tasks and generalizing them to new unseen tasks, offering a solution to the challenge of limited training samples. To address the few-shot problem of poor transfer effect caused by limited source domain samples under variable working conditions, this paper proposes a hard task-based dual-aligned meta-transfer learning (HT-DAMTL) method. Firstly, a dual-aligned meta-transfer framework is proposed, which embeds the designed cross-domain knowledge transfer structure (CDKTS) into the outer loop of meta-learning to achieve external transfer of meta-knowledge. The CDKTS method combines the use of multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) with a domain discriminator to extract features that are invariant across different domains. Secondly, a meta-training method called information entropy-based reorganization hard task (RHT) is introduced to enhance the meta-model’s feature learning on hard samples, leading to improved fault diagnosis accuracy. Finally, HT-DAMTL’s performance is validated on public and private bearing datasets, showing its superiority over other methods.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning models play a crucial role in smart manufacturing by revolutionizing industrial automation so as to boost productivity and product quality. However, the reliability of these models often faces challenges from factors such as data drift, concept drift, adversarial attacks, and increasing model complexity. In addressing these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach called Reliability Improved Machine Learning (RIML), which leverages on prior knowledge by incorporating it into the machine learning pipeline through a secondary output that is easily verifiable and assessable within the application domain. Built upon the Knowledge-embedded Machine Learning (KML) framework, RIML differs from conventional strategies by modifying the model’s architecture. In its implementation, additional layers were introduced, specifically designed to identify and discard misclassified cases to improve the model’s reliability. RIML’s efficacy was successfully demonstrated through a simulated dataset and three real use-case studies, namely, a general walk/run scenario, an industry-related case using metro railway dataset, and a smart manufacturing application on gas detection. The promising results highlighted RIML’s ability to significantly reduce misclassifications, thereby enhancing model reliability in diverse real-world scenarios.},

Academia has carried out a lot of intelligent research on CNC machine tool from technical perspective, but there still needs a systematic cognitive model to promote the construction of cognitive abilities, to support the intelligent realization and continuous improvement of CNC machine tool. Therefore, this paper proposes a three-part, seven-layer cognitive model based on cognitive informatics to promote the construction of cognitive abilities and the intelligent transformation of CNC machine tool. Firstly, a systematic multi-layer cognitive model is proposed, and each cognitive layer is introduced to promote the different cognitive abilities construction of CNC machine tool. Then, this paper introduces the cognitive analysis loop and the cognitive learning loop contained in the multi-layer cognitive model, which can promote the construction of the adaptive and continuous learning abilities of CNC machine tool. The evaluation indicators of the intelligence machine tool are given, which is used to evaluate machine tool intelligence model. Furthermore, the cognitive enabling technologies of the multi-layer cognitive model for intelligent machine tool is presented, which supports the realization of cognitive abilities such as analysis, decision making, and learning. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed systematic multi-layer cognitive model is verified by the developed computable digital twin platform and comparison before and after implementation for intelligent machine tool.},

The lack of data results in disconnection between data from different spaces, posing a challenge to forming a closed loop of data and hindering the development of digital twin (DT) driven fault diagnosis (FD). To address these issues, a new DT paradigm Digital-Triplet is proposed. This paradigm comprises three entities: a physical entity, a semi-physical entity, and a virtual entity. A semi-physical entity is created by implementing the "six-D" process on the physical entity. A new six dimensional structure is formed through the addition of the semi-physical entity. The new structure streamlines the construction of fault datasets, enhances sensor data acquisition, and tightly links different data spaces, thereby promoting the application of DT in equipment FD. Subsequently, the elevator is selected as a case study to illustrate the Digital-Triplet framework in detail. The results demonstrate that the Digital-Triplet framework can effectively expand the fault dataset and improve data collection efficiency through optimized sensor placement, thereby promoting fault diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {In remanufacturing, humans perform visual inspection tasks manually. In doing so, human inspectors implicitly solve variants of visual acquisition planning problems. Nowadays, solutions to these problems are computed based on the object geometry of the object to be inspected. In remanufacturing, however, there are often many product variants, and the existence of geometric object models cannot be assumed. This makes it difficult to plan and solve visual acquisition planning problems for the automated execution of visual inspection tasks. Reinforcement learning offers the possibility of learning and reproducing human inspection behavior and solving the visual inspection problem, even for problems in which no object geometry is available. To investigate reinforcement learning as a solution, a simple simulation environment is developed, allowing the execution of reproducible and controllable experiments. Different reinforcement learning agent modeling alternatives are developed and compared for solving the derived visual planning problems. The results of this work show that reinforcement learning agents can solve the derived visual planning problems in use cases without available object geometry by using domain-specific prior knowledge. Our proposed framework is available open source under the following link: https://github.com/Jarrypho/View-Planning-Simulation.},

Existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fault diagnosis methods often struggle to achieve accurate diagnoses of machine conditions due to the scarcity of labeled data, hindering the ability of models to develop strong inductive biases. We propose a plug-and-play auxiliary method, random convolution layer (RCL), to improve the generalization performance of the fault diagnosis models. This method delves into the fundamental commonalities across diverse tasks and varying network structures, thereby enhancing the diversity of samples to establish a more robust source domain environment. The RCL preserves the dimensional nature of the data in the time domain while randomly altering the kernel sizes during convolution operations, thus generating new data without compromising global information. During the training process, the newly generated data is mixed with the original data and fed into the fault diagnosis model. RCL is incorporated as a module into the inputs of different fault diagnosis models, and its effectiveness is validated on three public datasets as well as a self-built testbed. The results show that the present auxiliary method improves the domain generalization performance of the baselines, and can improve the accuracy of the corresponding fault diagnosis models.

  abstract     = {Data-driven, physics-based, and hybrid prognosis frameworks can be developed to estimate remaining useful life, depending on the availability of condition monitoring sensor data and physics-governing equations. No systematic study is available that shows the comparative performance of these frameworks. The present study, for the first time, attempts to show how these three frameworks can be developed under different scenarios and assumptions. The data-driven prognosis framework is developed using an accelerometer signal and an Artificial Intelligence-based random forest regression (RFR) model. A pit growth model inspired by the Paris crack growth law has been used for physics-based prognosis framework development. In this framework, sensor data is needed to know the gear’s current health status, as the prognosis framework can't be developed purely on physics. A hybrid prognosis framework is developed using two alternate approaches: one in which current health status is obtained directly from a visual inspection camera and the other in which this status is indirectly inferred from the accelerometer sensor data. In each case, the RUL prediction is made using a physics-based pit growth model coupled with the current health status obtained from either of the two approaches mentioned. To enhance the prediction accuracy, Bayesian inference is used to update the physics-based pit growth model parameters in both hybrid frameworks. Data obtained from five run-to-failure experiments performed on a specially designed gearbox test setup are used to show the comparative performance of these frameworks. The strengths and weaknesses of each of the frameworks are discussed based on the type of data requirement, model definition, parameter estimation, and prediction error.},

  abstract     = {Identifying tool wear state is essential for machine operators as it assists in informed decisions for timely tool replacement and subsequent machining operations. As each wear state corresponds to a unique mitigation strategy, timely identification is vital while implementing solutions to minimize tool wear. The paper presents a novel Human Guided-eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (HG-XAI) approach for identifying the tool wear state by integrating human intelligence and eXplainable AI with a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Efficient-Net-b0 model. The tool wear states were identified based on different wear mechanisms during the machining of IN718. The study considers four distinct tool wear states, i.e., Flank, Flank+BUE, Flank+Face, and Chipping, representing abrasion, adhesion, diffusion, and fracture wear mechanisms. The image-based datasets were created to depict various tool wear states by machining IN718 at varying surface speeds. The effectiveness of the proposed HG-XAI approach was evaluated by comparing its prediction accuracy with a standalone Efficient-Net-b0 model lacking human intelligence and XAI. Further, the scalability of the HG-XAI approach was examined by predicting wear states from images acquired at different cutting parameters. The results from the present study showed that the HG-XAI approach can predict the tool wear state with an accuracy of 93.08% and is scalable to variations in cutting conditions. Also, the proposed approach can be extended while developing vision-based on-machine tool wear monitoring systems.},

To enhance the performance of DL methods for vision task with few samples, this paper proposes a novel metric called Effectiveness of Auxiliary Task (EAT) and presents a multi-task learning approach utilizing this metric for selecting effective auxiliary task branch and adaptive co-training them with main tasks. Experiments conducted on two vision tasks with few samples show that the proposed approach effectively eliminates ineffective task branches and enhances the contribution of the selected tasks to the main task: reducing the average normalized pixel error from 0.0613 to 0.0143 in pose key-points detection and elevating the Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.6383 to 0.6921 in surface defect segmentation.

  abstract     = {The parallel machine scheduling problem (PMSP) involves the optimized assignment of a set of jobs to a collection of parallel machines, which is a proper formulation for the modern manufacturing environment. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely employed to solve PMSP. However, the majority of existing DRL-based frameworks still suffer from generalizability and scalability. More specifically, the state and action design still heavily rely on human efforts. To bridge these gaps, we propose a practical reinforcement learning-based framework to tackle a PMSP with new job arrivals and family setup constraints. We design a variable-length state matrix containing full job and machine information. This enables the DRL agent to autonomously extract features from raw data and make decisions with a global perspective. To efficiently process this novel state matrix, we elaborately modify a Transformer model to represent the DRL agent. By integrating the modified Transformer model to represent the DRL agent, a novel state representation can be effectively leveraged. This innovative DRL framework offers a high-quality and robust solution that significantly reduces the reliance on manual effort traditionally required in scheduling tasks. In the numerical experiment, the stability of the proposed agent during training is first demonstrated. Then we compare this trained agent on 192 instances with several existing approaches, namely a DRL-based approach, a metaheuristic algorithm, and a dispatching rule. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the scalability of our approach and its effectiveness across a variety of scheduling scenarios. Conclusively, our approach can thus solve the scheduling problems with high efficiency and flexibility, paving the way for application of DRL in solving complex and dynamic scheduling problems.},

The enriched CAD, containing inspection annotations (textual or dimensional) attached to geometrical entities, serving as the pipeline’s input, can be exported in a neutral file format, adhering to the Standard for Product Data Exchange (STEP) Application Protocol (AP)242, regardless of the modeling software used. The pipeline’s output is a Reconfiguration (ReCo) file, enabling the flexible hardware (e.g., robotic inspection cell) and software components of the VIS to be reconfigured via software (programmable). The main achievements of this work include: (i) demonstrating the feasibility of an end-to-end (i.e., CAD-to-ReCo file) pipeline that integrates the proposed software modules via Application Programming Interfaces (API)s, and (ii) formally defining the ReCo file. Experimental results from a demonstrative implementation enhance the clarity of the paper.

Firstly, multi-sensor data under different working conditions is collected, and features of different sensors are extracted by the corresponding deep learning model. Secondly, the multi-information interaction fusion network is designed to exchange sensor information and obtain fusion features. Then the fusion feature transfer model is proposed for cross-domain fault detection. Finally, the model is trained with the bearing dataset of the University of Paderborn. The results show that the transfer fault detection method with multi-sensor information fusion achieves state-of-the-art performances in cross-domain fault detection. It can adjust adaptively the contribution of each sensor information in the cross-domain fault detection.},

  abstract     = {Accelerating fabrication of additively manufactured components with precise microstructures is important for quality and qualification of built parts, as well as for a fundamental understanding of process improvement. Accomplishing this requires fast and robust characterization of melt pool geometries and structural defects in images. This paper proposes a pragmatic approach based on implementation of deep learning models and self-consistent workflow that enable systematic segmentation of defects and melt pools in optical images. Deep learning is based on an image-to-image translation–conditional generative adversarial neural network architecture. An artificial intelligence (AI) tool based on this deep learning model enables fast and incrementally more accurate predictions of the prevalent geometric features, including melt pool boundaries and printing-induced structural defects. We present statistical analysis of geometric features that is enabled by the AI tool, showing strong spatial correlation of defects and the melt pool boundaries. The correlations of widths and heights of melt pools with dataset processing parameters show the highest sensitivity to thermal influences resulting from laser passes in adjacent and subsequent layer passes. The presented models and tools are demonstrated on the aluminum alloy and datasets produced with different sets of processing parameters. However, they have universal quality and could easily be adapted to different material compositions. The method can be easily generalized to microstructural characterizations other than optical microscopy.},

  abstract     = {Hollow thin-walled aluminum alloy structural parts (HTWASP) must be cut after welding during the actual processing process, and a welding stress field is inevitably generated owing to the welding heat effect in the process of welding the workpiece, leading to distortion of workpiece. To accurately and efficiently predict the deformation of HTWASP after multiprocess processing, equivalent load caused by process of welding was computed through connection inherent strain theory with welding thermal parameters. A dynamic simulation model of the milling process of HTWASP was established by welding equivalent load. The influences of spindle speed and tool diameter on the deformation remain stress of structural workpieces were analyzed. Additionally, the simulated values for the deformation of the workpiece were compared and analyzed through milling tests on these structural parts. The results showed that the range of stress values and stress effects was smaller when the spindle speed was higher. The distance of the stress effect was the smallest when machine speed was 2500 rpm and tool diameter was 20 mm. Milling stress value was the smallest when machine speed was 2500 rpm and tool diameter was 6 mm. Most of the deformation occurred in the hollow position of the upper and diagonal plate; in contrast, the distortion of vertical plate and weld seam was not significant. The minimum deformation was 0.501 mm at machine speed is 2500 rpm and tool diameter is 6 mm. In the non-high-speed cutting state, high speed reduced workpiece quality of aluminum alloy workpiece, and slot milling quality was the best when machine speed was 1000 r/min and tool diameter was 6 mm. The proposed model sequentially couples the welding and milling process loads, and a multiprocess deformation prediction model that increasingly conforms to the actual processing sequence is constructed, providing a reference for the high-precision and efficient prediction of the multiprocess deformation in hollow thin-walled structural parts.},

To address these challenges, this paper introduces an edge-fog-cloud hybrid collaborative computing architecture (EFCHC) that enhances the interaction among multi-layer computational resources. Furthermore, the computational tasks offloading model under EFCHC is formulated to minimize objectives such as latency and cost. To refine the offloading solution, a novel multi-group parallel evolutionary strategy is proposed, which includes a two-stage pre-allocation scheme and a hyper-heuristic evolutionary operator for effective solution identification. In multi-objective benchmark testing experiments, the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms other comparative algorithms in terms of accuracy, convergence, and stability. In simulated workshop scenarios, the proposed offloading strategy reduces the total computational latency and cost by 17.81% and 21.89%, and enhances the load balancing efficiency by up to 52.50%, compared to six typical benchmark algorithms and architectures.},

The unexpected failure of its components may lead to part quality issues and machine breakdowns. Therefore, it is crucial to examine and understand its healthy condition when newly commissioned or repaired so that it can be used as a reference when monitoring its operational health. In this paper, a framework to establish a baseline reference dataset is proposed utilizing vibration monitoring and time domain statistical feature analysis. The framework was applied as a case study in a newly commissioned linear axis testbed. The results demonstrated that a linear axis under a known healthy condition exhibits low variability of its time domain features, negligible difference between forward and reverse stroke directions and a robust baseline dataset can be established by collecting data for approximately an hour of operation instead of a full day of operation (6 h of operation).},

However, existing research primarily focuses on predicting limited human motions using static global information, which fails to address the highly stochastic nature of customized assembly operations in a given region. To address this, we propose a dynamic scenario-enhanced diverse human motion prediction network that extracts dynamic collaborative features to predict highly stochastic customized assembly operations. In this paper, we present a multi-level feature adaptation network that generates information for dynamically manipulating objects. This is accomplished by extracting multi-attribute features at different levels, including multi-channel gaze tracking, multi-scale object affordance detection, and multi-modal object’s 6 degree-of-freedom pose estimation. Notably, we employ gaze tracking to locate the collaborative space accurately. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-step feedback-refined diffusion sampling network specifically designed for predicting highly stochastic customized assembly operations. This network refines the outcomes of our proposed multi-weight diffusion sampling strategy to better align with the target distribution. Additionally, we develop a feedback regulatory mechanism that incorporates ground truth information in each prediction step to ensure the reliability of the results. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through comparative experiments and validation of assembly tasks in a laboratory environment.},

  abstract     = {Automatic tool condition monitoring becomes crucial in metal cutting because tool wear impacts the final product’s quality. The optical microscope approach for assessing tool wear is offline, time-consuming, and subject to measurement error by humans. To accomplish this, the machine must be stopped, and the tool must be removed, which causes downtime. As a result, numerous research attempts have been made to develop robust systems for direct tool wear measurement during machining. Therefore, the proposed work focused on developing a direct tool condition monitoring system using machine vision to calculate tool wear parameters, specifically flank wear. The cutting tool insert images are collected using a machine vision setup equipped with an industrial camera, bi-telecentric lens, and a proper illumination system during the machining of AISI 4140 steel. The comparative analysis of image processing algorithms for tool wear measurement is proposed under the selected machining environment. The wear boundary is extracted using digital image processing tools such as image enhancement, image segmentation, image morphology operation, and edge detection. The wear amount on the tool insert is extracted and recorded using the Hough line transformation function and pixel scanning. The comparison of results revealed the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the proposed image processing algorithm with a maximum of 6.25% and minimum of 1.10% error compared to manual measurement. Hence, the proposed approach eliminates manual measurements and improves the machining productivity.},

  abstract     = {Designing efficient closed-loop control algorithms is a key issue in Additive Manufacturing (AM), as various aspects of the AM process require continuous monitoring and regulation, with temperature being a particularly significant factor. Here we study closed-loop control for the temperatures in the extruder of a Material Extrusion AM system, specifically a Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) system. Previous approaches for temperature control in AM either require the knowledge of exact model parameters, or involve discretisation of the state and action spaces to employ traditional data-driven control techniques. On the other hand, modern algorithms that can handle continuous state and action space problems require a large number of hyperparameter tuning to ensure good performance. In this work, we circumvent the above limitations by making use of a state space temperature model while focusing on both model-based and data-driven methods. We adopt the Linear Quadratic Tracking (LQT) framework and utilise the quadratic structure of the value function in the model-based analytical solution to produce a data-driven approximation formula for the optimal controller. We demonstrate these approaches using a simulator of the temperature evolution in the extruder of a BAAM system and perform an in-depth comparison of the performance of these methods. We find that we can learn an effective controller using solely simulated input–output process data. Our approach achieves parity in performance compared to model-based controllers and so lessens the need for estimating a large number of parameters of the often intricate and complicated process model. We believe this result is an important step towards achieving autonomous intelligent manufacturing.},

Discovering the optimal set of parameters via trial and error can be time-consuming and costly, as it often requires examining numerous permutations and combinations of parameters which commonly have complex interactions. However, machine learning (ML) methods can recommend suitable processing windows using models trained on data. They achieve this by efficiently identifying the optimal parameters through analyzing and recognizing patterns in data described by a multi-dimensional parameter space. We reviewed ML-based forward and inverse models that have been proposed to unlock the process–structure–property–performance relationships in both directions and assessed them in relation to data (quality, quantity, and diversity), ML method (mismatches and neglect of history), and model evaluation. To address the common shortcomings inherent in the published works, we propose strategies that embrace best practices. We point out the need for consistency in the reporting of details relevant to ML models and advocate for the development of relevant international standards. Significantly, our recommendations can be adopted for ML applications outside of AM where an optimum combination of process parameters (or other inputs) must be found with only a limited amount of training data.},
