  abstract     = {Single-level reformulations of (nonconvex) distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems are often intractable, as they contain semi-infinite dual constraints. Based on such a semi-infinite reformulation, we present a safe approximation that allows for the computation of feasible solutions for DROs that depend on nonconvex multivariate simple functions. Moreover, the approximation allows to address ambiguity sets that can incorporate information on moments as well as confidence sets. The typical strong assumptions on the structure of the underlying constraints, such as convexity in the decisions or concavity in the uncertainty found in the literature were, at least in part, recently overcome in [16]. We start from the duality-based reformulation approach in [16] that can be applied for DRO constraints based on simple functions that are univariate in the uncertainty parameters. We significantly extend their approach to multivariate simple functions, which leads to a considerably wider applicability of the proposed reformulation approach. In order to achieve algorithmic tractability, the presented safe approximation is then realized by a discretized counterpart for the semi-infinite dual constraints. The approximation leads to a computationally tractable mixed-integer positive semidefinite problem for which state-of-the-art software implementations are readily available. The tractable safe approximation provides sufficient conditions for distributional robustness of the original problem, i.e., obtained solutions are provably robust.},

  abstract     = {The field of vector optimization represents a critical domain within the broader spectrum of optimization problems. Extensive research efforts are currently dedicated to developing solution methods for vector optimization problems. A range of classical approaches, originally designed for scalar optimization, have been adapted to address issues in vector optimization. These include techniques such as the steepest descent method, Newton’s method, quasi-Newton method and conjugate gradient method, among others. However, limited attention has been given to the three-term conjugate gradient method in the context of vector optimization. In this paper, based on the modified self-scaling memoryless Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method proposed by Kou and Dai (J. Optim. Theory Appl., 165(1): 209-224, 2015), we propose a novel three-term conjugate gradient-type method specifically designed for vector optimization problems. This method ensures the sufficient descent property independent of any line search strategy. Furthermore, the improved Wolfe line search is extended to vector optimization. The global convergence of the proposed method under the improved Wolfe line search is analyzed, demonstrating that at least one accumulation point of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm is a K-critical point of vector optimization problem. Numerical experiments conducted on a set of benchmark test problems highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to some existing gradient-based approaches.},

  abstract     = {Preconditioning is a powerful strategy for addressing ill-conditioned problems in optimization. It involves utilizing a preconditioning matrix to reduce the condition number and speed up the convergence of first-order methods. However, in multiobjective optimization, capturing the curvature of all objective functions using a single preconditioning matrix is challenging. Consequently, second-order methods tailored for multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs) employ distinct matrices for each of the objectives in direction-finding subproblems, resulting in expensive per-step costs. To strike a balance between per-step costs and better curvature exploration, we develop a “preconditioning” $$+$$ “preconditioning” strategy to devise a preconditioned Barzilai-Borwein descent method for MOPs (PBBMO). Specifically, this method integrates a single scaling matrix to capture the local geometry of an implicit scalarization problem, leading to reduced per-step costs. We then incorporate the Barzilai-Borwein rule relative to the matrix metric to tune the gradients within the direction-finding subproblem. This can be interpreted as an additional diagonal preconditioner tailored to each objective for better curvature exploration. From a preconditioning perspective, we employ the BFGS update formula to approximate a trade-off of Hessian matrices. Subsequently, we develop a Barzilai-Borwein quasi-Newton method with Wolfe line search for MOPs. Under mild assumptions, we provide a convergence analysis for the Barzilai-Borwein quasi-Newton method. Finally, comparative numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed method, even when applied to higher-dimensional and ill-conditioned problems.},

Model uncertainty is represented by a set of equivalent probability measures, with Novikov’s condition imposed to guarantee their mutual equivalence. Ambiguity attitudes are characterized by the $$\alpha $$ -maxmin model. Agents invest and consume in a financial market exposed to both common and idiosyncratic risks, aiming to maximize relative terminal wealth with the mean-variance criterion and the expected utility of relative consumption under the $$\alpha $$ -maxmin model. We formulate a heterogeneous game that emphasizes outperforming a specific group of competitors. Agents focus on a weighted average of their peers’ wealth and consumption. This optimization problem is inherently time-inconsistent, and we derive the associated extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equations within a game-theoretic framework. The robust best response strategies are composed of a myopic component and another component that reacts to the actions of other agents. We obtain closed-form solutions for the robust Nash equilibrium investment-consumption strategies through a system of linear equations. This paper explores how levels of ambiguity, ambiguity aversion, risk aversion, and competition affect Nash equilibrium strategies, uncovering the herd effect that competition has on agents’ strategies.},

  abstract     = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular method in machine learning and signal processing to decompose a given nonnegative matrix into two nonnegative matrices. In this paper, we propose new algorithms, called majorization-minimization Bregman proximal gradient algorithm (MMBPG) and MMBPG with extrapolation (MMBPGe) to solve NMF. These iterative algorithms minimize the objective function and its potential function monotonically. Assuming the Kurdyka–Łojasiewicz property, we establish that a sequence generated by MMBPG(e) globally converges to a stationary point. We apply MMBPG and MMBPGe to the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence-based NMF. While most existing KL-based NMF methods update two blocks or each variable alternately, our algorithms update all variables simultaneously. MMBPG and MMBPGe for KL-based NMF are equipped with a separable Bregman distance that satisfies the smooth adaptable property and that makes its subproblem solvable in closed form. Using this fact, we guarantee that a sequence generated by MMBPG(e) globally converges to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) point of KL-based NMF. In numerical experiments, we compare proposed algorithms with existing algorithms on synthetic data and real-world data.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents an equation error framework for the identification of stochastic coefficients in stochastic saddle point problems. As a key application, we demonstrate how this framework encompasses the inverse problem of stochastic parameter estimation in the nearly incompressible elasticity system, the underlying mathematical model for the elastography inverse problem of locating cancerous tumor. Beyond this, the framework is general and applies to a range of other problems. The proposed approach reformulates the nonlinear inverse problem as a stochastic quadratic optimization problem. We establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution under a quadratic regularization and analyze the impact of data perturbation. To enable numerical solution, we employ a stochastic Galerkin discretization, derive the corresponding discrete optimization problem, and provide explicit expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the objective function. To validate the framework, we apply it to a test case involving the identification of a random coefficient in a nearly incompressible elasticity system, demonstrating its capability to accurately recover both the mean and variance of an unknown stochastic Lamé coefficient.},

We establish a strong Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality condition to identify local Pareto efficient solutions under the MOP-CPLD framework. We also introduce a suitable CPLD condition for a nonsmooth multiobjective optimization problem with equilibrium constraints in terms of convexificators which is denoted by MOPEC-CPLD.

  abstract     = {In this paper, we propose the first Quasi-Newton method with a global convergence rate of $$O(k^{-1})$$ for general convex functions. Quasi-Newton methods, such as BFGS and SR-1, are well-known for their impressive practical performance. However, they are theoretically slower than gradient descent for general convex functions. This gap between impressive practical performance and poor theoretical guarantees was an open question for a long period of time. In this paper, we make a significant step to close this gap. We improve upon the existing rate and propose the Cubic Regularized Quasi-Newton Method with a convergence rate of $$O({k^{-1}})$$ . The key to achieving this improvement is to use the Cubic Regularized Newton Method over the Damped Newton Method as an outer method, where the Quasi-Newton update is an inexact Hessian approximation. Using this approach, we propose the first Accelerated Quasi-Newton method with a global convergence rate of $$O({k^{-2}})$$ for general convex functions. In special cases where we have access to additional computations, for example, Hessian-vector products, we can improve the inexact Hessian approximation and achieve a global convergence rate of $$O({k^{-3}})$$ , which makes it intermediate second-order method. To make these methods practical, we introduce the Adaptive Inexact Cubic Regularized Newton Method and its accelerated version, which provide real-time control of the approximation error. We show that the proposed methods have impressive practical performance and outperform both first and second-order methods.},

Existing approaches often fail to ensure convergence when communication is disrupted and coordination is impaired. To address these challenges, we propose a fully distributed algorithm that combines a linear extended state observer for real-time disturbance estimation with a gradient-based control protocol. Key innovations include: (1) a computationally efficient local behavior estimation strategy based on observed states and gradient information, which replaces global estimation to reduce complexity; and (2) a unified control framework applicable to both first- and second-order MASs, guaranteeing convergence to the DNE despite DoS attacks and external perturbations. Rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis establishes sufficient conditions for stability and convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enables agents to reach the Nash equilibrium under persistent attacks and disturbances, highlighting its robustness and scalability.},

Moreover, we capture the risk attitude of each power company by considering a suitable coherent risk measure in the problem’s formulation. In order to prove the existence of at least one equilibrium solution, we introduce a suitable quasi-variational inequality formulation.

Traditional sharp augmented Lagrangian methods are known for their effectiveness but are often hindered by the need for global minimization of nonconvex, nondifferentiable functions at each iteration. To address this challenge, we introduce a smoothing function that approximates the sharp augmented Lagrangian, enabling the use of primal minimization strategies similar to those in Powell–Hestenes–Rockafellar (PHR) methods. Our approach retains the theoretical rigor of classical duality schemes while allowing for the use of stationary points in the primal optimization process. We present two algorithms based on this method–one utilizing standard descent and the other employing coordinate descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our smoothing–based method compares favorably with the PHR augmented Lagrangian approach, offering both robustness and practical efficiency. The proposed method is particularly advantageous in scenarios where exact minimization is computationally infeasible, providing a balance between theoretical precision and computational tractability.},

Developing the variational analysis associated with switching constraints, we present explicit formulas of radial cone, (directional) tangent cones, (directional) normal cones, outer (inner) second-order tangent set as well as geometrically derivability and parabolically derivability of the cross set. The relations among the (directional) tangent cones and normal cones, and second-order tangent set are established. The decompositions of normal cones, tangent cones and second-order tangent sets associated with Cartesian product of the cross set and a nonempty closed set are also obtained. We derive the characterizations, such as the non-emptiness, uniqueness, convexity and compactness, of the multiplier sets and directional multiplier sets associated with the stationary points and directional stationary points of MPSC. Then the second-order necessary conditions and the second-order growth conditions of MPSC are established by the second-order tangent sets. Besides, the second-order optimality conditions of MPSC are also established by using the Fréchet second-order subdifferentials, where the involved functions are lack of the twice-differentiability.},

  abstract     = {We investigate an optimal control problem of crop irrigation with non-autonomous and non-smooth dynamics. Depending on contexts and objectives, several formulations associated to different constraints and criteria can be derived. Our work aims at providing optimal feedback solutions for these problems by deriving and analyzing the optimality necessary conditions. To this end, we assemble the different problems into a common formulation, and we carry out a dedicated way of handling state constraints. We show that all optimal irrigation strategies belong to a family of simple parameterized time-varying feedback controls, independently of the context and objective, and suitable for computational purposes.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses a class of bilevel optimization problems involving an upper level problem which is a static optimization problem aimed at minimizing a first performance criterion over optimal trajectories. These trajectories are parameterized by a set of parameters (which has the structure of a metric space) and evaluated at a finite set of prescribed time instants. The optimal trajectories are the minimizers of a lower level problem, which is a dynamic optimization problem where the objective is to minimize a second cost functional over trajectory/control pairs on a given time interval. We consider intermediate-point problems (i.e. performance criteria take into account the values of the trajectories in the middle of the underlying time interval) including problems with free final and intermediate-point constraints, as well as problems with more general endpoint and intermediate-point constraints. We introduce, to the best of our knowledge, a new notion of solution for the reference bilevel problem: this is a pair composed of a control function and a family of associated trajectories that are optimal for both the upper and lower problems. We establish necessary conditions of optimality for these classes of bilevel problems by transforming them into single ‘min-min’ optimal control problems with uncertainty parameters. To derive our results, we employ perturbation methods to construct, with the help of Ekeland’s variational principle, a sequence of multiprocess optimization problems, on which we apply Clarke and Vinter’s multiprocesses theory together with techniques recently developed for optimal control problems with uncertainty parameters which can be adapted to the bilevel problem studied in the present paper.},
