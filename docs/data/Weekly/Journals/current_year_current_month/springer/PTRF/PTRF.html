  abstract     = {Motivated by the entropic optimal transport problem in unbounded settings, we study versions of Hilbert’s projective metric for spaces of integrable functions of bounded growth. These versions of Hilbert’s metric originate from cones which are relaxations of the cone of all non-negative functions, in the sense that they include all functions having non-negative integral values when multiplied with certain test functions. We show that kernel integral operators are contractions with respect to suitable specifications of such metrics even for kernels which are not bounded away from zero, provided that the decay to zero of the kernel is controlled. As an application to entropic optimal transport, we show exponential convergence of Sinkhorn’s algorithm in settings where the marginal distributions have sufficiently light tails compared to the growth of the cost function.},

Our proposed method recovers polynomial rates of convergence for the resulting estimator. This is achieved under the assumption of exponentially decaying tails for the interaction function.

The main results involve the asymptotic behavior of the top Lyapunov exponent $$\lambda $$ associated with this random dynamical system as one or more of the parameters in the system tend to 0 or $$\infty $$ . This enables the construction of a bifurcation diagram in parameter space showing stable regions where $$\lambda <0$$ (implying synchronization) and unstable regions where $$\lambda > 0$$ (implying chaotic behavior). The value of $$\lambda $$ depends strongly on the shearing effect of the twist factor b/a of the deterministic Hopf bifurcation. If b/a is sufficiently small then $$\lambda <0$$ regardless of all the other parameters in the system. But when all the parameters except b are fixed then $$\lambda $$ grows like a positive multiple of $$b^{2/3}$$ as $$b \rightarrow \infty $$ .},

In both dimensions one and two, we give a pathwise construction of stochastic multi-bubble blow-up solutions, which concentrate at finitely many distinct points, and behave asymptotically like a sum of pseudo-conformal blow-up solutions. In particular, this provides the first examples of mass quantization phenomenon in the stochastic case. It applies to the canonical deterministic model as well and complements the classical work (Merle, Comm. Math. Phys. 129(2), 223–240 (1990)). The second main result is concerned with the uniqueness of multi-bubble solutions in the energy class with the rate $$(T-t)^{3+\zeta }$$ , where $$\zeta $$ can be any small positive constant. The uniqueness result is new in both the stochastic and deterministic cases. Via the pseudo-conformal symmetry, it also yields the corresponding uniqueness of deterministic multi-solitons. In the special single-bubble case, it provides the conditional uniqueness of stochastic critical-mass blow-up solutions, which improves the recent work (Su and Zhang, J. Funct. Anal. 284, 109796 (2023)).},
