  abstract     = {The convergence of stochastic interacting particle systems in the mean-field limit to solutions of conservative stochastic partial differential equations is established, with optimal rate of convergence. As a second main result, a quantitative central limit theorem for such SPDEs is derived, again, with optimal rate of convergence. The results apply, in particular, to the convergence in the mean-field scaling of stochastic gradient descent dynamics in overparametrized, shallow neural networks to solutions of SPDEs. It is shown that the inclusion of fluctuations in the limiting SPDE improves the rate of convergence, and retains information about the fluctuations of stochastic gradient descent in the continuum limit.},

In a weak coupling scaling, we establish a Gaussian limit with nontrivial size of fluctuations, thus casting the nonlinearity as marginally relevant. The result builds on a precise analysis of the Wild expansion of the solution and an understanding of the underlying stochastic and combinatorial structure. This gives rise to a representation for the limiting variance in terms of Butcher series associated to the solution of an ordinary differential equation.},

The associated unlabeled diffusion is reversible with respect to the Ginibre random point field, and the dynamics are thus referred to as the Ginibre interacting Brownian motion. If the interacting Brownian particles have interaction potential $$ \Psi $$ of Ruelle class and the total system starts in a translation invariant equilibrium state, then the tagged particles are always diffusive if the dimension $$ d$$ of the space $$ {\mathbb {R}}^{d} $$ is greater than or equal to two. That is, the tagged particles are always non-degenerate under diffusive scaling. Our result is, therefore, contrary to known results. The Ginibre random point field has various levels of geometric rigidity. Our results reveal that the geometric property of infinite particle systems affects the dynamical property of the associated stochastic dynamics.},

  abstract     = {We consider the point-to-point log-gamma polymer of length 2N in a half-space with i.i.d. $${\text {Gamma}}^{-1}(2\theta )$$ distributed bulk weights and i.i.d. $${\text {Gamma}}^{-1}(\alpha +\theta )$$ distributed boundary weights for $$\theta >0$$ and $$\alpha >-\theta $$ . We establish the KPZ exponents (1/3 fluctuation and 2/3 transversal) for this model when $$\alpha =N^{-1/3}\mu $$ for $$\mu \in \mathbb {R}$$ fixed (critical regime) and when $$\alpha >0$$ is fixed (supercritical regime). In particular, in these two regimes, we show that after appropriate centering, the free energy process with spatial coordinate scaled by $$N^{2/3}$$ and fluctuations scaled by $$N^{1/3}$$ is tight. These regimes correspond to a polymer measure which is not pinned at the boundary. This is the first instance of establishing the 2/3 transversal exponent for a positive temperature half-space model, and the first instance of the 1/3 fluctuation exponent besides precisely at the boundary where recent work of Imamura et al. (Solvable models in the KPZ class: approach through periodic and free boundary Schur measures. arXiv:2204.08420 . 2022) applies and also gives the exact one-point fluctuation distribution (our methods do not access exact fluctuation distributions). Our proof relies on two inputs—the relationship between the half-space log-gamma polymer and half-space Whittaker process (facilitated by the geometric RSK correspondence as initiated in Corwin et al. (Duke Math J 163(3):513–563, 2014), O’Connell et al. (Invent Math 197(2):361–416, 2014), and an identity in Barraquand and Wang (Int Math Res Not 2023:11877, 2022) which relates the point-to-line half-space partition function to the full-space partition function for the log-gamma polymer. The primary technical contribution of our work is to construct the half-space log-gamma Gibbsian line ensemble and develop, in the spirit of work initiated in Corwin and Hammond (Invent Math 195(2):441–508, 2014), a toolbox for extracting tightness and absolute continuity results from minimal information about the top curve of such half-space line ensembles. This is the first study of half-space line ensembles.},

We prove the comparison principle, and the convergence of finite-dimensional approximations furnishing the existence of solutions. Under additional convexity conditions, we show that the solution can be represented by a version of the Hopf–Lax formula, or the Hopf formula on cones. Previously, two notions of solutions were considered, one defined directly as the Hopf–Lax formula, and another as limits of finite-dimensional approximations. They have been proven to describe the limit free energy in a wide class of mean-field spin glass models. This work shows that these two kinds of solutions are viscosity solutions.},

This model was invented with the aim of evaluating the limitations of an asexual reproduction mode in preventing the accumulation of deleterious mutations through natural selection alone. The main considered model is non-classical, as it is a stochastic diffusion evolving on an irregular set of infinite dimension with hard killing on a hyperplane. We are nonetheless able to prove exponential convergence in total variation to the quasi-stationary distribution even in this case. The parameters in this last convergence result are directly related to the core parameters of Muller’s ratchet. The speed of convergence to the quasi-stationary distribution is deduced both for the infinite dimensional model and for approximations with a large yet finite number of potential mutations. Likewise, we give uniform moment estimates of the empirical distribution of mutations in the population under quasi-stationarity.},
