  abstract     = {Accurate robot odometry is essential for autonomous navigation. While numerous techniques have been developed based on various sensor suites, odometry estimation using only radar and IMU remains an underexplored area. Radar proves particularly valuable in environments where traditional sensors, like cameras or LiDAR, may struggle, especially in low-light conditions or when faced with environmental challenges like fog, rain or smoke. However, despite its robustness, radar data is noisier and more prone to outliers, requiring specialized processing approaches. In this paper, we propose a graph-based optimization approach ( https://github.com/robotics-upo/4D-Radar-Odom.git ) using a sliding window for radar-based odometry, designed to maintain robust relationships between poses by forming a network of connections, while keeping computational costs fixed (specially beneficial in long trajectories). Additionally, we introduce an enhancement in the ego-velocity estimation specifically for ground vehicles, both holonomic and non-holonomic, which subsequently improves the direct odometry input required by the optimizer. Finally, we present a comparative study of our approach against existing algorithms, showing how our pure odometry approach improves the state of art in all trajectories of the NTU4DRadLM dataset, achieving promising results when evaluating key performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and introduces a formation control method that addresses both preset transient performance and steady-state performance constraints for fixed-configuration formations of USVs, taking into account model uncertainties and external disturbances. By designing the control law for different regions, we overcome the singularity issues inherent in traditional PID control. The control algorithm is integrated with graph theory to achieve effective formation control of the USVs. A dimension-reduced extended state observer is employed to detect unknown time-varying side-slip angles and external disturbances, providing accurate estimation and compensation for these composite disturbances, including ocean current interference. The stability of the ship formation control law is verified using Lyapunov theory. Additionally, the cascade system stability analysis method is used to demonstrate that the closed-loop system possesses input-to-state stability. Simulation results indicate that this method significantly enhances the stability and robustness of the USV formation.},

  abstract     = {The increasing integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into complex projects, driven by their versatility and accessibility, requires robust mechanisms for interaction with various elements of the system during sophisticated tasks such as monitoring large-scale infrastructure and environmental inspection. This trend demands flexible integration solutions. This paper presents an open-source Ground Control Station (GCS) that serves as a crucial intermediary module, enabling the seamless integration of multi-UAV fleets with external applications working as Control Centers (CC). The GCS facilitates end-to-end automated workflows: from receiving high-level task assignments from the CC, through optimized mission planning and coordinated execution across heterogeneous UAV fleets (e.g., multicopters, VTOLs, fixed-wing, etc.), to data acquisition, processing, and the delivery of consolidated results back to the CC. Unlike many existing GCS solutions, often tied to specific autopilots or lacking straightforward integration capabilities with higher-level command systems, our approach provides a flexible and application-agnostic layer. The capabilities of the system were validated in real-world scenarios, including automated tower and power line inspections. These tests demonstrated that tasks commanded by the CC via the GCS platform were executed automatically and efficiently, as expected.},

  abstract     = {Robot integration in daily life demands research on both safety and social acceptance. Current methods focus on safety, but social factors are understudied. Moreover, existing studies lack deep analysis of human perception towards robot movement. Here, we present a novel navigation approach based on the combination of Game Theory and the Social Force Model (GTSFM) to bridge these gaps. We model navigation as a non-cooperative game to consider both pedestrians and robot as rational agents influencing each other’s choices. We evaluate the social acceptability of the GTSFM algorithm from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives. In both evaluations, the GTSFM is compared against two state-of-the-art algorithms: the social force model (SFM) and the optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA). According to the quantitative analysis performed in simulation, the GTSFM outperforms the SFM in all considered performance metrics and ensures higher performance than ORCA considering the smoothness of the trajectories and the proximity to pedestrians. The qualitative measurement is performed through a real-world experiment using a questionnaire administered to a pool of 76 participants. Our qualitative analysis revealed no statistically significant differences in performance between the algorithms tested. This lack of distinction may be due to unaccounted factors. The robot’s appearance and the limited velocity of the real robot could have obscured the distinction between the algorithms. These results represent a significant milestone in advancing the integration of robots into social environments also leave important hints for future research.},

  abstract     = {Self-localization is a core capability in autonomous mobile robot navigation. The Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) algorithm addresses this challenge by maintaining a particles set to represent multiple hypotheses of the robot’s current state. In 2022, this problem was introduced in the RoboCup Small Size League (SSL), and this work proposes an integrated pipeline for solving the SSL self-localization problem while also detecting the environment dynamic objects using onboard monocular vision and inertial odometry data. We enhance the MCL algorithm using insights from implementations of other RoboCup leagues, improving its robustness and increasing its processing speed by adapting the number of particles in the set according to the confidence of the current distribution. For that, we propose a novel approach for measuring the quality of the current distribution based on applying the observation model to the resulting particle of the algorithm. This approach improved up to 56% in computation speed while maintaining the capability to track the robot’s pose.},
