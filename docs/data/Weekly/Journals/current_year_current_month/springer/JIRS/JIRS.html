  abstract     = {Accurate robot odometry is essential for autonomous navigation. While numerous techniques have been developed based on various sensor suites, odometry estimation using only radar and IMU remains an underexplored area. Radar proves particularly valuable in environments where traditional sensors, like cameras or LiDAR, may struggle, especially in low-light conditions or when faced with environmental challenges like fog, rain or smoke. However, despite its robustness, radar data is noisier and more prone to outliers, requiring specialized processing approaches. In this paper, we propose a graph-based optimization approach ( https://github.com/robotics-upo/4D-Radar-Odom.git ) using a sliding window for radar-based odometry, designed to maintain robust relationships between poses by forming a network of connections, while keeping computational costs fixed (specially beneficial in long trajectories). Additionally, we introduce an enhancement in the ego-velocity estimation specifically for ground vehicles, both holonomic and non-holonomic, which subsequently improves the direct odometry input required by the optimizer. Finally, we present a comparative study of our approach against existing algorithms, showing how our pure odometry approach improves the state of art in all trajectories of the NTU4DRadLM dataset, achieving promising results when evaluating key performance metrics.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) and introduces a formation control method that addresses both preset transient performance and steady-state performance constraints for fixed-configuration formations of USVs, taking into account model uncertainties and external disturbances. By designing the control law for different regions, we overcome the singularity issues inherent in traditional PID control. The control algorithm is integrated with graph theory to achieve effective formation control of the USVs. A dimension-reduced extended state observer is employed to detect unknown time-varying side-slip angles and external disturbances, providing accurate estimation and compensation for these composite disturbances, including ocean current interference. The stability of the ship formation control law is verified using Lyapunov theory. Additionally, the cascade system stability analysis method is used to demonstrate that the closed-loop system possesses input-to-state stability. Simulation results indicate that this method significantly enhances the stability and robustness of the USV formation.},
