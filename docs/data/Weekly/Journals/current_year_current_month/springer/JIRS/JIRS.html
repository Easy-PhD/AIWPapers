  abstract     = {Dual mobile manipulators (DMMs) possess the advantages of high redundancy and extensive working space, enabling robot systems to undertake more complex tasks, such as the collaborative transportation of objects with stereoscopic shapes. Some existing works have addressed the collaborative transportation tasks under the tightly-coupled transportation model. Nevertheless, there have been few studies on the transportation issues in the loosely-coupled transportation model, where the problems such as the difficulty of maintaining formation configuration and high requirements for internal force stability exist. To this end, this paper presents a new event-based planning and control approach. First, the motion forms during the transportation process are classified for the collaborative transportation scenarios of objects with stereoscopic shapes, and an event-based motion planning strategy is provided. Then, by combining admittance control and nonlinear feedback control, a force-position hybrid control method is designed to control the force and position errors during the transportation process. Experimental results indicate that compared to the time-based method, the proposed event-based method can better guarantee the collaborative performance of the DMMs system during the transportation process. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first attempt to solve the collaborative transportation problem of DMMs with loosely-coupled model by the event-based method.},

However, the practicality of their reconfigurations is often limited by the necessity of manually deriving models and adapting control software for each new configuration. This manual process can be time-consuming and complex, making it less feasible to fully utilize the potential of modular robotics. Existing approaches for automatic derivation of models and effortless deployment of model-based controllers consider robotic manipulators only. In contrast, we consider modular wheeled mobile robots and present an approach for automatically recognizing their kinematics and deploying their navigation capabilities given mobility and perception modules. Our approach has been tested through both simulations and experiments. The simulations validate the approach across different platforms, each with varying compositions of modules. The experimental results further show the effectiveness of our approach, by deploying the autonomous navigation of a platform composed of four steering wheels, and by focusing on car-like, differential, and omni-like kinematic configurations.},

The proposed system integrates a Leader-Follower feedback controller that regulates distance and angle between robots to maintain the object closure condition throughout the transport. The soft grippers enhance adaptability to object contours and allow stable manipulation with fewer robots.

  abstract     = {Overall, a big challenge in building a sailboat USV relies on the development of an autonomous system for guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) because both sail and rudder angle must be cooperatively adjusted to correct the navigation direction — traditional propelled boats can be more easily controlled with a straightforward control task to set the rudder angle. Moreover, sailing upwind requires special maneuvers to reach a given target in that unfeasible direction. Reinforcement learning emerges as a promising technique for building autonomous GNCs for sailing robots, but training the neural network with a real sailboat is impractical due to long periods of training and safety reasons. Even traditional control-based approaches are mainly tested in simulated environments due to the difficulties in building and operating a real sailboat. The issue that arises is the fidelity of these simulated environments. In this context, we propose Yara, an oceanic virtual environment with a reliable physics simulation for developing, training, and evaluating autonomous agents to operate digital twins of sailing robots in reinforcement learning and other paradigms. An autonomous sailing robot digital twin is available within the virtual environment, with the foil dynamics constructed based on a real sailing robot. We coupled these foil dynamics in Gazebo’s physics engine to compute the lift and drag forces acting on the sail, rudder, and keel. The simulated world feeds sensors such as cameras, wind sensors, and GPS. The Robot Operating System communicates these sensors’ data through topics, facilitating users’ implementation and testing of new GNC solutions. Yara provides a reliable solution for foil dynamic simulated physics that achieves a simulation speedup of 300 times on an i7 laptop with 8 GB of RAM, powered by a Nvidia RTX 3060 and running Ubuntu 20.04. With this speedup, it is possible to complete a million time steps of deep reinforcement learning training in approximately eight hours. Evaluation scenarios were presented to highlight specific features of the simulator, like the maneuverability of the sailing robot digital twin and applications to train, evaluate, and compare reinforcement learning agents and other control solutions.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the robust trajectory tracking control challenge for multiple mobile robots in complex environments, an increasingly critical issue as the number of robots grows and the demand for high tracking accuracy and efficiency increases. Existing methods are unable to strike a balance between safety and tracking precision in multi-robot trajectory tracking, with the requirement that robots should be as close as possible to their designated positions at all times during tracking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Multi Mobile Robot Trajectory Model Predictive Control (MMRT-MPC) and the Trajectory Action Dependence Graph (TADG) framework. MMRT-MPC incorporates multiple indicators into the cost function to improve trajectory tracking accuracy and efficiency. Meanwhile, TADG ensures safety during trajectory tracking and is compatible with MMRT-MPC as well as other control algorithms. Simulations in Gazebo show that the TADG method ensures the safety of trajectory tracking control. Compared with applying TADG to Prioritized Trajectory Optimization (PTO) and Bellman Dynamic Programming with Model Predictive Control (BDP-MPC), MMRT-MPC+TADG reduces average delay by 17.7% and 11.6% respectively under different numbers of robots, and by 20.8% and 14.3% in the case of 30 robots with random delays added. Furthermore, the validity of our proposed method is confirmed through real-world experimental results.},

The event-triggered mechanism activates control laws only when necessary, reducing the computational burden of continuous control adjustments and enhancing responsiveness and efficiency. This strategy supports robustness, mitigates issues arising from local minima, and maintains system stability, providing a practical solution for real-time visual servoing tasks.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel approach, Coalition Formation for Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Task Allocation (CF-HMRTA), to address the challenge of multi-robot task allocation. The problem, inherently NP-Hard, is tackled using bipartite graph matching. CF-HMRTA forms heterogeneous robot coalitions with unique service skills to complete tasks collaboratively, using a heuristic algorithm for optimal robot-task pairing while preventing task overlap. Recent research work using bipartite graph matching for multi-robot coalition formation and task allocation often assumes homogeneity across tasks and robots, where any robot can be assigned to any task. In contrast, the solution proposed in this paper explicitly considers the diversity of robots with varying service skills. Additionally, tasks demand different sets of skills, such as sensing, monitoring, and data collection, making certain tasks unsuitable for some robots due to hardware constraints. For instance, tasks requiring aerial footage are assigned to drones, while ground robots handle close-ground monitoring. Furthermore, we incorporate task-specific time constraints into our problem formulation, enhancing its realism. Considerably less research has been conducted on heterogeneous robot teams solving tasks that require multiple service skills and temporal constraints, making our work a significant contribution to the field. The algorithm achieves a worst-case time complexity of $$ O(|E|) $$ , where $$ E $$ represents the edges in the bipartite graph, and guarantees perfect matching. Simulation results highlight its scalability, successfully allocating up to 2000 robots to 400 tasks in approximately 11 seconds.},

Secondly, an OB method by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with backstepping technique is developed for USVs course tracking control system. Different from other optimal methods, the OB method is to design the controller of every backstepping step to be the optimized solution of the corresponding subsystem so that the overall system control is optimized.

This is precisely the focus of this work that introduces a novel approach for securing communications between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In particular, to safeguard the data against attacks in UAV networks, implemented for military-grade or critical infrastructure operation scenarios, different security techniques are combined, including the employment of a chaotic synchronization-based communications architecture. The proposed chaotic-synchronized, secure communications system (UAV-CSCS) is applied onboard a UAV and comprised of three layers, namely a VPN server (initial security layer), a custom ROS-based framework (data collection and distribution layer), and a lightweight chaotic communications module (secondary security layer). UAV-CSCS’s main component is a transmitter-receiver communication architecture based on chaotic synchronization that successfully encodes and decodes information over a chaotic signal, enabling secure information exchange between agents. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a prototype is designed, developed, and thoroughly tested in real-world multi-UAV experiments. The results demonstrate secure, real-time communication with low-power consumption and minimal resource allocation (in terms of CPU and RAM), validating the system’s efficiency and applicability.},

  abstract     = {The deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) raises significant concerns regarding the security and integrity of sensitive data communicated across various heterogeneous devices, resources, applications, and users in autonomous marine vehicles. The existing heterogeneous nature often struggles with the diversity of different device types' communication features, and the dynamic nature of IoT environments also compromises privacy due to unauthorized users' marine vehicle devices. A novel data space privacy model, supported by connected federated learning, is utilized for secure authentication in the communication of IoT marine vehicles, thereby enhancing security and privacy. The proposed model ensures user data privacy by enabling localized model training using synchronous connectivity for resource verification and data space privacy and reducing the risk of data exposure. The learning is periodically updated with the synchronous fitness value to retain similar authentication throughout the sharing intervals. By incorporating real-time resource verification, optimizing resource allocation, and mitigating communication drops. The results demonstrate that this proposed model reduces communication drop by 11.21% across varying users, 12.06% regarding sharing space value and time, 11.9% of transaction values, and 12.17% across multiple devices, with an improved authentication success rate and data integrity compared to existing models. The research implications offer valuable insights for developing more secure IoT communication protocols and policy frameworks that enhance data privacy and authentication in marine IoT networks.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an innovative approach using Semi-Markov Decision Processes (SMDPs) for task allocation in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically addressing the stochastic nature of battery levels. By dynamically managing task assignments based on real-time battery status and the time spent in different states, the SMDP framework significantly enhances operational efficiency. This SMDP approach achieves an average improvement of 54.1% decrease in total flight time compared to manual assignment strategies, this study further investigates the impact of different reward matrix configurations. The increasing deployment of UAVs in surveillance, disaster response, and delivery services necessitates efficient task allocation strategies, particularly under energy constraints. Previous works have explored heuristic and reinforcement learning-based approaches, yet few have incorporated the semi-Markov decision framework for battery-aware task scheduling. Our research extends prior efforts, such as resource-constrained task allocation models and networked evolutionary game-theoretic approaches, by explicitly modeling state durations and decision-making uncertainty. This study expands on previous findings by utilizing two distinct sets of reward matrices to validate the improvements achieved with SMDPs in UAV task allocation. By comparing these configurations, we aim to further optimize decision-making strategies, ensuring more efficient and adaptive UAV operations in dynamic environments.},

The study commences with the mechanism structure synthesis of the hip exoskeleton robot (HER), followed by kinematic and dynamic analysis and simulation of HEI. The experimental findings reveal that the designed HER can achieve misalignment compensation (MC) displacements in the 0 to 18.3 mm range.

To address these limitations, this paper introduces a new approach to estimate and model the reachability space of manipulators using a single ellipsoid equation. By generating a point cloud from the robot kinematic model, the proposed method avoids the complexity of forward and inverse kinematics calculations to generate the set of reachable points. The ellipsoid parameters are computed by exploiting two techniques: an optimization-based process and a machine learning approach that leverages the PointNet model. Different optimization algorithms and variants of the PointNet model are tested and compared in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing and modeling an accurate representation of the reaching capabilities of a robotic manipulator.},

Maintaining continuous, high-precision pose estimation of the AUV over extended durations is critical for its mission success and operational safety. To address the limitations of vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in underwater environments, particularly trajectory tracking failures caused by visual information scarcity, this paper proposes a novel pose estimator switching framework. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of AUV pose estimation by incorporating two key components. First, we designed a visual monitor that continuously assesses the work state of the SLAM system. Next, we developed a neural network-based pose estimator driven by Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) data and combined with pressure measurements, which is called IPNet Estimator. When visual information becomes unavailable, the system seamlessly switches to this alternative estimator, ensuring uninterrupted pose estimation for the AUV. Finally, experiments conducted on a publicly available underwater dataset validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

Such factors may compromise the mission’s safety and outcome, as the operators might issue unintentional commands. Nonetheless, real-time monitoring of both the operator and the ROV can help prevent such potential accidents by introducing a mechanism that detects such anomalies. We present the construction of real-life datasets that include two test cases: aerial and ground vehicles. Data were collected from the operator and the ROV during a mission. The first dataset consists of data from 19 subjects when operating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), while the second dataset includes data from 7 subjects when performing an operation with an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV). The construction of such datasets and the expansion in more than one ROV aim to the generalization of our approach towards abnormal command detection. A thorough analysis was conducted and presented, which included statistical analysis: a t-test and the extraction of average values and box-plots. Further, feature extraction and selection were performed as part of the analysis of the constructed datasets, towards the classification of abnormal commands.},

The high-speed, continuous nature of the tossing task necessitates precise and efficient adjustments to ensure that the objects reach their target location. Although nonlinear model predictive controllers (MPCs) are a valuable tool to calculate trajectories, it is difficult to assess in advance how long the calculations will take. They are, hence, difficult to use in tossing under dynamic conditions. To achieve accurate tossing under varying target locations within restricted computational time, we propose a soft switching multiple MPC strategy that enables smooth trajectory updates, while adhering to system constraints. By switching between multiple linear model predictive controllers, our approach ensures rapid trajectory generation, enabling seamless operation in unpredictable conditions. Experimental validation was conducted using a 6-degrees-of-freedom industrial robot arm, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing computational load by a factor of 1300 compared to a benchmark based on nonlinear MPC. These results confirm its effectiveness for high-speed robotic tossing and suggest broader applicability in tasks requiring real-time trajectory adaptation.},

During repeated charging and discharging, the degradation of LIBs, which reduces their maximum power output and operating time, is a pivotal issue. This degradation can affect not only battery performance but also safety of the system. Therefore, it is essential to accurately estimate the state-of-health (SOH) of the battery in real time. To address this problem, we propose a fast SOH estimation method that utilizes the sparse model identification algorithm (SINDy) for nonlinear dynamics. SINDy can discover the governing equations of target systems with low data assuming that few functions have the dominant characteristic of the system. To formulate the state of degradation model, domain knowledge and statistical variables are suggested. This is the first implementation of statistical variables in SINDy for SOH estimation. Using SINDy, we can obtain the data-driven SOH model to improve the interpretability of the system. To validate the feasibility of the proposed method, the estimation performance of the SOH and the computation time are evaluated by comparing it with various machine learning algorithms, showing that it is approximately 30 times faster than GPR.},

This approach includes an enhanced forward checking method that evaluates task suitability and UAV compatibility in real-time using dynamic programming, thus refining search precision. The ETCSP model was tested in two phases, initially assigning various tasks and then employing CSP methods to monitor task changes over time. Results show that the generic TCSP method requires 61 UAVs to complete 70 tasks, while the Enhanced TCSP achieves the same with only 48 UAVs—which is roughly a 21% reduction in UAV usage. Similarly, the Enhanced method completes the task package in about 3800 min and with 1142 L of fuel, compared to 4855 min and 1615 L for the TCSP method, translating to approximately a 22% reduction in time and a 29% reduction in fuel consumption.},

This decoupled approach allows for a more accurate representation of friction behavior, especially at low velocities. Additionally, the influence of ball screw spline coupling between joints 3 and 4 is investigated, revealing its impact on the robot’s dynamics, particularly under payload conditions.

  abstract     = {Traditional adaptive and robust control methods sometimes struggle to address the complex and dynamic uncertainties inherent in quadrotor flight, frequently resulting in overly conservative or unstable behavior due to reliance on presumed uncertainty bounds. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified online-learning-based control framework that integrates data-driven uncertainty estimation with a nominal flight controller. Furthermore, we systematically evaluate four representative learning methods, namely Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs), Echo State Networks (ESNs), and Gaussian Processes (GPs), spanning both parametric and non-parametric techniques. Through extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we benchmark these methods in terms of (i) uncertainty estimation accuracy, (ii) trajectory tracking performance, and (iii) real-time computational efficiency. Our results reveal key trade-offs: GPs yield highest accuracy but require approximations for real-time use. ELMs and RBFNNs enable fast inference but suffer initialization sensitivity. ESNs provide the best balance, offering both stability and real-time performance. This work underscores the critical role of model selection in learning-based flight control, providing insights for deploying these algorithms in resource-constrained aerial systems operating under uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous robotic systems will be the future of planetary exploration missions. For autonomous robotic exploration, reliable pose estimation is required. This can be provided by cooperative radio localization, where radio signals are exchanged among the robots and other mission objects. Range and direction information is obtained by measuring the signal round-trip time (RTT) and direction-of-arrival (DoA), which enables position and orientation estimation of the robots. For the first time, we have demonstrated cooperative radio localization within a space-analogue exploration mission with two robotic rovers on the volcano Mt Etna. With this paper, we share our main lessons learned based on a thorough evaluation of measurement data. Thereby we identify estimation biases as the main error source. We then show how to estimate and compensate these biases during the mission by simultaneous localization and calibration (SLAC). We further investigate the impact of the radio signals reflected on the ground and on mission objects on the ranging accuracy. Then, we demonstrate the benefit of cooperation and the feasibility of single-link localization. In addition, we share tangible ranging and DoA estimation error models based on measurements in a realistic environment.},

  abstract     = {The advances in deep learning for image processing greatly impacted mobile robots’ ability to navigate using vision-based techniques. There are many applications in which the robot is required to follow a specific visual cue. One newly emerging method for autonomous navigation along a consistent visual cue is Visual Teach and Generalise (VTAG). It is a unified approach to extract suitable features for path following in repetitive and structured environments. However, a relatively large number of data samples is required for the time-consuming training of a detector tied to a specific visual cue. We introduce an improved version of VTAG that does not need any neural network training and significantly reduces the requirements for the number of data samples. The core idea is to use an average representation of images collected during short supervised traversals, capturing characteristics of repetitive paths. The average representation is created in a latent space crafted by contrastive learning with the linear matching scheme and can be computed in real time, even on a CPU. The capability of rapid deployment, precision, and robustness of the presented method is evaluated in multiple field experiments performed in different environments.},

  abstract     = {Most telemanipulation systems for aerial robots provide the operator with only 2D screen visual information. The lack of richer information about the robot’s status and environment can limit human awareness and, in turn, task performance. While the pilot’s experience can often compensate for this reduced flow of information, providing richer feedback is expected to reduce the cognitive workload and offer a more intuitive experience overall. This work aims to understand the significance of providing additional pieces of information during aerial telemanipulation, namely (i) 3D immersive visual feedback about the robot’s surroundings through mixed reality (MR) and (ii) 3D haptic feedback about the robot interaction with the environment. To do so, we developed a human-robot interface able to provide this information. First, we demonstrate its potential in a real-world manipulation task requiring sub-centimeter-level accuracy. Then, we evaluate the individual effect of MR vision and haptic feedback on both dexterity and workload through a human subjects study involving a virtual block transportation task. Results show that both 3D MR vision and haptic feedback improve the operator’s dexterity in the considered teleoperated aerial interaction tasks. Nevertheless, pilot experience remains the most significant factor.},

  abstract     = {Integrating intelligent sensor technologies with robotic manipulators is central to advancing smart manufacturing systems. This study presents a comprehensive trajectory planning and optimization framework for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm equipped with sensor-driven control to enhance task precision and reduce execution time. Five interpolation methods were evaluated in both Cartesian and joint spaces, with an improved cubic B-spline fitting method selected for its superior trajectory smoothness and adaptability. A novel genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to optimize time-based trajectory execution, incorporating a penalty-based constraint handling mechanism and a sinusoidal function for adaptive variation in crossover and mutation rates. Simulation results demonstrated a 30–33% reduction in total motion time compared to the unoptimized baseline, lowering the execution time from 20.00 s to 13.38 s across five trajectory segments. The algorithm ensured compliance with mechanical constraints on angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk. Validation was performed using a co-simulation platform integrating MATLAB Simscape, SolidWorks CAD models, and the Robotics Toolbox. Simulated joint angles, velocities, and accelerations exhibited < 2% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) against theoretical predictions, confirming the accuracy of the inverse kinematics and optimization process. This work demonstrates the viability of sensor-integrated, optimization-driven robotic arms for time-sensitive, high-precision operations in Industry 4.0 environments.},

  abstract     = {Robot grasping is a critical area of research in robotics, which aims to develop algorithms and strategies that enable robots towards reliable grasping and manipulation of objects in various environments. The ability to grasp and handle objects dexterously has wide-ranging applications in manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Recent advances in deep learning have paved the way for learning-based approaches toward autonomous grasping and intelligent manipulation in structured and unstructured environments. However, majority of the existing methods are designed for two-finger robotic grippers and cannot be extended towards application on three-finger robotic grippers. Three-finger grippers can perform a wide variety of grasps, and thereby require more nuanced grasp representation as compared to existing approaches. In this work, we propose a novel method towards representing underactuated three-finger grasps. A new grasp data set is also presented, specifically designed to train and evaluate three-finger robotic grasps using the proposed novel representation. A state-of-the-art deep learning architecture was trained on the dataset towards developing an end-to-end grasp planning pipeline. The proposed pipeline uses color and depth images as inputs to predict the ideal grasp pose for a three-finger robotic gripper to grasp the target object. The trained network was validated through simulation and hardware experiments, and the results were compared with an existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach to highlight the potential of this new technique for grasp representation and planning.},

  abstract     = {On 16 November 2020, a MQ-8C Firescout was preparing for a form/fit/function ground test of a new battery. The ground test was considered low risk and therefore did not require extensive risk mitigation steps. The test points were simple: start the air vehicle, do a systems check, and shut down the air vehicle. On the morning of the test event, the MQ-8C was chained to the ground (as it was a maintenance ground turn), and a maintenance laptop was connected to interface with the air vehicle systems. A command and control communication link was not established with a ground station. The test team started the air system, and everything functioned as expected until test personnel initiated shutdown. Within 30 seconds, the air vehicle went to full power, the rotor disk shifted from parallel to the ground to full forward and full right, the shifted disk cut the only connection to the maintenance laptop, and the system ran for approximately 6 minutes until the transmission came apart causing over $2,500,000 of damage. This paper summarizes the facts surrounding the mishap and offers conclusions and recommendations on how to avoid similar mishaps in the future.},

  abstract     = {Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to enable autonomous navigation in unknown environments. Most research assumes perfect sensor data, but real-world environments may contain natural and artificial sensor noise and denial. Here, we present a benchmark of both well-used and emerging DRL algorithms in two navigation tasks - Lidar + position, and vision end-to-end - with configurable sensor denial effects. In particular, we are interested in comparing how different DRL methods (e.g. model-free, on-policy PPO vs. model-free off-policy TD3, vs. model-based DreamerV3) are affected by imperfect sensor readings. We show that DreamerV3 outperforms other methods in the visual end-to-end navigation task with a dynamic goal. Furthermore, DreamerV3 generally outperforms other methods in sensor-denied environments. In order to improve robustness, we use adversarial training and demonstrate an improved performance in denied environments, although we show that this may lead to the agent learning to choose high-risk actions in case of uncertain sensor readings, which is not appropriate for safety-critical scenarios. We anticipate this benchmark of different DRL methods and the usage of adversarial training to be a starting point for the development of more elaborate navigation strategies that are capable of dealing with uncertain and denied sensor readings.},
