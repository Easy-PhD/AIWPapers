  abstract     = {Multi-robot teams provide an effective solution for delivering multiple types of goods, such as food or medicine, to various locations of demand. This work presents a Voronoi-based coverage control approach to the multi-resource allocation problem, and considers a heterogeneous team comprising robots with different resource types and capacities. The team must supply resources to multiple demand locations. Demand of resources may change over time, and fluctuate in overall demand, which is represented over the environment as a time-varying density function. From the demand density, robots minimize their respective locational cost, adapting and moving to areas of higher demand. Robots must adhere to supply constraints and replenish resources over time to ensure persistent resource coverage. This paper therefore investigates how to enable persistent deployments, wherein robots must continually alternate between serving demand or replenishing resources. We explore four algorithms for resource replenishment, which vary in communication, forecasting, and information assumptions. Simulations and hardware experiments demonstrate a need-based auction algorithm, which aims to minimize service blackouts, produces the best performance for a heterogeneous team. We also present a discussion on acceptable alternatives for homogeneous teams without communication.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed for long-term information-gathering tasks, which pose two key challenges: planning informative trajectories in environments that evolve across space and time, and ensuring persistent operation under energy constraints. This paper presents a unified framework, mEclares, that addresses both challenges through adaptive ergodic search and energy-aware scheduling in multi-robot systems. Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we model real-world variability using stochastic spatiotemporal environments, where the underlying information evolves continuously over space and time under process noise. To guide exploration, we construct a target information spatial distribution (TISD) based on clarity, a metric that captures the decay of information in the absence of observations and highlights regions of high uncertainty; and (2) we introduce Robust-meSch ( RmeSch ), an online scheduling method that enables persistent operation by coordinating rechargeable robots sharing a single mobile charging station. Unlike prior work, our approach avoids reliance on preplanned schedules, static or dedicated charging stations, and simplified robot dynamics. Instead, the scheduler supports general nonlinear models, accounts for uncertainty in the estimated position of the charging station, and handles central node failures. The proposed framework is validated through real-world hardware experiments, and feasibility guarantees are provided under specific assumptions.
