  abstract     = {An attack graph is a concise portrayal of the various paths within an open system that enable an attacker to reach a prohibited state (such as gaining access to a restricted resource), despite the system’s preventive measures. The assessment of system vulnerability involves examining the presence of such paths. In this work, we analyze attack graphs using a game-theoretic approach. Specifically, we introduce a well-suited game model that represents the dynamics between the system and the attacker, and propose an automata-based solution to demonstrate the absence of vulnerability.},

Our objective is to assess the performance of these algorithms in various grid-based environments to present how specific domain features influence their efficiency. Additionally, we extend our experiments by incorporating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) benchmarks, using handcrafted features and features extracted with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to characterize the maps. The results of our evaluation were later used to train machine learning models capable of predicting the efficient algorithm for a given pathfinding task based on performance criteria. This multi-algorithm pathfinding method enhances the selection of the best algorithm for different pathfinding problems. Furthermore, we revealed the most important features that impact the selection of the efficient algorithm. We identify the most important characteristics of the grid that affect the selection and performance of the algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Ensuring the safe and effective operation of autonomous systems is a complex undertaking that inherently relies on underlying decision-making processes. To rigorously analyze these processes, formal verification methods, such as model checking, offer a valuable means. However, the non-deterministic nature of realistic environments makes these approaches challenging and often impractical. This work explores the capabilities of a constraint-based planning approach, Tumato, in generating policies that guide the system to predefined goals while adhering to safety constraints. Constraint-based planning approaches are inherently able to provide guarantees of soundness and completeness. Our primary contribution lies in extending Tumato’s capabilities to accommodate non-deterministic outcomes of actions, enhancing the robustness of the behavior. Originally designed to accommodate only deterministic outcomes, actions can now be modeled to include alternative outcomes to address contingencies explicitly. The adapted solver generates policies that enable reaching the goals in a safe manner, even when such alternative outcomes of actions occur. Additionally, we introduce a purely declarative manner for specifying safety in Tumato to further enhance its expressiveness as well as to reduce the susceptibility to errors during specification. The incorporation of cost or duration values to actions enables the solver to restore safety in the most preferred manner when necessary. Finally, we highlight the overlap of Tumato’s safety-related capabilities with a systems-theoretic approach, STPA (Systems-Theoretic Process Analysis). The aim is to emphasize the ability to avoid unsafe control actions without their explicit identification, contributing to a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of safety.},

  abstract     = {Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP) are a useful model for decision-making under partial observability and stochastic actions. Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (POMCP) is an online algorithm for deciding on the next action to perform, using a Monte-Carlo tree search approach, based on the UCT algorithm for fully observable Markov-decision processes. POMCP develops an action-observation tree, and at the leaves, uses a rollout policy to provide a value estimate for the leaf. As such, POMCP is highly dependent on the rollout policy to compute good estimates, and hence identify good actions. Thus, many practitioners who use POMCP are required to create strong, domain-specific heuristics. In this paper, we model POMDPs as stochastic contingent planning problems. This allows us to leverage domain-independent heuristics that were developed in the planning community. We suggest two heuristics, the first is based on the well-known $$h_{add}$$ heuristic from classical planning, and the second is computed in belief space, taking the value of information into account.},

  abstract     = {Interactive reinforcement learning is an effective way to train agents via human feedback. However, it often requires the trainer (a human who provides feedback to the agent) to know the correct action for the agent. If the trainer is not always reliable, the wrong feedback may hinder the agent’s training. In addition, there is no consensus on the best form of human feedback in interactive reinforcement learning. To address these problems, in this paper, we explore the performance of binary reward as the reward form. Moreover, we propose a novel interactive reinforcement learning system called Multi-Trainer Interactive Reinforcement Learning (MTIRL), which can aggregate binary feedback from multiple imperfect trainers into a reliable reward for agent training in a reward-sparse environment. In addition, the review model in MTIRL can correct the unreliable rewards. In particular, our experiments for evaluating reward forms show that binary reward outperforms other reward forms, including ranking reward, scaling reward, and state value reward. In addition, our question-answer experiments show that our aggregation method outperforms the state-of-the-art aggregation methods, including majority voting, weighted voting, and the Bayesian aggregation method. Finally, we conduct grid-world experiments to show that the policy trained by the MTIRL with the review model is closer to the optimal policy than that without a review model.},
