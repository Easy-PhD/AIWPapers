  abstract     = {With the increasing global consciousness in the nutritional impact of food consumption, there is a growing need to ascertain the quality standards of fruits or vegetables. Precise and timely quality assessment of fruits or vegetables offers substantial economic advantages to agronomists. It also provides agricultural support by supplying farmers with crucial assessments that enable fair compensation for harvests and higher-quality goods. A significant technological gap in monitoring the quality evolution of fruits within the food supply chain is leading to substantial fruit wastage. Several cutting-edge technologies, such as computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning, have been extensively applied in various agricultural domains, particularly in quality estimation, to address the food security issue. Recently, deep belief classifiers have facilitated promising outcomes, showing higher accuracy than conventional methods. However, the existing deep models for assessing the quality of fruits and vegetables are translation invariant and sensitive to the captured image orientation. Moreover, the existing methods for the fruit quality assessment are fruit-specific and fail to perform on multiple fruits and vegetables. To address this concern, this paper presents a novel method, FruCapsNet, which leverages the strength of capsule network with a shuffle attention mechanism to identify multiple fruit quality effectively. The proposed method utilizes the convolution layers for low-level feature extraction, a shuffled attention block for selective feature maps, and a capsule module for capturing hierarchical feature map relationships. The performance of the proposed method has been validated using the publicly available VegNet dataset, which contains four different fruits with multiple qualities. The experimental result showed that FruCapsNet overshadows the existing state-of-the-art deep network models in terms of accuracy, F1-Score, precision, recall, MSE, and specificity. The proposed method has achieved the highest testing accuracy of $$93.89\%$$ , $$93.18\%$$ , $$92.78\%$$ , and $$93.68\%$$ for bell pepper, chili pepper, new mexico chile, and tomato, respectively. Additionally, the t-distributed Symmetric Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) framework has been employed to interpret the classification outcomes of the FruCapsNet method for validation.},

  abstract     = {Cancer is a diverse disease brought on by the aberrant development of a cell. Cancer prognosis has become a priority in cancer research as it helps medical experts to plan treatment strategies. As a result, Artificial Intelligence-based learning approaches have been used to model the development and treatment of cancer. In cancer research, several such techniques are being commonly used to build prediction models, leading to an efficient and reliable verdict. We examined the most recent models to highlight the role of predictive models in cancer research. Using a combination of keywords like machine learning, deep learning, cancer prognosis, cancer prediction, and cancer survivability, we found articles published in scientific databases between 2010 and 2021. Our study carries multiples investigations and presents a summary of automated learning methods used in cancer predictive modeling in this article. Although it is evident that machine/deep learning-based models enhance our ability in the early prediction of cancer diagnosis, an adequate amount of affirmation is needed to make sure that such predictive models can be introduced in routine medical practices. The cancer research field is of high impact, and investigations on cancer prediction models should be encompassed for medical decision support of both practitioners and patients.},

  abstract     = {In 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a global survey revealing that 16% of the worldâ€™s population lives with some form of functional limitation. The majority of these individuals reside in developing countries, where access to assistive technologies is limited due to economic and structural barriers. In this context, the development of affordable and accessible solutions is crucial to promoting autonomy and inclusion. This study proposes a facial movement-based wheelchair control system designed for individuals with tetraplegia. The system leverages real-time computer vision techniques and the YOLOv8 model to detect specific facial features - with a focus on nose position and orientation - converting these into directional commands (forward, backward, left, and right). The framework is structured into three main stages: facial detection, feature extraction, and command inference. To classify directional commands, we evaluated two machine learning methods: PCA and XGBoost. The confusion matrices demonstrated that XGBoost achieved superior accuracy across all classes, particularly in the "forward" direction (89%), outperforming PCA (78%). Interpretability analysis using a SHAP summary plot showed that the most influential features for decision-making are delta_x and delta_y, corresponding to the horizontal and vertical displacements of the nose. These features are directly linked to rotational and linear movement commands. Angular attributes such as angle_yaw and angle_pitch, which represent head rotation in the horizontal and vertical planes, further support directional inference, especially for users with limited motion amplitude. Conversely, features like angle_roll and stability_score demonstrated low relevance, as they are not directly associated with mapped commands in the current system. Overall, the performance metrics - 96.5% precision, 95.8% recall, and 95.9% mean Average Precision (mAP) - confirm the robustness of the proposed approach. The integration of advanced visual processing with interpretable models results in a responsive and intuitive control interface, effectively supporting users with severe motor impairments and enhancing their independence and quality of life.},

  abstract     = {This study focuses on the 3D flow field around straight groynes using experimental datasets and kernel-based techniques. In this regard, firstly, the three-dimensional turbulent flow field around straight groynes with different lengths was investigated using laboratory experiments. Then, two kernel-based approaches including the Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) were used for modeling the three-dimensional velocity components. Finally, the modeling uncertainty was investigated using the Lower Upper Bound Estimation (LUBE) method. Estimation (LUBE) method was applied to explore modeling uncertainty. Experimental results showed that increasing the length of the groyne enhanced the maximum kinetic energy of the turbulent flow along the shear layer while also making the energy distribution in the depth more uniform. The groyne with largest length had the highest general turbulent shear stress in the downstream of the structure. The results showed that the kernel-based methods successfully simulated the 3D velocity components, and the GPR performed much better than the KELM. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the vertical coordinate of the measuring point (Z*) was the least important input variable in flow field simulation around a single straight groyne. It was found that the GPR demonstrated a desirable degree of reliability. Experimental study of flow structure around single straight groynes.

  abstract     = {The integration of stochastic renewable energy sources, like wind turbines and photovoltaic systems, into electrical grids introduces challenges to grid stability and reliability, leading to voltage and frequency deviations. This study addresses the fluctuation issue by examining hybrid energy storage systems combining batteries and supercapacitors. A novel power smoothing approach is proposed, involving two strategies: employing LSTM neural networks for short-term prediction of RES power profiles and optimizing HESS through charge/discharge cycle control using a machine learning-based algorithm. This paper also introduces the synergy of vanadium redox flow batteries and supercapacitor for efficient energy storage. The proposed approach is validated through experimental testing in a controlled microgrid setting. The evaluation demonstrates significant improvements, including a 74.2% reduction in power fluctuations and an enhanced smoothing quality evaluation index by up to 40%, surpassing conventional methods like moving average, ramp rate, and low pass filter. The contributions of this research encompass an advanced energy smoothing methodology, streamlined storage integration, and an enhanced energy quality framework for hybrid renewable energy systems.},

  abstract     = {Rural areas embody the deepest thoughts and wisdom of the Chinese nation and are the root of Chinaâ€™s excellent traditional culture. At present, the essence of rural construction is the revitalization of rural culture. With the development of the times, the spiritual and cultural needs of the rural population are also growing due to significant improvements in material living conditions. As an important carrier of rural culture, landscape serves as a starting point for research into rural landscape design with the concept of cultural inheritance. Reasonably and effectively exploring cultural elements and discussing the related theories and practical issues of rural landscape design from a new perspective are crucial for maintaining the vitality of rural areas and promoting sustainable rural development. The quality evaluation of cultural heritage-oriented rural landscapes within the rural revitalization framework is a task well-suited for multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM). Recently, the Exponential TODIM (ExpTODIM) and VIKOR methods have been introduced to address MAGDM challenges. For handling uncertain data during this evaluation, the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic sets (2TLNSs) have been introduced as an effective tool. In this research, the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic number ExpTODIM-VIKOR (2TLNN-ExpTODIM-VIKOR) method is introduced to tackle MAGDM challenges using 2TLNSs. Furthermore, a numerical study focusing on the quality evaluation of cultural heritage-oriented rural landscapes in the context of rural revitalization is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the 2TLNN-ExpTODIM-VIKOR approach. The major contributions are illustrated: (1) ExpTODIM and VIKOR approach are extended to the 2TLNNs; (2) entropy approach is expressed to obtain the weight under 2TLNNs; (3) 2TLNN-ExpTODIM-VIKOR approach is expressed forward MAGDM under 2TLNNs; (4) Finally, numerical example for quality evaluation for cultural heritage-oriented rural landscapes within the rural revitalization context and comparative analysis are expressed to validate the 2TLNN-ExpTODIM-VIKOR approach.},

The proposed model integrates dynamic resource allocation to ensure more effective utilization of resources. It considers the performance of resource allocation across various activities and permits resource reassignment based on the current project conditions. Unlike traditional static approaches, where resource allocation for each activity is predetermined and inflexible over time, the proposed model allocates resources dynamically based on the performance of each activity. The results, accompanied by sensitivity analysis, indicate that the model can successfully prioritize critical activities and adjust resource allocation dynamically. It underscores the importance of a balanced and coordinated approach to resource allocation, emphasizing that the combined effect of multiple resources is more beneficial than focusing on individual ones. Moreover, managerial insights from this study highlight the necessity for managers to consider the relative prioritization of global resources concerning their overall impact on project outcomes. The findings underscore the value of the proposed model as a powerful tool for handling resource-constrained multi-project environments, advancing theoretical understanding and influencing project management practices.},

While probability theory deals with randomness, and we cope with imprecision using the theory of fuzzy sets, combining both these descriptions is neither straightforward nor simple. Even seemingly simple tasks, such as calculating the probability of an event for a fuzzy random variable, are not obvious. In this contribution, we propose a method of calculating probabilities related to the so-called LR fuzzy random variables. Besides indicating the general method, we show how, in situations where it is difficult to obtain an analytical solution, it is possible to determine the desired probability using numerical methods, referring to the Monte Carlo simulations. The considered approach is illustrated with examples, also based on the real-life dataset.},
