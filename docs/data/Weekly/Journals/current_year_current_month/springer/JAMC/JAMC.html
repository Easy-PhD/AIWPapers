  abstract     = {The finite element method (FEM) is an important tool for approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). The convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations describe the changes in substances in space and time. In this paper, we propose a $$\theta$$ -FEM framework with Wang-Ball elements for solving the CDR equations. The proposed approach integrates Wang-Ball basis functions for spatial discretization and a $$\theta$$ -difference scheme for temporal discretization. Stability analysis and error estimations in $$L^2$$ , $$H^1$$ -semi, $$L^\infty$$ norms are rigorously derived, demonstrating that the method is unconditionally stable for $$\frac{1}{2}\leq\theta\leq 1$$ . Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, showcasing the method’s effectiveness for Wang-Ball elements of degree $$q > 3$$ in both two- and three-dimensional domains.},

To address the nonsmoothness of functions, the functions involved are considered as directionally differentiable. Firstly, the robust necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are established under generalized univexity assumptions. For better comprehension of sufficiency results, an illustrative application is also provided. Further, a dual explored by a few authors: the Jagannathan type dual is formulated for the given primal problem. This dual has been explored due to its parametric form which can be solved with ease by a variety of computational approaches and hence, has potential applications in exploring various mathematical programming problems formulated in real life issues. Finally, the fundamental robust duality theorems namely weak, strong and strict converse duality are developed by employing the generalized univexity of the involved functions.},

When the parameter $$\varrho$$ equals 1, the generalized Caputo model simplifies to the classic Caputo model. To ensure the model’s reliability, its existence and uniqueness are validated using the Schauder and Banach fixed point theorems, while stability is assessed with the Ulam-Hyers criterion.

For spatial discretization, Chebyshev nodes are utilized as collocation points, and a hybrid methodology combining the alternating direction implicit scheme with collocation techniques is applied to address multi–dimensional problems. In irregular computational domains, the finite block method is adopted for two–dimensional DOTFPIDEs. The stability and convergence of the numerical schemes are rigorously analyzed, and computational experiments are conducted to validate their theoretical accuracy and efficiency.

The with-memory method is constructed by approximating the nonlinear function using a bivariate polynomial curve that satisfies certain tangency conditions at multiple points, effectively improving the convergence performance. A thorough local convergence analysis is conducted to validate the theoretical robustness of the approach. Moreover, the stability of the proposed method is investigated through a multidimensional dynamical analysis using fixed-point operators derived from various quadratic and cubic polynomials applied within the iterative method. The dynamical plane constructions associated with the method provide visual insights into its behavior, revealing convergence exclusively to the roots of the given polynomials. Numerical experiments on many standard test nonlinear problems confirm the method’s superior accuracy and efficiency compared to some existing techniques, confirming its applicability for broad application in scientific and engineering computations.},

In this paper, the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and the weights between the $$l_{1}$$ -norm and $$l_{0}$$ -norm terms in the model are discussed. A lower bound of decrements of the objective function is derived in terms of the difference of the reconstructed images for sufficiently large iteration numbers under certain conditions. It is further shown that there exists a subsequence of the reconstructed image sequence converging to a local minimizer. Numerical experiments demonstrate the reconstruction results by using different weights of the $$l_{0}$$ -norm term and lead to discussions on parameter selection.},

The choice of a TFPM is an attempt to work beyond accuracy by placing equitable emphasis on developing an accessible and simple algorithm. The method basically functions on an explicit 4-point centered stencil where the nodal solutions on the advanced temporal level are represented as the linear combination of nodal solutions on the preceding temporal level. The scalars involved are determined by the application of the fundamental set of solutions, obtained through the method of separation of variables, into the linear combination within each local cell constituted by the stencil, thereby inducing the pith of the localized exact solutions into the TFPM approximations. The methodology, founded upon the utilization of linear combinations, streamlines computations by obviating the necessity for intricate matrix calculations and inversions. The competence of the method is recognized through theoretical analyses of stability, consistency, and convergence complemented by numerical compatibility established through comparisons of solutions of standard examples with exact solutions and solutions from other methods in existing literature. The method extends the possibility of being accessed for other non-linear problems and higher dimensions.},

  abstract     = {This research proposes the numerical solution of the regularized long wave equation using the collocation method with redefined uniform hyperbolic polynomial B-spline as the basis function. The equation is discretized using the Crank-Nicolson method for spatial derivatives and the forward finite difference method for temporal derivatives. Furthermore, the non-linear terms are linearized using the quasilinearization method. The stability of the scheme is determined using the von Neumann method, revealing that the proposed approach is unconditionally stable. The method’s convergence is analyzed through theoretical investigation and numerical experimentation, and it is found to exhibit second order convergence. The method’s versatility is demonstrated by generating single solitary waves, including their interactions in pairs and triads, and the evolution of the Maxwellian initial condition into solitary waves. The three conservation constants are computed and discovered to be closely parallel to the analytical values. Additionally, the convergence of the numerical solution to the exact solution is assessed by calculating the $${L_2}$$ and $${L_\infty }$$ error norms. The conservation quantities and error norms obtained using the proposed scheme are compared with the outcomes discovered in the literature. The conservation laws reveal that the solitary waves maintain temporal and spatial translational symmetry during propagation, whereas the error norms indicate that the proposed technique provides highly accurate approximate solutions compared to existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the collocation method with redefined uniform hyperbolic polynomial B-spline basis function has been applied to solve the regularized long wave equation. This novel approach provides accurate approximate solutions, making it a promising framework for solving other non-linear partial differential equations.},

  abstract     = {In this work, we present an innovative linear relaxation explicit-invariant energy quadratization (EIEQ) scheme, which is specially designed to solve Allen-Cahn (AC) and Cahn-Hilliard (CH) type models. This strategy can be simply called LR-EIEQ scheme. By introducing a quadratic auxiliary variable, the original model is transformed into an equivalent formulation. Furthermore, by harnessing the “zero energy contribution” (ZEC) property, we introduce a non-local auxiliary variable specifically designed to tackle the nonlinear coupling variables. The newly devised method distinguishes itself from traditional invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) or scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches in that it eliminates the need to refactor nonlinear functions into the product of two quadratic functions. Rather, it facilitates a more straightforward reconstruction of the nonlinear terms. Next, we develop distinct numerical algorithms for both models, employing the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF-2) and Crank-Nicolson (CN) formula. We meticulously prove the energy stability and unique solvability of the proposed schemes, and clearly demonstrate the decoupling of the numerical solution. Through a sophisticated splitting technique, the non-local auxiliary variable effectively decouples all variables within the equivalent model, resulting in multiple linear systems. During each iteration of the time-stepping process, only a minimal number of these linear systems need to be solved, thereby achieving complete decoupling of the variables and markedly boosting computational efficiency. Subsequent numerical simulation tests further validate the stability and reliability of the developed algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Graph construction is a powerful tool for solving complex problems across various fields of computer science and computational intelligence. When dealing with uncertainty, fuzzy graph structures are preferred over crisp graph structures, as they effectively represent the inherent uncertainty within a network. To better capture vague and imprecise concepts, the ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-rung orthopair fuzzy set serves as a highly effective framework, as its models provide greater flexibility than other fuzzy models when handling human judgment data. In this paper, we introduce a new framework, referred to as ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-rung orthopair fuzzy graphs (( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs), by integrating the concept of graphs with ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-rung orthopair fuzzy sets. The key advantage of this framework is that it meets the demands of certain applications that cannot be effectively modeled using previous approaches to handling uncertainty, as they either require equal degrees of uncertainty (such as IFSs, PFSs, and q-ROFSs) or impose restrictions on the powers of uncertainty degrees through fixed parameter values $$n$$ and $$m$$ (as in (2,1)-FSs and (3,2)-FSs). We start by introducing the degree and whole degree of a vertex in ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs, and illustrate their significance using road networks. Understanding the degree and whole degree of a vertex also provides insight into the characteristics of product operations on ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs. Building on this, we define the strong product and $$*$$ -product as product operations on ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs. These operations become particularly useful when dealing with a large number of ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs. We also introduce the concept of vertex degree and whole degree in the strong product and $$*$$ -product, and establish general theorems concerning the degree and whole degree of ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs under the proposed product operations, and provide several numerical examples to illustrate the introduced concepts. Furthermore, we explore an application of the degree and whole degree of the $$*$$ -product of two ( $$n$$ , $$m$$ )-ROFGs in multi-criteria decision-making concerning the selection of the most likely team to compete in games and using optimal performance measures. Finally, we make comparisons to highlight the shortcomings of previous techniques in modeling certain practical cases that are effectively addressed by our approach, as well as we discuss the minor limitations of the proposed method associated with excessively large values of $$n$$ and $$m$$ that can generally be mitigated by selecting moderate settings that better reflect typical decision-making contexts.},

Sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium points are established using the Laplace transform, discrete fractional analysis, and Mittag-Leffler functions. Furthermore, the fractional Lyapunov method is employed to derive stability and synchronization criteria within the drive-response framework.

This paper employs contraction mapping in Banach spaces to validate the TE-U of a certain class of M-fractional SDDMs driven by SBM. For this aim, we establish some suitable Lipschitz constraints on the drift and the diffusion coefficients and employ a weighted normed space based on the space $${\text{{\rm H}}}p$$ for $$p \geqslant 2$$ . For convenience, BDGI estimates the stochastic terms in the desired proofs. The theoretical findings are followed by constructing a numerical step spectral method to provide approximate solutions to the suggested models. In this method, we organize steps to deal with the delay terms in subintervals, and the desired approximations in each subinterval are obtained using a collocation spectral mechanism, where the test functions are the orthogonal SLPs in which the problem is condensed into a group of computational simultaneous equations. For the stochastic term, the quantities of the SBM paths are assessed with the MATHEMATICA program. Moreover, the convergence study is confirmed for the presented approach to capture the behavior of approximations. Ultimately, applications of various forms are solved and shown in terms of tables, figures, and notations, whilst the obtained results emphasize the accuracy and validity of the constructed algorithm steps. The eloquent method formulation indicates the ability to use it in solving other types of fractional stochastic delay differential models that appear in various scientific and engineering domains.},

SAMDAM employs simple mirror descent ascent steps along with momentum acceleration to update the variables $$x$$ and $$y$$ alternately at each iteration. We further prove that SAMDAM achieves a gradient complexity of $$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{3}\epsilon^{-4})$$ for finding an $$\epsilon$$ -stationary point in stochastic nonconvex settings, where $$\kappa$$ represents the condition number of the problem.

This hybrid method leverages Haar wavelets in conjunction with the finite difference method to provide robust numerical solutions. It is expertly designed for both linear and nonlinear models, adeptly handling constant or variable coefficients across regular interfaces. At the heart of this technique is the approximation of spatial derivatives using truncated Haar series, while time derivatives are efficiently processed through the finite difference method. The methodology has been rigorously tested across a variety of linear and nonlinear models, demonstrating its effectiveness. In linear problems, the algebraic system is solved with precision using the Gauss elimination method. For nonlinear challenges, the Quasi-Newton linearization formula is applied to successfully eliminate non-linearity from the model. To evaluate the technique’s performance, we analyze key metrics such as maximum absolute errors, root mean square errors, and computational convergence rates with varying numbers of collocation points. The proposed approach consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in situations involving abrupt changes in the solution space or discontinuities between boundary and initial conditions, delivering stable solutions in these critical scenarios. The combination of strong theoretical foundations and computational stability, along with excellent convergence rates and comprehensive numerical studies, firmly validates the accuracy and versatility of this method, confirming its wide range of applications.},

Numerically, we implement the $$\text{L1}$$ scheme to approximate the Caputo fractional derivative of order $$\alpha\in(0,1)$$ and the finite difference method for the discretization of the space derivative. Meanwhile, a linearly implicit technique is introduced for the nonlinear logistical function $$f(y)=r y (1-y)$$ . With the investigation on the solvability and positivity of the numerical solutions unconditionally, it is shown that one solution bounds the numerical solutions above. Further, we investigate that the numerical approach is capable of accurately capturing the long-time behavior of the original problems without any step-size restrictions. Finally, numerical examples that are in line with these results are presented to support the theoretical approach, including numerical simulations for large values of $$r$$ .},

  abstract     = {This paper is devoted to time-space finite element analysis for time-space fractional parabolic problems with spectral fractional Laplacian under weak regularity assumptions. First, a discrete spectral fractional Laplacian is introduced based on matrix transfer technique on quasi-uniform meshes, and time-space finite element discrete scheme for time-space fractional parabolic problem is established using continuous time Petrov-Galerkin method and spatially conforming finite element method. In order to capture the weak singular behavior of the exact solution and improve the global convergence order of the discrete scheme, time-stepping finite element scheme is implemented on graded meshes. Afterwards, the well-posedness of the approximate solutions is discussed based on the continuity and coercivity given by Caputo derivative. In addition, the convergence analysis of the fully discrete scheme under weak regularity conditions is investigated by means of time-space projection estimates and consistency error estimate. Finally, a fast time-stepping finite element scheme is designed and numerical examples are provided to validate our theoretical results. Numerical experiments show that the error order is better than the present theoretical analysis and the use of graded meshes does improve the global numerical accuracy.},

Analytically, we derive a threshold quantity $$\kappa_0$$ , which determines whether kidney failure/infection will occur. Our analysis reveals the presence of transcritical bifurcation as $$\kappa_0$$ crosses unity, signaling a shift in the stability of system’s equilibria and highlighting conditions for effective control of diabetes and kidney disease. Further, sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential parameters affecting the number of individuals at risk of kidney complications. The model is extended to include two time-dependent controls, designed to reduce the prevalence of both diabetic and kidney-related complications. To analyze the optimal control problem, Pontryagin’s Maximum Principle is applied, whereas the forward-backward sweep method is utilized to compute its solutions. Our analysis highlights that web-based advertising interventions are significantly more effective than word-of-mouth communication alone in the diabetes and kidney disease. Moreover, the comparison of the impacts of the two control strategies provides insights for targeted public health interventions.},

  abstract     = {To address the synchronization challenges caused by dynamic links, inter-cluster delays, and topological uncertainties in complex dynamical networks (CDNs), this paper proposes a control framework integrating clustering and adaptive coordination. Unlike traditional methods that require predefined cluster numbers and rely on constant coupling matrices, we employ the spectral clustering algorithm to split networks into user-defined clusters and introduce dynamic links to characterize node coupling interactions, overcoming the inflexibility of conventional models in scenarios such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations and communication networks. A unified state equation is adopted for node dynamics, reducing the complexity of predefined independent equations for each cluster in traditional multi-cluster modeling. In the control strategy, dynamic links act both as node coupling media and as control targets. Specifically, intra-cluster dynamic links track predefined topologies via adaptive controllers, while inter-cluster uncertain links are stabilized within bounded ranges through adaptive update laws. The asymptotic stability of CDNs is rigorously proven by using a composite Lyapunov function that integrates tracking errors of node states and coupling links. A simulation of UAV formation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves on-demand clustering, with UAV flight parameters (node states) and intra-cluster communication strengths (intra-cluster links) asymptotically converging to desired trajectories, while inter-cluster interactions (inter-cluster link) remain controllable. This framework provides a flexible, stable, and universal theoretical solution for cluster synchronization in CDNs.},

  abstract     = {This paper examines the problem of interdicting the minimum $$st$$ -cut, which can be viewed as a Stackelberg game with two types of players: evaders and interdictors. The goal of the evaders is to sever any connection between two crucial points by destroying certain links. They aim to find the minimum-cost cut to achieve this. Meanwhile, the interdictors, who are aware of the evaders’ objective, want to increase the cost of link destruction as much as possible. They can fortify the links to achieve this objective. This paper specifically focuses on the case where the cost of fortifying each link follows a convex piecewise-linear function. To tackle this problem, two polynomial-time algorithms are proposed. The first algorithm converts the problem into a root-finding problem involving a convex piecewise-linear function. It then employs a discrete-type Newton method to find the root in a finite number of iterations. The second algorithm is a modified version of the well-known successive shortest path algorithm. In order to assess the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conduct computational experiments and compare them with a previous approach, which deals with linear costs. The results clearly demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the previous one in terms of speed and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, pose a significant global health burden, progressively impairing cognitive and motor functions. The complex interplay between neuronal health, immune response, and pathological protein accumulation necessitates advanced mathematical modeling for better understanding and intervention strategies. In order to analyze brain diseases, we have developed a five-compartment nonlinear mathematical model to observe the dynamics and focuses on extracellular $$\alpha$$ -synuclein function, functioning neurons, infected neurons, activated microglia density, and $$T$$ -cells, which may contribute to neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative contexts. Since our model hasn’t been put forth in the literature before, it is novel. In addition, we modified the recently created model by adding fractional order derivatives to better comprehend the relationship between immune response dynamics and neuronal health in brain disorders. To better comprehend these intricate processes and advance medical therapies, our study combines novel mathematical methods with computer simulations. Stability analysis confirms the existence of a feasible disease-free equilibrium. In contrast, sensitivity analysis highlights the critical influence of parameters such as neuron production $$(\Pi_N)$$ , infection rate $$(\gamma)$$ , and microglial activation $$(\Theta)$$ . Numerical simulations reveal that lower fractional orders $$(\nu < 1)$$ slow disease progression, indicating the long-term impact of neuroinflammatory feedback mechanisms. To assess the computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed fractional-order model, we compare numerical solutions obtained using the Lagrange interpolation method and the ODE45 solver. The results demonstrate that the Lagrange interpolation method exhibits superior accuracy and stability in capturing the long-term behavior of neurodegenerative progression, whereas ODE45, a classical numerical approach, struggles with fractional dynamics due to its dependence on integer-order derivatives. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and offer a framework for exploring targeted therapeutic strategies. By refining fractional-order parameters and integrating real-world clinical data, future research can enhance the predictive power of these models, aiding in early diagnosis and optimized treatment strategies for neurodegenerative disorders.},
