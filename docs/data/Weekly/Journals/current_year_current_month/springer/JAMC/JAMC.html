  abstract     = {The graph partitioning problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formulate a 0-1 quadratic integer programming model for the graph partitioning problem with vertex weight constraints and fixed vertex constraints, and propose a recursive bipartition algorithm based on the subspace minimization conjugate gradient method. To alleviate the difficulty of solving the model, the constrained problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization problem using equilibrium terms, elimination methods, and trigonometric properties, and solved via an accelerated subspace minimization conjugate gradient algorithm. Initial feasible partitions are generated using a hyperplane rounding algorithm, followed by heuristic refinement strategies, including one-neighborhood and two-interchange adjustments, to iteratively improve the results. Numerical experiments on knapsack-constrained graph partitioning and industrial examples demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract     = {Cervical cancer is a prevalent cancer, caused by persistent HPV infection and poses a severe danger to public health worldwide. The transition from HPV infection to cervical cancer is a protracted process, typically spanning many years, and is hereby referred to as the cancerous delay. To take into account the impact of the cancerous delay in transmission between HPV and cervical cancer, we develop a delayed model that correlates HPV and cervical cancer to investigate the transmission behavior of HPV. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence and stability of equilibria. Then, we identify the existence of Hopf bifurcation, which is induced by the cancerous delay, and discuss its properties, subsequently estimate the duration of delay which maintains the stability of bifurcating periodic solutions. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate an optimal control model. Then, we modify the forward–backward sweep method for the non-delayed model which further addresses the optimal control problem for the delayed model. The results reveal that a comprehensive strategy combining pharmacological interventions with non-pharmacological approaches is the most effective method for controlling the disease. Ultimately, we utilize numerical simulations to substantiate the validity of our theoretical results.},

The novel MDADETS is proposed, which can dynamically adjust the event triggering frequency according to the control requirements of the agent, thus can further reduce the status signals reaching the actuator. At the same time, the multiple discrete Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with time-varying matrices is used to reduce the uncertainty brought to the agent at the switching instant, making the increment of LKF less than 1 at the switching instant, thereby reducing the conservatism of MASs. Then, it is proved that the Zeno phenomenon with MDADETS will not occur, which ensures the effectiveness of the novel scheme. Then based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) we can deduce the sufficient conditions for H∞ global asymptotic consensus, and obtain parameters such as controller gain and trigger matrix. Finally, numerical simulation is used to verify the operability and superiority of the novel scheme, as well as the effectiveness of the discrete LKF method used in this problem.},

We introduce the Connectivity Number (CN) as a novel and computationally efficient metric to assess network robustness. CN quantifies the minimum strength of connectedness for any vertex in a fuzzy graph $$\mathcal{G} = (\nu, \mu)$$ , identifying the weakest links that influence overall stability. Theoretical properties of CN are established in various fuzzy graph structures, including strong fuzzy graphs, fuzzy cycles, and complete fuzzy graphs. We further investigate the behavior of CN under six fundamental fuzzy graph operations: Cartesian product, normal product, tensor product, composition, lexicographic max product, and lexicographic min product, revealing critical insights into connectivity in composite structures. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of CN by applying it to a mobile communication network, where it effectively identifies weak connections and informs optimization strategies. Compared to existing indices such as the Wiener index (WI) and the connectivity index (CI), CN provides a simpler and more direct measure of connectivity weaknesses, making it a valuable tool for network optimization, resilience analysis, and decision-making. Future research will explore CN in dynamic fuzzy graphs, examine its stability under network perturbations, and develop efficient algorithms for large-scale applications.},

Recognizing the limitations of traditional techniques, such as slow convergence and high computational cost, we develop new third-, fourth-, and sixth-order iterative schemes to significantly improve convergence behavior and solution accuracy. The novelty of this work lies in the extension of the classical ADM framework to construct higher-order methods without resorting to linearization or perturbation techniques. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, a detailed comparative study is conducted against existing higher-order iterative approaches. The comparison is made in terms of convergence order, number of iterations, computational effort, and accuracy through a series of numerical examples drawn from real-world models in population dynamics, fluid flow, and chemical kinetics. The results clearly demonstrate that the new methods outperform their counterparts, offering faster convergence and reduced computational costs while maintaining high accuracy. These advances have substantial potential to improve simulations and predictive modeling in various fields, including physics, engineering, environmental science, and biomedical applications.},

Illustrative examples are provide to obtain theoretical results. Inspired by the interaction between reduced form and structural credit models, we suggest modeling the firm value process as a time-varying Bm that could incorporate stochastic volatility effects and leaps as well as to examine the first passage issue for these kinds of procedures.

By adopting an innovative combination of large shrinkage mappings and Chatterjea-type mappings, the paper builds upon established theoretical foundations to develop a novel analytical and numerical framework for investigating the influence of time delays in fractional epidemic models. With the aim of linking these findings to real-world applications, a numerical simulation framework is presented to study the dynamics of a generalized fractional-delay epidemic system, incorporating time-dependent effects that influence disease transmission and stability. By incorporating Caputo’s fractional derivative, the results reveal the impact of time delays, such as incubation periods, and fractional dynamics on disease transmission and stability in the system. These results shed light on the complex interactions between time delays and the fractal properties of the system, providing a comprehensive approach to modeling evolving temporal behaviors in epidemiology.},

We analyze the stability and direction of Hopf bifurcation, primarily influenced by delays, through normal form theory and the centre manifold theorem. In all delay scenarios, we examine the local stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium points. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number (BRN). The model incorporates control measures such as educational campaigns, hospital bed availability, and immunity enhancements. To formulate an optimal control problem aimed at identifying the most effective strategy for minimizing costs, we apply Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Finally, we propose the optimization problem and discuss the control strategy designed to minimize disease outbreaks and control costs.

This study proposes a predator-prey system with a Holling type-II functional response, incorporating prey vigilance behavior to avoid predation, as well as hunting cooperation among predators. The dynamics of the system are analyzed through the examination of the existence and stability of equilibrium points, bifurcation analysis, and the impact of time delays, including maturation delay, gestation delay, and incubation delay. The study investigates the effects of hunting cooperation and prey vigilance on the model. The results show that while hunting cooperation can destabilize the system, prey vigilance has a stabilizing effect. The novelty of this work lies in its exploration of the combined impact of multiple time delays, prey vigilance, and hunting cooperation. The analysis begins by studying the effects of each time delay individually. Maturation delay, denoted as $$\tau_1$$ , exhibits switching behavior, causing the system to alternate between stable and unstable states. In the absence of hunting cooperation, the time delay $$\tau_1$$ destabilizes the model through Hopf bifurcation, leading to chaotic behavior. But in the presence of both hunting behavior and prey-vigilance, the model shows the switching behavior through Hopf bifurcation about the time delay parameters $$\tau_1$$ and $$\tau_2$$ . Also obtained the periodic doubling and chaos about the incubation delay $$\tau_3$$ for the model.},

  abstract     = {Classical graph theory is poorly able to handle the fuzziness in graphs. Therefore, fuzzy graph theory was developed to deal with the problem. However, fuzzy graph theory is unable to control the granularity of information in fuzzy directed graphs (FDGs), which may lead to the misclassification. Rough sets theory (RST) has been proven to be capable of discovering knowledge from graph data. Thus, RST was introduced into FDGs to form rough fuzzy directed graphs (RFDGs), which can address the misclassification problem. Nonetheless, there is a lack of theoretical basis on the effectiveness of RST in handling fuzziness in graphs. Thus, this paper first explores the theoretical relationships between generalized RST and fuzzy graph theory, based on the mutual representations between fuzzy binary relations and FDGs. Then the theoretical equivalences between approximation operators in generalized RST and fuzzy notions in FDGs are investigated. Secondly, fuzzy strongly connected components (FSCCs) are characterized using RST approximation operators based on the found equivalences. Thirdly, FSCCs are generalized to RFSCCs in RFDGs, which are more effective in handling fuzzy problems than FDGs. An algorithm based on RST approximation operators is developed to efficiently compute RFSCCs in RFDGs. Experiments show that it outperforms existing algorithms in computational efficiency. Especially for the Baltic ecological network, our study can use the found RFSCCs in RFDGs to effectively reveal stable energy flow communities.},

Topological indices, similar to the mathematical modeling of the toxicological, pharmacological, physicochemical, and other characteristics of chemical compounds, are extensively utilized in chemical research. Numerous topological indices have been defined in the literature according to degree, distance, spectrum etc. We examine the Euler Sombor index which is defined as $$EP(G) = \sum\limits_{uv \in E(G)} \sqrt {{{\left( {{d_G}(u)} \right)}^2} + {{\left( {{d_G}(v)} \right)}^2} + {d_G}(u){d_G}(v)},$$ where $${d_G}(u)$$ and $${d_G}(v)$$ denote the degrees of $$u$$ and $$v$$ , respectively.

We analyze the correlation for the Euler Sombor index with other established indices utilizing linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso, elastic net, exponential, and logarithmic regressions. Furthermore, we examine the chemical relevance of the Euler Sombor index concerning the isomers of octane.},

In particular, we construct $$(1,k)$$ -overlap-free codes where $$k \geq n/2$$ and n denotes the block size, expand a known construction of $$(k,n-1)$$ -overlap-free codes, and combine the ideas behind both constructions to obtain $$(t_1,t_2)$$ -overlap-free codes and codes that are simultaneously $$(1,k)$$ - and $$(n-k,n-1)$$ -overlap-free for some $$k < n/2$$ . In the case when overlaps of lengths between 1 and k are prohibited, we complete the characterisation of non-expandable codes initiated by Cai, Wang, and Feng (IEEE Trans Inf Theory, 2023).},

  abstract     = {Overfitting and slow convergence are common problems when using the gradient descent method in neural network training. We use regularization and momentum terms, respectively, to reduce these negative phenomena. In this paper, we consider the convergence of the gradient descent method with smoothing L0 regularization and an adaptive momentum term. The objective function for normal L0 regularization is the sum of a function that is not convex, smooth, or Lipschitz. This makes the error function and the norm of the gradient oscillate. This impediment prevents neural networks from achieving optimal measurement rates for application verification. However, we can address the deficiency of the normal L0 regularization term by using the smoothing approximation techniques. This paper presents the results of weak convergence for smooth L0 regularization using the adaptive momentum method. Furthermore, we have proven the strong convergence results of the theorems. Simulations based on three learning problems—parity problems, function approximation problems, and classification tasks—illustrate the viability of the suggested approach under these circumstances. The suggested approach assumes the momentum coefficient, regularization parameter, and learning rate to be constants. We selected these problems because their unique error surfaces provide an appropriate setting for evaluating the efficacy of the suggested approach. Simulation examples demonstrate the superiority of the suggested algorithm and bolster the theoretical analysis.},

The structure-property relationship of chemical compounds can be numerically revealed using topological indices, eliminating the need for wet laboratory testing. Given its strong correlation with molecular properties and activities, the inverse symmetric division degree index (ISDD) is a well-established measure. In this work, we begin with mathematical exploration of its exponential variant (EISDD). The lower and upper bounds of EISDD for various families of graphs, including general connected graphs, trees, and bipartite graphs, are estimated. Corresponding extremal graphs are also examined. Finally, the role of the EISDD index in structure-property relationship modelling is analysed. The EISDD index is found to model different properties of octanes and some medicinal chemicals with significant accuracy.},

Therefore, the time-stepping scheme in stable generalized finite element method (SGFEM) has to be treated carefully. The complexity and precision of algorithms are important considerations when addressing problems with moving interfaces. This paper aims at proposing a robust, efficient, and high-precision numerical scheme for solving one-dimensional parabolic problems with moving interfaces. The discrete scheme is derived by using the Crank-Nicolson scheme or central difference scheme in temporal direction, while employing the modified SGFEM in spatial direction, in which an exponential enrichment function is utilized. The proposed methods reduce the complexity of the spatial discretization and decreases the number of degrees of freedom as compared to the corrected extended finite element method (XFEM), and it has a second-order convergence rate in both the temporal and spatial directions with respect to the $$\boldsymbol{L^2}$$ norm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the optimal $$\boldsymbol{L^2}$$ convergence for the proposed algorithms. The numerical results also show that the proposed algorithms are free from the ratio of the time step to the spatial mesh parameter, and possess the capability to capture the weak discontinuities of moving interface problems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we introduce a alteration of Stepanova’s mathematical model for tumor growth under immunological activity. We justify this modification because the tumor cells possess memory and heritable traits, and the mathematical model of tumor cells under immunity response reveals richer dynamic behaviors, such as chaos. Therefore, we first consider the Stepanova tumor model incorporating fractional order differential equations with piecewise constant arguments and then obtain a system of difference equations. The discrete model has three equilibrium points such as a tumor-free equilibrium point and two positive equilibrium points defined as benign and malignant case. In the malignant case, the positive equilibrium point is always unstable, while the other equilibrium points are locally asymptotically stable under some algebraic conditions. In addition, we show that the parameters tumor stimulated proliferation rate µI, rate of influx κ, fractional order parameter α and discretization parameter h have a crucial impact on the dynamic structure of the system. The occurrence of the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, signifying the presence of quasi-periodic solutions, for tumor cells is established in the system as these parameters are modified. The numerically calculated bifurcation points give the threshold values for controlling the growth of tumor cell densities. Chaotic behavior is associated with structures resulting from the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation and can be analyzed with the Lyapunov exponent. Furthermore, we apply chaos control techniques like state feedback and hybrid control to mitigate chaotic behavior within the tumor-immune system. Thus, it is shown that the model successfully describes different dynamic behaviors such as uncontrolled tumor growth, tumor dormant state and tumor remission in the tumor-effector interaction.},

Then we designed algorithms for computing these two decompositions along with the Moore-Penrose inverse and outer inverse of the tensors. Numerical examples are discussed in support of these theoretical results. In addition, we derive exact expressions for the outer inverses of tensors using a symbolic tensor (tensors with polynomial entries) computation.

  abstract     = {The Mittag-Leffler fractional derivative operator, whose kernel consists of a combination of the exponential law and the power law, has been usefully used in applications of fractional calculus. In this paper, we suggest a two-parameter Mittag-Leffler type fractional derivative model. The new definition generalizes the Mittag-Leffler fractional derivative with a rich variety of behaviors for derivatives as it introduces a fractional derivative with respect to two orders. We formulate the corresponding fractional integral. Then, we present a singular kernel extension of the proposed two-parameter Mittag-Leffler type fractional derivative. Moreover, we discuss some features and relationships of the proposed operators and provide solutions for some initial value problems involving the studied fractional derivatives. Next, we depict the dynamic behavior of a nonlinear model involving the proposed extended Mittag-Leffler type fractional derivative through numerical simulations. The benefit of the extended version is that it can provide useful insights into the modeling problem so that it overcomes the drawbacks of the non-singular kernel version.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the Local Discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method has been successfully applied to solve various reaction-diffusion problems characterized by boundary layers. To achieve uniform convergence in the small perturbation parameter $$\varepsilon $$ , layer-adapted meshes of Shishkin-type along with their variants, have been frequently combined with the numerical schemes. However, limited convergence results have been reported for the LDG method applied to graded meshes. These meshes, generated through recursive formulae, present a compelling alternative, especially they are less sensitive to variations in $$\varepsilon $$ , which determines the mesh structure and the solution behavior. In the present paper, we investigate the convergence of the LDG method on two Duran-type meshes: the Duran-Shishkin mesh and the Duran mesh. We derive optimal-order error estimates if the logarithmic factor is neglected. These results, appearing in the literature for the first time, open up new possibilities for the application of the LDG method with graded meshes in solving problems with boundary layers. Numerical results confirm that our theoretical estimates are sharp.},

  abstract     = {In complex and uncertain environment, Multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) remains a significant challenge, particularly when existing MADM techniques struggle to differentiate between the preference orders (POs) of the alternatives. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel technique for MADM within the context of $$p, q$$ -quasirung orthopair fuzzy numbers ( $$p, q$$ -QOFNs). To achieve this, we first develop a novel possibility degree measure (PDM) to compare different $$p, q$$ -QOFNs and provide some notable characteristics. In the process of aggregating information, Schweizer-Sklar norms offer greater flexibility. To fully utilize the advantages of these norms, we propose new operational laws for $$p, q$$ -QOFNs based on these norms. Then, by using the proposed operations, we propose the $$p, q$$ -quasirung orthopair fuzzy Schweizer-Sklar weighted arithmetic ( $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWA) and geometric ( $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWG) aggregation operator (AO). Also, we discuss some properties of the proposed $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWA AO and $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWG AO. Finally, we develop a novel MADM technique for $$p, q$$ -QOFNs incorporating the proposed PDM and the $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWA AO and $$p, q$$ -QOFSSWG AO. In order to showcase the efficacy and superiority of the proposed MADM technique, we provide numerical examples. These examples illustrate that the new MADM technique effectively addresses the limitations of existing MADM techniques, particularly in situations where they are unable to differentiate between the POs of the alternatives.},

Our study investigates the underlying issue by considering a simple yet new colorectal cancer model incorporating cetuximab administration with the effect of memory, and considering average human body’s measurement. An analytical solution of the system is found using the Sumudu transform. Also, using Hilbert and Banach space theories, an analysis was performed for a generalized form of unique and Picard $$\mathcal{H}$$ -stable analytical solution. The proposed model explores the uniqueness of solutions, transcritical bifurcation, and Ulam-Hyers stability. Some new biological insights in terms of fractional parameters are suggested. Finally, numerical simulations for the dynamics of medical therapy in eradicating malignancy are depicted for various fractional and fractal dimensions. The necessity of the cetuximab drug is also highlighted together with the proliferation of the effector cells. The analysis provides new bio-mathematical understandings that guarantee the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions by illuminating critical criteria for system stability. One of the major significances of the proposed model is predicting the consistency of the treatment by carrying the numerical simulations for the model.},

  abstract     = {In an optimal control strategy, an important point is to define the cost of the control. Usually it is added to the control criterion and multiplied by a small coefficient denoted by ɛ which is known as the marginal cost of the control. The key idea of this paper, is to introduce a smoothing term in the control cost which aims at reducing the quantity of energy spent and reducing the oscillations of the control. Then using a so-called asymptotic control based on the smallness of ɛ, we construct an exact control which can be implemented in a close loop. The energy involved in the control depends mainly on the variation of the control. Therefore it seems natural to include this quantity (the total variations) in the criterion involved in the optimal control. This can be done approximately by introducing the L1 norm of the first order derivative of the control. The control strategy that we develop in this paper can be applied to such linear models. One important and new point is that we focus on exact control strategies for a non-differentiable criterion because of the cost of the control. Following the ideas of Tykhonov regularization method, it is proved using the so-called asymptotic method based on the smallness of the marginal cost of the control, that the exact control suggested is the one which represents the minimum of the marginal cost among exact controls. Furthermore, and it is the main technical point, it can reduce the variations of the control with an adequate tuning of the various parameters of the control loop. We test the method on three examples. The first one concerns an elementary case just to show that the algorithm works on a reference situation. The second one is the control of flight of a flying boat with foils. We describe in the appendix the mechanical model which can be instable because of a negative damping. The third example concerns the America’s cup boat Luna Rossa.},

The number of infections in people aged 15 years and older accounts for 97.5% of all cases. Vaccination is the most effective way of reducing the risk of disease transmission. It is essential to assess the role of vaccination or booster vaccination in adult populations. In this paper, the hepatitis B cases data in different age groups were analyzed, an age heterogeneous hepatitis B transmission dynamics model including multiple age groups and vaccination was established. Fitting the cumulative case data of hepatitis B and obtaining the model parameters. Sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R0 shows that vaccination of the population aged 25–70 can significantly reduce the number of hepatitis B cases. Exploring the impact of different vaccination immunization strategies on the number of hepatitis B cases, we get that it is the most effective to vaccinate people aged 15–70, which can reduce the cumulative number of hepatitis B cases by about 60%. Only reducing the contact between people does not help to significantly reduce the number of hepatitis B cases, but vaccination helps to greatly reduce the number of hepatitis B cases.},
