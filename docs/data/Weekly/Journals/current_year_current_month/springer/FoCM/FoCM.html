The operator is stable as a mapping from the trace space of $$W^{s, p}(K)$$ to $$W^{s, p}(K)$$ for all $$p \in (1, \infty )$$ and $$s \in (k+1/p, \infty )$$ . Moreover, if the data is the trace of a polynomial of degree $$N \in {\mathbb {N}}_0$$ , then the resulting lifting is a polynomial of degree N. One consequence of the analysis is a novel characterization for the range of the trace operator.},

  abstract     = {Classically, the continuous-time Langevin diffusion converges exponentially fast to its stationary distribution $$\pi $$ under the sole assumption that $$\pi $$ satisfies a Poincaré inequality. Using this fact to provide guarantees for the discrete-time Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, however, is considerably more challenging due to the need for working with chi-squared or Rényi divergences, and prior works have largely focused on strongly log-concave targets. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantees for LMC assuming that $$\pi $$ satisfies either a Latała–Oleszkiewicz or modified log-Sobolev inequality, which interpolates between the Poincaré and log-Sobolev settings. Unlike prior works, our results allow for weak smoothness and do not require convexity or dissipativity conditions.},

However, a mean-field analysis reveals that the gradient flow corresponding to the SVGD algorithm (i.e., the Stein Variational Gradient Flow) only provides a constant-order approximation to the Wasserstein gradient flow corresponding to the KL-divergence minimization. In this work, we propose the Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow, which interpolates between the Stein Variational Gradient Flow and the Wasserstein gradient flow. We establish various theoretical properties of the Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow (and its time-discretization) including convergence to equilibrium, existence and uniqueness of weak solutions, and stability of the solutions. We provide preliminary numerical evidence of the improved performance offered by the regularization.},

Relative Betti diagrams encode the multiplicities of these functors in minimal relative resolutions.

  abstract     = {Regularization is necessary when solving inverse problems to ensure the well-posedness of the solution map. Additionally, it is desired that the chosen regularization strategy is convergent in the sense that the solution map converges to a solution of the noise-free operator equation. This provides an important guarantee that stable solutions can be computed for all noise levels and that solutions satisfy the operator equation in the limit of vanishing noise. In recent years, reconstructions in inverse problems are increasingly approached from a data-driven perspective. Despite empirical success, the majority of data-driven approaches do not provide a convergent regularization strategy. One such popular example is given by iterative plug-and-play (PnP) denoising using off-the-shelf image denoisers. These usually provide only convergence of the PnP iterates to a fixed point, under suitable regularity assumptions on the denoiser, rather than convergence of the method as a regularization technique, thatis under vanishing noise and regularization strength. This paper serves two purposes: first, we provide an overview of the classical regularization theory in inverse problems and survey a few notable recent data-driven methods that are provably convergent regularization schemes. We then continue to discuss PnP algorithms and their established convergence guarantees. Subsequently, we consider PnP algorithms with learned linear denoisers and propose a novel spectral filtering technique of the denoiser to control the strength of regularization. Further, by relating the implicit regularization of the denoiser to an explicit regularization functional, we are the first to rigorously show that PnP with a learned linear denoiser leads to a convergent regularization scheme. The theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments for the classical inverse problem of tomographic image reconstruction.},
