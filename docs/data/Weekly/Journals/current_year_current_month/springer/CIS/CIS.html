  abstract     = {Although the cloud-based commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and cutting-edge zero-shot learning abilities on a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance on Named Entity Recognition (NER) is still significantly below supervised baselines. While NER in the universal domain has achieved remarkable success, NER in specialized industries continues to face challenges due to the scarcity of data and computational resource. To address these issues, this study proposes "SMALLM", a novel NER framework that integrates a local BERT-based model to augment the performance of the state-of-the-art LLM, ChatGPT, in an end-to-end manner. By leveraging both the strengths of the small model and the LLM, SMALLM acts as a domain expert through few-shot learning. SMALLM updates only hundreds of thousands of parameters in the local BERT-based model with minimal training data. This significantly reduces computational demands, enables fast training and minimizes reliance on data. Additionally, our framework provides a solution to the constraints posed by closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT converting their responses into one-hot vectors for subsequent optimization and integration. Through experiments on three industrial Chinese NER (CNER) datasets—Construction, CCKS2019- Military, and CCKS2020-Clinic—SMALLM enhances the performance of ChatGPT, achieving improvements of 28.80%, 13.48%, and 48.37%, respectively. Additionally, SMALLM consistently surpasses mainstream models in low-resource settings.},

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction is a critical process for enhancing software quality by identifying potential defects early in the development lifecycle. Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP) broadens traditional defect prediction methods by leveraging data from source projects to predict defects in target projects. However, existing CPDP methods face two key issues: insufficient feature representation and inadequate alignment of data distributions between source and target projects. To address these challenges, this study introduces TriStage-CPDP, a novel three-stage framework. In the first stage, TriStage-CPDP harnesses the capabilities of CodeT5+ to extract nuanced semantic and syntactic features, combines GraphSAGE for software dependency representation, and incorporates traditional metrics to construct a comprehensive feature set, enabling a more nuanced representation of software features. The second stage employs an integrated feature selection strategy that combines Last Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to refine feature relevance and eliminate redundancy effectively. Finally, a domain adaptation mechanism based on Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) aligns data distributions between source and target projects in a shared subspace, ensuring practical knowledge transfer. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset demonstrate that TriStage-CPDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving F-measure, AUC, and MCC. These results highlight its effectiveness in enhancing defect prediction effectiveness for data-scarce or new projects, offering a robust solution for CPDP and valuable insights for future research.},

Driven by the pursuit of user engagement, competitive social platforms often overlook effective rumor control mechanisms, exacerbating information disorders. A framework for modeling platform-wide competition during short-term but explosive information transmission scenarios is proposed in this paper. We first introduce a novel dynamic susceptible, exposed, infected, labeled, and recovered (SEILR) model, which is meticulously designed to capture the intricate dynamics of information transmission across multilayer networks. Second, we formulate a zero-sum differential game framework to analyze the strategic interactions among competing platforms. By integrating critical cost factors, including user losses, potential government sanctions, and social management expenses, our framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the economic implications of rumor control. Third, to address the complexity of deriving optimal strategies within the proposed framework, we innovatively combine iterative approximate dynamic programming (ADP) with neural networks. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of the neural networks, we enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the ADP process. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted in a duopoly market setting, we validate the efficacy of our proposed strategies. The results demonstrate their remarkable cost efficiency and superior rumor management capabilities relative to those of the existing approaches.},

Therefore, we propose a novel hybrid heterogeneous graph transformer (HHGT) method with both content and topology features to mine COAs more accurately, with two main contributions. First, we tackle the COA mining problem for the first time with a real-world dataset established from the WeChat platform, where the data analysis reveals that not only the node content feature but also the node topology feature can be useful for COA mining. Second, we propose the HHGT by learning both node content and topology features to exhibit superior generalization and representation capabilities for COA mining. We benchmark the HHGT and study its performance and feature effectiveness on the real WeChat dataset, providing helpful insights for COA mining. Experimental results show that the proposed HHGT performs better than all compared methods on unseen data, and can provide support for the analysis of the relationship among official accounts.},

In this work, we propose ARP-STGCN, a novel approach that simultaneously addresses trajectory prediction and the imputation of missing observations. By leveraging a Gated Convolutional Imputation Module and an Attraction–Repulsion Potential (ARP) model, ARP-STGCN not only handles incomplete trajectories but also effectively captures social interactions among pedestrians. Our method utilizes a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (STGCN) to model dynamic interactions between pedestrians, while incorporating scene features to account for environmental context. Additionally, we introduce a Weighted Position Loss function to emphasize accurate prediction in later time steps, ensuring that cumulative errors are minimized. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving significantly lower Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error across multiple benchmarks, including the ETH/UCY dataset and SDD dataset. Moreover, ARP-STGCN consistently demonstrates faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for real-time applications.

However, existing methods predominantly depend on pre-trained models for image modality processing, which often struggle to meet the fine visual information requirements essential for multi-modal alignment tasks. To address this issue, we propose a novel MMEA model, termed VEMEA, in which a new dual attention feature enhancement module was designed to enhance visual features extracted using pre-trained models. This module utilizes a multi-branch convolutional network alongside depth separable convolutional to enhance the local semantic information from the features output by the pre-trained model at first. Then the dual attention network dynamically adjusts the spatial and channel distribution of image features, capturing the global dependencies of spatially sensitive features and channels, thereby enhancing the representation of key regional features. Furthermore, during feature fusion, we employ a hierarchical semantic embedding and a cross-modal adaptive weighted attention mechanism to capture the correlations and interactions between modalities, thus alleviating issues related to modal heterogeneity. Additionally, this paper introduces an iterative optimization strategy based on credibility, which leverages the confidence scores of model outputs to preferentially select high-confidence aligned entity pairs, thereby increasing the number of marked entity pairs and improving alignment task performance. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods across all metrics, indicating its efficacy and robustness in the MMEA task.},

However, existing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods based on CqROF data do not account for the interconnections among multiple criteria and are unable to mitigate the impact of extreme values. To address these issues, this paper proposes novel operators, namely the CqROF partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (CqROFPMSM) and the CqROF weighted partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (CqROFWPMSM), designed to handle scenarios where criteria are divided into distinct parts with interconnections among multiple criteria within the same part. The advantageous characteristics of the proposed operators are thoroughly examined. To alleviate the negative impact of extreme evaluation values on the aggregated outcome, additional operators, the CqROF power partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (CqROFPPMSM) and the CqROF weighted power partitioned Maclaurin symmetric mean (CqROFWPPMSM), are formulated. Furthermore, the indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis (ITARA) method is extended under the CqROF environment to determine the semi-objective importance of key decision-making criteria. Next, a novel MCDM approach is presented, employing the proposed operators and the ITARA method. A numerical example related to supplier selection is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed approach. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted, evaluating the designed MCDM approach against various existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {GPT is among the most powerful large language models (LLMs), known for its versatility and strong performance across a wide range of tasks. However, its substantial computational demands and limited cross-domain generalization present challenges, particularly in resource-sensitive applications like Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). Existing ABSA models are typically domain-specific and suffer from catastrophic forgetting—losing previously acquired knowledge when sequentially trained on new domains—resulting in poor scalability and knowledge retention. To address these issues, we proposed a novel framework that integrates GPT-2 with a replay-based lifelong learning mechanism to support incremental, multi-domain ABSA while mitigating forgetting. The model is sequentially fine-tuned using real-data replay across four diverse ABSA domains: Laptops, Restaurants, Tweets, and Finance. Experimental results show that proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 0.85 and a Backward Transfer (BWT) score of -0.09, significantly outperforming the baseline model without lifelong learning (accuracy of 0.70, BWT of -0.64). We further conducted a t-test to validate the statistical significance of the improvements. we design an ANFIS-based model trained on experimental results to predict the proper memory ratio for new datasets, enabling more effective and adaptive lifelong learning in GPT-based architectures. In addition, we applied a multi-level data augmentation pipeline, which significantly improved performance across domains (p = 0.0049), enhancing both retention and generalization under constrained memory. Additionally, we introduced a domain sequence permutation study to test robustness against task-order sensitivity, while another part evaluates generalization under a simulated fifth domain constructed from a mixture of all original domains. These components validate the model’s scalability and ability to generalize beyond trained distributions. An ablation study was conducted to isolate the contributions of each module, including replay, ANFIS prediction, and data augmentation. The results demonstrate that removing any single component leads to a measurable drop in performance, confirming that each part of the framework contributes meaningfully to overall effectiveness. A post-hoc comparison with a distillation-based lifelong learning baseline was conducted, showing improved performance of our replay + ANFIS approach. We acknowledge that additional comparisons with advanced baselines such as GEM or A-GEM are needed to further strengthen this claim, which we leave for future work. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining GPT-2 with replay-based lifelong learning and adaptive memory control, offering a scalable and robust solution for continuous, multi-domain sentiment analysis. Our proposed model provides a practical foundation for future research in dynamic, cross-domain ABSA systems.},

These shortcomings compromise the safety, robustness, and consistency of their reasoning, particularly in ambiguous or high-stakes scenarios. In this paper, we propose three complementary frameworks aimed at enabling more trustworthy visual reasoning through structured deliberation. The first is the self-reflective reasoning single-agent framework, which facilitates iterative self-revision without requiring external supervision. The second is the structured debate agent framework, in which turn-based rebuttals between agents promote contrastive, multi-perspective refinement. The third is the progressive two-stage debate agent framework, which enables efficient yet accurate decision-making through model-to-model deliberation between smaller and larger agents. Experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that all three frameworks significantly enhance reasoning performance, achieving up to a 5.4% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) and over a 40% reduction in localization error compared to a single-pass baseline. Further evaluation across robustness (IoU), safety (self-revision rate, SRR), and consistency (consistency score, CS) confirms the effectiveness of multi-round, self-corrective, and multi-agent reasoning strategies. These results establish a practical path toward safer, more robust, and more interpretable vision-language models through lightweight, deliberative inference frameworks.},

  abstract     = {Fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring is essential for detecting fetal distress, yet current deep learning approaches suffer from limited discriminative accuracy and poor interpretability, hindering clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Fetalet, an interpretable framework for FHR anomaly detection with three key innovations: (1) shapelet-driven methodology capturing discriminative temporal patterns through learnable shapelets, (2) linear-time computational complexity via convolutional parameterization, and (3) clinically verifiable decision rationale through prototype-based metric learning. Our shapelet visualization approach enables direct clinical validation, with 92% alignment rate between automatically detected patterns and clinically recognized waveforms. Evaluated on both public (NIFEA) and private (FHRA) datasets, Fetalet achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.98 F1-score and 0.96 accuracy while demonstrating robustness to clinical noise conditions, maintaining less than 3% performance degradation under Gaussian noise levels up to 0.2. Notably, on the FHRA dataset, Fetalet demonstrates a 19.7% F1-score improvement over Anomaly Transformer with significantly faster training time (3.6s versus 100 s). The framework’s interpretability features enable clinicians to validate model decisions through shapelet matching with established clinical patterns, enhancing trust in AI-assisted monitoring systems. This work bridges the gap between high-performance deep learning and clinically actionable interpretability, offering a promising solution for real-world fetal monitoring applications where both accuracy and transparency are critical for clinical decision-making.},

  abstract     = {Flocking control is essential for studying the collective behavior of agents in multi-agent systems (MASs). Most existing flocking control algorithms assumed that the motion of the agent was influenced by consensus, gradient-based, and navigation feedback terms. However, the interaction of these terms might trap the agent in dynamic equilibrium state with near-zero acceleration and velocity under complex obstacles. This prevented the agent from bypassing the obstacles and tracking the group target. In this paper, we propose a vector field histogram plus (VFH+) flocking control algorithm. The algorithm maps the obstacle information into a simple binary polar histogram. Using this histogram, the expected velocity is calculated to construct the consensus term, which can guide the agent in escaping from the dynamic equilibrium state and bypassing obstacles. Then, a non-increasing piecewise function is formulated to dynamically alter the magnitude of the gradient-based term, thereby reducing the possibility of collisions. Additionally, the navigation feedback term is developed to track the group target. Stability analysis provides sufficient conditions that there are no collisions between agents or with obstacles. Subsequently, simulations conducted on combination, U-shaped and multiple obstacles demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental adaptability of the VFH+ flocking control algorithm.},
