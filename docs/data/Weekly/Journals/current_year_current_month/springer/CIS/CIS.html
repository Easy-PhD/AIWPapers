  abstract     = {Although the cloud-based commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and cutting-edge zero-shot learning abilities on a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, their performance on Named Entity Recognition (NER) is still significantly below supervised baselines. While NER in the universal domain has achieved remarkable success, NER in specialized industries continues to face challenges due to the scarcity of data and computational resource. To address these issues, this study proposes "SMALLM", a novel NER framework that integrates a local BERT-based model to augment the performance of the state-of-the-art LLM, ChatGPT, in an end-to-end manner. By leveraging both the strengths of the small model and the LLM, SMALLM acts as a domain expert through few-shot learning. SMALLM updates only hundreds of thousands of parameters in the local BERT-based model with minimal training data. This significantly reduces computational demands, enables fast training and minimizes reliance on data. Additionally, our framework provides a solution to the constraints posed by closed-source LLMs like ChatGPT converting their responses into one-hot vectors for subsequent optimization and integration. Through experiments on three industrial Chinese NER (CNER) datasets—Construction, CCKS2019- Military, and CCKS2020-Clinic—SMALLM enhances the performance of ChatGPT, achieving improvements of 28.80%, 13.48%, and 48.37%, respectively. Additionally, SMALLM consistently surpasses mainstream models in low-resource settings.},

  abstract     = {Software defect prediction is a critical process for enhancing software quality by identifying potential defects early in the development lifecycle. Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP) broadens traditional defect prediction methods by leveraging data from source projects to predict defects in target projects. However, existing CPDP methods face two key issues: insufficient feature representation and inadequate alignment of data distributions between source and target projects. To address these challenges, this study introduces TriStage-CPDP, a novel three-stage framework. In the first stage, TriStage-CPDP harnesses the capabilities of CodeT5+ to extract nuanced semantic and syntactic features, combines GraphSAGE for software dependency representation, and incorporates traditional metrics to construct a comprehensive feature set, enabling a more nuanced representation of software features. The second stage employs an integrated feature selection strategy that combines Last Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to refine feature relevance and eliminate redundancy effectively. Finally, a domain adaptation mechanism based on Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) aligns data distributions between source and target projects in a shared subspace, ensuring practical knowledge transfer. Experiments on the PROMISE dataset demonstrate that TriStage-CPDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving F-measure, AUC, and MCC. These results highlight its effectiveness in enhancing defect prediction effectiveness for data-scarce or new projects, offering a robust solution for CPDP and valuable insights for future research.},

  abstract     = {In the digital era, the widespread dissemination of rumors on online social networks (OSNs) has emerged as a formidable challenge. Driven by the pursuit of user engagement, competitive social platforms often overlook effective rumor control mechanisms, exacerbating information disorders. A framework for modeling platform-wide competition during short-term but explosive information transmission scenarios is proposed in this paper. We first introduce a novel dynamic susceptible, exposed, infected, labeled, and recovered (SEILR) model, which is meticulously designed to capture the intricate dynamics of information transmission across multilayer networks. Second, we formulate a zero-sum differential game framework to analyze the strategic interactions among competing platforms. By integrating critical cost factors, including user losses, potential government sanctions, and social management expenses, our framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the economic implications of rumor control. Third, to address the complexity of deriving optimal strategies within the proposed framework, we innovatively combine iterative approximate dynamic programming (ADP) with neural networks. Leveraging the approximation capabilities of the neural networks, we enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the ADP process. Through extensive numerical simulations conducted in a duopoly market setting, we validate the efficacy of our proposed strategies. The results demonstrate their remarkable cost efficiency and superior rumor management capabilities relative to those of the existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {As cheating official accounts (COAs) in social media has posed a significant threat to society, how to detect COAs has attracted increasing attention worldwide. However, mining COAs is challenging because the COAs are always much fewer than normal accounts and will conceal themselves by mimicking normal accounts. Therefore, we propose a novel hybrid heterogeneous graph transformer (HHGT) method with both content and topology features to mine COAs more accurately, with two main contributions. First, we tackle the COA mining problem for the first time with a real-world dataset established from the WeChat platform, where the data analysis reveals that not only the node content feature but also the node topology feature can be useful for COA mining. Second, we propose the HHGT by learning both node content and topology features to exhibit superior generalization and representation capabilities for COA mining. We benchmark the HHGT and study its performance and feature effectiveness on the real WeChat dataset, providing helpful insights for COA mining. Experimental results show that the proposed HHGT performs better than all compared methods on unseen data, and can provide support for the analysis of the relationship among official accounts.},
