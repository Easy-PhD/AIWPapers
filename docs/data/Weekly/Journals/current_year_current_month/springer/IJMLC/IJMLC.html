  abstract     = {Brain tumors are serious and abnormal growth within the brain by posing significant challenges for medical diagnosis and treatment. The varied and complex nature of brain tumors complicates their detection and accurate classification. The need for precise classification of brain tumors from medical imaging is crucial for effective medical intervention. However, traditional methods are reliant on manual diagnosis, which are prone to human errors and inconsistencies. Previous research has struggled to enhance diagnostic precision by combining predictions from multiple models but often result in discrepancies and inconsistent outcomes by leading to complicated diagnostic processes. To address these challenges, researchers have increasingly turned to advanced computational methods to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this context, we propose a robust ensemble approach optimized using a Differential Evolution (DE)-based algorithm. Our method combines three high-performing pre-trained CNN models like MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2 and optimizes their contributions by assigning optimal weights through DE. This technique intelligently adjusts the weights allocation of models to maximize ensemble performance. During optimization, the probabilities from each model are extracted and integrated using a weighted average aggregation scheme, enhancing the diagnostic precision and overall predictive accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to two publicly available datasets: a binary classification dataset (BR35H) and a multi-class (4-class) dataset. Through rigorous evaluations, our optimized ensemble approach demonstrated superior accuracy performance of 98% and 97.03%, respectively. We used several performance evaluation metrices and visualization techniques like Grad-CAM to highlight critical areas within the images. Additionally, statistical validation is conducted using the Friedman test followed by the Conover post hoc analysis to rigorously assess and compare the performance differences across models.},

  abstract     = {The growing complexity of cyber threats presents significant challenges to the security of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems, where traditional security and intrusion detection methods often prove inadequate. The Key challenges include inefficient key management, fragmented security protocols, and limited scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Dynamic Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning (DA-DRL) framework that enhances Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption by dynamically adjusting key generation in response to real-time threats. Additionally, a multi-layered security architecture integrating AES, SHA-512, Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge Proof (NIZKPs), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is introduced, ensuring robust protection against diverse attack vectors. The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is employed for decentralized and immutable data storage, enhancing data security and transparency. The proposed DA-DRL-AES-SHA-512 methodology significantly outperforms conventional encryption techniques, achieving an encryption time of 0.0975 s, decryption time of 0.0846 s, and a throughput of 75.63 transactions per second (Tx/s) with a network overhead of just 0.1289%. The Energy consumption and computational overhead are reduced to 0.3664 J and 0.48%, respectively. The Secure and Dependable Bi-LSTM GRU Intrusion Detection Framework (S-BiLSTMGRU-IDF) achieves 99.94% accuracy in binary classification and 99.89% in multiclass classification, improving detection efficiency by 0.6–3.5% over state-of-the-art models. This blockchain-based framework ensures real-time threat mitigation, enhanced data integrity, and superior system performance, establishing a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for IoMT security.},

The common method is extracting features from electronic health records and choosing appropriate models to identify patients who may have a higher risk of death. However, the lack of standardization and identifiability in the storage of unstructured data in medical records poses a significant challenge in training models to predict patient mortality. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous data fusion mortality prediction model called Fusion-transformer to address the above issues. The proposed Fusion-transformer model uses a time-aware self-attention mechanism to combine structured data represented by time signals and static information and unstructured data represented by clinical notes to enhance patient representation learning. Fusion-transformer also uses a time decay module to control the influence of the patient’s hospitalization experience on the current health status at different times. The results of in-hospital mortality prediction experiments on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III dataset show that Fusion-transformer outperforms other machine learning and deep learning baseline models, improving the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve metric from 0.891 to 0.923. In addition, we explore the practical applications value of our method through real ICU patient electronic medical records.},

  abstract     = {The graph structure can reveal the relationships between feature nodes and improve the performance of feature-based models. However, more research is needed to construct a patient graph representation using electronic medical record (EMR) to meet modeling requirements. This study aims to propose a heterogeneous patient graph representation (HePGR) framework capable of discovering associations between medical concepts in EMR while simultaneously supporting both clustering and classification tasks. We construct HePGR’s edge connections by evaluating the correlations between medical concepts(e.g., laboratory tests, drugs, surgical codes) using positive pointwise mutual information, directly linking patients with their corresponding medical concepts. Graph attention networks are used to obtain patient node representations, with a supervised training method based on cross-entropy and a semi-supervised method leveraging pseudo-labeling and contrastive learning. To validate the effectiveness of the HePGR model, we design comparison and ablation experiments that are performed on a stroke patient dataset with two prediction tasks and one clustering task. HePGR shows superior performance in all tasks, achieving areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.990 and 0.806 in the two prediction tasks and a Jaccard coefficient of 0.810 in the clustering task. The proposed HePGR model effectively identifies associations between medical concepts and shows high performance in clinical tasks. This model is expected to be extended to more medical concepts for broad clinical applicability.},

  abstract     = {Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) representation learning is a pivotal task aimed at transforming entities and relations within TKG from a high-dimensional vector space to a lower-dimensional vector space, while preserving the relational features inherent in TKG. TKG comprises a sequence of knowledge graphs (KGs) at various timestamps. Presently, existing methodologies tend to either focus solely on learning historical event characteristics or exclusively model time-dependent relationships. There is a notable dearth of research concerning incomplete data, posing significant challenges to comprehending and capturing the intricate relationship characteristics within TKG. In response to this challenge, a novel method named TFCE is introduced to address the challenges posed by temporal evolution and incomplete data in TKGs. TFCE encompasses three core components: a Temporal Feature Module, a Complex Evolution Module, and a Temporally Embedded Decoder. TFCE incorporates a temporal feature module, enabling the temporal encoding of entities and relations within KGs. This module seamlessly integrates temporal information into the representation learning process. By discerning patterns of entities and relations across time, TFCE facilitates the comprehension and discovery of temporal order relations within KGs. The complex evolution module adeptly learns the evolutionary representation of entities and relationships at each timestamp through recursive modeling of the KG sequence. By systematically analyzing the KG sequence, this module captures the nuanced evolution of entities and relationships over time, enhancing the understanding of temporal dependencies between events. To accommodate incomplete temporal data, TFCE employs a temporally embedded decoder. This decoder effectively processes incomplete temporal data, facilitating the inference of representation learning. Experimental validation conducted across three real-world datasets, namely ICEWS14s, ICEWS 05-15, and ICEWS18, underscores the superiority of TFCE over baseline methods. The TFCE framework demonstrates remarkable efficacy in capturing temporal relationships within TKG, thus showcasing its potential for advancing temporal knowledge graph representation learning methodologies.},

  abstract     = {Harris hawk optimization (HHO) is a popular metaheuristic algorithm recently proposed, but it suffers from slow convergence speed, low accuracy, and the problem of easily getting stuck in local optima when dealing with practical problems. To address these drawbacks, we propose an improved version called augmented Harris hawk optimization (AHHO). In the enhancement, we introduce Logistic chaotic population initialization to enhance AHHO’s global exploration capability; adopt a dynamic Lévy flight strategy to improve the algorithm’s early convergence speed; and propose a new surprise pounce exploitation strategy to enhance the algorithm’s optimization ability. Additionally, we introduce a random centroid dynamic backward learning to improve the algorithm’s search efficiency, convergence speed, and robustness, thereby effectively solving complex optimization problems. To validate the performance of AHHO, we conducted analyses from three aspects: population diversity, exploration and exploitation balance, and convergence behavior. We compared it with HHO and 12 other high-performance algorithms on the CEC2014 and CEC2017 test sets, in two test sets, 15, 17, 23, 14, 18, and 21 first-place rankings were obtained in three dimensions, respectively. The results show that compared to HHO and other algorithms, AHHO demonstrates superior comprehensive performance in all aspects. Finally, we applied AHHO to 5 engineering optimization problems and 1 unmanned aerial vehicle path planning problem, 5 engineering problems and UAVs both achieved first place rankings. The results indicate that AHHO outperforms other benchmark algorithms, demonstrating its strong scalability and outstanding optimization performance.},

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of computer networks has led to designing a more flexible and efficient architecture called Software-Defined Networking (SDN). SDN decouples the control plane from the physical networking devices in the data plane. SDN’s global perspective and programmability have inspired researchers to develop ideas that would have been difficult or even impossible in traditional networks. Traffic forecasting is an interesting area that has driven the efforts of this paper. In this study, an optimization of time series parameters is performed to achieve the most suitable time series structure for feeding deep-learning algorithms. Popular deep-learning algorithms, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are compared in traffic forecasting. An improved version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), called Local Optimum Escape Particle Swarm Optimization (LOEPSO), is proposed. The algorithm is a variation of PSO inspired by Harmony Search optimization to replace the global worst particle with a randomly created particle. A Ryu controller has been customized to gather the network’s switches’ port statistics and generate a time series from traffic passing through the ports. A traffic generator application, implemented as a Python thread, runs at the SDN network’s hosts simulated in Mininet. For an extensive analysis, traffic is generated in two modes: an idle mode with regular traffic and the worst-case scenario where a chaotic function is used to determine traffic volume. The results show that CNN and LSTM provide reliable forecasting for regular traffic. However, despite having equivalent training results in chaotic traffic, LSTM performs better in forecasting validation data.},

Mechanism design offers a solution by employing a bi-level optimization framework, where a designer agent intervenes in the reward structures to incentivize desired behaviors among self-interested agents. However, a major obstacle in reward optimization lies in solving multi-agent reinforcement learning problems given a reward structure. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel algorithm that leverages successor features (SFs) at both levels of the optimization. Specifically, SFs help reduce the number of design iterations at the upper level by using previously learned equilibria as biased information sources and accelerate equilibrium learning at the lower level by transferring equilibria from previously solved Markov games. This innovative approach leads to significant computational savings, making the process up to ten times faster compared to traditional methods.},

  abstract     = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a prevalent and serious global health issue, with a significant impact on individuals globally. Hence, it is imperative to promptly obtain an accurate diagnosis and interpretation for the commencement of appropriate treatment as timely detection and intervention can enhance the probability of long-term survival. Existing projection-based methods for feature selection do not yield desired outcomes due to their different objectives necessitating the need for innovation approaches for a higher predictive performance. This study proposes a novel fusion-based feature selection (FFS) model for the optimization and selection of distinct features to enhance CKD diagnosis. This study utilizes the University of California, Irvine (UCI) CKD dataset and addresses missing data and imbalance issues through Multiple Imputations by Chain Equation (MICE) and Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (Borderline-SMOTE). The proposed model integrates different machine learning (ML) classifiers, conventionally known as black boxes, with SHAP values to provide interpretability and gain transparency in the decision-making process. The proposed FFS model performs better than single feature selection approaches, achieving 100% in all of the evaluation metrics for support vector machine, light gradient boosting, random forest, voting and extreme gradient boosting classifiers compared to other existing literature that also utilized the same dataset. Notably, the SHAP analysis reveals that features such as red blood cell, white blood cell count and the pus cell clumps show model specific interactions. This aids healthcare in understanding and effectively applying the model’s outputs. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our proposed approach exhibits superior performance which has the potential to complement physicians’ diagnosis of kidney diseases. Also, the incorporation of explainability enhances the clarity of outcomes and facilitates the identification of the underlying cause of the diseases, contributing to more transparency and ethically sound AI applications in healthcare.},

  abstract     = {Q-learning, an eminent reinforcement learning (RL) approach, has garnered substantial research attention in recent years owing to its effectiveness in solving intricate problems and attain noteworthy results in a range of applications. In this study, the Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO) is explored as a promising metaheuristic algorithm, primarily due to its biologically inspired mechanisms that emulate the adaptive and dynamic behaviors of gazelles in nature. However, despite its strong performance, MGO has inherent limitations, such as a tendency to become trapped in suboptimal search regions during early iterations, making it challenging to escape local optima. Therefore, to circumvent these shortcomings, this paper introduces a novel Q-learning-inspired Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (QLMGO), integrating chaotic and random opposite-based learning (ROBL) strategies to enhance optimization performance. The key innovation of QLMGO lies in its dynamic switching mechanism, enabled by Q-learning, which adaptively selects between ROBL and chaotic strategies to optimize the search process. Initially, Q-learning is utilized to regulate the switching mechanism, ensuring efficient exploitation of the search space. During the update phase, QLMGO dynamically chooses the most effective strategy, either ROBL for intensified local search or chaotic exploration for escaping local optima, to accelerate convergence towards the global optimal solution. The performance of QLMGO was rigorously evaluated against well-established optimization algorithms using 23 CEC2005 functions, 10 advanced CEC2019 functions, 30 CEC2017 test functions, and six real-world engineering problems. To ensure a robust and precise assessment, statistical analyses including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Friedman test, and t test were conducted. The empirical results from benchmark functions and engineering applications demonstrate the superiority of QLMGO in solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems efficiently, thereby validating its effectiveness as an innovative optimization approach.},

  abstract     = {Classifying high-dimensional imbalanced data, such as images and audio, poses a significant challenge to the machine learning community. One potential solution is to employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) for augmenting the minority class data. However, augmentation in data space shows limited performance improvements due to the intricate relationship between balancing class distribution and enhancing feature representation for the minority class. This paper proposes a novel adversarial feature augmentation network via Transformer-level feature fusion (AFAN-TFF) for imbalanced data classification, which operates in feature space without regard to the modality of input data. AFAN-TFF adopts a modified GAN architecture comprising four key components: a feature generator, a feature discriminator, a feature extractor, and a feature classifier. Additionally, a lightweight vision Transformer (ViT) module is devised to enhance feature extraction. This module integrates a global feature pooling layer and a local feature pooling layer, which are used for capturing long-term dependency and contextual features, respectively. Subsequently, these two types of features are fused by a global–local feature fusion layer. These features can complement each other and overcome their individual limitations, resulting in a more robust and informative feature representation. We conducted extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets to compare AFAN-TFF against several established class-imbalance methods. Results demonstrate that AFAN-TFF has substantial advantages over the comparison methods, with consistently improved weighted accuracy, weighted F1, and weighted MCC scores. The effectiveness of employing AFAN-TFF for feature augmentation to enhance classification performance under class-imbalance conditions is also validated.},

However, existing approaches based on self-attention mechanisms usually consider user preferences only from the time-domain perspective, ignoring the inherent periodicity in user behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce an innovative solution called FDSRec, which combines frequency domain self-attention networks with contrastive learning techniques. Specifically, we propose a frequency domain self-attention encoder to capture periodic variations in user behavior data. We convert user representations into frequency domain representations by employing the Fast Fourier Transform technique. Subsequently, the frequency domain self-attention networks are used to learn the correlation and importance among different frequency domain components. In addition, we design time-domain and frequency-domain enhancement methods to address data sparsity and noise issues. Furthermore, we employ a multi-task technique to optimize sequential recommendation and contrastive learning objectives. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that FDSRec outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Cyberattacks in various forms like distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), resource exploitation or reconnaissance etc. can significantly reduce the accessibility, performance and security and exposing more and more flaws in these technologies, resulting in regular disruptions, monetary losses and reputational harm. This research study introduces an Artificial Immune System (AIS) based Intrusion detection System (IDS) that monitors, detects and mitigates attacks effectively by combining the entropy fluctuation method and a novel Deep Maxout classifier. By analyzing entropy variations in network traffic, the system identifies deviations indicative of potential attacks. An Improved Activation and Loss Function (IALF)-based Deep Maxout classifier and a Deep Belief Network (DBN) are combined in a hybrid model that is highly effective at detecting complex, nonlinear patterns and adjusting activation and loss functions. These insights are then further processed to distinguish malicious activity from normal behavior, resulting in enhanced detection accuracy. Upon detection, the Entropy-based Mitigation Process (EMP) isolates malicious nodes to ensure secure data transmission using normalized correlation coefficients and quartile deviation metrics. The proposed system is evaluated using diverse datasets, which represent a wide range of cyberattacks on computing resources and communication systems. Experimental findings show that the system outperforms traditional models in terms of detection accuracy and adaptability while minimizing false positives. A dynamic mitigation approach addresses both current and future security needs by enabling continuous, adaptive protection against dynamic threat landscape.},

  abstract     = {The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved the quality and diversity of AI-generated content(AIGC). LLM-Generated text detection plays an important role in preventing the harmful misuse of large language models. Existing approaches primarily analyze texts individually, overlooking the structural relationships between them. This limitation restricts their ability to generalize across diverse LLMs, as they fail to capture the shared statistical patterns inherent in generated texts. To address this, an unsupervised-based structural information for LLM-generated text detection (SILTD) method is proposed. The key insight is that texts from different LLMs exhibit latent similarities in their generative statistical space, which can be modeled to improve cross-model generalization. First, we construct a multi-relational text graph based on the similarity of text features, which aims to model the intricate similarities and correlations between texts. Second, we propose a novel unsupervised graph clustering method. The multi-relational graph is transformed into an encoding tree, which is then optimized based on a two-dimensional structure entropy minimization algorithm to achieve hierarchical clustering of texts. Structural entropy minimization enables achieving high-quality clusters, by measuring the uncertainty of random walks within the graph. Finally, we introduce a new method that measures text similarity and computes the intensity of text aggregation within each cluster, to perform in-cluster label inference. Extensive experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, our approach is more effective and generalizable in detecting six popular LLMs across five datasets.},

  abstract     = {Facial Expression Recognition (FER) refers to the automated analysis of human emotional states using computer vision techniques, which are of significant importance in tasks such as fatigued driving detection, learning engagement analysis, and safety monitoring. In recent years, deep learning methods have made remarkable progress in facial expression recognition tasks. However, due to scarce samples, high intra-class variation, and inter-class similarity, current approaches perform poorly in recognizing difficult categories, such as Disgust and Fear. To alleviate the performance degradation resulting from these difficult categories, we propose a training framework called Contrastive Learning Distillation of Non-target Categories (CLDN). The proposed method consists of two stages: In the first stage, the model is jointly trained using contrastive learning and supervised learning to weaken the influence of imbalanced labels on visual representation learning, thereby generating robust soft labels. In the second stage, simple category knowledge is transferred to the difficult categories through self-distillation. During the distillation phase, a Non-target Categories Distillation Loss is introduced, alleviating the inhibition of classic distillation losses on non-target category knowledge and further promoting knowledge transfer during the distillation process. The proposed approach achieves competitive results on the RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet datasets. Ablation studies demonstrate that the method significantly improves the network’s recognition accuracy for difficult categories. The code is available at https://github.com/Greysahy/CLDN .},

The classification of time series data streams spans across many applications of intelligent systems. However, the scarcity of effective Machine Learning architectures to handle limited time-series data adversely affects the realization of some crucial applications. In particular, healthcare-related applications are inherently concerned with limited time series datasets. Indeed, building effective artificial intelligence (AI) models for rare diseases using conventional techniques can pose a significant challenge. Utilizing recent advances in deep learning and signal processing techniques, this study introduces a new ensemble deep learning (DL) approach for time series categorization in the presence of limited datasets. Physiological data, such as ECG and voice, are used to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed DL architecture with data obtained from IoT and non-IoT devices. The proposed framework comprises a self-designed deep CNN-LSTM along with ResNet50 and MobileNet transfer learning approaches. The CNN-LSTM architecture includes an enhanced squeeze and excitation block that improves overall performance.This architecture processes time series data transformed into a 3-Channel image structure via improved recurrence plot (RP), Gramian angular field (GAF), and fuzzy recurrence plot (FRP) methods.

  abstract     = {Obtaining sufficient data is often challenging, costly, or even infeasible in real-world applications. To address this issue, researchers have developed methods for learning from limited data, which involves discovering the underlying pattern using a small amount of available data. Data augmentation and model fine-tuning are two methods commonly used for learning with limited data. However, both methods have limitations: model fine-tuning methods often face difficulties in acquiring relevant data for pre-training in certain fields, such as drug discovery, whereas data augmentation methods have the potential risk of causing bias. To address this challenge, we propose a general learning framework for limited data using a combination of data augmentation and model fine-tuning (DAMFT). This framework comprises data augmentation and model fine-tuning modules. The data augmentation module is responsible for generating relevant data that are utilized to pre-train the target model, and the model fine-tuning module aims to correct the potential bias of the pre-trained model caused by data augmentation. DAMFT not only solves the difficulty in obtaining relevant data needed for model fine-tuning but also alleviates the bias caused by data augmentation. Furthermore, under the DAMFT framework, we provide a supervised learning algorithm, DAMFT_GH, which adopts a generative adversarial network and head fine-tuning to generate the new instances and tune the pre-trained model, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning algorithm can effectively improve the performance of the classification model in the case of limited data.},

The motivation behind this task is to address the issue faced by sentiment analysis, where the majority of languages lack sufficient labeled data for training. Nevertheless, cross-lingual sentiment analysis tasks mostly depend on translation tools and corpora. This dependency can prevent these models from capturing the unique sentiment characteristics in the target language due to the accuracy limitations of translation tools and corpora. Driven by the common belief that emojis have consistent associations with sentiments across languages, we introduce a method called emotional mutual reinforcement (EMR). Our EMR approach aims to transfer sentiment knowledge between different languages by using emojis as medium of connection. The central concept of EMR involves employing emojis as the medium to connect different languages, facilitating emotional mutual reinforcement across different linguistic contexts. Sentiment knowledge can effectively cross linguistic boundaries through reinforcing emotion-related features with similar sentiment tendencies. In contrast to existing approaches that utilize emojis as a bridge, EMR can incorporate more fine-grained sentiment knowledge from different languages. Results from a complete evaluation on several publicly available datasets confirm the efficiency of the approach we proposed.},

  abstract     = {Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (EEFO) algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the social predation behavior of electric eels. It incorporates interactions, resting, migration, and hunting activities to enhance search efficiency. Although EEFO is effective for optimization tasks, it is characterized by slower convergence rates and a tendency to fall into local optima in certain cases. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Multi-strategy Improved Electric Eel Foraging Optimization (MIEEFO) that integrates three key strategies: adaptive tent chaotic mapping, Differential Evolution (DE) mutation strategy, and an enhanced solution technique based on the Fibonacci search technique (FSM). Firstly, MIEEFO employs an adaptive tent chaotic mapping strategy for initializing a uniformly distributed high-quality population for effective search space exploration. Secondly, a novel DE-based mutation strategy is introduced to balance the exploration and exploitation phases. Additionally, to enhance solution quality and mitigate the risk of local optima, an FSM-based improved solution technique is applied to refine the current optimal solution. To conduct a thorough assessment of MIEEFO’s global optimization capabilities, the established numerical challenge of the CEC’22 test suite is utilized. MIEEFO undergoes a comparative analysis with a range of modern, enhanced algorithms, employing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Friedman test to integrate the results of these comparisons. The findings reveal that MIEEFO stands out for its superior optimization abilities, evidenced by its lowest average Friedman ranking of 1.37. MIEEFO consistently outperforms its rivals in most test scenarios, offering solutions that are both more precise and reliable. In addition, the application of MIEEFO is presented through five real-world constrained engineering design challenges, indicating its practical utility. These results highlight MIEEFO’s robust optimization capabilities and its potential for widespread application. Moreover, the proficiency of MIEEFO in managing discrete feature selection tasks is examined through tests on 17 datasets, in conjunction with ten established classification techniques and two advanced classification methods. The results confirm that MIEEFO achieved an average feature selection reduction of 72.59% across datasets while improving classification accuracy by up to 7.2% compared to competing methods.},

Then adaptive denoising module combining the soft threshold function and the improved channel attention mechanism removes the noise mixed in the signal. After that, the Inception-ResNet which is composed of Inception and residual structure is used to mine deep features. Finally the modulation recognition is realized by the full connection layer. The simulation results show that under the background of Gaussian white noise, its average recognition accuracy for common signals reaches about 94% and also performs well in the condition of Rician, Rayleigh and even unknown channel.

While some existing algorithms leverage game transformation techniques to compute TMECor by converting ATGs into two-player zero-sum games, these methods often encounter scalability issues. The exponential growth in the transformed game tree size impedes computational speed and consumes significant storage resources. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on perfect-recall refinement that achieves game tree transformation while maintaining the original size. Additionally, we introduce an innovative teammate modeling approach, allowing team members to infer private information based on observations of their teammates’ actions. Experimental results on benchmark testbeds show a significant improvement in equilibrium computation efficiency without expanding the game size, indicating the effectiveness of our method.

Current research includes expertise-based and search-based techniques, among which Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches stand out, but face significant time and resource consumption issues. To address this issue, CSG-NAS narrows the search scope by using the core structure-guided search, which greatly improves search performance and efficiency. However, CSG-NAS only considers the complementarity between high-quality views when acquiring the core structures, leading to an incomplete narrowed search space. In this paper, we combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Core Structure-Guided search to propose an efficient and credible MMC algorithm, MCTS-CSG. It includes the core structures acquisition module composed of learning and searching phases, and the optimal structure search module composed of evolving phase. Specifically, the learning phase partitions and ranks the entire space by learning the node regressor, the search phase is based on the MCTS method to sample the structure in the most promising subspace while avoiding falling into a local optimum. The core structures containing complementarity and optimality are obtained after cyclic execution of the learning and searching phases. In the evolving phase, high-quality search domains are constructed around the core structures, which are defined as areas likely to contain high-performance fusion structures, and the Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) is used to find the optimal model structure. Meanwhile, a knowledge inheritance strategy is introduced to improve search speed.

  abstract     = {Attribute reduction based on dynamically updated datasets in fuzzy rough sets plays a significant role in dealing with the uncertainty of time-evolving updated data. However, current research on attribute reduction lacks theoretical mechanisms to actively distinguish and defend against malicious interference in datasets. Aiming at this problem, an attribute reduction update framework with defense is proposed for dynamic datasets with adversarial attack. In this framework, an adversarial attack model is presented to select the optimal attacked attributes and construct the adversarial samples to generate the attack datasets. Based on this, a defense model is designed by constructing defense samples to avoid attacks. Firstly, the key identification sample pairs that determine the discernibility of the minimal element subset are defined, which are then used to define the attack target candidate set and construct adversarial samples. To alter the discernibility attributes of the key discernibility sample pairs, the attribute significance degree with attack preference is defined to select the unimportant attributes to attack. Then, the attack model is designed to select the optimal attacked candidate subset and generate the attack dataset. Targeting the attack strategy, defense samples for both the optimal attacked attribute subset and the useless attribute set are constructed to generate the defense matrix and defense datasets. Finally, a unified update strategy for attribute reduction after attack and defense is proposed to induce the updated reduct. Numerical experiments verify the rationality and effectiveness of the framework proposed in this paper based on the success rate of attack and defense, as well as the classification results.},

  abstract     = {Utility tunnels represent a critical component of urban infrastructure, often regarded as the city’s lifeline. Ensuring the security of utility tunnels is crucial for protecting urban infrastructure and preventing threats to essential services from intruders. Traditional trajectory recovery methods rely on GPS data, which are not suitable for underground environments with inferior signals. The widely deployed network of surveillance cameras in tunnels presents new opportunities, as it allows us to extract video signals and recover intruders’ trajectories, but this approach encounters several challenges. Firstly, the videos from camera network lacks clear identity labels, leading to ambiguous correspondence between intruders and video records. Secondly, the uneven and incomplete distribution of surveillance cameras results in data sparsity issues. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework, TrajUT, which leverages machine learning algorithms to address these challenges. In the first stage, we introduce the multi-criteria-based trajectory segmentation to segment the raw record sequence into sub-sequences belonging to different groups of intruders, based on the continuity of sequences. For second stage, we design a hidden Markov model-based method that uses the records as observed sequences to infer the hidden sequences with the minimum cost, which correspond to the intruder movement trajectories. The proposed dynamic speed constraints enhance trajectory recovery by incorporating both spatial distances and temporal speed relationships into the cost adjustment mechanism. We conduct experiments using real-world data from the utility tunnels in Suzhou City. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving a 10.38% improvement in precision compared to the best baseline method.},

Through comprehensive ablation studies, we explore the contribution of various model components and propose optimization strategies, including genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning, to dynamically adjust ensemble weights. Our feature alignment techniques-using contrastive and cosine similarity losses-further improve multimodal integration. Evaluations on the Animal Kingdom dataset, which includes 30,100 clips across 140 action classes, demonstrate that ARTEMIS achieves a new state-of-the-art mAP of 79.82, outperforming existing methods.

  abstract     = {Predicting traffic flow on urban road networks is extremely challenging due to complex spatio-temporal correlations. Currently, the most popular method is to stack multiple layers of spatio-temporal graph convolutions, which generally combines the graph convolutional network (GCN) with the temporal convolutional network (TCN) or the recurrent neural network (RNN) for joint spatio-temporal prediction. However, the existing methods for constructing the predefined adjacency matrices of the GCN fail to accurately capture the real world situation. In addition, these methods restrict the potential of GCN since the GCN module is limited to aggregating the features within a relatively limited local spatio-temporal neighborhood. In this paper, we propose a neural network called Gformer for predicting traffic flow based on the time lagged and cross correlation (TLCC) algorithm. Gformer captures the temporal and spatial features using the linear self-attention and TLCC-based GCN. The combination of these two models expands the range of the temporal and spatial neighborhoods where feature aggregation is effective, further unleashing the potential of GCN. Additionally, a novel parametrized skip-connection is used to merge the outputs of multiple layers of the encoder and feed them into the decoder for final prediction. To validate the effectiveness of Gformer, we conduct experiments on the two large-scale urban traffic flow datasets and find that our proposed model exhibits superior overall performance compared to all baseline models. The experiments demonstrate the validity and robustness of the proposed model.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, machine learning-based methods have become essential for classifying network data flows under encryption, as traditional deep packet inspection is ineffective due to encryption protocols like HTTPS and QUIC, which now cover over 85% of Internet traffic. However, the scale of modern Internet traffic introduces new challenges, particularly the massive size of datasets required for training these models. Handling such large datasets results in excessive computational costs, prompting the need for data condensation techniques that reduce dataset size without sacrificing performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Evolutionary Coreset Distillation method for network traffic classification. Our approach, named ECODI, combines the power of evolutionary algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs) to condense large datasets into smaller, representative coresets. We employ LLMs to generate high-level embeddings that guide the evolutionary algorithm in selecting coresets, thus preserving the most important information while reducing the dataset size. Additionally, we introduce a gradient-based forgetting mechanism to further refine the coreset by eliminating redundant or low-impact data points. The extensive experiments demonstrate that ECODI outperforms both traditional methods (Random Sampling, K-Center, and Herding) and recent evolutionary approaches (EVA and DEvS) in achieving high classification performance with reduced dataset sizes. Notably, ECODI achieves a fitness score of 0.94 in as few as 10 generations, offering substantial improvements in terms of both convergence speed and final classification accuracy compared to EVA and DEvS.},

With Internet of Things (IoT) as a ubiquitous phenomenon, IDS has become increasingly important owing to the massive growth of connected devices. Machine learning algorithms can detect anomalies in large datasets, but centralized methods pose security risks by gathering all data in one place. Federated learning (FL) offers a safer alternative, allowing multiple clients to collaborate on a model without sharing data, reducing the risk of data leaks and enhancing privacy. In this paper, we propose a FL-based IDS. Herein, we have applied the FL approach to a number of clients that are grouped in sets where the number of clients in a set varies from 2 to 10. After that, we applied feature ranking via a random forest approach, wherein the features are ranked based on their importance to find the optimal and reduced dataset for reducing the inference time. Further, three models for each of the clients were trained using the refined dataset obtained. Next, the central server aggregates the data from the clients using three methods. We have updated the dataset with two types of scenarios, one with two classes (Benign and Attacks) and the second with a multi-class (Benign, Dodag, Flooding, Rank, Blackhole) for identifying the attack.

  abstract     = {Facial expression recognition (FER) is an important area in computer vision and Artificial Intelligence focused on identifying emotions from facial movements. However, FER faces challenges such as variability in expressions, occlusions, and changing lighting conditions. Addressing these requires advanced solutions, including improved feature extraction techniques, enhanced model training processes, and comprehensive contextual data analysis. This paper proposes a multi-aspect enhancement learning based facial emotion recognition (MAEL-FER) model that exploits several unique modules to effectively classify facial emotions. This approach consists of one of the most specific features to learn the best details of facial expressions that allow for the classification of similar emotions. A feature enhancement module enhances features in some way and suppress those that may not be accurate or noisy, a region enhancing module enhances regions in face such as the eyes and the mouth to recognize emotions. Also, the model entails feature such as generalization learning for better adaptation with various dataset, Meta-learning to allow efficient learning with limited samples, Adversarial training for robustness against noise and adversarial attacks. The MAEL-FER model offers high accuracy in recognizing facial expressions and effectively extracts features, enabling it to distinguish between similar emotions even in challenging conditions. Simulation results highlight the MAEL-FER model's effectiveness with high accuracy rates of 85.78%, 96.98%, 94.83%, and 69.08% across four FER datasets of FER-2013, CK+, RAF-DB, and AFFECTNET-7, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a robust Graph Embedded Subspace Clustering model with Entropy-based Feature Weighting (GSCEFW) to differentiate feature weights and substantially facilitate manifold preserving during subspace learning. In particular, an optimal graph exploration term guided by pseudo-label learning is introduced to subspace clustering framework, which imposes dual-structural constraint on subspace representation to strengthen its block diagonal contour. Then, an entropy-based feature weighting term is considered to automatically mitigate the adverse effect from noisy or irrelevant features during data reconstruction. Finally, an alternative optimization method is developed to solve the challenging objective function, together with theoretical algorithm analysis. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed GSCEFW model compared with the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {In noisy environments, the accuracy of speech recognition is often affected by noise interference, making it necessary to use speech enhancement techniques to mitigate this impact. Current methods that incorporate enhancement modules through joint training have made some progress in improving the robustness of speech recognition systems. However, these approaches primarily focus on directly modeling the original noisy signal without fully considering the use of potentially valuable information within the noise to support the enhancement modeling process. To address these issues, this work proposes a robust speech recognition method based on dense time–frequency convolution and bispectral refinement enhancement. This method attempts to avoid the problem of excessive suppression by repairing distortions that may be introduced by the speech enhancement module while performing noise reduction. First, a single-channel speech enhancement module based on dense time–frequency convolution is used for initial noise suppression. Then, a bispectral refinement enhancement module is designed to extract beneficial features from the estimated noise to improve speech quality. Finally, a proposed weighted speech distortion loss function is applied through multi-task joint training to further enhance recognition performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the word error rate in speech recognition by 17.57% compared to baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {Traditional Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) aims to establish a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables. It will convert the original data into one-dimensional vectors, thus destroying the structural information of the data and generating dimensional catastrophes. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel model CNNM2DPLSR called Two-Dimensional Partial Least Squares Regression (2DPLSR) with Manifold Optimization based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Firstly, deep features are extracted from the original data using CNN, which are taken as the new independent variables. To retain the structural information of the data, after performing bilateral dimensionality reduction on the independent variables, the resulting low-dimensional features are multiplied by the dependent variable to maximize the inner product, thereby obtaining the bilateral dimensionality reduction matrix. Finally, an objective function for the model is constructed and undergoes a detailed derivation process. Given that the dimensionality reduction matrix satisfies the column orthogonality constraints, the manifold optimization approach is operated in this model to obtain more accurate numerical solutions. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed method has lower classification error rates and better adaptability than other representative methods.},

While previous studies have attempted to address this through uncertainty estimation and relabeling, they have overlooked the accuracy of uncertainty learning and the adaptability of label correction. We propose Adaptive Label Modification based on Uncertainty Learning (ALM-UL), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts noisy labels based on learned uncertainty without manual sample selection. ALM-UL consists of two key components: (1) an uncertainty learning module that obtains precise uncertainty value by focusing on relatively challenging samples, and (2) an adaptive label modification module that revises noisy labels using the learned uncertainty. This approach allows ALM-UL to concentrate on critical facial samples and implement a parameter-free relabeling mechanism, effectively mitigating the impact of uncertain samples. Our method is easily implementable with minimal additional parameters. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that ALM-UL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving an average improvement of 2% in recognition accuracy.},

To overcome the limitation, the FDC model is proposed as a novel embedded feature selection approach grounded in granular computing theory. By incorporating a fuzzy consistency metric, the FDC model enables nonlinear mapping from the feature space to the decision space, capturing the intricate relationship between features and decisions. FDC integrates a dual mechanism of fusion fuzzy information decision learning and classification reward, allowing it to simultaneously account for both the fuzzy and explicit aspects of classification. Experimental evaluations on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that the FDC model effectively improves feature selection accuracy, suggesting its potential and applicability in practical settings.},

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that combines autoencoder-like NMF with dual-graph constraints for multi-view clustering (ADGNMF). This approach unifies data representation learning and data reconstruction into a single framework, enhancing the learning of low-dimensional data representations. Additionally, to capture comprehensive information, we apply dual-graph constraints to both the data and feature manifolds. The algorithm employs an iterative updating strategy to optimize the objective function.

  abstract     = {Technological advancements have resulted in the accumulation of vast amounts of data across various industries, often containing redundant or irrelevant features. As a result, the development of efficient feature selection methods has become increasingly critical. This paper proposes an Improved Binary Bat Algorithm (IBBA) to overcome the limitations of the original Bat Algorithm (BA), particularly its weak exploration ability and tendency to become trapped in local optima. IBBA enhances both exploration and exploitation through a novel Fitness-based Exploitation Strategy (FES) and an improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO). Additionally, random perturbations are introduced during iterations to adjust positions that deviate from the search space, thus preventing ineffective searches. Since the original BA is primarily designed for continuous optimization problems, this study also investigates the effect of four V-shaped transfer functions on the algorithm’s performance. Experimental results on 28 datasets with varying dimensionalities (ranging from nine to 12,600 features) demonstrate that IBBA outperforms 12 state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms in terms of fitness, accuracy, feature selection ratio, and runtime. Moreover, an analysis of exploration and exploitation shows that IBBA effectively balances these two processes, addressing BA’s exploration shortcomings. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test, conducted at a significance level of 0.05, validates the algorithm’s effectiveness, revealing that IBBA demonstrates significant advantages in 87.5% of the tests. Finally, comparisons with 14 recently proposed feature selection methods highlight IBBA’s competitive classification accuracy. Therefore, this study is expected to make a valuable contribution to solving feature selection problems across datasets with diverse dimensionalities.},

  abstract     = {Domain adaptation object detection (DAOD) uses the labeled data of one scene (i.e., the source domain) and the unlabeled data of another unfamiliar scene (i.e., the target domain) to train the cross-domain object detector. Most existing methods align the overall distribution of features by adversarial adaptive methods. Despite their success, these methods are primarily designed for two-stage detectors that are challenging to deploy, resulting in limited practical applications. In addition, owing to the instability of adversarial domain discriminator training, inducing the detector is difficult using only an adversarial adaptive strategy to extract instance-level domain-invariant features to align the overall distribution. To address these issues, we propose a new cross-domain object detection framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series of algorithms named Disentanglement Representation YOLO (DRY). The developed method achieves feature disentanglement in the channel dimension and spatial dimensions through domain-invariant feature disentanglement (DIFD) and instance-level feature disentanglement (ILFD) modules, respectively, prompting the detector to extract domain-invariant features. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods. It achieved an average accuracy value of 42.7 on the Cityscapes to FoggyCityscapes benchmark and significantly outperformed all other methods on human and car objects. The average accuracy values of 49.0 and 49.5 achieved on the SIM10K to Cityscapes and KITTI to Cityscapes scenarios, respectively, are superior to those of existing methods. Extensive experimental results on various datasets verify that the proposed DRY method is effective and widely applicable. The code is available at https://github.com/BJUTsipl/DRY .},

It is proposed that fuzzy time series modeling, with fuzzy logical relationships (FLRs) predicted by deep learning, and hyperparameters (fuzzy order and length of intervals) defined by swarm intelligence, can effectively forecast non-stationary time series data. The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for accurate time series forecasting models that can adapt to multiple successive waves of the pandemic caused by dynamically evolving variants of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) having distinctive spread patterns. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid time series forecasting model integrating high-order FTS, context-augmented variants of the long short-term memory network (LSTM), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), is proposed for accurate forecasting of COVID-19 cases associated with multiple COVID-19 waves. Attention and convolution mechanisms are explored for context augmentation in LSTM. The proposed hybrid model is evaluated on five different datasets of COVID-19 confirmed cases in USA, UK, India, Russia and Italy, in the duration of June 1, 2020 to April 15, 2022, encompassing multiple COVID-19 waves. The model forecasts are compared with five state-of-the-art time series forecasting models using five different performance metrics. Experimental results prove that the hybrid of FTS, attention-bidirectional-LSTM, and PSO (FTS+PSO+Attention-Bi-LSTM) performs consistently best for all countries. Nemenyi statistical significance test verifies that FTS+PSO+Attention-Bi-LSTM is the leading model for time series forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic with 95% confidence.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing complexity of user-item interactions on the Internet, it is important to profile users and model their preferences in recommender systems. Traditional methods, including metric learning, rely on historical user-item interactions to model preferences but struggle in sparse data scenarios. While item tags offer valuable auxiliary information to enhance representations, their shared nature across items makes it challenging to effectively profile users with tags, which requires preserving user personalization through high-quality tag representations. Moreover, traditional optimization for user/item representations always takes place in Euclidean space, where the unconstrained nature of embedding norms tends to lean toward trivial solutions. This may bias the system towards common or popular preferences, thus suppressing the variety in tag-aware user profiles. To this end, we propose to profile users with tag-enhanced spherical metric learning for recommendation, named UTRec. Specifically, we propose an adaptive tag selection mechanism to ensure the quality of tag representations and learn tag-enhanced representations of users/items, thereby effectively profiling users. Additionally, we introduce a spherical optimization strategy for tag-enhanced recommendations to alleviate the limitations imposed by lazy learning and traditional optimization, ensuring the accuracy and diversity of user and item representations within the spherical space. Numerous experiments have been conducted on four real-world datasets, where our proposed tag-enhanced UTRec framework can bring consistent performance gains and achieve a 13.67% improvement regarding both Recall and NDCG metrics.},

  abstract     = {Detecting tiny objects in aerial images has always been a perennial challenge in computer vision. The tiny objects contain limited pixel representation and are susceptible to background noise, making accurate detection difficult. This paper proposes a novel framework for the detection of tiny objects, which is guided by an end-to-end query-based approach. There are two inherent drawbacks of previous query-based detectors: first, query-based detectors are inherently insensitive to the detection of tiny objects; second, the performance of the detectors gradually saturates as the network depth increases. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve the above problems by leveraging the property that queries are one-to-one label assignment rules. Specifically, the interactive query prediction selector first selects queries with high confidence scores as acceptable queries. Then, a contrastive learning information extractor is used to progressively assign samples to the accepted and improved noisy queries. Finally, a progressive search is used to generate refined prediction anchor boxes. We conducted extensive experiments on three publicly available aerial image datasets, namely DOTA, VisDrone, and AI-TOD, to demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our proposed method. The results show that our proposed method yields significant performance improvements in the tiny object detection task, outperforming the existing benchmark models.},

  abstract     = {Federated test-time adaptation (FTTA) aims to adapt knowledge from diverse source models to different but related unlabeled target data in an online and privacy-aware manner. However, existing FTTA methods struggle with decreased adaptation performance caused by data distribution shifts among clients. In this paper, we propose an FTTA method (ALAA-TTEA) called adaptive local aggregation average and test-time energy adaptation. The method consists of two continuous stages. First, in the federated aggregation stage, clients adaptively aggregate the global model and local model through adaptive local aggregation (ALA) to initialize the client model. Then, they obtain the global model through personalized training and model averaging. Second, in the test-time adaptation stage, test-time energy adaptation (TTEA) uses an energy function to transform the global model into an energy-based model. It aligns the model distribution with the test data distribution, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to adapt to the test distribution and improving overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALAA-TTEA effectively handles data distribution shifts, including feature shift, label shift, hybrid shift, and domain shift. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing FTTA methods under most conditions.},

  abstract     = {Computing with words has proven to be a valuable tool for directly processing linguistic information. However, due to the different states of objects at different times or places, how to dynamically obtain the relations and hierarchical structures of linguistic expressions in different contexts is always a challenge. This paper proposes a computing with linguistic expressions (CWLE) model based on linguistic concept lattices to address this challenge. To handle uncertainty in linguistic expressions, interval type-2 fuzzy sets are first employed to model them, with an initial order established via the centroid mean, enabling flexible adaptation to varied contexts. Second, the linguistic label formal context automates fuzzy set generation, while a fuzzy linguistic-valued lattice is constructed based on the similarity and hierarchical relationships among linguistic expressions. In addition, a hierarchical generation algorithm further captures complex contextual relationships. Finally, comparative analysis demonstrates the CWLE model’s effectiveness in accurately representing the hierarchical structure of linguistic expressions.},

  abstract     = {Because most data in the real world can be represented in graph structures, graph mining is essential in many fields. In recent decades, research on algorithms for mining frequent subgraphs in graph databases has matured. In addition to frequent patterns, periodic and closed patterns are important in real life. However, the definition of periodic patterns in the precedent study is rigorous and has certain limitations, so that many approximate periodic patterns cannot be mined. Thus, based on the study of periodic patterns in itemset databases, we define periodic frequent subgraphs (PFSs) in dynamic graphs using the three measures: average periodicity, maximum periodicity, and minimum periodicity. The task of PFS mining is to discover all the PFSs in a given database. We propose the PFS Miner (PFSM) algorithm to realize this task. In addition, we propose closed PFSs (CPFSs) and the corresponding mining algorithm named CPFS Miner (CPFSM) to make the excavated periodic frequent patterns more concise. Finally, we conduct experiments on real datasets to analyze the performance of the algorithms. The experimental results indicate that the PFSM algorithm can mine meaningful periodic frequent patterns and CPFSM can mine closed periodic frequent patterns with good efficiency and performance.},

  abstract     = {Flatness control is an important means to improve the quality of the strip, and modern tandem cold rolling mills are equipped with various control actuators. The existing flatness control efficiency is determined offline and remains constant throughout the manufacturing process. During actual manufacturing, equipment, and process states may change, making it necessary to identify flatness control efficiency online. The main flatness feedback control strategy is a fixed priority sequence in the existing CVC (Continuous Variable Crown) cold tandem rolling mill. The control system does not have the flexibility to adjust the sequence based on real-time flatness. Aiming at the above problems, in order to improve the effect of flatness control, this paper proposes a dynamic flatness feedback control strategy based on control efficiency identification. To address the issue of high cost and difficulty in updating the on-site flatness control efficiency, based on historical actual data, the IGWO (improved grey wolf optimization) algorithm is used to intelligently identify control efficiency. Data post-processing through IF (isolated forests) and CLT (central limit theorem) obtains results on control efficiency. At the same time, a similarity index is proposed to dynamically adjust the priority sequence of feedback control based on the identification results of the control efficiency and the measured flatness deviations. Finally, the field application results show that the flatness control accuracy is improved, the reduction value of the flatness deviations increased by 13.41%, and the reduction rate of the flatness deviations increased by 9.66%.},

  abstract     = {Feature selections (FSs) can greatly reduce the dimensionality and complexity of data, improving the efficiency of data mining and classification learning. For interval-valued ordered decision systems (IVODSs), FSs rely on dominance degrees and information measures; however, there are few selection algorithms based on fusion measurements and few semantic analyses of dominance degrees. Around IVODSs, this paper proposes fuzzy probability dominance rough sets (FPDRSs), an information measurement system and a fusion measure, and thus it constructs a systemic FSs framework. Firstly, we utilize a probability density function to propose the fuzzy probability dominance degree (FPD) that can deeply characterize the fuzzy probability dominance relation (FPDR) between any ordered interval values, and define fuzzy probability dominance dual approximations and dependency (FPDD), so FPDRSs are constructed. Then, the fuzzy probability dominance information entropy, conditional entropy (FPDCE), joint entropy and mutual information are obtained to constitute an information measurement system. Furthermore, a fuzzy probability dominance dependency-conditional entropy (FPDDCE) is defined. In addition, the monotonicity and nonmonotonicity of uncertainty measures are studied. Afterwards, three algorithms FPDD-FS, FPDCE-FS and FPDDCE-FS are constructed by using FPDD, FPDCE and FPDDCE, where attribute significance is used for heuristic searches. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measures is verified through data experiments, and three proposed algorithms achieve better classification performance than six comparative algorithms.},
