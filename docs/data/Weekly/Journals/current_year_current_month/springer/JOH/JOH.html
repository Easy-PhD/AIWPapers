  abstract     = {This paper introduces the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available, is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the $$\alpha $$ -neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework’s ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.},

  abstract     = {Given a collection L of n subsets of a finite set R, the Maximum Intersection of k-Subsets problem (kMIS) aims to select a subset $$L' \subseteq L$$ with $$|L'| = k$$ such that the intersection of the subsets in $$L'$$ is maximized. This problem is $$\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$$ -hard and has applications in data anonymization, bioinformatics, recommendation systems, and various other fields. In this work, we propose an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm for solving the kMIS. The local search phase uses the swap(1,1) neighborhood structure. To enhance efficiency, we introduce an auxiliary data structure which precomputes partial intersections, reducing the complexity of evaluating a neighboring solution from $$O(k^2)$$ to O(k). The proposed ILS was evaluated against two state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature on 238 benchmark instances. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach efficiently finds high-quality solutions, establishing its competitiveness for solving the kMIS.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a study of the robust (non-deterministic) job scheduling problem with interval release dates on unrelated machines. Robust optimization is a tractable alternative to stochastic optimization suited for problems in which parameter distributions are undetermined due to insufficient data. Our problem formulation involves minimizing the maximum regret, defined as the worst-case deviation from an optimal makespan, with the assumption that each release date belongs to a well-defined interval. Mathematical analysis is accomplished to investigate the properties of the robust scheduling problem examining the inapproximability, determination of the upper bound of a regret function, and selection of feasible scenarios. In order to solve the robust scheduling problem, we propose an algorithm that implements a greedy strategy and schedules jobs using only the deterministic criterion (the makespan) instead of assessing the worst-case regret value. We compare the quality of our schedules with the solutions obtained by the properly adapted and tuned simulated annealing algorithm. Additionally, the applicability of our robust approach (robust framework) in the Scheduling-Location problem (deterministic problem in which the parameters are precisely defined), which combines the facility location problem and job scheduling problem, is demonstrated. The numerical evaluation shows that including the uncertainty and regret-averse (the minimax regret criterion) can allow, in certain cases, to achieve optimal solutions for incomplete dataset.},
