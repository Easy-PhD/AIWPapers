  abstract     = {This paper introduces the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), a versatile and efficient stochastic local search method tailored to combinatorial optimization problems. Using the random-key concept, RKO encodes solutions as vectors of random keys that are subsequently decoded into feasible solutions via problem-specific decoders. The RKO framework is able to combine a plethora of classic metaheuristics, each capable of operating independently or in parallel, with solution sharing facilitated through an elite solution pool. This modular approach allows for the adaptation of various metaheuristics, including simulated annealing, iterated local search, and greedy randomized adaptive search procedures, among others. The efficacy of the RKO framework, implemented in C++ and publicly available, is demonstrated through its application to three NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems: the $$\alpha $$ -neighborhood p-median problem, the tree of hubs location problem, and the node-capacitated graph partitioning problem. The results highlight the framework’s ability to produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem domains, underscoring its potential as a robust tool for combinatorial optimization.},

  abstract     = {Given a collection L of n subsets of a finite set R, the Maximum Intersection of k-Subsets problem (kMIS) aims to select a subset $$L' \subseteq L$$ with $$|L'| = k$$ such that the intersection of the subsets in $$L'$$ is maximized. This problem is $$\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$$ -hard and has applications in data anonymization, bioinformatics, recommendation systems, and various other fields. In this work, we propose an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm for solving the kMIS. The local search phase uses the swap(1,1) neighborhood structure. To enhance efficiency, we introduce an auxiliary data structure which precomputes partial intersections, reducing the complexity of evaluating a neighboring solution from $$O(k^2)$$ to O(k). The proposed ILS was evaluated against two state-of-the-art metaheuristics from the literature on 238 benchmark instances. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach efficiently finds high-quality solutions, establishing its competitiveness for solving the kMIS.},
