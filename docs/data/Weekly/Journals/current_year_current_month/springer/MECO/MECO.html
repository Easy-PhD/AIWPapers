  abstract     = {Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) is a fine-grained task that aims to analyze users’ sentiment polarity towards target aspects through different and rich modal contents. In conjunction with this topic, many methods have been proposed to link modalities to form interactive judgments of emotional tendencies. However, the currently proposed methods have some disadvantages: (1) Since some image modalities are unrelated to text modalities, information irrelevant to the aspect will be introduced; (2) Different modalities are difficult to complement each other during the fusion process, resulting in poor fusion performance, and the fusion process may also introduce additional noise. To address these issues, we propose a novel MABSA network model that combines a simple noise filtering approach with an innovative fast learning method for effective classification. Specifically, for the visual modality, we introduce an image content filtering (ICF) layer to filter out information that is not relevant to the aspect and text modalities. In addition, in the fusion stage, we proposed an excellent bidirectional interactive prompt fusion (BIPF) layer, which integrates prompt learning into the query and fusion stages, realizes the fusion of different modalities and contextual semantic information, and makes modal fusion more comprehensive. The outcomes of our experiments indicate that the model we developed attains leading-edge performance levels when tested on two MABSA datasets. Furthermore, a large number of experiments have shown that the model we put forward exhibits remarkable performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Path planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments with high dimensionality attempts to search for waypoint sequences always of increased size. Such a challenging task can be considered as a multi-objective Large-Scale Global Optimization (LSGO) problem where efficient solving requires more sophisticated algorithms. In this paper, a novel Parallel Cooperative Coevolutionary Multi-Objective Multi-Verse Optimization (PCCMOMVO) algorithm is developed and successfully applied. In this Cooperative Coevolutionary (CC) framework, a MOMVO algorithm is considered to design an improved subcomponent optimizer based on an allocated multi-core CPU architecture and a Message Passing Interface (MPI). The MOMVO population is divided into sub-populations, called species, where each of them is responsible for optimizing a subcomponent of the LSGO problem according to the “divide-and-conquer” concept of CC framework. To form a complete candidate solution of the whole LSGO path planning problem, each species shares a number of representative solutions selected from the Pareto non-dominated ones found so far. The selection process is based on the Pareto ranks achieved by the use of a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). A parallelization mechanism based on a simple yet efficient master–slave model and allocated MPI is implemented to provide acceleration in computation runtime. Demonstrative results and ANOVA tests are presented over planning scenarios with increased complexity to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the PCCMOMVO algorithm. Extensive evaluations and comparisons are carried out in terms of collision-avoidance capabilities, path shortness and efficiency against the curse of dimensionality and computational time consumption.},
