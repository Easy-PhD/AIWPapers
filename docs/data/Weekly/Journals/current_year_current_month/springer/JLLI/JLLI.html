  abstract     = {To avoid the risk of problems to do with division by zero (DbZ), arithmetical texts involving division use what may be called traditional conventions on DbZ. Earlier, we developed a method for exploring these conventions using informal notions of legal and illegal texts, which are used to analyse simple fragments of arithmetical texts. We showed how these texts can be transformed into logical formulae over special total algebras, called common meadows, that are able to approximate partiality but in a total world. The subtleties of the legal/illegal distinction call for further development of these mathematical methods. Here we examine a more complex type of text, namely proof by contradiction, in which inconsistent assumptions can coexist with DbZ. We formulate more advanced criteria of legality for this case. We introduce a three-valued logic to capture the resulting semiformal conventions that is based on a notion we call frugal equality for partial operators. We apply the method to a proof of the Bayes-Price Theorem in probability theory, whose proof has DbZ issues.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a novel proof-theoretic approach to a logic specifically designed to handle exceptions and typicality. Our method extends the classical first-order sequent calculus by incorporating a specialized framework to manage both negative extra-logical information (explicit exceptions) and positive information (background assumptions). We prove that the resulting sequent calculi satisfy the cut-elimination theorem, thereby ensuring strong analytical properties. Furthermore, we show how this framework effectively models traditional reasoning patterns involving conflicting information and typicality. Finally, we establish a natural correspondence between our approach and the Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor postulates, further grounding our work within established theoretical foundations.},

  abstract     = {There is an alternative semantics for multi-modal (epistemic) logics based on (world, agent) pairs (see, e.g., Grove, Artificial Intelligence, 1995). Denote it by $$Sem_{\langle w,a\rangle }$$ . It is effectively applied to multi-modal logics with quantification over agents of knowledge (or over their names). In this paper, we consider propositional modal logic with quantification over propositions ( $$SOPML$$ ) and introduce an alternative semantics for this logic also based on pairs, but pairs of a slightly different kind, namely, on (world, proposition) pairs. Denote it by $$Sem_{\langle w,p\rangle }$$ . Some key properties of $$Sem_{\langle w,a\rangle }$$ , as well as the principles for constructing this semantics will be taken as a basis to define $$Sem_{\langle w,p\rangle }$$ . Within the framework of the introduced semantics, we define general (or Henkin) frames and present a decidable modal two-variable fragment of $$SOPML$$ interpreted on these frames ( $$SOPML^H_{tvf}$$ ). $$SOPML^H_{tvf}$$ allows us to express all challenges considered in (Shtakser 2023a, J.Log.Lang.Inf.,) and inexpressible in a decidable modal loosely guarded fragment of $$SOPML$$ presented in that paper. The fragment $$SOPML^H_{tvf}$$ partially satisfies the principle of non-Fregean logic: two different atomic propositions with the same truth value can have different contents. Also we define relating connectives in $$SOPML^H_{tvf}$$ and prove that the weak Boethius’ Thesis built using these connectives is a valid formula of this fragment.},

  abstract     = {Measurement is about finding structure in a set of objects (or events). It is about associating a set of objects whose structure we wish to understand with a set of formal objects, typically numbers, whose structure we understand. Underlying measurements are the four types of scales (nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio), which differ in how much information they provide about the objects being measured. These scale types are classified into those that involve a unit of measurement (interval and ratio) and those that do not (nominal and ordinal). In this paper, we make use of this distinction to formulate a hypothesis about the nature of human concepts. We suggest that humans and only humans mentally represent concepts that rely on measurement scales that invoke a unit (i.e. interval and ratio scales). We test this uniqueness claim in the context of social cognition and show that this hypothesis provides a principled account of why certain forms of sociality are only observed in human relations. We highlight the fact that the significance of measurement scales in the study of cognition in general and human cognition in particular is yet to be appreciated.},
