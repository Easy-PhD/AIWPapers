  abstract     = {Given a multigraph $$G=(V,E)$$ , the edge-coloring problem (ECP) is to color the edges of G with the minimum number of colors so that no two adjacent edges have the same color. This problem can be naturally formulated as an integer program, and its linear programming relaxation is referred to as the fractional edge-coloring problem (FECP). The optimal value of ECP (resp. FECP) is called the chromatic index (resp. fractional chromatic index) of G, denoted by $$\chi '(G)$$ (resp. $$\chi ^*(G)$$ ). Let $$\Delta (G)$$ be the maximum degree of G and let $$\Gamma (G)$$ be the density of G, defined by $$\begin{aligned} \Gamma (G)=\max \left\{ \frac{2|E(U)|}{|U|-1}:\,\, U \subseteq V, \,\, |U|\ge 3 \hspace{5.69054pt}\textrm{and} \hspace{5.69054pt}\textrm{odd} \right\} , \end{aligned}$$ where E(U) is the set of all edges of G with both ends in U. Clearly, $$\max \{\Delta (G), \, \lceil \Gamma (G) \rceil \}$$ is a lower bound for $$\chi '(G)$$ . As shown by Seymour, $$\chi ^*(G)=\max \{\Delta (G), \, \Gamma (G)\}$$ . In the early 1970s Goldberg and Seymour independently conjectured that $$\chi '(G) \le \max \{\Delta (G)+1, \, \lceil \Gamma (G) \rceil \}$$ . Over the past five decades this conjecture, a cornerstone in modern edge-coloring, has been a subject of extensive research, and has stimulated an important body of work. In this paper we present a proof of this conjecture. Our result implies that, first, there are only two possible values for $$\chi '(G)$$ , so an analogue to Vizing’s theorem on edge-colorings of simple graphs holds for multigraphs; second, although it is NP-hard in general to determine $$\chi '(G)$$ , we can approximate it within one of its true value, and find it exactly in polynomial time when $$\Gamma (G)>\Delta (G)$$ ; third, every multigraph G satisfies $$\chi '(G)-\chi ^*(G) \le 1$$ , and thus FECP has a fascinating integer rounding property.},

The Pareto-scheduling problem is studied in this paper, which includes the hierarchical-scheduling problem as a subversion. By using the single-machine scheduling with generated completion times model introduced by Zhao and Yuan (J Comb Optim 39:637–661, 2020), we present an $$O(n^2)$$ -time algorithm to solve the Pareto-scheduling problem, and two $$O(n\log n)$$ -time algorithms to solve two hierarchical-scheduling problems, respectively. Our $$O(n\log n)$$ -time algorithms improve the $$O(n^2\log n)$$ -time algorithms given by Sarin and Prakash (J Comb Optim 8:227–240, 2004) to solve two hierarchical-scheduling problems on identical parallel machines.},

  abstract     = {Email communication is used by around 87% of the business communities for internal and external communication. The detection of emotion in email communication along with visual analytics is a frontier laden with potential but still it has its challenges. They face challenges such as measuring effect of emotional cues, lack of capability for visualizations, integrating seamlessly into existing platforms and implementation of multimodal analysis. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a multimodal architecture known as EmoMAC that will help in analysing emotions in emails. By incorporating the multimodal data of the MELD dataset, it enhances the comprehensive interpretation of emotional dynamics. For textual analysis, the proposed model includes DelighT transformer with attention scaling and multi head attention incorporated into the model. For the extraction of dynamic visual features from videos, Dynamic Spatio Temporal Feature Pyramid Network with Pyramid Pooling (DSTFP) is used. Other features such as the sender-receiver relationship, the time stamps, which are obtained from the contextual schemes can easily be incorporated by the Bias Induced Sparse Hierarchical Attention Module (BiSHAM) which utilizes a bias aware attention module for feature fusion. For versatility in new task or data EmoMAC utilizes MAML algorithm for adaptability. Using Meaningful Neural Network (MNN), EmoMAC integrates text, image, and contextual data for emotion detection within emails. Rigorous evaluation accuracy of 90.10%, precision of 95.23%, recall of 91.65%, F1 score of 92.45%, and wa-F1 score of 88.47% validates EmoMAC’s efficacy in capturing emotional nuances and provides insights for visual analytics of emotions within email.},
