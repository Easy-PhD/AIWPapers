  abstract     = {We present improvements to famous algorithms for community detection, namely Newman’s spectral method algorithm and the Louvain algorithm. The Newman algorithm begins by treating the original graph as a single cluster, then repeats the process to split each cluster into two, based on the signs of the eigenvector corresponding to the second-largest eigenvalue. Our improvement involves replacing the time-consuming computation of eigenvalues with a random walk during the splitting process. The Louvain algorithm iteratively performs the following steps until no increase in modularity can be achieved anymore: each step consists of two phases–phase 1 for partitioning the graph into clusters, and phase 2 for constructing a new graph where each vertex represents one cluster obtained from phase 1. We propose an improvement to this algorithm by adding our random walk algorithm as an additional phase for refining clusters obtained from phase 1. It maintains a complexity comparable to the Louvain algorithm while exhibiting superior efficiency. To validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conducted experiments using randomly generated graphs and real-world data.},

  abstract     = {The facility location game, where the agents’ locations are on a line, is considered in this paper. The input consists of the reported locations of agents, which are collected as part of the game setup. We introduce the concept of a fairness baseline and define a function to characterize each agent’s satisfaction with the facility location. Our objective is to establish a mechanism that obtains the true information of agents and outputs a single facility location so that the sum of all agents’ satisfaction with the location is maximized. For the game with two agents, we propose a $$\frac{5}{4}$$ -approximate strategy-proof mechanism, which is the best possible. In the general case, we demonstrate that the median mechanism achieves an approximation ratio of $$\frac{3}{2}$$ . In particular, the median mechanism is an optimal group strategy-proof mechanism for the game with three agents. Additionally, we devise a $$\frac{1+\sqrt{3}}{2}$$ -approximation group strategy-proof mechanism by modifying the median mechanism. We also consider social satisfaction in the obnoxious facility location game and design a mechanism based on the median of the input.},

  abstract     = {The maximum expert consensus model (MECM) aims to maximize the number of consensual decision-makers (DMs) within a limited budget. However, it may fail to achieve high group satisfaction or even cannot reach an acceptable consensus due to its neglect of the group consensus level, resulting in type- $$\alpha $$ constraints not being satisfied. To address this issue, we extend the existing MECM by considering both type- $$\alpha $$ and type- $$\varepsilon $$ consensus constraints to enable the group consensus level and the number of consensual DMs as large as possible. Firstly, we construct a dual-MECM that considers the above two constraints. Secondly, we further develop a dual-MECM considering compromise limits (dual-MECM-CL). To provide a reference for budgeting, a dual minimum cost consensus model (dual-MCCM) is established to determine the upper and lower bounds of the budget. Subsequently, we explore the relationships between the two proposed MECMs and the existing MECM. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed models is illustrated by numerical examples. The results show that: (1) The dual-MECM can ensure that the majority of DMs reach consensus while maintaining a high group consensus level. (2) With a limited budget, the improvement of the overall consensus level will lead to the reduction in the number of consensual DMs. (3) Consideration of individual compromise limits may reduce the number of consensual DMs within the same budget. Therefore, the proposed models can derive a more reasonable consensus result due to full consideration of consensus measurements and DMs’ behaviors.},

  abstract     = {In transportation networks, routing problems are cursed with arbitrary changes occurring in the dataset due to unpredictable events like agent breakdown (sensor or vehicle failure), network connectivity changes, resource/demand fluctuations, etc. Moreover, capacity restriction on the agents may require multi-trip solutions for meeting large demands over networks. For example, a battery-powered inspection wagon can only service a limited number of track sections in a single trip. We investigate a moving horizon approach for the multi-trip dynamic capacitated arc routing problem with limited duration to mitigate the limitations of CARP variants in the literature. The proposed approach addresses arbitrary changes in the underlying network, agent unavailability scenarios, and simultaneously satisfies the time limit on meeting all demands. The moving horizon approach subdivides the planning horizon to determine the current trip (single-trip) for all agents, hence coined as Moving Horizon Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (MH-CARP). The proposed MH-CARP is formulated as a set covering problem that considers both partial and full trips (trips may not start at the depot), making it suitable for tackling arbitrary events by re-planning. Theoretical results for the computation of dual variables are derived and then implemented in the column generation algorithm to obtain lower bounds. The algorithm is validated on a widely available dataset for CARP, having instances of up to 147 tasks that require servicing by up to 20 agents. Using this benchmark data, the partial-trip based re-planning strategy is also validated. Lastly, a simulation study is presented to demonstrate the re-planning strategy and compare an MH-CARP solution to two CARP based solutions - one with no arbitrary events and the other with known arbitrary events. The results also convey that greedy solutions are avoided to satisfy the limited duration restriction, and automatic re-ordering of the trips is achieved to compensate for arbitrary events.},

  abstract     = {Strengthened notions of a matching M of a graph G have been considered, requiring that the matching M has some properties with respect to the subgraph $$G_M$$ of G induced by the vertices covered by M: If M is the unique perfect matching of $$G_M,$$ then M is a uniquely restricted matching of G; if all the edges of M are pendant edges of $$G_M,$$ then M is a semistrong matching of G; if all the vertices of $$G_M$$ are pendant, then M is an induced matching of G. Strengthened notions of edge coloring and of the chromatic index follow. In this paper, we consider the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with given maximum degree $$\Delta .$$ We prove that graphs with maximum average degree less than 14/5 have semistrong chromatic index (hence uniquely restricted chromatic index) at most $$2\Delta +4,$$ and we reduce the bound to $$2\Delta +2$$ if the maximum average degree is less than 8/3. These cases cover, in particular, the cases of planar graphs with girth at least 7 (resp. at least 8). Our result makes some progress on the conjecture of Lužar et al. (J Graph Theory 105:612–632, 2024), which asserts that every planar graph G has a semistrong edge coloring with $$2\Delta +C$$ colors, for some universal constant C. (Note that such a conjecture would fail for strong edge coloring as there exist graphs with arbitrarily large maximum degree that are not strongly $$(4\Delta -5)$$ -edge-colorable.) We provide an example of a planar graph showing that the maximum semistrong chromatic index of planar graphs with maximum degree $$\Delta $$ is at least $$2\Delta +4.$$},

In the routing phase, a packet originating at any source vertex of P is routed to its destination vertex belonging to P. At every vertex v of P along the routing path, until the packet reaches its destination, the next hop is determined using the routing tables at v and the additional information (including the packet’s destination vertex label) in the packet. We show our routing scheme constructs routing tables in $$O\big (n \big (1+\frac{1}{\epsilon }\big ) \big (\lg {n}\big )^3\big )$$ time and the routing tables at all the vertices of P together use $$O\big (n+\frac{n}{\epsilon }\big (\lg {n}\big )^3\big )$$ space.

In this paper, a self-learning method that combines Monte Carlo tree search with deep reinforcement learning is proposed to efficiently solve the graph coloring problem. This method offers two principal advantages. Firstly, it leverages deep reinforcement learning to eliminate the necessity for manual feature construction and data labeling. Secondly, by combining the neural network with Monte Carlo tree search, the neural network can provide comprehensive guidance based on the structural information of the graph, facilitating a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation, thereby leading to superior solutions. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed herein has distinct advantages over existing graph coloring algorithms. Moreover, this approach also exhibits outstanding performance when dealing with graph instances whose vertex size surpasses those encountered during the training phase.},

In this paper, we focus on two specific classes of trees: $${{\mathcal {T}}}_{n,b}$$ , the set of all n-vertex trees with b branching vertices, and $${{\mathcal {T}}}_{n,\Delta }$$ , the set of all n-vertex trees with prescribed maximum degree $$\Delta $$ . Thus the purpose of this paper is twofold concerning the $$\mathcal{S}\mathcal{O}_\alpha $$ index: (i) to characterize the minimal trees in $${{\mathcal {T}}}_{n,b}$$ when $$\alpha > 0$$ , and (ii) to characterize the maximal trees in $${{\mathcal {T}}}_{n,\Delta }$$ when $$0<\alpha < 1$$ . The results of (i) hold true even when the class $${{\mathcal {T}}}_{n,b}$$ is confined to the class of chemical trees and also recover previously known results for the Sombor index. The findings in (ii) resolve a previously posed problem for the $$\mathcal{S}\mathcal{O}_{\alpha }\,(0<\alpha <1)$$ index and, moreover, establish analogous results for the well-known general sum-connectivity index, thereby addressing the corresponding unresolved cases for both indices.},

Until now, no methods have been presented that guarantee optimal solutions to this volume maximisation problem while considering continuous free rotation of the item, with approaches relying on heuristics, approximations or enforcing a discrete number of rotations. We aim to find optimal solutions when considering continuous rotation, represented using quaternions. This enables modelling rotation through quadratic constraints. The resulting quadratically constrained problem can be solved to optimality by mathematical solvers. To keep the required computation time within reasonable limits, various improvements to the model such as symmetry breaking are introduced. Experiments show that the majority of our benchmark instances can be solved to optimality within minutes. The expansion to concave containers is also explored, but proves to be more challenging as the required number of quadratic constraints quickly becomes prohibitive.},
