  abstract     = {Analysis of covariance is a crucial method for improving precision of statistical tests for factor effects in randomized experiments. However, existing solutions suffer from one or more of the following limitations: (i) they are not suitable for ordinal data (as endpoints or explanatory variables); (ii) they require semiparametric model assumptions; (iii) they are inapplicable to small data scenarios due to often poor type-I error control; or (iv) they provide only approximate testing procedures and (asymptotically) exact test are missing. A resampling approach to the NANCOVA framework is investigated. NANCOVA is a fully nonparametric model based on relative effects that allows for an arbitrary number of covariates and groups, where both outcome variable (endpoint) and covariates can be metric or ordinal. Novel NANCOVA tests and a nonparametric competitor test without covariate adjustment were evaluated in extensive simulations. Unlike approximate tests in the NANCOVA framework, the proposed resampling version showed good performance in small sample scenarios and maintained the nominal type-I error well. Resampling NANCOVA also provided consistently high power: up to 26 % higher than the test without covariate adjustment in a small sample scenario with 4 groups and two covariates. Moreover, it is shown that resampling NANCOVA provides an asymptotically exact testing procedure, which makes it the first one with good finite sample performance in the present NANCOVA framework. In summary, resampling NANCOVA can be considered a viable tool for analysis of covariance overcoming issues (i) - (iv).},

  abstract     = {A consistent goodness-of-fit test for distributional regression is introduced. The test statistic is based on a process that traces the difference between a nonparametric and a semi-parametric estimate of the marginal distribution function of Y . As its asymptotic null distribution is not distribution-free, a parametric bootstrap method is used to determine critical values. Empirical results suggest that, in certain scenarios, the test outperforms existing specification tests by achieving a higher power and thereby offering greater sensitivity to deviations from the assumed parametric distribution family. Notably, the proposed test does not involve any hyperparameters and can easily be applied to individual datasets using the gofreg-package in R.},

  abstract     = {Association analysis of multivariate omics outcomes is challenging due to the high dimensionality and inter-correlation among outcome variables. In practice, the classic multi-univariate analysis approaches are commonly employed, utilizing linear regression models for each individual outcome followed by adjustments for multiplicity through control of the false discovery rate (FDR) or family-wise error rate (FWER). While straightforward, these multi-univariate methods overlook dependencies between outcome variables. This oversight leads to less accurate statistical inferences, characterized by lower power and an increased false discovery rate, ultimately resulting in reduced replicability across studies. Recently, advanced frequentist and Bayesian methods have been developed to account for these dependencies. However, these methods often pose significant computational challenges for researchers in the field. To bridge this gap, a computationally efficient autoregressive multivariate regression model is proposed that explicitly accounts for the dependence structure among outcome variables. Through extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the approach provides more accurate multivariate inferences than traditional methods and remains robust even under model misspecification. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to investigate whether the associations between serum lipidomics outcomes and Alzheimer’s disease differentiate in ε 4 allele carriers and non-carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene.},

  abstract     = {The problem of breakpoint detection is considered within a regression modeling framework. A novel method, the max-EM algorithm, is introduced, combining a constrained Hidden Markov Model with the Classification-EM algorithm. This algorithm has linear complexity and provides accurate detection of breakpoints and estimation of parameters. A theoretical result is derived, showing that the likelihood of the data, as a function of the regression parameters and the breakpoints location, increases at each step of the algorithm. Two initialization methods for the breakpoints location are also presented to address local maxima issues. Finally, a statistical test in the one breakpoint situation is developed. Simulation experiments based on linear, logistic, Poisson and Accelerated Failure Time regression models show that the final method that includes the initialization procedure and the max-EM algorithm has a strong performance both in terms of parameters estimation and breakpoints detection. The statistical test is also evaluated and exhibits a correct rejection rate under the null hypothesis and a strong power under various alternatives. Two real dataset are analyzed, the UCI bike sharing and the health disease data, where the interest of the method to detect heterogeneity in the distribution of the data is illustrated.},

The procedure is fully nonparametric and has a Bayesian motivation and interpretation. Indeed, the recursive algorithm follows a certain Bayesian update, defined by the predictive distribution of a Dirichlet process mixture of linear regression models. Consistency of the algorithm is demonstrated under mild assumptions, and numerical accuracy in finite samples is shown via simulations and real data examples. The algorithm is very fast to implement, it is parallelizable, sequential, and requires limited computing power.},
