  abstract     = {This paper develops a general asymptotic theory for nonparametric kernel regression in the presence of cluster dependence. We examine nonparametric density estimation, Nadarayaâ€“Watson kernel regression, and local linear estimation. Our theory accommodates growing and heterogeneous cluster sizes. We derive asymptotic conditional bias and variance, establish uniform consistency, and prove asymptotic normality. Our findings reveal that under heterogeneous cluster sizes, the asymptotic variance includes a new term reflecting within-cluster dependence, which is overlooked when cluster sizes are presumed to be bounded. We propose valid approaches for bandwidth selection and inference, introduce estimators of the asymptotic variance, and demonstrate their consistency. In simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the cluster-robust bandwidth selection and show that the derived cluster-robust confidence interval improves the coverage ratio. We illustrate the application of these methods using a policy-targeting dataset in development economics.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies parameter estimation using L-moments, an alternative to traditional moments with attractive statistical properties. The estimation of model parameters by matching sample L-moments is known to outperform maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) in small samples from popular distributions. The choice of the number of L-moments used in estimation remains ad-hoc , though: researchers typically set the number of L-moments equal to the number of parameters, which is inefficient in larger samples. In this paper, we show that, by properly choosing the number of L-moments and weighting these accordingly, one is able to construct an estimator that outperforms MLE in finite samples, and yet retains asymptotic efficiency. We do so by introducing a generalised method of L-moments estimator and deriving its properties in an asymptotic framework where the number of L-moments varies with sample size. We then propose methods to automatically select the number of L-moments in a sample. Monte Carlo evidence shows our approach can provide mean-squared-error improvements over MLE in smaller samples, whilst working as well as it in larger samples. We consider extensions of our approach to the estimation of conditional models and a class semiparametric models. We apply the latter to study expenditure patterns in a ridesharing platform in Brazil.},

  abstract     = {While seasonality inherent to raw macroeconomic data is commonly removed by seasonal adjustment techniques before it is used for structural inference, this may distort valuable information in the data. As an alternative method to commonly used structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) for seasonally adjusted data, we propose to model potential periodicity in seasonally unadjusted (raw) data directly by structural periodic vector autoregressions (SPVARs). This approach does not only allow for periodically time-varying intercepts, but also for periodic autoregressive parameters and innovations variances. As this larger flexibility leads to an increased number of parameters, we propose linearly constrained estimation techniques. Moreover, based on SPVARs, we provide two novel identification schemes and propose a general framework for impulse response analyses that allows for direct consideration of seasonal patterns. We provide asymptotic theory for SPVAR estimators and impulse responses under flexible linear restrictions and introduce a test for seasonality in impulse responses. For the construction of confidence intervals, we discuss several residual-based (seasonal) bootstrap methods and prove their bootstrap consistency under different assumptions. A real data application shows that useful information about the periodic structure in the data may be lost when relying on common seasonal adjustment methods.},

In the literature, the misspecification-robust inference with useless factors is known to give rise to nonstandard limiting distributions bounded stochastically to compute critical values. We show how and to what extent the wild bootstrap yields a more accurate approximation of the distribution of t -statistics when testing for an unpriced factor in the context of linear SDF models. Simulation experiments and empirical tests are also used to document the relevance of the bootstrap method.},

We adopt a block-based strategy to estimate volatility nonparametrically from the intraday observations over local time windows with asymptotically shrinking size. Our detector then tracks sequential changes in running means of the intraday volatility curve estimates. Asymptotic size and power properties of the detector follow from a weak form invariance principle, which is established under the strong mixing condition aligned with our semimartingale setup. Simulation and empirical results demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the proposed detection method.},

  abstract     = {This paper studies the principal components (PC) estimator for high dimensional approximate factor models with weak factors in that the factor loading ( Î› 0 ) scales sublinearly in the number N of cross-section units, i.e., Î› 0 âŠ¤ Î› 0 / N Î± is positive definite in the limit for some Î± âˆˆ ( 0 , 1 ) . While the consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimates are by now well known when the factors are strong, i.e., Î± = 1 , the statistical properties for weak factors remain less explored. Here, we show that the PC estimator maintains consistency and asymptotic normality for any Î± âˆˆ ( 0 , 1 ) , provided suitable conditions regarding the dependence structure in the noise are met. This complements earlier result by Onatski (2012) that the PC estimator is inconsistent when Î± = 0 , and the more recent work by Bai and Ng (2023) who established the asymptotic normality of the PC estimator when Î± âˆˆ ( 1 / 2 , 1 ) . Our proof strategy integrates the traditional eigendecomposition-based approach for factor models with leave-one-out analysis similar in spirit to those used in matrix completion and other settings. This combination allows us to deal with factors weaker than the former and at the same time relax the incoherence and independence assumptions often associated with the later.},
