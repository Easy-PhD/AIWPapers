  abstract     = {Explainable AI and model transparency methods primarily focus on classification tasks, identifying salient input features or abstract concepts that are directly tied to the data. In contrast, algorithmic problems such as SAT solving present a deeper challenge: here, meaningful concepts depend not only on the input but also on the model’s evolving internal state; hence, such settings remain underexplored. We study concept learning in an existing model named NeuroSAT , a Graph Neural Network (GNN) trained to predict satisfiability, and uncover internal algorithmic structures, most notably the notion of support , that align with classical SAT heuristics. We then construct a significantly simplified GNN trained via a teacher–student approach: instead of learning from SAT/UNSAT labels, the student is trained to mimic NeuroSAT ’s latent representations—i.e., the concepts themselves—and achieves comparable performance using 91 % fewer parameters. For this simplified architecture, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that demonstrates, under certain assumptions on the input distribution and network weights, the emergence of the concept of support and its governing role in the network’s dynamics. This work bridges explainability and algorithmic reasoning by showing that classical SAT-solving strategies emerge naturally in GNNs—and can be used to simplify, compress, and formally analyze their internal dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Cyber threats have evolved in complexity, aiming at a wide range of sectors using advanced methods and tools. This evolving threat landscape challenges existing cybersecurity frameworks, many of which lack the adaptability to counteract the complex tactics of sophisticated adversaries. Developing robust cyber defense strategies requires simulating dynamic interactions between attackers and defenders across high, moderate, and low-impact scenarios. The Flip-It cyber game serves as an intelligent framework for simulating these interactions, enabling the analysis of adaptive strategies in cybersecurity. This paper aims to address the problem of mitigating malware prevalence with full consideration of attack/defense capabilities in arbitrary network topologies. This paper proposes a sophisticated discrete-time epidemic model to characterize security state transitions over time for all three scenarios within the Flip-It game framework. On this basis, the original problem is modeled as a closed-loop control problem to seek the optimal containment strategy. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is then used to tackle the problem, generating efficient defense strategies that are well-adapted to changing cybersecurity environments. Numerical simulations based on small-world networks, scale-free networks, and router networks are then carried out to generate corresponding strategies. Additionally, we have evaluated the performance of the proposed method against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) in terms of attack/defense objective function, control actions, number of devices under the control of the attacker and defender, stability, execution time, and scalability. This comprehensive approach integrates epidemiological modeling, game theory, and advanced machine learning to effectively tackle the complexities of contemporary cybersecurity threats.},

  abstract     = {The present paper studies the self-triggered secure bipartite formation for MASs against Byzantine adversaries, where an asymptotic stabilization control protocol is designed. Compared with the existing work, a more practical situation is considered where the state of each subsystem is unmeasurable and the system output is transmitted to its neighbor agents instead of the state. First of all, a distributed bipartite formation variable (DBFV) is introduced and the bipartite formation control objective turns out to be a convergence problem of the DBFV. Then, the dynamic system of the DBFV is set up where a multiple disturbance (MD) is involved. Next, the algebraic relation between the MD and the DBFV is defined, based on which a distributed unknown input observer (DUIO) is designed such that the asymptotic convergence estimates of the DBFV and the MD are obtained. Further, a DUIO-based controller is established to realize the asymptotic stabilization of the DBFV dynamic system. Finally, a Byzantine detection and defense strategy is designed based on the self-triggered mechanism with discontinuous updates of the communication topology, where nonsmooth dynamics theory is introduced into the stability analysis of the DBFV system. The proposed strategy and controller are validated by a simulation example.},

  abstract     = {Graph coarsening is the process of simplifying large-scale graph representations while preserving essential structural characteristics to improve computational efficiency in graph processing. Conventional techniques primarily reduce graph size through node and edge merging but often inadequately preserve both global spectral properties and local structural details. Real-world graphs exhibit inherent hierarchical complexity comprising critical global topological patterns and local structural features necessary for accurate analysis. To address these limitations, we present a Multi-Granularity Spectral Graph Coarsening (MGSGC) framework that systematically integrates spectral graph analysis with local structural preservation through multi-granularity operations. Our approach initiates with hierarchical graph decomposition, where node merging generates structurally homogeneous subgraphs. Spectral analysis of normalized Laplacian matrices guides iterative coarsening optimization, using spectral distance metrics to identify subgraphs requiring refinement. A dual-resolution mechanism preserves global spectral signatures and local connectivity patterns simultaneously, ensuring retention of both macroscopic and microscopic structural information. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that MGSGC outperforms recent methods, achieving higher accuracy, superior structural preservation, and strong resilience to label noise, ensuring robust performance in real-world scenarios.

  abstract     = {Accurate forecasting of power generation helps to assess the stability of the supply of power generation and to better plan the use of electrical energy. China’s power generation exhibits seasonal oscillations, nonlinear growth, and uncertain fluctuations. The interval numbers can reflect the range of uncertainty fluctuations in the data. Therefore, the three-parameter interval grey numbers prediction of China’s power generation is studied. A matrixed Fourier grey Euler Bernoulli model MFGEBM(1,1) for three-parameter interval grey numbers is proposed. First, a seasonal factor is introduced into a new Caputo fractional accumulation generation operator to reduce the seasonal volatility of the sequence. Secondly, the Fourier series and Bernoulli’s equation are introduced into the grey Euler model to further improve the applicability to sequences with seasonal oscillations. Then, based on a new convergence factor and triangular walking strategy, the grey wolf algorithm is improved to optimize the model’s parameters, and its effectiveness is verified with algorithm comparison experiments. In order to test the accuracy of the model proposed in this paper, two cases with different development trends and related to power are studied, and four existing grey models for seasonal oscillation sequences are used as competing models. Finally, the proposed model is used to forecast China ’s power generation.},

  abstract     = {We investigate the identification of the Boolean algebra ℘ ( X ) of all subsets of a universe X with the set E ( X ) = { 0 , 1 } X of characteristic functions, focusing on the expression of the complement operation in three equivalent forms. Building on this, we extend the framework to fuzzy sets f : X → [ 0 , 1 ] , which form a complete distributive lattice equipped with three distinct complement operations: • the Zadeh (Kleene) complement f ′ ( x ) = 1 − f ( x ) , • the Brouwer (intuitionistic) complement f ∼ ( x ) = χ { x ∈ X : f ( x ) = 0 } , and • the anti-Brouwer complement f ♭ ( x ) = χ { x ∈ X : f ( x ) ≠ 1 } . We analyze the algebraic properties and interrelations of these complements. This leads to the study of Brouwer–Zadeh (BZ) algebras, which generalize Boolean algebras to lattices with two non-standard complements linked via a ∼ ′ = a ∼∼ , implying a ∼ ≤ a ′ . We show that any BZ algebra naturally decomposes into three non-overlapping components: a Zadeh algebra, a Brouwer algebra, and an anti-Brouwer algebra. Furthermore, we derive two significant structures from BZ algebras: • the Pawlak Rough Approximation Structure (RAS), and • the Kuratowski Abstract Topological Structure (ATS). To model information granularity and graduality, we introduce the Pawlak operator into the BZ framework, yielding the Pawlak–Brouwer–Zadeh (PBZ) lattice. This enriched structure allows us to formally distinguish between vagueness and ambiguity in RAS and to model granularity in fuzzy sets, providing an algebraic foundation for shadowed sets and related granular models.},

  abstract     = {A mathematical model is presented for a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk, which is initiated from a quantum initial state and governed by a coin operator. When the coin operator is a flip operator, a path analysis formula is employed to compute the position probability distribution. For a general coin operator, matrix decomposition is utilized to transform it into the equivalent flip operator. When a walker undergoes n steps of evolution, it is observed that the probability of the walker occupying any given position exhibits the existence of both maximum and minimum values, irrespective of the quantum initial state. By linking these extreme positions together, a confined region is delineated, the boundary of which is designated as the envelope of the quantum walk. Remarkably, the envelope is independent of the quantum initial state. To facilitate the computation of this envelope, the relevant formulas are transformed into rational expressions, wherein both the numerators and denominators are represented by polynomials with even integer coefficients. These polynomials are classified to determine the coefficients of the numerator polynomials. An analysis is conducted to identify the location of the maximum value of the envelope, thereby examining the maximum value of the position probability distribution.},
