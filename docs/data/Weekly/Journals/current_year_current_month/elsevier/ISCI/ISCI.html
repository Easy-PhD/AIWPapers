  abstract     = {With the wide application of diffusion models in the field of image generation, image copyright protection and traceability have become increasingly complex and challenging. To address these problems, this paper proposes a robust watermarking method for diffusion model generated images to achieve their copyright protection and traceability. The method designs an invertible mapping module to replicate and cryptographically map the watermark information into an approximately Gaussian distributed noise, which is highly consistent with the distribution of the original generation model. The mapped watermark noise serves as the latent space vector of the generative model, preserving both image generation quality and model performance. In the watermark extraction stage, the original watermark information can be accurately recovered from the generated image through the reverse extraction and voting mechanism. Experimental results show that the proposed method demonstrates excellent performance in terms of image watermark extraction accuracy, robustness and watermark image generation quality. It can still maintain 99 % true positive rate and 97.5 % bit accuracy under various attacks, and the overall performance in the detection and traceability scenarios is significantly better than the existing baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {This research focuses on enhancing the extraction of sentiment quadruples consisting of target, aspect, opinion, and sentiment from multi-turn dialogs, which remains a challenging problem in conversational sentiment analysis. Existing methods frequently encounter challenges with complex sentence structures, presence of multiple sentiment quadruples, and interference from irrelevant contextual information. These challenges often result in suboptimal performance. These limitations are addressed by introducing Schrödinger equation-based adaptive dropout multi-granular feature enhancement network (SEAD-MGFE-Net), a novel framework that synergizes multigranular feature extraction with quantum-inspired adaptive regularization. The proposed methodology incorporates a multi-layer tree structure to segment sentences into semantically coherent fragments, thereby improving the alignment between aspect and opinion terms while simultaneously mitigating noise impact. Moreover, we engineer a multi-angle dynamic adjacency learning enhancement module that adeptly captures both local and global features inherent in graph-structured representations. Additionally, we devise an adaptive dropout mechanism based on the Schrödinger equation, facilitating automatic modulation of the regularization strength throughout training. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets in both Chinese and English validate the state-of-the-art effectiveness of our proposed SEAD-MGFE-Net model, achieving Micro-F1 scores of 46.53 % (Chinese) and 40.97 % (English), surpassing the strongest baseline models by 2.04 % and 1.57 %, respectively. SEAD-MGFE-Net exhibits efficacy in extracting cross-utterance quadruples and managing long-range dependencies. These findings confirm the effectiveness and broad applicability of SEAD-MGFE-Net for conversational sentiment analysis.},

  abstract     = {The increasing concerns regarding data privacy exacerbate the challenges associated with “data silos”. Federated learning (FL) effectively addresses these issues by facilitating distributed machine learning without necessitating direct data exchange. However, the dependence on a central server in conventional FL architectures exacerbates privacy risks and limits cross-domain data sharing. Existing blockchain-based FL frameworks often employ static consensus protocols, such as classical Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), which typically rely on fixed weight aggregation strategies. While these methods simplify implementation, they fail to adaptively adjust aggregation weights according to heterogeneous privacy budgets. Attempts to implement adaptive weight aggregation often require achieving consensus for each individual weight, significantly reducing efficiency and creating scalability challenges in large-scale networks. To address these gaps, we propose DSM-PBFT, a variant PBFT consensus enhanced with dynamic scoring matrices (DSM), which enables parallelized validation of multiple models while adaptively adjusting aggregation weights based on differential privacy budgets. Our noise-aware aggregation mechanism dynamically reweights models through cross-validation of accuracy, F1 score, and loss-transformed metrics, effectively decoupling privacy guarantees from model utility degradation. Security analyses affirm the robustness of this framework against Byzantine attacks, with experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrating superior model accuracy across diverse privacy budgets while effectively curbing accuracy degradation under attack scenarios.},

Recently, contrastive learning has shown remarkable ability in learning discriminative representations for detecting anomalies. However, most existing contrastive-based methods rely on complex contrastive mechanisms and specially designed model architectures, which make it difficult to maintain efficiency and flexibility across various application scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce Subsequence-Heterogeneity that defined as the discrepancies in variation patterns and statistical characteristics between subsequences obtained through fixed-interval sampling, which are more pronounced in anomalous sequences than in normal ones. It can serve as a natural discrimination criterion and eliminate the need for complex contrastive mechanisms and specialized model architectures. Specifically, we adopt an efficient temporal hierarchical masking strategy with linear complexity to construct two branches for learning representations at different granularities. The Subsequence-Heterogeneity Contrastive Learning (SHCL) is implemented with different neural networks and enables flexible application to anomaly detection across diverse scenarios. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that SHCL not only achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced time and resource costs but also significantly improves the ability of different neural networks to distinguish normal from anomalous patterns.

Our proposal uses the linear secret-sharing scheme (LSSS) and the notion of certificateless cryptography to restrict the authorities of each attribute authority and the system authority. In addition, it generates a constant-size signature and achieves high verification efficiency by aggregating attribute keys. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that our proposal achieves anonymous authentication and is provably secure under the standard model. Simulation experiments show that the execution time of our algorithm is less than 50 ms to run during both the signature and verification phases, making it well-suited for applications with limited resources.},

To address this limitation, an intuitive idea is introducing deep neural networks to eliminate the noise and redundancy, yielding a potential embedding space. Nevertheless, existing deep MVSC methods merely focus on either the embeddings or self-expressions to explore the complementary information, which hinders subspace learning. In this paper, we present a deep multi-view dual contrastive subspace clustering framework to exploit the complementarity to learn latent self-representations effectively. Specifically, multi-view encoders are constructed to eliminate noise and redundancy of the original features and capture low-dimensional subspace embeddings, from which the self-representations are learned. Moreover, two diverse specific fusion methods are conducted on the latent subspace embeddings and the self-expressions to learn shared self-representations, and dual contrastive constraints are proposed to fully exploit the complementarity among views. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Graph-based clustering has garnered significant attention due to its outstanding performance in uncovering sample structures. However, existing graph-based methods face two major challenges: 1) In graph construction, they typically focus only on direct connections between samples or an exact high-order relationship, neglecting the impact of hidden complex relationships on clustering performance; 2) The separation of spectral analysis and category acquisition into two distinct stages often results in a loss of effectiveness. To handle these problems, we propose a parameter-free discrete clustering method, called parameter-free discrete clustering via adaptive hypergraph fusion (DCAHF). Specifically, DCAHF first produces multiple different hypergraphs, each serving as a biased approximation of the data's intrinsic manifold. These complementary approximations capture distinct local-to-global geometric patterns. Then, it introduces an adaptive fusion strategy that learns optimal weights to combine them into a single consensus hypergraph on manifold space, effectively reconstructing the real manifold structure with reduced bias and improved integrity. Finally, discrete spectral analysis is performed directly on the consensus hypergraph to generate discrete sample categories, thereby avoiding the performance loss associated with two-stage approaches. Thus, DCAHF is a high-performance, parameter-free clustering model that can flexibly adapt to various clustering tasks. Since the DCAHF model cannot be solved using gradient descent methods, we develop a coordinate descent-based optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the model. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DCAHF significantly enhances clustering effectiveness while maintaining comparable efficiency to state-of-the-art methods.},

This field aims to transfer knowledge from previous experiences to recognize new concepts with limited samples.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Branch Semantic Alignment (MBSA) for few-shot image classification, with the objective of investigating the role of multi-level features. Instead of using standard convolutional layers, we employ diverse convolutional layers to generate enhanced representations in each branch. These representations are then utilized by a dense classifier, which is supervised by a powerful guidance mechanism to incorporate semantic information into their spatial locations. During the inference stage, the multi-branch semantic alignment is designed to align multi-level features between query images and support images. This alignment process effectively establishes semantic correspondences between representations at different levels, thereby enhancing the ability to recognize novel categories. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on various few-shot benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to those of several previous approaches, and ablation studies are performed to analyze the impact of different components.},

While deep learning models—particularly CNNs and Transformer-based architectures—have significantly improved HPE accuracy, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that subtly distort keypoint localization, thereby undermining system reliability. To address this challenge, we propose regularization and pruning transferable adversarial attack (RPA), a novel framework designed to enhance the transferability of adversarial samples in Transformer-based HPE models. RPA integrates two synergistic strategies: gradient regularization, which suppresses dominant feature correlations to reduce overfitting, and adaptive weight pruning, which removes redundant parameters to reduce model-specific noise. This dual mechanism enables the generation of transferable adversarial attacks that are effective across diverse model architectures. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art HPE networks demonstrate that RPA consistently outperforms existing attack methods. In white-box settings, RPA reduces average precision (AP) by 0.05-0.30; in black-box scenarios, it yields AP drops of 0.01-0.04. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in IoT-enabled HPE applications and establish a new benchmark for evaluating adversarial robustness in real-time perception systems.},

Most existing methods learn the spatial-temporal distribution of normal features and detect deviations as anomalies. Typically, they employ autoencoders to independently learn appearance and motion features, but this separate learning limits the exploitation of their interrelation in real-world scenarios. To enhance the representation of normal patterns by capturing feature interrelation, we propose a cross-feature fusion and memory-constraint network (CF 2 M-Net) for VAD. Specifically, inspired by the representational ability of cross-attention in multimodal fusion, we design a cross-attention and memory-constraint (CM) module to enrich appearance features with motion information. To prevent overfitting to anomalous events, the memory-constraint module further constrains fused features within the distribution of normal patterns. We design an attention fusion (AF) decoder to predict normal features closer to the normal distribution, enhancing their separability from anomalies. By jointly modeling appearance and motion through feature fusion and memory constraints, CF 2 M-Net provides more discriminative normal representations for anomaly detection. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets show that the CF 2 M-Net performs comparably with leading approaches. Moreover, the detailed evaluations indicate the effectiveness of normal representation based appearance-motion fusion features for VAD.},

  abstract     = {Many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs) are widely used in scientific research and engineering practices, which mainly consider joint optimization of multiple objectives simultaneously. Despite the numerous multi-objective evolutionary algorithms proposed in recent years, they often struggle with challenges in fitness assignment arising from objective conflicts. Meanwhile, they tend to perform well in only one aspect of convergence, diversity, and computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an improved multi-population co-evolutionary algorithm for many-objective optimization (termed MPCMO), which leverages the advantages of multi-population co-evolutionary techniques. The primary objective of MPCMO is to achieve a more balanced performance across convergence, diversity, and complexity. MPCMO comprises three essential components. Initially, an adaptive evolutionary strategy is employed to dynamically allocate evolutionary opportunities to subpopulations so as to conserve computational resources and enhance convergence. Subsequently, a migration strategy is developed to ensure a more global approximation of whole Pareto front. Additionally, an archive update-truncation strategy, based on angle selection and shift-based density estimation, is adopted to enhance diversity. We conduct comprehensive comparative experiments on a variety of many-objective benchmark problems with complicated characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both diversity and convergence.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are practical tools that represent and integrate plentiful structural and semantic information in mainstream industrial scenarios. Despite their potential, the heterogeneity and complexity of KGs pose a formidable obstacle, especially for graph representation learning. Most existing KG embedding models omit dynamic high-order connectivity patterns to gain insights into heterogeneous networks and heavily rely on handcrafted patterns to handle complex semantic relationships, which limits their capability to adaptively capture the nuanced and intricate relationships of KGs in different tasks. To fill this gap, we present Reinforced Heterogeneous Graphlet Design (ReHGD)—a model designed for KGs that focuses on the adaptive design of typed graphlets (heterogeneous chains and motifs) through a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. This task-driven approach can learn discriminative graph representations tailored to specific downstream tasks. Specifically, ReHGD engages in the creation of typed graphlets through a two-stage process: it (1) establishes a reinforced chain design module to generate chains without predefined rules and (2) employs a buffer-aware sampling technique to derive episodic chains from prior experiences. Subsequently, motifs are deduced through the application of commute count and Hadamard product operations to the episodic chain-based subgraphs. In the final step toward learning graph representations, ReHGD undertakes chain and motif aggregations. Experimental results and analyses reveal that ReHGD outperforms strong baselines on three real-world graph data and practical tasks.},

  abstract     = {Texture analysis is crucial for understanding images by extracting features that define spatial patterns. Recently, bi-dimensional extensions of entropy measures have gained attention due to their simplicity and strong theoretical foundations. However, existing methods primarily operate in the spatial domain and thus overlook frequency-domain and multiscale information. To address this, we introduce bidimensional wavelet increment entropy (wavelet IncrEn 2 D ). A one-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the Haar wavelet decomposes each image into approximation (low-frequency) and, for some neuroimaging data, detail (high-frequency) subbands; IncrEn 2 D is then applied both to capture global structural patterns and fine, detailed texture variations. We evaluated wavelet IncrEn 2 D on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing between different noise types (white Gaussian, salt-and-pepper, and speckle noise). Comparisons between periodic and synthesized images revealed lower wavelet IncrEn 2 D values for periodic textures. Tests on real texture datasets highlight the method's ability to differentiate various patterns. In particular, wavelet IncrEn 2 D achieved 86.69% accuracy in distinguishing MRI images of healthy versus multiple sclerosis–affected brains. Overall, wavelet IncrEn 2 D offers a robust, frequency-aware descriptor that outperforms existing 2D entropy methods.},

  abstract     = {Visual Relationship Detection (VRD) has significantly advanced with Transformer-based architectures. However, we identify two fundamental drawbacks in conventional label assignment methods used for training Transformer-based VRD models, where ground-truth (GT) annotations are matched to model predictions. In conventional assignment, queries are trained to detect all relations rather than specializing in specific ones, resulting in ‘unspecialized’ queries. Also, each ground-truth (GT) annotation is assigned to only one prediction under conventional assignment, suppressing other near-correct predictions by labeling them as ‘no relation’. To address these issues, we introduce a novel method called Groupwise Query Spe ci a lization and Q uality-Aware Multi-Assignment (SpeaQ). Groupwise Query Specialization clusters queries and relations into exclusive groups, promoting specialization by assigning a set of relations only to a corresponding query group. Quality-Aware Multi-Assignment enhances training signals by allowing multiple predictions closely matching the GT to be positively assigned. Additionally, we introduce dynamic query reallocation, which transfers queries from high- to low-performing groups for balanced training. Experimental results demonstrate that SpeaQ+, combining SpeaQ with dynamic query reallocation, consistently improves performance across seven baseline models on five benchmarks without additional inference cost.},

These characteristics make it challenging for traditional physical models and data-driven methods to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal convolutional network named ConvDiff, optimized specifically for dynamic system modeling tasks by integrating a latent space denoising diffusion model. ConvDiff effectively captures complex spatio-temporal features and handles uncertainties in physical systems by introducing multi-scale convolutional modules combined with a physics-guided diffusion mechanism. Specifically, our model incorporates eight temporal modules and four spatial modules, using a hierarchical convolutional and diffusion structure to capture the intricate dynamics of physical systems. The experiments involved different spatio-temporal data, such as those from TaxiBJ and the Navier-Stokes dataset. According to the findings, ConvDiff demonstrates substantial improvements in essential performance indicators. For example, in the TaxiBJ dataset, ConvDiff obtained a mean squared deviation of 0.29 and a PSNR value of 40.31, outperforming the best-performing models. Moreover, on the Navier-Stokes dataset, ConvDiff reduced the MSE by 51.15% compared to the best baseline model. These results indicate that ConvDiff effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies and improves prediction accuracy, particularly in physics-driven dynamic systems.

In customer relationship management (CRM), the Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis model is one of the most effective approaches to increase the profits of major enterprises. However, with the rapid development of e-commerce, the diversity and abundance of e-commerce data pose a challenge to mining efficiency. Moreover, in actual market transactions, the chronological order of transactions reflects customer behavior and preferences. To address these challenges, we develop an effective algorithm called SeqRFM, which combines sequential pattern mining with RFM models.

A series of experiments demonstrates the superiority and effectiveness of the SeqRFM algorithm compared to the most advanced RFM algorithms based on sequential pattern mining.

First, considering the spatiotemporal distribution of EVs, a Markov chain is constructed to describe probabilistic transitions between spatiotemporal states, which is then embedded in a traffic-network-based path decision model. Second, a dynamic battery energy consumption model is established, incorporating multiple factors that influence battery performance. Using Monte Carlo simulation results, a bi-objective optimization model is formulated to schedule charging and discharging, simultaneously minimizing (i) total cost — including user recharging time and battery degradation — and (ii) grid-load fluctuation. Given the NP-hard nature of the problem, an improved multi-objective bitterling fish optimization (IMOBFO) algorithm is developed to balance global exploration and local exploitation.

Specifically, we proposed a spatial-temporal interactive couple block that contains both temporal and spatial branches to investigate the relationships between global and local patterns in temporal and spatial perspectives. In the temporal branch, we design a hybrid network module capable of enhancing representation learning using convolution and attention mechanisms, which dynamically capture the local trendiness and long-term time dependence implicit in time series. In the spatial branch, a novel dynamic graph learners are designed to learn global and local spatial patterns. Then a novel interactive coupling method is proposed to link the two branches together. ASTIC predicts time series effectively by using a multilevel structure to model the trendiness of the series and mining the spatial-temporal heterogeneity.

  abstract     = {Nonlinear causal discovery from observational data imposes strict identifiability assumptions on the formulation of structural equations utilized in the data-generating process. However, in real-life settings, the ground-truth mechanism responsible for cause-effect transformations is unknown. Thus, it is impossible to verify its identifiability. This is the first research to assess the performance of structure learning algorithms from seven different families in non-identifiable settings with an increasing degree of nonlinearity. The evaluation of structure learning methods under assumption violations requires a rigorous and interpretable approach that quantifies both the structural similarity of the estimation with the ground truth and the capacity of the discovered graphs to be used for causal inference. Motivated by the lack of a unified performance assessment indicator, we propose an interpretable, multidimensional evaluation framework, specifically tailored to the field of causal discovery from i.i.d. data. In particular, we introduce a six-dimensional evaluation metric, called distance to the optimal solution, which aims at providing a holistic overview of the performance of structure learning techniques. Our large-scale simulation study, which incorporates seven experimental factors, shows that hybrid Bayesian networks outperform most recently introduced continuous optimization techniques under certain conditions. Additionally, causal order-based methods yield results with comparatively high proximity to the optimal solution.},

  abstract     = {Lossy image compression is essential for efficient transmission and storage. Traditional compression methods mainly rely on discrete cosine transform (DCT) or singular value decomposition (SVD), both of which represent image data in continuous domains and, therefore, necessitate carefully designed quantizers. Notably, these methods consider quantization as a separate step, which prevents quantization errors from being incorporated into the compression process and degrades the reconstruction quality, particularly in SVD-based methods. To address this issue, we introduce a quantization-aware matrix factorization (QMF) to develop a novel lossy image compression method. QMF provides a low-rank representation of the image data as a product of two smaller matrices, with elements constrained to bounded integer values, thereby effectively integrating quantization with low-rank approximation. We propose an efficient, provably convergent iterative algorithm for QMF using a block coordinate descent scheme, with subproblems having closed-form solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms JPEG at low bit rates below 0.25 bits per pixel. We also demonstrated that our method has an improved capability to preserve visual semantics compared to JPEG at low bit rates by evaluating an ImageNet pre-trained classifier on compressed images.

  abstract     = {The rapid growth of Ethereum has spurred widespread adoption of smart contracts, enabling substantial financial transactions. Once deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts are immutable, rendering them unmodifiable even if vulnerabilities are present. In recent years, numerous attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities have caused significant financial losses. Although prior research has improved vulnerability detection in source code or bytecode before deployment, identifying attacks that exploit vulnerabilities during the execution phase after deployment remains a significant challenge. These challenges arise from the limited adaptability of predefined detection rules and an overreliance on opcode sequence names, which often neglects a comprehensive analysis of opcode sequence properties. In this study, we propose an advanced multidimensional feature fusion technique designed to detect attacks during the execution phase of smart contracts. By leveraging deep learning, our approach enhances detection accuracy through a comprehensive analysis of attack behaviors across four dimensions: operation objects, action behaviors, functional categories, and gas consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a detection accuracy of 97.21% and a weighted F1-score of 97.21%, confirming its effectiveness in identifying attacks.},

Considering the circumstances of communication noises among agents, distributed intermittent event-triggered privacy-preserving formation algorithms including the fuzzy logic system are given. Meanwhile, a novel privacy-preserving mask function is proposed, where indistinguishable space is increased by 26.2% than ones in existing literatures. Based on stochastic stability analysis and graph theory, sufficient conditions of mean square formation with the bound error are derived. Moreover, optimal controllers for the leader are proposed within the intermittent event-triggered privacy-preserving framework. In order to deal with nonlinear and unknown function, we exploit the idea of adaptive control to parameterize partial derivative of corresponding cost function, which is another different technique rather than the adaptive dynamic programming one.

  abstract     = {Feature selection is a data dimensionality reduction method commonly used to handle high-dimensional datasets. It improves classification accuracy by selecting relevant features, as well as removing irrelevant and redundant ones. However, due to the vast search space, effectively selecting features remains a challenge. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been successfully applied to feature selection due to its excellent global search capability and ease of implementation. Existing PSO methods typically use predefined or self-adaptive inertia weights and predefined acceleration coefficients for all datasets. The diversity across datasets means that uniform hyperparameter settings are often suboptimal. To address this, this paper introduces a novel PSO variant, termed PAPSO, which emphasizes a problem-aware hyperparameter design for improved adaptability. Specifically, PAPSO leverages each dataset's intrinsic properties via two mechanisms: an inertia weight adjustment driven by PSO's optimization process for tailored search behavior, and an initialization strategy that sets acceleration coefficients based on the dataset's specific characteristics. This data-driven approach is central to PAPSO's problem-aware' capabilities, allowing the datasets's specific properties themselves to directly guide the hyperparameter design and optimization process more effectively than predefined settings. Extensive experiments on 15 high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that PAPSO achieves a superior balance between the number of selected features and classification accuracy.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a new family of Durrmeyer Deep Neural Networks (DDNN), characterized by its deep multi-layer architecture and the integration of Gaussian-Based Density (GBD) functions as sigmoidal activation mechanisms. Unlike shallow neural network (NN) operators, which often struggle with higher-order dependencies, this deep-layered approach significantly enhances approximation accuracy and adaptability. We rigorously analyze the convergence properties of DDNN in L p spaces, demonstrating its superior stability over Bernstein-type operators. Importantly, extensive numerical experiments consistently show that DDNN achieves significantly smaller approximation errors compared to shallow-type NN operators, confirming its superior performance in function approximation. The deep structure of DDNN enables the modeling of complex, higher-order dependencies, while the GBD-based activations provide flexibility and adaptability in capturing transient neural interactions. This design enables the operator to effectively balance signal preservation and noise reduction through integral-based smoothing techniques. By bridging classical approximation theory and deep learning, this study establishes DDNN as a powerful tool for dynamic signal processing. Moreover, we apply the DDNN framework to dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis, where it effectively uncovers time-varying connectivity patterns in key brain regions by circumventing the limitations of conventional moving window techniques. The results highlight DDNN's ability to preserve low-frequency components while substantially reducing high-frequency noise, providing a more accurate representation of evolving brain states. Further, in its robust application to fMRI data for Independent Component Analysis (ICA), DDNN consistently and markedly enhanced spatial sparsity: raw component sparsity values (ranging from approximately 0.16 to 0.24) are significantly improved to a much higher range (0.77 to 0.85), representing an average increase of over 0.60 across components. This substantial improvement in spatial localization, coupled with DDNN's capacity for selective temporal modulation, provides a more accurate representation of evolving brain states, advancing the methodological landscape of functional neuroimaging and signal processing.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the estimation of minimum initial states (MISs) for partially observable labeled time Petri net (LTPN) systems. Particularly, an MIS is defined by two components: a minimal initial marking possessing the minimum achievable total token count, and a set of timing constraints that explicitly define the static firing delays for every transition enabled under this initial marking. The number of logic transition sequences (LTSs) consistent with a given time-label sequence (TLS) can be infinite. To ensure tractability, we adopt the assumption that only a finite number of unobservable transition firings can occur prior to the firing of any observable transition. Within this framework, the initial step involves deriving the set of minimal initial markings. This derivation is based on LTSs that exhibit logical consistency with the provided TLS. Subsequently, we define a route-modified state class graph (R-MSCG) that is generated by firing the logic consistent LTSs attached to minimal initial markings. By utilizing the transitions-related timing constraints in R-MSCGs, a method is presented to detect whether these logic consistent LTSs are timing consistent with the given TLS. Moreover, we report an algorithm to implement the MISs estimation. Finally, a part processing unit is provided to illustrate how to apply the proposed algorithms to estimate the MIS that allows the specified task sequence to be completed with the least required resources while meeting the timing constraints on the task executions.},
