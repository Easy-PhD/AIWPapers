  abstract     = {In reinforcement learning, designing an effective reward function is essential for developing and controlling humanoid robots. The criteria for replicating human learning and achieving human-like responses in bipedal robots remain unclear. Integrating kinematic and dynamic characteristics into the reward function, along with the use of detailed models, can enhance efficiency and robustness. This study proposes a novel manipulability-based reward function within an end-to-end learning framework, enabling the agent to autonomously generate robust, real-time movements. Incorporating the kinematic manipulability index into the proposed reward function significantly improves the robot's locomotion behavior and ability to handle disturbances. Results indicate that incorporating kinematic manipulability into training enhances the robot's forward speed and improves its ability to handle sagittal and lateral disturbances, as well as uncertainties in length and weight distribution. Furthermore, compared to a classical hierarchical controller, the trained agent attained higher speeds and demonstrated superior disturbance handling, validating the effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach. These findings highlight the significance of incorporating kinematic manipulability into the reward function to enhance the agility and adaptability of bipedal robots.},

  abstract     = {This work presents a fuzzy adaptive control technology for determining the desired trajectory of collaborative robot manipulators when grasping a general object. While the classical fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are commonly used to compensate for some unknown nonlinear continuous functions, their approximation accuracies are often limited. To address this issue, a non-zero time-varying parameter is introduced in the input of Mamdani type or Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) type FLSs. This parameter allows for universal approximation, enabling the system to automatically adjust the approximation precision through adaptive rules. The unknown nonlinear continuous functions are represented using a combined form of homogeneous functions, which are then approximated using FLSs. Unlike previous fuzzy adaptive control schemes, this approach overcomes the limitation of a finite universal approximation domain. Additionally, the proposed method can calculate the coefficients of consequents in T–S type FLSs, reducing the computational load of the controller. The effectiveness of the proposed sliding mode surface is demonstrated in ensuring the required tracking performance, with all signals in the closed-loop system being uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The efficiency of the control scheme is further demonstrated through various simulation results.},

  abstract     = {Due to advances in robotics science, mobile robots are being used in more and more applications worldwide, and the autonomous navigation of these robots is an important topic in their discussion. This paper focuses on the autonomous navigation of a two-wheeled self-balancing robot (TWSBR) in an unknown environment using behavior-based control in the form of a hybrid automaton. This hybrid automaton includes the behaviors “Go To Goal” and “Avoid Obstacle,” and to avoid the Zeno phenomenon between these two behaviors, another behavior is considered in between, called “Follow Wall,” which the robot uses to move around the obstacle. However, two bugs are identified in the conventional hybrid automaton. The first bug causes the robot to not follow the optimal path. Another bug is that the Zeno phenomenon occurs between the two behaviors “Follow Wall” and “Go To Goal,” causing odometry errors in the experimental environment. The results show that the modified hybrid automaton successfully corrects the bugs and works as intended. The navigation algorithm is designed for the point mass model, so it is transformed to the unicycle model using a transformation, which can be used as input to the TWSBR controller. After linearizing the dynamic equations of the robot around its equilibrium point, the pole placement method is used to create the TWSBR controller. By adding the Luenberger observer to estimate the state variables, the non-full-state feedback system is also controlled. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the whole system is functioning properly so that the robot follows the path determined by the navigation algorithm while maintaining its equilibrium.},

  abstract     = {Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations, traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling. Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality and scalability of the framework, TSP instances of varying sizes are solved using three methods: Greedy Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). An object-based optimization is subsequently applied to further refine the paths. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav, our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and tracking. Experimental results show that MCRL provides a balanced solution, reducing travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining comparable performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and eliminates intersections. Computational resource comparisons further highlight that GHI scales efficiently with increasing waypoints, whereas ACO and MCRL incur higher computational costs. These results confirm the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed CPP-DIP.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges of detecting line segments in dynamic and geometrically complex environments, EM-LSD, a lightweight and efficient line segment detection model, is introduced. Accurate and efficient detection of line segments is critical for tasks such as environmental modeling and localization in SLAM, where the failure to extract robust line features can result in unreliable mapping and trajectory estimation. The design of EM-LSD is guided by the limitations of existing methods: traditional approaches often fail to capture multi-scale and global features in noisy scenes, while deep learning models with multi-stage architectures impose high computational costs, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Inspired by the observation that multi-scale feature extraction is essential for handling diverse geometric structures, EM-LSD incorporates a Dense Atrous Convolution (DAC) module to effectively capture multi-scale information with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, the need for robustness against structural complexities and noise led to the integration of dual decoders with a Channel-Spatial Multi-scale Attention (CSMA) module and a Multi-scale Atrous Deformable Block (MADB), enabling adaptive feature representation. Experimental results on the Wireframe and YorkUrban datasets validate EM-LSD’s superior accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance, emphasizing its capability to support resource-constrained SLAM applications. This model not only addresses the limitations of existing methods but also enhances the reliability of environment modeling and localization, offering inspiration for the development of lightweight and efficient detection frameworks.},

At present, in order to realize the obstacle avoidance function of flexible robots, inverse kinematic calculations are usually unavoidable. The problems of large amount of computation, long solution time, and non-convergence of results make the configuration control for flexible robots still challenging. Most of the current studies use the inverse kinematics calculation of end tracking, and for flexible robots with multiple degrees of freedom, the success rate of obstacle avoidance is low and the computational cost is large. In this paper, a three-segment continuum configuration planning method based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed, in which the rough obstacle avoidance path is obtained by RRT algorithm, then the three-segment fitting is carried out by using the second-order Bézier curve, and the length error is evaluated to meet the planning requirements. Experiments such as obstacle avoidance tests, the arrival of target endpoints at different positions and different obstacle environments show that the proposed method can effectively map the feasible solution to the actual configuration. Compared with the inverse kinematics method, the proposed approach improves the success rate of obtaining feasible solutions by at least 14.8% and reduces the solution time by at least 55%. In addition, no prior curvature information and traditional inverse kinematics calculation are needed for the configuration control.},

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the problem. In some special cases, our algorithm is convergent with respect to ‖ . ‖ . The problem involves discovering the environmental map and blind alley regions, that are bounded by obstacles, and it provides no possible passage for robots except in and out of their path entry occur, the robot has to return back to some positions outside to escape from such regions such that the returned path is not longer than the path entry (Blind Alley Region problem, (BAR) problem, in short). To solve the (BAR) problem, sequences of bundles of line segments during the robot’s traveling are constructed in our algorithm. Some advantages of our algorithm are that (a) It reduces search space in blind alley regions because it only works on the sequences of bundles of the line segments built by the robot’s limited vision range. (b) Our algorithm ensures that the returned path to escape from the regions is not longer than the previous path of the robot. (c) Due to the construction of the sequences of bundles of line segments, our paths are not always “close” obstacles and the number of turns of such paths is smaller ones determined by other shortest path algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT*). Our algorithm is implemented in Python and we experience the algorithm on some autonomous robots with different vision ranges in real environment.

A distributed cooperative planning framework, based on graph theory, is employed to enable effective information exchange and cooperative control among multiple quadrotors. To mitigate the impact of unknown disturbances, such as wind fields and variations in payload mass, a disturbance observer is developed to estimate and compensate for these disturbances, thereby enhancing system robustness. Furthermore, an improved prescribed performance control method is proposed to address the issue of exceeding performance boundaries. The steady-state error of the system is effectively reduced by adaptively adjusting the prescribed performance boundary and combining it with integral backstepping, and real-time constraints on tracking errors and closed-loop stability are achieved.
