  abstract     = {In the last decades, robotic manipulation has been treated as a cornerstone research topic to improve, accelerate but also safeguard human work in industrial, medical and everyday activities. For this reason, robotic hands are increasingly devoted to mimicking or augmenting human abilities. In particular, the two main operations performed by a human hand are precision and power grasping with the possibility of dosing the right grasping force to avoid breaks, deformations, or drops of the grasped objects. This paper presents the design, characterization and testing of a novel underactuated tendon-driven soft robotic gripper with sensing fingertips to regulate the applied contact force mimicking the ability of the human hand. The evolution of the design phases is presented and discussed together with the characterization procedures. Results of the grasping tests show the successful application of the new gripper in different tasks.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing use of robots in daily life, there is a growing need to provide robust collaboration protocols for robots to tackle more complicated and dynamic problems effectively. This paper presents a novel, factor graph-based approach to address the pursuit–evasion problem, enabling accurate estimation, planning, and tracking of an evader by multiple pursuers working together. It is assumed that there are multiple pursuers and only one evader in this scenario. The proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of evader estimation and tracking, allowing pursuers to capture the evader in the shortest possible time and distance compared to existing techniques. In addition to these primary objectives, the proposed approach effectively minimizes uncertainty while remaining robust, even when communication issues lead to some messages being dropped or lost. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, this paper demonstrates that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms traditional pursuit–evasion methods across several key performance metrics, such as the time required to capture the evader and the average distance traveled by the pursuers. Additionally, the proposed method is tested in real-world hardware experiments, further validating its effectiveness and applicability.},

  abstract     = {The energy efficiency of manipulators performing cyclic motions can be enhanced by utilizing the so-called natural motion, namely, the natural oscillations that occur when elastic elements are placed in series or parallel with the actuators. In this paper, the natural motion of the RR-4R-R robot is discussed. This manipulator exhibits a 4-DOF mobility similar to that of the widespread SCARA robot, but the vertical prismatic joint is replaced by a four-bar mechanism. This modification, along with the adoption of a direct-drive actuator for the four-bar mechanism, makes it easier to achieve the elastic balancing of the robot, allowing the exploitation of its natural motion. The robot dynamics is analysed using the Lagrangian approach. Two types of elastic balancing are considered: one using a torsional spring and one using a linear coil spring. A simplified model of the vertical motion is then proposed, decoupled from the inertial effects of the horizontal motion, and used to estimate the vertical natural period. The behaviour of the manipulator with natural elastic balancing is compared with that obtained with exact elastic balancing, which provides an indifferent equilibrium in any robot position. This comparison is first carried out in the time domain, and then the space of the robot operating conditions is sampled through multibody simulations, performed to investigate the threshold of convenience between exact and natural balancing. Simulation results indicate that exploiting the natural motion of the RR-4R-R manipulator can significantly reduce energy consumption in a wide range of industrial applications involving pick-and-place tasks.},

  abstract     = {During collision avoidance, the tether of Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) is subject to entanglement with obstacles or other ROVs’ tether. This specificity renders traditional multi-robot obstacle avoidance approaches inadequate for tethered multi-robot scenarios. This paper proposes a guaranteed ellipsoid model for representing the ROV’s tether and its nearby obstacles, enabling an efficient, low-computation collision avoidance method for a fleet of ROVs. The model ensures that if the ellipsoid encompassing the tether remains entirely outside the ellipsoid encompassing an obstacle, there is no risk that the tether collides with it. The approach requires only the two attachment points of the tether and its length, without needing any information about the tether’s shape, dynamics, or external disturbances such as underwater currents. A collision avoidance strategy is developed based on potential field methods combined with tether length management. When multiple ROVs are involved, personalities are added to ROV to obtain different behaviors, reducing the likelihood of deadlocks during avoidance maneuvers. Simulations demonstrate the method’s effectiveness across various scenarios, and its limitations are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {Previous rolling soft robots are usually hard to achieve balanced rolling performance (terrain adaptability, rolling velocity and energy efficiency). This paper proposes a rolling soft robot driven by local curvature loading, which demonstrates good rolling velocity, small deformation rate, good energy efficiency and excellent terrain adaptability. A theory based on the energy method is established to analyze the rolling mechanism of the soft robot and to determine the critical loading curvature, which is validated by experiments. The local curvature loading causes the deformation of the entire robot configuration and results in the shift of the gravity center, which generates a gravity torque to drive the rolling of the soft robot when the critical loading curvature is reached. The proposed soft robot has good average rolling velocity (182.9 mm/s or 0.938 body length per second, BL/s) and can adapt to a variety of complex terrains such as the stairs (stair height 15 mm), the slope (slope angle 12.4 °) and the wide broken bridge (gap length 100 mm or 0.526 BL). The study in this work demonstrates broad application prospect in the fields of biomedical therapy, exploration, searching and rescuing, which provides a new idea for the structural design and performance improvement of rolling soft robots.},

Robust and adaptive control strategies can immensely benefit these scenarios by increasing autonomy and endurance. However, AUVs are nonlinear systems whose dynamics are challenging to model, especially during agile maneuvers at high angles of attack. To better capture these nonlinear effects, this paper proposes a physics-informed system identification scheme that combines prior knowledge of the system dynamics with data-driven regression. Strategies including Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), nonlinear least squares regression, and Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to learn the AUV dynamics online from measured data. These data-driven models are then implemented in an adaptive model predictive controller (MPC) for agile maneuvering that drives the system to a set point while updating the prediction model when new measurements are available. The performance of these three system identification strategies is evaluated on two different 6-DOF AUV platforms. All three strategies show good real-time performance, while the GP model offers the best balance between accuracy, speed and robustness. Field experimental data from the SAM AUV and the MOLA AUV are used for performance evaluation.},

Integrating kinematic and dynamic characteristics into the reward function, along with the use of detailed models, can enhance efficiency and robustness. This study proposes a novel manipulability-based reward function within an end-to-end learning framework, enabling the agent to autonomously generate robust, real-time movements. Incorporating the kinematic manipulability index into the proposed reward function significantly improves the robot's locomotion behavior and ability to handle disturbances. Results indicate that incorporating kinematic manipulability into training enhances the robot's forward speed and improves its ability to handle sagittal and lateral disturbances, as well as uncertainties in length and weight distribution. Furthermore, compared to a classical hierarchical controller, the trained agent attained higher speeds and demonstrated superior disturbance handling, validating the effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach. These findings highlight the significance of incorporating kinematic manipulability into the reward function to enhance the agility and adaptability of bipedal robots.},

First, a context recognition module and a language processing module are developed to obtain the context information, user intent and slots, which become part of the system state. Second, a reinforcement learning algorithm is utilized to train an initial policy in a simulated HRI environment. User feedback data is collected through HRI using the initial policy. Third, a new policy that combines the reinforcement learning-based policy and a supervised learning-based policy is adapted based on the user feedback. We conducted both simulated user tests and real human subject tests to evaluate the proposed CACAS. The results show that the CACAS achieved a success rate of 85% in the real human subject test and 87.5% of participants were satisfied with the adaptation results. For the simulation test, the CACAS had the highest success rate compared with the baseline methods.},

  abstract     = {The application of diffusion models into the field of robotics is gaining increasing attention due to its advantages in modeling complex data distributions. In the visual navigation task of mobile robots based on diffusion policy, existing frameworks use the current observation as the guidance condition and adopt a classifier free guidance mode for joint training. However, using diffusion models for end-to-end training may result in feature loss, as the learned features are not well understood, which leading to poor generalization in unknown environments and low navigation success rates. To address the issue of generalization, we proposed a new visual navigation framework called MATdiff from the perspective of visual representation. Our framework utilizes two auxiliary tasks to enhance the representation capability of the Conditioned Observation Network. It leverages depth estimation to extract the geometric features of the environment and employs free-space segmentation to identify safely drivable regions, which are defined as areas free from obstacles and suitable for safe navigation. After the fusion of those features, we use a conditional diffusion model to model the distribution under observation conditions and generate a fixed number of consecutive waypoints. This design of auxiliary tasks ensures that the conditional features pays attention to both geometric and semantic information simultaneously. We conduct experiments in both simulation environments and the real world. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method not only has lighter model parameters but also achieves the highest navigation success rate and a longer average travel distance before collision.},

While the classical fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) are commonly used to compensate for some unknown nonlinear continuous functions, their approximation accuracies are often limited. To address this issue, a non-zero time-varying parameter is introduced in the input of Mamdani type or Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) type FLSs. This parameter allows for universal approximation, enabling the system to automatically adjust the approximation precision through adaptive rules. The unknown nonlinear continuous functions are represented using a combined form of homogeneous functions, which are then approximated using FLSs. Unlike previous fuzzy adaptive control schemes, this approach overcomes the limitation of a finite universal approximation domain. Additionally, the proposed method can calculate the coefficients of consequents in T–S type FLSs, reducing the computational load of the controller. The effectiveness of the proposed sliding mode surface is demonstrated in ensuring the required tracking performance, with all signals in the closed-loop system being uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). The efficiency of the control scheme is further demonstrated through various simulation results.},

This paper focuses on the autonomous navigation of a two-wheeled self-balancing robot (TWSBR) in an unknown environment using behavior-based control in the form of a hybrid automaton. This hybrid automaton includes the behaviors “Go To Goal” and “Avoid Obstacle,” and to avoid the Zeno phenomenon between these two behaviors, another behavior is considered in between, called “Follow Wall,” which the robot uses to move around the obstacle. However, two bugs are identified in the conventional hybrid automaton. The first bug causes the robot to not follow the optimal path. Another bug is that the Zeno phenomenon occurs between the two behaviors “Follow Wall” and “Go To Goal,” causing odometry errors in the experimental environment. The results show that the modified hybrid automaton successfully corrects the bugs and works as intended. The navigation algorithm is designed for the point mass model, so it is transformed to the unicycle model using a transformation, which can be used as input to the TWSBR controller. After linearizing the dynamic equations of the robot around its equilibrium point, the pole placement method is used to create the TWSBR controller. By adding the Luenberger observer to estimate the state variables, the non-full-state feedback system is also controlled. The results of the simulations demonstrate that the whole system is functioning properly so that the robot follows the path determined by the navigation algorithm while maintaining its equilibrium.},

By integrating real-time voxel maps, the algorithm optimizes paths to stay near the pipeline axis. Simulation results show that PAPlanner reduces average path length by 26.4% compared to the advanced MBPlanner method in the elbow scene experiment, demonstrating efficient safe trajectory maintenance. In the variable diameter scene experiment, where MBPlanner fails frequently, PAPlanner achieves a 0% failure rate.

  abstract     = {Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is vital in precision agriculture to improve efficiency and resource utilization. In irregular and dispersed plantations, traditional grid-based CPP often causes redundant coverage over non-vegetated areas, leading to waste and pollution. To overcome these limitations, we propose CPP-DIP, a multi-objective CPP framework designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The framework transforms the CPP task into a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and optimizes flight paths by minimizing travel distance, turning angles, and intersection counts. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not rely on GPS-based environmental modeling. Instead, it uses aerial imagery and a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)-based approach to detect trees and extract image coordinates. A density-aware waypoint strategy is applied: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to reduce redundant waypoints in dense regions, while a greedy algorithm ensures complete coverage in sparse areas. To verify the generality and scalability of the framework, TSP instances of varying sizes are solved using three methods: Greedy Heuristic Insertion (GHI), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Monte Carlo Reinforcement Learning (MCRL). An object-based optimization is subsequently applied to further refine the paths. Additionally, CPP-DIP integrates ForaNav, our insect-inspired navigation method, for accurate tree localization and tracking. Experimental results show that MCRL provides a balanced solution, reducing travel distance by 16.9 % compared to ACO while maintaining comparable performance to GHI. It also improves path smoothness by reducing turning angles by 28.3 % and 59.9 % relative to ACO and GHI, respectively, and eliminates intersections. Computational resource comparisons further highlight that GHI scales efficiently with increasing waypoints, whereas ACO and MCRL incur higher computational costs. These results confirm the robustness, efficiency, and scalability of the proposed CPP-DIP.},

  abstract     = {To address the challenges of detecting line segments in dynamic and geometrically complex environments, EM-LSD, a lightweight and efficient line segment detection model, is introduced. Accurate and efficient detection of line segments is critical for tasks such as environmental modeling and localization in SLAM, where the failure to extract robust line features can result in unreliable mapping and trajectory estimation. The design of EM-LSD is guided by the limitations of existing methods: traditional approaches often fail to capture multi-scale and global features in noisy scenes, while deep learning models with multi-stage architectures impose high computational costs, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. Inspired by the observation that multi-scale feature extraction is essential for handling diverse geometric structures, EM-LSD incorporates a Dense Atrous Convolution (DAC) module to effectively capture multi-scale information with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, the need for robustness against structural complexities and noise led to the integration of dual decoders with a Channel-Spatial Multi-scale Attention (CSMA) module and a Multi-scale Atrous Deformable Block (MADB), enabling adaptive feature representation. Experimental results on the Wireframe and YorkUrban datasets validate EM-LSD’s superior accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance, emphasizing its capability to support resource-constrained SLAM applications. This model not only addresses the limitations of existing methods but also enhances the reliability of environment modeling and localization, offering inspiration for the development of lightweight and efficient detection frameworks.},

To address this gap, we propose a neuromorphic visuotactile slip detection method named VT-SNN using Tactile Address-Event Representation (TAER) encoding combined with brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) modeling in this paper. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the VT-SNN achieves slip detection accuracy of 99.59% and F1 score of 99.28%, which is comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while exhibiting significant advantages in power dissipation and inference time. Furthermore, we deployed the VT-SNN on Intel neuromorphic computing chip–Loihi and performed closed-loop slip-feedback robotic manipulation tasks such as bottle-cap tightening and loosening. Our closed-loop neuromorphic visuotactile sensing system shows significant promise for high accuracy, low latency, and low power dissipation for robotic dexterous manipulation.},

  abstract     = {Obstacle-aware configuration control represents a critical challenge in the deployment of continuum robots for advanced applications such as robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery and intelligent industrial grasping systems. At present, in order to realize the obstacle avoidance function of flexible robots, inverse kinematic calculations are usually unavoidable. The problems of large amount of computation, long solution time, and non-convergence of results make the configuration control for flexible robots still challenging. Most of the current studies use the inverse kinematics calculation of end tracking, and for flexible robots with multiple degrees of freedom, the success rate of obstacle avoidance is low and the computational cost is large. In this paper, a three-segment continuum configuration planning method based on Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm is proposed, in which the rough obstacle avoidance path is obtained by RRT algorithm, then the three-segment fitting is carried out by using the second-order Bézier curve, and the length error is evaluated to meet the planning requirements. Experiments such as obstacle avoidance tests, the arrival of target endpoints at different positions and different obstacle environments show that the proposed method can effectively map the feasible solution to the actual configuration. Compared with the inverse kinematics method, the proposed approach improves the success rate of obtaining feasible solutions by at least 14.8% and reduces the solution time by at least 55%. In addition, no prior curvature information and traditional inverse kinematics calculation are needed for the configuration control.},

This article deals with the formation control of multiple Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based on a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. The proposed Decentralized Self-Attention based Soft Actor–Critic (DEC-ASAC in short) method uses an attention mechanism and maximum entropy reinforcement learning control, so as to enable AUVs to learn formation control independently. The corresponding environmental states, action space and reward schemes are designed for leader and follower AUVs. Simulations and lake test verify that the proposed DEC-ASAC algorithm can stably and effectively learn control policies during training process, achieving effective control of multiple AUVs to keep different formation shapes.},

  abstract     = {Consider the following problem: A robot operating in a 2D environment with a limited vision range finds a path to a goal in an unknown environment containing obstacles. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to solve the problem. In some special cases, our algorithm is convergent with respect to ‖ . ‖ . The problem involves discovering the environmental map and blind alley regions, that are bounded by obstacles, and it provides no possible passage for robots except in and out of their path entry occur, the robot has to return back to some positions outside to escape from such regions such that the returned path is not longer than the path entry (Blind Alley Region problem, (BAR) problem, in short). To solve the (BAR) problem, sequences of bundles of line segments during the robot’s traveling are constructed in our algorithm. Some advantages of our algorithm are that (a) It reduces search space in blind alley regions because it only works on the sequences of bundles of the line segments built by the robot’s limited vision range. (b) Our algorithm ensures that the returned path to escape from the regions is not longer than the previous path of the robot. (c) Due to the construction of the sequences of bundles of line segments, our paths are not always “close” obstacles and the number of turns of such paths is smaller ones determined by other shortest path algorithms (e.g., A*, RRT*). Our algorithm is implemented in Python and we experience the algorithm on some autonomous robots with different vision ranges in real environment. We also compare our result with RRTX, a state-of-art local path-planning algorithm, and A ∗ , a basic one. The experimental results show that our algorithm provides better solutions than RRTX and A* results in some specific circumstances.},

A precise dynamic model of the system is formulated using the Udwadia–Kalaba method. A distributed cooperative planning framework, based on graph theory, is employed to enable effective information exchange and cooperative control among multiple quadrotors. To mitigate the impact of unknown disturbances, such as wind fields and variations in payload mass, a disturbance observer is developed to estimate and compensate for these disturbances, thereby enhancing system robustness. Furthermore, an improved prescribed performance control method is proposed to address the issue of exceeding performance boundaries. The steady-state error of the system is effectively reduced by adaptively adjusting the prescribed performance boundary and combining it with integral backstepping, and real-time constraints on tracking errors and closed-loop stability are achieved. Simulation results validate that the proposed control strategy significantly enhances the control performance and disturbance rejection capability of the multi-quadrotor suspended payload system, demonstrating superior robustness.},

We demonstrate zero-shot generalization on scenarios with significantly larger maps, an increased number of obstacles, and a varying number of agents compared to what is seen during training.
