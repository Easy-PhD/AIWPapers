  abstract     = {The article proposes an innovative single-stage modular three-phase Power Factor Correction (PFC) converter featuring fewer current controllers. This technique leverages a practical DC-DC Quadratic Boost Converter (QBC) for PFC in Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS). An equivalent circuit with the non-ideal QBC is established and its small-signal model is derived, followed by a cascade control of inner current loops and outer voltage loops. The suggested linear quadratic regulator for linear matrix inequality-based PI control strategy ensures sinusoidal supply currents with a high power factor (PF) and low percentage Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for line, servo, and regulatory operations, while addressing imbalances in the magnitude of the supply voltage. Additionally, the PFC method regulates the load voltage, and the minimal number of current controllers reduces computational tasks, losses, and overall cost. MATLAB/Simulink is used to simulate the suggested system, which uses the extended symmetrical components approach for reference current generation. The QBC's effectiveness is validated under diverse working conditions using a DSPIC30F2010 controller for a 300â€¯W prototype. The results affirm the efficacy of the proposed technique, showcasing improved efficiency with fewer current controllers.},

To tackle this challenge, a hierarchical fuzzy state modeling technique is proposed in this work to construct fuzzy relation matrices (FRM) with reduced dimensions (orders), for system state forecasting. In processing, firstly, the FRM with high dimensions is decomposed into several lower-dimensional FRM models. Secondly, using the semi-tensor product, a fuzzy logic framework is developed to reduce the number of fuzzy rules. The proposed hierarchical fuzzy model is also implemented for gear system health state forecasting, where system parameters are trained to improve the fuzzy reasoning accuracy.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the tracking control problem for a class of nonlinear systems subject to time-varying total disturbance and proposes a cascaded linear active disturbance rejection control (CLADRC) approach based on additive state decomposition (ASD). By employing the ASD technique, the original system is equivalently decomposed into a nominal primary system and an uncertain secondary system. The primary system eliminates the estimated total disturbance to achieve precise reference tracking, while the secondary system suppresses the residual disturbance. Both subsystems are governed by state feedback controllers incorporating disturbance estimation and compensation. Compared to the standard linear active disturbance rejection control strategy, the proposed method fully decouples the tracking and robust components of the state feedback controller, enabling independent parameter tuning. Furthermore, by introducing a linear extended state observer for the secondary system, a secondary estimation of the residual disturbance is performed, thereby enhancing the robustness of the overall system. A criterion based on Lyapunov stability theory is provided to ensure that the closed-loop systems remain uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, simulation and experimental results on permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) speed regulation validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},

Finally, an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (ASMC) for the WT-based approximated model (WTAM) of the plant has been designed. The design of the controller uses the Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) for tuning purposes. The gain of the switching control law is decided by the gain adaptation technique. The Lyapunov Stability criterion is exploited to judge the stability. To validate the controller's performance in real-time, the WTAM of a Cart Inverted Pendulum is taken.

Traditional closed-loop control structure of digital accelerometers is optimized only for the disturbance loop, failing to optimize the performance of the dual loops simultaneously. An advanced dual-degree-of-freedom (ADOF) Smith predictive control is proposed herein, structurally isolating the setpoint loop from the disturbance loop. Firstly, the principle of the closed-loop digital accelerometer is elaborated, and the contradiction between the performance optimization of dual loops is analyzed. Secondly, an ADOF Smith predictive control is proposed and compared with other control structures. Furthermore, the setpoint and disturbance controllers in the structure are designed using the Dahlin algorithm and H âˆž optimal control methods for parameter tuning, with the controllers being determined by a single parameter. To quantitatively describe the relationship between the control parameters and robust performance, the relationship between the control parameters and the margin indicators is derived, and the control performance is evaluated. Finally, an experimental platform of a digital closed-loop accelerometer is constructed to validate the proposed ADOF control structure and parameter tuning methods. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed ADOF control structure significantly outperforms traditional digital closed-loop control and filtered Smith predictive control, and compared with the dual-degree-of-freedom control structure, it exhibits better nominal performance under low robustness parameters due to delay compensation.},

Specifically, we introduce a framework for causal kernel design based on generalized orthogonal basis functions (GOBFs) and successfully extend it to the non-causal scenario. In addition, using the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm as an example, we explore the potential of using meta-heuristic techniques for hyperparameter estimation in KRM. To further enhance the search accuracy of the algorithm, we improve the GWO algorithm by adopting a nonlinear weight update strategy and incorporating crossover and mutation strategies inspired by the genetic algorithm (GA).

  abstract     = {The attitude representation of the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) typically relies on Euler angles and unit quaternions. However, existing works have demonstrated that both approaches exhibit inherent limitations when solving large-angle rotation maneuvers, primarily characterized by singularities and unwinding phenomena. In light of these limitations, this article investigates a model-free tracking control scheme for AUV to perform arbitrary large-angle rotation maneuvers in six degrees of freedom (6-DOF). Specifically, a rotation matrix-based error dynamics is constructed to achieve a globally unique attitude representation. A key technical obstacle is that defining attitude error directly via the rotation matrix complicates controller design. To circumvent this problem, an alternative error metric is presented to transform the rotation matrix-based attitude error from the special orthogonal group in three-dimensional space (SO(3)) to Euclidean space. Distinguished from a single estimation network, a hierarchical echo state network (ESN) is established to estimate hydrodynamic coefficients and actuator faults, which comprises multiple independent subnetworks to conduct various estimation tasks. Moreover, a collaborative critic network (CCN) is utilized to generate reinforcement signals, endowing the hierarchical ESN with favorable learning capability. In this way, the system robustness is significantly enhanced while ensuring high tracking performance. Finally, rigorous theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are presented to show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control scheme.},

In order to achieve the goal of anti-swing, many researches have been developed. However, an extremely superior control technology, called backstepping, has not been applied to overhead cranes. In this paper, a block backstepping-based trajectory tracking control scheme for 2-DOF overhead cranes is proposed for the first time. Firstly, a new variable transformation with state coupling function is designed to achieve swing suppression and thereby improve transient performance. Then, in order to enhance steady-state performance, an integral state is introduced into the designed Lyapunov candidate function. Finally, a trajectory tracking controller is proposed by backstepping. Meanwhile, a novel parameter tuning method is developed using pole placement, which saves time and effort in control parameter tuning. Note that the proposed scheme only utilizes backstepping technology and does not use other techniques for additional processing. Via zero dynamics analysis and Lyapunov stability theorems, the stability is rigorously proved. The advantages and robustness of the proposed scheme are explained by the following experimental results: settling time of the trolley is about 5â€¯s, and the steady-state error remains within 0.5 % . The load swing angle enters the range of [ âˆ’ 0.5 deg, 0.5 deg] in about 4â€¯s.},

  abstract     = {Direct current (DC) arc faults are a leading cause of fire incidents in photovoltaic (PV) systems. Accurate modeling of DC arc faults is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of DC arcs and for developing effective detection strategies. In this study, we propose a novel model for DC arcs, referred to as the exponent segmented noise model. This model effectively characterizes arc noise by establishing an exponential relationship between frequency values and spectral energy. To enable precise parameter extraction from the exponent segmented noise model, we introduce a new metaheuristic algorithm called the feedback chaotic growth optimizer (FCGRO). FCGRO improves upon the traditional growth optimizer (GRO) by integrating feedback operators and chaos mechanisms. Firstly, the convergence performance of FCGRO is rigorously evaluated through comparative experiments on three well-established benchmark engineering optimization problems. Subsequently, based on data collected from an established experimental platform, the proposed FCGRO and eight state-of-the-art algorithms are employed to extract parameters of the exponent segmented noise model for DC arc faults. The FCGRO achieves an overall average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0418 with a standard deviation of 0.00818, representing reductions of at least 10.43â€¯% and 26.86â€¯%, respectively, compared to the other eight methods. These results indicate that FCGRO delivers more accurate and stable parameter estimations than the competing algorithms. Regarding computational efficiency, FCGRO has an average processing time of 9.969â€¯s, ranking it third among the nine evaluated methods, which confirms its competitiveness in terms of speed. Finally, compared with existing DC arc models, the proposed exponent segmented noise model reduces RMSE by an average of 53.26â€¯%, demonstrating its superior modeling capability.},

To address these issues, this work proposes a control strategy that integrates a robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE)-based immersion and invariance (I&I) adaptive controller with segmented gains and an improved mixer. The RISE-based adaptive controller is theoretically capable of estimating and compensating for external disturbance torques and forces with bounded derivatives. Furthermore, a model of the CTR module that accounts for differences between the upper and lower rotors is introduced, and the proposed mixer is designed to realize efficient control at varying tilt angles of the CTR modules. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme significantly improves stability, transient response speed, disturbance rejection performance, and parameter estimation accuracy compared to existing control strategies for the CTRUAV.},

Simulation and experimental results show that MGEA outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving a 16.35â€¯% reduction in trajectory length, a 13.74â€¯% increase in computational speed, and an 18.60â€¯% improvement in minimum fitness, while maintaining zero collisions in cluttered 3D environments. This method provides an efficient solution for industrial lifting tasks and demonstrates scalability potential. These advancements establish a theoretical foundation for real-time planning in dynamic non-convex environments, addressing critical challenges in the application of multi-robot suspension systems.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a finite-time active disturbance rejection control (FADRC) framework for quadrotor attitude tracking is presented. The FADRC framework is developed for two cascaded loops (inner-loop and outer-loop) to control the attitude angle and angular velocity, respectively. Two nonlinear extended state observers (NESOs) are devised to actively estimate and compensate for total disturbances, including internal uncertainties and external disturbances. A novel tracking differentiator (TD) is introduced to generate smooth angular speed information, featuring a simpler configuration and only one adjustable parameter, thus enhancing practical applicability. Additionally, a nonlinear control law is formulated to resist disturbances. For the outer-loop, a finite-time controller is designed to significantly enhance the tracking speed and mitigate the effects of tracking errors by ensuring convergence in a finite time, thereby improving the overall system response and robustness. The inner-loop nonlinear controller ensures rapid angular velocity tracking and stable output torques. The convergence of the TD and NESO, as well as the stability of the dual-loop controllers, are rigorously proven using Lyapunov methods. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control scheme achieves precise tracking performance with faster response speed, smaller tracking error, and better disturbance rejection performance compared to the existing methods.},

In some cases, the failure of one or more joints may lead to task failure or even cause damage, highlighting the necessity of fault tolerance as a crucial capability for robotic control systems. To achieve the fault-tolerant control capability of the redundant manipulator, a quadratic programming problem is formulated to minimize the joint velocity based on the task-priority strategy. Based on this formulation, a constraint transformation method is employed to handle the joint velocity constraints, and finally, this quadratic programming problem is solved using zeroing neurodynamics with finite-time convergence.

This paper develops a hybrid methodology using heterogeneous sensor measurements for monitoring robotic cutting tools with four tool states: healthy, surface damage, flake damage and broken tooth. The proposed approach integrates the maximal overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MODWPT) with health indicators to construct feature matrices for each tool state. Feature selection is performed using the tree growth algorithm (TGA) to reduce computation time and improve feature space separation by selecting only relevant features. The selected features are input into a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to detect, identify and classify each tool state with high accuracy. The proposed method provides a classification accuracy of 99.04â€¯% for vibration, 95.51â€¯% for torque, and 91.67â€¯% for force signals. Using unseen vibration data, the model achieved a test accuracy of 98.44â€¯%, demonstrating a high degree of generalizability.

Existing methods face difficulties in accurately picking the first arrival event due to the combined effects of signal distortion from wireless channel fading and the inability to distinguish and suppress measurement outliers effectively. To overcome these challenges, the signal model for the microseismic system with wireless transmission channel fading is established in this paper, which reflects real-world engineering scenarios. Subsequently, a recursive filter incorporating a self-adaptive saturation function (SSF) is proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of MOs on arrival time picking accuracy. The filter gain is derived by minimizing the upper bound matrix of the filter error covariance, and a sufficient condition is proposed to ensure that the filtering error is mean-square exponentially bounded. The presented algorithm effectively suppresses the negative impact of MOs and enhances filtering performance in scenarios with wireless channel fading.

Unlike other studies on large-scale interconnected systems, the equilibrium point of the system under our study is not zero. Firstly, by incorporating a discount factor and introducing a barrier function and a Lyapunovâ€“Krasovskii (L-K) function, we construct a cost function for the interconnected system with a non-zero equilibrium point, time delay, and constraints, thereby transforming the constrained decentralized control problem into an unconstrained optimal control problem (OCP). Subsequently, an event-based Hamiltonâ€“Jacobiâ€“Bellman (HJB) equation is established. To enhance computational efficiency, a DET mechanism is proposed. Then, the event-triggered HJB equation is solved utilizing the learning method based on ADP. Simultaneously, the weights of the neural network (NN) are optimized using a gradient descent algorithm and experience replay (ER) techniques. By employing ER technology, we have eliminated the systemâ€™s requirement for continuous excitation. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis, we have demonstrated the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the system states and neural network weights, and excluded Zeno behavior. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by using a spring-pendulum example.},

  abstract     = {The fault-tolerant control (FTC) issue for quantized nonlinear stochastic distribution control (SDC) systems in the presence of both actuator and sensor faults is addressed. A two-step fuzzy modeling approach is employed to systematically construct the static and dynamic models of the system, which establishes a foundational framework for subsequent fault diagnosis (FD) and FTC. Building upon the model, an adaptive augmented observer is designed to estimate actuator and sensor faults simultaneously, even under the influence of quantization effects. Furthermore, an innovative comprehensive FTC strategy is proposed, in which a virtual sensor compensator is integrated with a minimum rational entropy (MRE) fault-tolerant controller to effectively compensate for faults and ensure the system stability. The practical effectiveness of the proposed methodology is validated through its application to a molecular weight distribution system.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the Koopman method has found numerous applications in the field of nonlinear control due to its ability to map nonlinear states into high-dimensional spaces, thereby transforming nonlinear control problems into linear or bilinear problems. However, Koopman methods based on deep learning suffer from slow convergence, and the Koopman coefficients obtained through iterative processes cannot guarantee long-term prediction stability in the high-dimensional mapped space. To address these issues, we propose a Stable Deep Koopman Network with Model Predictive Control (SDKN-MPC) method for nonlinear control. The SDKN-MPC method utilizes the Stable Koopman Solver Algorithm to solve for a stable Koopman operator. It incorporates neural network training for embedding functions, with both training processes interleaved until convergence is achieved towards a unified stable solution. Subsequently, Model Predictive Control (MPC) is employed to control the high-dimensional linear system mapped through the Koopman operator, yielding high-dimensional desired inputs. These inputs undergo further processing through an auxiliary network to obtain the actual predictive control inputs. The proposed method is subjected to long-term predictive performance testing across multiple typical nonlinear control tasks and is compared with existing deep learning-based approaches. The results demonstrate that our method can extract more effective nonlinear features, converges rapidly, and exhibits superior predictive performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) face significant challenges in tracking, navigation, and obstacle avoidanceâ€”critical aspects for advancing intelligent underwater robotics. This research presents a new navigation technique that combines Guiding Vector Field (GVF) concepts with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to improve the precision and efficiency of vectored thruster AUV operating in complex environments. The proposed approach utilizes the AUV's relative positioning and environmental data to generate obstacle avoidance trajectories as desired GVF. Subsequently, MPPI optimization is applied to control inputs, considering dynamic constraints, to achieve effective tracking and obstacle avoidance. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate the method's efficacy in navigating complex scenarios with non-convex obstacles. In the aspect of path tracking, the tracking error is reduced by 64â€¯%, while maintaining safe distances in various obstacle configurations. Results show that the integrated method successfully combines local optimization prediction capabilities of MPPI with the global velocity planning of GVF, enabling efficient AUV navigation in intricate environments while ensuring the effectiveness and safety of the execution process. The method demonstrates robust performance even under disturbance conditions, maintaining a tracking error of only 0.017â€¯m. This research contributes a solution for AUV operation in challenging maritime settings, with applications in marine surveying, underwater search and rescue, and offshore operations. By addressing key challenges in underwater navigation, this study advances the practical capabilities of AUV technology, paving the way for more efficient and reliable underwater robotic systems.},

The guidance law is meticulously crafted to operate in scenarios where determining gap edges relies on active vision methods, making it reliable in various real-world applications. What sets this guidance law apart from existing ones is its adherence to a nonlinear framework, refraining from the need to linearize the system dynamics. This remarkable feature allows the proposed guidance design to maintain its effectiveness even when the deviations in the heading and flight path angle are significant from their nominal values. The efficacy of the proposed guidance law is substantiated using a point mass vehicle and the quadrotor in the planar and three-dimensional scenarios. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed design, considering wind gusts and Gaussian noise. The results obtained from these simulations demonstrate the efficacy of barrier Lyapunov function-based guidance for aerial vehicles in the context of gap traversal.},

First, the mathematical model of undetectable attacks is conducted, and the conditions under which these attacks cannot be jointly detected by the global positioning system (GPS) and the laser distance sensor (LDS) are specified. Then, the existence and implementation of secure flight trajectories for UAVs under undetectable attacks are explored. A strategy based on Pontryaginâ€™s Maximum Principle is proposed to plan a safe trajectory. This strategy ensures that UAVs can safely reach their destinations, even when facing undetectable attacks.

Then, a memory-based anti-attack scheme is presented for designing the secure observer-based controller, supplying an effective method to weaken the impact of DoS attacks on formation control. Subsequently, the set-membership concept is introduced to derive some sufficient conditions such that the one-step ahead formation errors are always confined to the tracking ellipsoidal set. Combining the sufficient conditions with saturation constraints, an optimization problem is proposed to obtain the optimal ellipsoidal sets. For reaching the leader-following formation, an online optimization algorithm is provided to recursively solve the observer-based controller. To reduce the execution frequency of the optimization problem, a novel event-triggered mechanism with attack-dependent adaptive threshold is embedded in the optimization algorithm.

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a periodic event-triggered control (PETC) algorithm for underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) subject to unknown exogenous perturbances within limited communication bandwidth. Initially, the underactuated USV model is reformulated using output redefinition-based dynamic inversion (ORDI) so that the system attains a well-defined relative degree through an approximate variable vector. While typical USV control strategies isolate the yaw and surge channel, the ORDI integrates both dimensions into a single framework to adopt a direct controller design. Subsequently, the minimum-learning-parameter radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) with adaptive laws is employed to effectively approximate the nonlinear dynamics and external perturbations with rapid and fewer computations. After that, an anti-chattering velocity observer is presented to provide accurate velocity estimation based solely on position data transmission. Building on this, a PETC algorithm is introduced which balances the periodic sampling with traditional event-triggered control via a sliding mode manifold. This mechanism is designed to assess the requirement for computations and the subsequent transmission of updated measurements alongside current control signals. Furthermore, it can dynamically adjust the communication frequency between the controller and the actuators, in accordance with the digital platformâ€™s demands. Moreover, Theoretical analysis rigorously proves that state errors and estimation errors converge to equilibrium and ensure the system stability. Numerical simulations substantiate the robustness and superior performance of the proposed control scheme under bandwidth limitations and uncertain conditions.},
