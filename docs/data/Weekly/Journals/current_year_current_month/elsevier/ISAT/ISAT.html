  abstract     = {In automotive fuel cell systems, high-voltage operation accelerates carbon support and platinum catalyst degradation, significantly compromising system durability. This study develops a dynamic system model with active cathode recirculation to capture the transient response of voltage, and proposes a hybrid control scheme that combines a proportional compensator with a fuzzy LQG controller to effectively enhance voltage regulation and disturbance tracking capabilities. Extensive simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) confirm the precision and rapid response of the developed controller. Compared to single LQG and fuzzy LQG controllers, the error reduction achieved is 49.3 % and 40.3 %, respectively, and the overall control benefit ratio improves by 19.2 % and 11 %. This method balances dynamic response with control efforts, effectively reducing the risk of high voltage-induced degradation under low-load conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper introduces a novel alarm system designed for use with both Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) and non-IID variables. The proposed algorithm, termed the Cascade Alarm System (CAS), utilizes the largest singular value of the signal as the basis for fault detection, employing k alarm subsystems. The greatest singular values extracted from the Lagged Covariance Matrix (LCM) of a sliding window constitute the output of the first alarm subsystem. The CAS offers two primary advantages. First, each subsystem independently generates its own alarm signal, resulting in a more flexible multilevel architecture. Second, the multilevel structure, founded on singular value decomposition (SVD), exhibits a filtering property that enhances its resilience to noise and inaccuracies. The maximum singular value effectively captures the essential information of the signal, ensuring that the filtering capabilities of the proposed method do not significantly compromise the performance of the alarm system or the integrity of critical signal information. The experimental results from the implementation of the proposed alarm system under various fault conditions demonstrate satisfactory performance. Additionally, the performance of the Cascade Alarm System has been compared with leading contemporary alarm system design methodologies, including median, moving average filters, delay timers, Cumulative Sum Control Chart (CUSUM), and serial method.},

  abstract     = {Due to the residual pressure accumulated during the reciprocating movement of the plunger pump, there is a deviation between the flow pulsation and the theoretical calculation value. Current nonlinear control methods for the electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA) often oversimplify and compensate for flow pulsation linearly, neglecting its nonlinear characteristics and deviation effects. This approach increases matching uncertainties and amplifies noise due to higher control gains, thus limiting the improvement of control performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a composite adaptive disturbance rejection control method based on flow pulsation compensation for the EHA. This method equates the flow pulsation model of the pump to a combination of a theoretical flow pulsation control input term and a bounded disturbance term (the difference between the theoretical and actual flow pulsation), followed by the design of a composite adaptive law to handle parameter uncertainties, and the design of the expanded state observers based on position and pressure signals to estimate and compensate for the uncertainties nonlinearly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing with other control methods through experiments.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for a class of Quasi-Linear Parameter-Varying (quasi-LPV) systems characterized by a measurable time-varying parameter. The core of the proposed quasi-LPV-MPC controller lies in the utilization of a polytopic representation along with a gain-scheduled controller. A terminal cost that depends explicitly on the scheduling parameter is used. However, for the implementation, a complementary cost function is used to frame the optimization problem at each vertex level so that the requirement of updating the varying parameters over the prediction horizon is relaxed. Though the resulting suboptimal controller involves more computational burden, the proposed method demonstrates improvement in control performance over traditional MPC schemes. Experimental validation on a cascaded coupled tank system underscores the practical efficacy of the proposed quasi-LPV-MPC controller, while simulation studies on a twin rotor multi-input multi-output system serve as an additional demonstration example case. Comparative performance evaluations against both linear and nonlinear MPCs clearly illustrate that the quasi-LPV-MPC offers better control precision, adaptability, and the overall system responsiveness, thus positioning it as an effective solution for quasi-LPV systems.},

However, individual control of each component without considering the overall power matching leads the system to the low-efficiency zone, results in environmental pollution and huge economic loss. Therefore, it is highly desirable to find a way of obtaining energy-saving green MSAHSs. In this paper, the power consumption model of closed MSAHSs is established firstly to analyze theoretical factors affecting the component efficiency and find that the hydraulic pressure is the key factor. On this basis, a multi-algorithm integration global power matching method is then proposed, which consist of back propagation (BP) neural network, dynamic programming (DP) and improved adaptive genetic algorithm (IAGA). BP is used to construct efficiency prediction models for power elements (pumps, motors and engines) respectively, DP is used for elements’ high efficiency zone preliminary search, and IAGA is used to realize the global power matching of the multiple power units with energy conversion and transfer finally through optimal control parameters precise searching. Experiment is conducted on the closed MSAHS in a hydraulic fracturing vehicle. Results demonstrate that the MSAHS applied with multi-algorithm integration method improves the overall efficiency to a highest fuel savings of 35.5 % under normal conditions compared with local power matching control.},

The differences in working resistance and its time-varying unpredictability when shoveling different objects are the main causes of high energy consumption during the shoveling stage. In this paper, through the analysis of the shoveling process, the influence of the compacted layer on the working resistance is obtained. The constructed Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation model is used to elucidate that the timely lifting of the boom can have a destructive effect on the compacted layer. Moreover, considering the diversity of working objects, a study was carried out on the effect of different boom lifting ranges on the destruction of the compacted layer. The loader shoveling system's intelligent Energy Adaptive Control (EAC) strategy is constructed by integrating the material recognition model based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network algorithm. This control strategy can output the set pilot pressure according to the material type, realize the intelligent adjustment of the lifting range of the boom with the change of material type, and reduce the working resistance during the shoveling stage. The peak engine power consumed while shoveling sand, gravel, and boulders decreased by 20.6 %, 19.1 %, and 10.9 %, respectively, improving the energy utilization rate of the loader shoveling system when facing different working objects.},

To mitigate mechanical resonance, online adaptive notch filter is extensive used, thus the precise determination of resonant frequency holds significant importance. However, in certain scenarios involving the high-bandwidth servo system, a phenomenon known as frequency shift can make the notch filter ineffective in addressing servo resonance. To solve this problem, an oscillation frequency correction scheme based on two improved sliding-mode observers (ISMOs) utilizing a dual-power approximation law is proposed. First, the oscillation frequency shift is analyzed around the system delay, which can be equivalently modeled using a Pade approximation method. Subsequently, a feedback loop featuring two adaptive feedback coefficients is designed to automatically tune the time factor. Remarkably, the scheme can dynamically correct oscillation frequency, thereby promoting resonance suppression. At the same time, ISMOs-identified mechanical parameters provide critical foundations for feedback coefficient adjustment. It is worth noting that the dual-power approximation law effectively suppresses high-frequency chatter while maintaining parameter identification accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the scheme is validated through simulation and experimental results.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a segmented internal model control (SIMC) scheme based on the segmented combination model of the electromagnetic micro-mirror system (EMMS) is established. Notice that highly underdamped oscillation and rate-dependent hysteresis exist in the EMMS, so it is a complex nonlinear dynamic system. In order to control the deflection angle of the EMMS using the internal model control strategy, it is necessary to establish the inverse model of the EMMS. Therefore, a new model structure that is convenient for inversion is proposed in this paper to describe the characteristics of the EMMS with underdamped and rate-dependent hysteresis. In the proposed scheme, the model is a combination of a group of weighted sub-models based on the segmentation of the system's operating frequency. The weight of each segmented sub-model is not a constant but a new type of function which is also called the smoothing factor. Its function is to smooth the switching between sub-models, thereby reducing the dynamic error caused by model switching. In addition, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to determine the optimal frequency segmentation points, which helps to obtain the optimal model for describing the system characteristics. Based on the proposed segmented combination model, the corresponding segmented internal model control with two-degree-of-freedom filters is proposed, and the corresponding filters in the internal model control are designed based on the small gain theorem. Finally, the proposed control strategy is applied to the control of the deflection angle of the electromagnetic micro-mirror to verify the proposed control method. Moreover, the non-smooth internal model control strategy is also used for comparison in the experiments.},

The PPAC strategy aims to enhance, rather than replace, existing PID control loops in open-source autopilots. Although traditional autopilots effectively manage routine tasks in most applications, their reliance on meticulous tuning remains a limitation. To address this, PPAC leverages historical flight data, a frequently overlooked resource, to derive dynamic linearization models and control laws without requiring explicit UAV models. The PPAC framework is then integrated with the Total Energy Control System (TECS) for practical deployment in takeoff and cruising scenarios. Comprehensive numerical simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) tests validate the strategy by comparing baseline autopilot performance with PPAC-augmented systems. Results confirm that PPAC ensures prescribed performance bounds for altitude tracking errors across evaluated scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in augmenting autopilots with minimized redesign efforts.},

Based on the established nonlinear model, an adaptive robust controller (ARC) is designed by using the backstepping approach to overcome the parametric uncertainties and hard-to-model dynamics. The dual-observer is employed in the controller to observe and compensate for the nonlinear friction, which improves the low-velocity tracking performance of the ball-screw drives. Meanwhile, first-order filters are introduced by dynamic surface control (DSC) technique to eliminate the “complexity explosion” problem caused by the backstepping method.

However, traditional fault detection technologies still heavily rely on additional sensors. The resulting enormous cost of sensors restricts the application of those technologies. Given this situation, a self-sensing fault detection framework to explore the weak fault impulses of the planetary gearbox is presented without additional sensors. In this framework, we first capture the preliminary signals from the servo control systems. Then, the hole control model of the motor driving planetary gearbox is constructed. After this step, the feasibility of fault detection for the planetary gearbox through the motor servo control signals is investigated. With the measured servo control signals, a multi-signal assisting adaptive time synchronous averaging method is first proposed to explore fault impulses. This method first introduces a periodic enhanced Gini to select optimal parameters adaptively. Finally, experiments on a weak fault of three components in the planetary gearbox are carried out separately, certifying our framework's validation of planetary gearbox fault detection. This framework hopes to provide a novel scheme for the weak fault self-sensing of planetary gearboxes.},

  abstract     = {With the broad application of plug-and-play loads, it brings new challenges to conventional control issues in DC microgrids. This work addresses the joint optimization of generation costs and transmission line power losses considering bus voltage regulation. Specifically, the concept of virtual load nodes is first introduced so that loads can be implemented as plug-and-play. Through Kron Reduction, bus voltage of load nodes is indirectly controlled by DG nodes. Then, a distributed dual-projection-layer recurrent neural network (DRNN) is proposed for real-time optimal control. The coupled voltage and current are simultaneously maintained within safe bounds. By using Lyapunov synthesis, the convergence of the DRNN is demonstrated. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated by simulations in terms of plug-and-play test and comparative analysis.},

  abstract     = {Gas turbines, as highly complex thermal systems, exhibit significant nonlinearity and stochastic coupling in process control. Under closed-loop automatic speed regulation, persistent parametric oscillations may arise, posing serious threats to system reliability and safety. Aiming to reveal the stochastic response characteristics of parametric oscillations in gas turbines, this paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the evolution law of parametric oscillation and multi-source stochastic excitations based on stochastic dynamics model, which is derived from thermodynamic equations and verified by measurement data. The internal stochastic excitation is determined by information entropy, while the form of the stochastic process of the external stochastic excitation is identified through data-driven reverse identification. The PDF evolution law of parametric oscillation is studied for different excitation forms, and the bifurcation behavior and sensitivity analysis of them are carried out. Under typical operating conditions, the synergistic effect of internal and external stochastic excitations reduces parametric oscillation amplitude by approximately 31 % compared to internal excitation alone. Moreover, the originally tri-modal distribution evolves into a unimodal pattern, revealing the transition trend of parametric oscillation behavior in gas turbines. These findings offer an effective approach to analyze parametric oscillation.},

To overcome this challenge, we innovatively develop a hierarchical Gaussian-process-based nonlinear programming (GPNLP) approach for the USV time-optimal global path planning and COLAV local path planning. We model irregular static obstacles using Gaussian process regression for the first time, such that navigable waters are more sufficiently utilized for path planning. A TSS compliance assessment function is created to output violation penalties for the TSS requirements that should be satisfied as far as practicable. Accordingly, we plan the time-optimal global path and the COLAV local path hierarchically by minimizing two integral objective functions (with respect to the TSS violation penalties) subject to the multiple constraints. Simulations and simulation comparison results demonstrate that both the planned USV time-optimal global path and COLAV local path under the proposed hierarchical GPNLP approach are USV dynamics compliant and TSS compliant.},

An improved fixed-time auxiliary system is applied to compensate for the effects of input saturation nonlinearity. By developing a novel switching boundary protection algorithm, a switching control scheme is further designed to solve the output constraints better. An improved FTDO is developed to estimate composite disturbances containing saturation function approximation errors and external disturbances.

Therefore, this study proposes a random reference tracking nonlinear model predictive control with dynamic forecasting of stochastic references. Convergence to a robust invariant set is guaranteed by an additional constraint limiting the previous step’s tracking stage cost function. The proposed predictive approach is implemented using a parallel Newton-type method to make it more efficient and applicable. The proposed approach for wind turbine control is designed considering the random wind speed reference. Simulations are performed for extreme and fatigue load scenarios. The results show that the proposed controller performs more robustly than the nominal nonlinear model predictive control approach, performing better in optimal power extraction and reducing aerodynamic loads.},

  abstract     = {The preservation of stability is essential for the efficient and reliable functioning of the electrical transmission system. Frequency oscillations are prevalent in interconnected power systems (IPS) and may lead to instability; therefore, it is crucial to monitor and examine them meticulously. Effective frequency management is essential for regulating frequency output in an interconnected smart power system (ISPS) that includes renewable energy sources (RESs), redox flow batteries (RFBs) and static synchronous series compensators (SSSCs). In view of the challenge presented, this research introduces an efficient control architecture that utilizes a 2 degree of freedom-based model predictive controller (2DoF-MPC) to enhance system performance. Additionally, it integrates a linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) to employ a state observer alongside the evolving frequency management. The convergence of the predictive and state observer frameworks results in a robust 2DoF-MPC-LADRC to manage frequency disturbances and uncertainties in the power system. The suggested technique is thoroughly validated across several parameters for ISPS, instilling confidence in its capacity to attain minimal frequency variation in multiple scenarios. The performance of the proposed controller design shows that the frequency performance in area 1 and area 2 settles in 5.085 sec and 3.965 sec, when the load changes by 3 %, and it settles in 4.655 sec and 4.050 sec, respectively, when the load changes by 5 %.},

The FOSMCC strategy synthesizes the fractional-order control and predefined-time theory with sliding mode control, augmented by the disturbance feedforward compensation loop driven by dual STDOs. Such control framework provides enhanced control performance guarantees, including fast transient response, high steady-state precision, and reinforced disturbance rejection. Furthermore, by employing Lyapunov’s direct approach, it is theoretically demonstrated that the entire NSSS, under the developed coordinated strategy, achieves superior predefined-time stability. Finally, comprehensive numerical validation and comparative studies reveal that the developed FOSMCC strategy with STDOs significantly outperforms both the latest fractional-order fixed-time sliding mode controller (FOFTSMC) and the practically adopted coordinated controller (PACC), exhibiting better transient/steady-state control response and stronger robustness against disturbances. Simulation results validate that, in the presence of compound disturbances, the proposed FOSMCC strategy reduces the integral absolute control error of nuclear power and water level by 89.37 % and 87.67 %, respectively, compared to FOFTSMC, and by 99.97 % and 99.99 %, respectively, compared to PACC.},

The current study introduces a novel saturated non-singular terminal sliding mode controller to address input saturation for an over-actuated remotely-operated vehicle (ROV). The proposed controller consists of a tuning algorithm to ensure that the control commands do not violate the time-varying saturation limits of each DOF. In addition, a fixed-time extended-state observer is designed to estimate the vehicle’s velocity along with the lumped unknown dynamics of the system. The observer is also employed as a tool to maintain the orientation of the ROV in extreme environmental conditions. The stability analysis shows that all system’s states, except for yaw angle, are globally finite-time stable and the yaw angle is globally asymptotically stable. Several sets of simulations are carried out and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed controller in terms of positioning accuracy, saturation compensation and transient behaviour under different environmental conditions.},

The control objectives include controlling both the directly actuated generalized coordinates and the non-actuated generalized coordinate, which is controllable through dynamic coupling with the actuated coordinates. In this regard, the system's dynamic equations are derived using the Lagrangian approach. A new nonlinear and nonsingular sliding manifold is introduced, based on which a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of the robot. This approach addresses the challenges posed by underactuation, system nonlinearities, instability, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is proven that finite-time asymptotic convergence of the tracking error to zero is ensured when the uncertainty upper bound is known, and convergence to a residual set is achieved when the upper bound is unavailable. The theoretical guarantees provided by the proposed control scheme are further validated through comprehensive MATLAB simulations, where its effectiveness is demonstrated under both low- and high-frequency disturbances as well as parameter uncertainties.},

Moreover, an event-triggering protocol is implemented to manage network resources efficiently. Furthermore, by employing the stochastic Lyapunov theory and the finite-time analysis method, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the finite-time boundedness of the resulting closed-loop system throughout both the reaching and sliding motion phases. To mitigate the attack’s effects and improve the system’s performance, the Secretary Bird Optimization Algorithm (SBOA) with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) is explored as a new approach for designing the optimal gains of controllers and observers.

In the network layer, a distributed observer with secure output feedback control is developed to mitigate severe deception attacks, ensuring that the mean square observer error remains within an acceptable range. In the physical layer, fault compensators are designed to address both additive and multiplicative faults. As a result, the followers achieve time-varying formation control, and closed-loop stability analysis is conducted using the Lyapunov method.

  abstract     = {The development of multi-agent consensus raises the importance of network topology. As the number of agents increases, multi-agent systems (MAS) in a large-scale and high-density topology demand higher resources, which consequently degrades efficiency of consensus. Existing approaches that consider only direct point-to-point neighbors may overlook potential topological information, further hindering consensus performance. To achieve fast consensus in large-scale and high-density topologies, a framework named Homogeneous Connections Based on Agents State Fusions MAS (HCASFMAS) is proposed. The framework extracts broader topology information of consensus degree by fusing states of two-hop neighbors. Leveraging homogeneous idea, agents establish homogeneous connections with neighbors that exhibit a higher consensus degree, ultimately accelerating the consensus process while preserving connectivity. First, a neighbor selection strategy based on consensus degree of agent state fusion is introduced to construct candidate neighbors, aiming to reduce redundant connections. Second, an adaptive consensus algorithm is formulated to flexibly adapt to the distribution of neighbors. Finally, a candidate constraints set is established to accelerate consensus by expanding the scope of constraints while preserving connectivity. In this study, connectivity and convergence of the system are theoretically analyzed from a geometric perspective. Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the proposed method with existing approaches under different densities and topologies. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of this method in achieving fast convergence, particularly in large-scale and high-density scenarios.},

First, a learning controller and a learning identifier are constructed. Based on DLA and the exponential stability of a class of linear time-varying (LTV) discrete-time systems, the control knowledge and the diagnosis knowledge of the actuator faults are obtained. Second, a set of controllers and a set of diagnosis estimators are constructed based on the learnt control and diagnosis knowledge. When an incipient actuator fault occurs, fast fault detection and isolation (FDI) can be achieved using the diagnosis estimators. Then, the pattern-based FTC scheme is implemented to improve the control performance. When the small fault grows to a larger one, the rapid FDI and FTC are implemented again, providing fast responses to the occurred larger fault. The advantages of the proposed method are that: (i) a simple adaptive learning controller with the filtering technique is designed, in which the exponential convergence of the tracking error and parameter estimation errors can be achieved simultaneously; (ii) the sensitivity to small actuator faults is enhanced, and the fast FTC to larger actuator faults is achieved by utilizing the learnt knowledge.
