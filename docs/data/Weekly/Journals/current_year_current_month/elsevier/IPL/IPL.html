For this purpose we introduce a new concept of guarded pancake blocks. Gates and Papadimitriou proved that f ( n ) ≥ 17 n / 16 for n a multiple of 16. Heydari and Sudborough improved this bound to f ( n ) ≥ 15 n / 14 for n a multiple of 14. We extend that result to f ( n ) ≥ ⌊ ( 15 n + 9 ) / 14 ⌋ for every n ≥ 6 .},

  abstract     = {Quantitative aspects like probabilities play an important role in concurrent processes. Providing a (modal) logic for a randomized concurrency model can augment the toolbox of analyzing probabilistic processes, and thus is a frequent topic in the field. In this paper, we are interested in logically characterizing uniformly randomized processes, whose semantical behavior is defined in a model-independent manner. Specifically, we present two modal logics for the uniformly randomized version of finite-state CCS (RCCS fs for short). Our logics extend the Hennessy-Milner logic, and one of them is equipped with the μ operator. Indeed, we prove that both logics characterize the branching bisimilarity for RCCS fs , i.e., two RCCS fs processes are branching bisimilar if and only if they are logically equivalent. To facilitate the proof, we also develop for RCCS fs an up-to proof method, which may be of independent interest.},

Given any string X , a factor W of X is called a cyclic cover if each position of X belongs to an occurrence of a cyclic shift of W in X . Two cyclic covers are distinct if one is not a cyclic shift of the other. The cyclic covers problem asks for all distinct cyclic covers of an input string X . We present an algorithm that solves the cyclic covers problem in O ( n log ⁡ n ) time, where n is the length of X . It is based on finding a well-structured set of standard occurrences of a constant number of factors of a cyclic cover candidate W , computing the regions of X covered by cyclic shifts of W , extending those factors, and taking the union of the results.},

The period of a digraph is the least common multiple of the periods of its strongly connected components. These notions play an important role in the theory of Markov chains and the analysis of powers of nonnegative matrices. While the time complexity of computing the period is well-understood, little is known about its space complexity. We show that the problem of computing the period of a digraph is NL -complete, even if all its cycles are contained in the same strongly connected component. However, if the digraph is strongly connected, we show that this problem becomes L -complete. For primitive digraphs (that is, strongly connected digraphs of period one), there always exists a number m such that there is a path of length exactly m between every two vertices. We show that computing the smallest such m , called the exponent of a digraph, is NL -complete. The exponent of a primitive digraph is a particular case of the index of convergence of a nonnegative matrix, which we also show to be computable in NL , and thus NL -complete.},

This is called a supercritical tradeoff between size and height because, if we do not care about size, every CNF is refutable in height n . Our proof method uses a simple construction, based on or-ification and base d representations of integers, to reduce the number of variables. A similar result appeared in [Fleming, Pitassi and Robere, ITCS '22], for different formulas using a more complicated construction for reducing the number of variables. Small refutations of our formula are necessarily highly irregular, making it a plausible candidate to separate resolution from pool resolution, which amounts to separating CDCL with restarts from CDCL without restarts. We are not able to show this. In the other direction, we show that a simpler version of our formula, with a similar irregularity property, does have polynomial size pool resolution refutations and thus does not provide such a separation for CDCL.},
