  abstract     = {A linear k -diforest is a directed forest consisting of directed paths of length at most k . Linear k -arboricity of a directed graph is defined as the minimum number of linear k -diforests needed to partition the edges of the graph. We show that the problem of deciding reachability in directed graphs having linear 2-arboricity two is NL -hard and the same is also true for directed graphs having linear 1-arboricity three. Our proof also implies that deciding reachability in such graphs remains hard even when a decomposition into two linear 2-diforests or three linear 1-diforests is provided. We further extend our results for a more restricted notion of linear arboricity, called geometric linear arboricity.},

Previously, the best complexity of the attack was 2 64 by Derbez et al. in ToSC 2024(1)/FSE 2024. We show that the committing attack against Rocca by Takeuchi et al. in ToSC 2024(2)/FSE 2025 can be applied to Rocca-S, where Rocca is an earlier version of Rocca-S. We show a concrete test vector of our attack. We also point out a committing attack that exploits equivalent keys.},

  abstract     = {A harmonious k -coloring of a graph G is a 2-distance proper k -coloring of its vertices such that each edge is uniquely identified by the colors of its endpoints. Here, we introduce its game version: the harmonious coloring game. In this two-player game, Alice and Bob alternately select an uncolored vertex and assigns to it a color in { 1 , … , k } with the constraint that, at every turn, the set of colored vertices induces a valid partial harmonious coloring. Alice wins if all vertices are colored; otherwise, Bob wins. The harmonious game chromatic number χ h g ( G ) is the minimum integer k such that Alice has a winning strategy with k colors. In this paper, we prove the PSPACE-hardness of three variants of this game. As a by-product, we prove that a variant introduced by Chen et al. in 1997 of the classical graph coloring game is PSPACE-hard even in graphs with diameter two. We also obtain lower and upper bounds for χ h g ( G ) in graph classes, such as paths, cycles, grids and forests of stars.},

  abstract     = {In the Steiner Path Aggregation Problem , our goal is to aggregate paths in a directed network into a single arborescence without significantly disrupting the paths. In particular, we are given a directed multigraph with colored arcs, a root, and k terminals, each of which has a monochromatic path to the root. Our goal is to find an arborescence in which every terminal has a path to the root, and its path does not switch colors too many times. We give an efficient algorithm that finds such a solution with at most 2 log 4 3 ⁡ k color switches. Up to constant factors this is the best possible universal bound, as there are graphs requiring at least log 2 ⁡ k color switches.},
