  abstract     = {A harmonious k -coloring of a graph G is a 2-distance proper k -coloring of its vertices such that each edge is uniquely identified by the colors of its endpoints. Here, we introduce its game version: the harmonious coloring game. In this two-player game, Alice and Bob alternately select an uncolored vertex and assigns to it a color in { 1 , … , k } with the constraint that, at every turn, the set of colored vertices induces a valid partial harmonious coloring. Alice wins if all vertices are colored; otherwise, Bob wins. The harmonious game chromatic number χ h g ( G ) is the minimum integer k such that Alice has a winning strategy with k colors. In this paper, we prove the PSPACE-hardness of three variants of this game. As a by-product, we prove that a variant introduced by Chen et al. in 1997 of the classical graph coloring game is PSPACE-hard even in graphs with diameter two. We also obtain lower and upper bounds for χ h g ( G ) in graph classes, such as paths, cycles, grids and forests of stars.},

  abstract     = {In the Steiner Path Aggregation Problem , our goal is to aggregate paths in a directed network into a single arborescence without significantly disrupting the paths. In particular, we are given a directed multigraph with colored arcs, a root, and k terminals, each of which has a monochromatic path to the root. Our goal is to find an arborescence in which every terminal has a path to the root, and its path does not switch colors too many times. We give an efficient algorithm that finds such a solution with at most 2 log 4 3 ⁡ k color switches. Up to constant factors this is the best possible universal bound, as there are graphs requiring at least log 2 ⁡ k color switches.},
