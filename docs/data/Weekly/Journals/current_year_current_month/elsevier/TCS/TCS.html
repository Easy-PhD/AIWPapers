  abstract     = {The game of i -MARK is an impartial combinatorial game introduced by Sopena (2016). The game is parametrized by two sets of positive integers S , D , where min D ≥ 2 . From position n ≥ 0 one can move to any position n − s , s ∈ S , as long as n − s ≥ 0 , as well as to any position n / d , d ∈ D , as long as n > 0 and d divides n . The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the last player to move is the winner. Sopena, and subsequently Friman and Nivasch (2021), characterized the Sprague–Grundy sequences of many cases of i -MARK ( S , D ) with | D | = 1 . Friman and Nivasch also obtained some partial results for the case i -MARK ( { 1 } , { 2 , 3 } ) . In this paper we present a convergence technique that gives polynomial-time algorithms for the Sprague–Grundy sequence of many instances of i -MARK with | D | > 1 . In particular, we prove our technique works for all games i -MARK ( { 1 } , { d 1 , d 2 } ) .},

  abstract     = {Robots with very weak capabilities placed on the vertices of a graph are required to move toward a common vertex from where they do not move anymore. The task is known as the Gathering problem and it has been extensively studied in the last decade with respect to both general graphs and specific topologies. Most of the challenges faced are due to possible isometries observable from the placement of the robots with respect to the underlying topology. Rings, Grids, and Complete graphs are just a few examples of very regular topologies where the placement of the robots and suitable movements are crucial for succeeding in Gathering. Here we are interested in understanding what can be done in Butterfly graphs where really many isometries are present and most importantly unavoidable by any movement. We propose a Gathering algorithm for the so-called leader configurations, i.e., those where the initial placement of the robots admits the detection (and election) of one robot as the leader. We introduce a non-trivial technique to elect the leader which is of its own interest. We also prove that the proposed Gathering algorithm is asymptotically optimal in terms of synchronous rounds required.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the shape formation problem within the 3D hybrid model, where a single agent with a strictly limited viewing range and the computational capacity of a deterministic finite automaton manipulates passive tiles through pickup, movement, and placement actions. The goal is to reconfigure a set of tiles into a specific shape termed an icicle . The icicle, identified as a dense, hole-free structure, is strategically chosen to function as an intermediate shape for more intricate shape formation tasks. It is designed for easy exploration by a finite-state agent, enabling the identification of tiles that can be lifted without breaking connectivity. Compared to the line shape, the icicle presents distinct advantages, including a reduced diameter and the presence of multiple removable tiles. We propose an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary initially connected tile structure into an icicle in O ( n 3 ) steps, matching the runtime of the line formation algorithm from prior work. Our theoretical contribution is accompanied by an extensive experimental analysis, indicating that our algorithm decreases the diameter of tile structures on average.},

Given a graph G , Hop Domination asks to find the minimum size of a hop dominating set of G , also called the hop domination number . Henning et al. (Graphs Combin. 2017) showed that Hop Domination is NP -hard for bipartite graphs and chordal graphs. Since the class of chordal graphs is contained in the class of perfect graphs, the problem is NP -hard on perfect graphs. We would like to study the complexity of the problem on subclasses of perfect graphs and understand where the complexity of the problem shifts from tractable to intractable. The following are the results of this paper. We present polynomial algorithms for Hop Domination on permutation graphs, interval graphs and biconvex bipartite graphs. This generalizes the polynomial time algorithm for Hop Domination on bipartite permutation graphs. We also initiate a study on this problem from the parameterized complexity perspective. We show that the decision version of Hop Domination is W [ 2 ] -hard when parameterized by solution size.},

The finitary multiset extension of a wqo-set induces an ordering on finite multisets over elements of that set, where one multiset precedes another if there exists an injective mapping between their elements that preserves the original ordering. In this work, we refine existing length theorems for the finitary multiset extension of Higman’s ordering over finite alphabets, and we establish a matching lower bound. As a corollary, we obtain tighter length bounds for the majoring extension of Higman’s ordering over finite alphabets. We demonstrate the application of our results in the complexity analysis of noncommutative hypersequent logics.},

Existing algorithms for clustering with outliers often have high computational complexities. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sublinear framework for solving the representative center-based clustering with outliers problems: k -median/means clustering with outliers. Our analysis is fundamentally different from the previous (uniform and non-uniform) sampling based ideas. In particular, our sample complexity is independent of the input size and dimensionality, and thus it is suitable for dealing with large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. We also conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both synthetic and real datasets.},

Traditional algorithms typically aim to determine a single winning strategy to develop a controller. However, in CPS control and other domains, permissive controllers are essential, as they enable the system to adapt when additional constraints arise and remain resilient to runtime changes. This work generalizes the concept of (permissive winning) strategy templates , originally introduced by Anand et al. at TACAS and CAV 2023 for deterministic games, to incorporate stochastic games. These templates capture an infinite number of winning strategies, allowing for efficient strategy adaptation to system changes. We focus on two winning criteria (almost-sure and positive winning) and five winning objectives (safety, reachability, Büchi, co-Büchi, and parity). Our contributions include algorithms for constructing templates for each winning criterion and objective and a novel approach for extracting a winning strategy from a given template. Discussions on comparisons between templates and between strategy extraction methods are provided.},
