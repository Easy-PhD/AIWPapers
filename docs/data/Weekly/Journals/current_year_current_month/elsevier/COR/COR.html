  abstract     = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a key mechanism to reduce emissions in the transportation industry, and hence contribute to the green transition. In this paper, we present a mathematical programming model which determines the optimal placement of EV charging stations such that chargers are placed in the most cost-efficient way possible for all stakeholders, assuming additionally that EV charging demand is inherently stochastic in nature. The model is formulated as a two-stage, continuous location–allocation model in the form of a generalised Weber problem in two dimensions. However, this formulation is non-convex and notoriously difficult to solve. We therefore propose a suitable discretisation procedure to find high quality solutions in suitable time. The discretisation procedure shows strong performance across a variety of computational experiments using randomly generated scenarios, maintaining robustness in terms of the objective value and overall solution quality. A part of this solution procedure was entered into the 15th AIMMS-MOPTA Optimisation Modelling Competition.},

  abstract     = {Semiconductor manufacturing presents a highly complex Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) due to the diversity and large number of processing machines, as well as the intricate manufacturing processes including batch and non-batch operations. Existing studies often either overlook batching problems or address them in oversimplified ways, failing to provide effective solutions for large-scale scheduling challenges with batch operations. For this problem, a model for the JSP involving both batching and non-batching processes in semiconductor fabs is first developed. Then, the First Come First Served (FCFS) approach, as an effective rule-based method, is employed to generate high-quality initial solutions. A tailored Constrained Genetic Algorithm (CGA) by embedding constraints to the stages of genetic algorithms is proposed to further optimize the solution. The CGA incorporates batch grouping, constrained encoding, constrained crossover and constrained mutation to effectively handle the sequential constraints of batch and non-batch processes, ensuring the generation of valid solutions. The CGA is validated using the SMT2020 and SMAT2022 datasets across various scales and scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the CGA outperforms FCFS, backward simulation and reinforcement learning. These results highlight the CGA’s effectiveness and robustness in solving complex scheduling problems in semiconductor manufacturing.},

We propose a method that combines the key features of two state-of-the-art approaches for the uncapacitated case, which are adapted to solve the problem at hand. The first approach is a linear reformulation that extends the best-known linearization in the literature, which is based on variable substitution. The second approach is a reformulation that incorporates outer-approximation cuts and enhanced submodular cuts, solving the problem via a branch-and-cut approach. We tested the performance of the three approaches on several instances and show that the combined method outperforms each of the preceding techniques. The optimal location patterns of the model are also analysed, and it is found that considering the overflow and overflow penalties in the objective function affects the location decisions. The resulting optimal locations align more closely with practical scenarios.},

  abstract     = {One of the main production-related costs in manufacturing is inventory cost since manufacturing firms allocate a vast area to raw material, semi-processed, and final products in production lines and warehouses. Reducing the volume of these inventories leads to lower production-related costs. This paper presents a novel mathematical model for zero-inventory production scheduling. In this model, the jobs arrive at fixed times and are scheduled on a set of unrelated machines. The jobs have different operations that need to be processed one by one. Since the system has zero inventory, the jobs must be processed immediately upon arrival. Also, whenever a job’s operation is complete, the following operation must instantly start (no wait time). That operation is outsourced if no machines are available to process any of the job’s operations. The jobs’ operations are dispatched to the machines from a dispatching center, and there is a latency between the dispatching center, the machines, and the outsourcing center. We present a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to formulate this problem. Then, the MINLP model is turned into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model by linearizing its constraints. Since many production scheduling problems are known to be NP-hard, particularly those involving unrelated parallel machines, precedence constraints, and time-dependent decisions like ours, we adopt two metaheuristics to solve the problem for large-scale cases where exact methods are computationally inefficient. The first is a Genetic Algorithm (GA), and the second is a Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithm. The performance of these algorithms is tested against the optimal solutions obtained from CPLEX for a set of small-scale problems. We consider a real case study, an image processing system, to validate the proposed developments (the MILP model and the GA). The results show that the presented model and algorithm can reduce the system’s total cost by about 12.57% compared to the existing online dispatching rules.},

Their performance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees, which are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree ensemble models do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to extract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the user with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive power of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a set partitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The extracted list of rules is unweighted and defines a partition of the training data, assigning each instance to exactly one rule, and thereby simplifying the explanation process. The proposed method works with tabular or time series data, for both classification and regression tasks, and its flexible formulation can include any arbitrary loss or regularization functions. Our computational experiments offer statistically significant evidence that our method performs comparably to several rule extraction methods in terms of predictive performance and fidelity towards the tree ensemble. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed method effectively extracts interpretable rules from tree ensembles that are designed for time series data.},

Considering uncertain demand, we introduced an innovative adoption model with two distinct take-back policies, trade-in and credit, to address challenges in multi-generation production planning. Inspired by real-world practices of companies like Apple and Samsung, our model first examines how trade-in programs drive repeat purchases and enhance market share, with credit-based programs to attract new customers. It then captures changes in demand, production planning, recovery decisions, and internal competition among multiple product generations. Distinct from previous conclusions, this study explores how producers can strategically manage demand for new generations to slow diffusion, thereby increasing refurbishment and recycling volumes over time.

The decisions to be made include the servers to be activated at each time period together with a service schedule and server allocation for every customer that respect the periodicity of customer demand and the capacity of the activated servers, which minimize the total cost of the activated servers. We give a first Integer Linear Programming formulation with one set of decision variables associated with each of the decisions of the problem. Afterwards, we develop a logic-based Benders reformulation where one set of variables is projected out and constraints that guarantee the feasibility of the solutions are introduced. The separation problem for the new set of constraints is studied, and an exact Branch & Logic-Benders-Cut algorithm for the reformulation is proposed together with several variations and enhancements. The particular cases in which all servers are identical and in which all parameters are time-invariant are also studied. Extensive computational experiments assess the superiority of the logic-based Benders reformulation over the first formulation.},

  abstract     = {Heuristic methods provide a computationally efficient framework for addressing two-dimensional irregular packing problems, particularly in resource-constrained industrial settings. As a typical combinatorial optimization problem, irregular packing exhibits exponential growth in computational complexity with increasing workpiece counts, while the solution space dynamically reconfigures due to geometric variability among workpieces. Although heuristic algorithms can generate feasible layouts within acceptable timeframes, their reliance on fixed search rule limits adaptability to diverse scenarios, necessitating more flexible approaches. In this paper, a hyper-heuristic algorithm based on Q-Learning is proposed to solve open dimension packing problems, including one-open and two-open dimension problems. Q-Learning is adopted as the high-level strategy for its ability to optimize low-level heuristic selection through reward-driven experience accumulation. The method incorporates a mixed encoding method for solution representation, four specialized low-level heuristic operators, a linear population decline mechanism, and an elite preservation strategy to balance exploration–exploitation. The Q-Learning controller dynamically selects operators by updating the Q-table based on Bellman’s equation. The proposed algorithm is compared to some advanced algorithms in general datasets. The results show that our method has better performance and applicability.},

This review explores the increasing convergence of ML algorithms with traditional M&S methods- namely Agent-Based Modelling & Simulation, Discrete Event Simulation, and System Dynamics- in healthcare applications. Through a systematic review of 90 relevant studies, this article provides a comprehensive synthesis of the current state-of-the-art Hybrid M&S-ML in healthcare.

Key findings highlight prominent methodological and technical trends, as well as opportunities for combining M&S with ML to address healthcare challenges.

  abstract     = {Driven by the dual engines of supply chain integration and low-carbon transformation in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) manufacturing systems, energy-efficient integrated distributed scheduling has emerged as a pivotal component of industrial intelligence-driven smart manufacturing. This article investigates the energy-efficient integrated distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with preventive maintenance (EE-IDHFSP-PM), which aims to minimize the dual objectives of makespan and total carbon emissions. In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established for the EE-IDHFSP-PM, making the first attempt to solve such NP-hard problem by using a Q -learning-based multi-objective hyper-heuristic algorithm (QLMHHA). First, a modified NEH-based initialization method is introduced to produce high-quality solutions that balance multiple optimization objectives, ensuring both the quality and diversity of initial populations. Second, a novel multi-stage collaborative energy-efficient strategy (MSC_EES) is developed to dynamically adjust the processing speeds of machines on non-critical paths, which reduces energy consumption across stages. Third, a new Q -learning-based high-level strategy (HLS) is devised to dynamically coordinate twelve low-level heuristics (LLHs) according to specific states, improving adaptive search efficiency through superior exploration–exploitation trade-offs. Fourth, a dual-criterion reward mechanism is proposed to evaluate population quality in terms of both convergence and diversity, which can deliver immediate feedback and effectively guide evolutionary processes. Fifth, comprehensive convergence and computational complexity analyses of critical components are conducted to confirm the stability, reliability, and efficiency of QLMHHA. Extensive experiments are carried out on 54 small-scale and 24 large-scale instances, which demonstrate that QLMHHA achieves promising performance in both effectiveness and efficacy against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms for addressing the EE-IDHFSP-PM. These findings validate the efficacy and superiority of QLMHHA in tackling complex scheduling challenges, providing valuable theoretical implications and practical insights for energy-efficient distributed manufacturing systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, how to reduce energy consumption at the manufacturing system level in the low-carbon multi-objective flexible job shop scheduling problem (LCM-FJSP) has received significant attention. In this research, a model with the maximum completion time, total machine workload and total carbon emissions is built. Moreover, a Q-learning-based adaptive weight-adjusted decomposition evolutionary algorithm (QMOEA/D-AWA) is proposed. In the QMOEA/D-AWA, an initialization strategy with four heuristic initial rules for obtaining high-quality population, a variable neighborhood search strategy with four problem-specific local search methods for enhancing exploration and a Q-learning-based parameter adaptive strategy for automatically determining the number of neighborhood solutions are designed. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed QMOEA/D-AWA, it is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on 15 instances. In the statistical analysis, the QMOEA/D-AWA obtains the overwhelming metric results in 10 instances. In the visual analysis, the completion time is reduced by 3.74%, the total workload is reduced by 3.94%, and the carbon emissions are reduced by 5.94%.},

  abstract     = {Global warming has led to declining sea-ice in the Arctic Ocean, making it easier for ice-class vessels to navigate Arctic waters for greater portions of the year. As sailing conditions in these waters improve over coming decades, these passageways are expected to open for larger portions of the year and to become increasingly viable options for unsupported transit and even open-water vessels. This paper proposes a Benders-branch-and-cut methodology for estimating changes in global maritime cargo flow patterns under future climate scenarios with declining Arctic sea ice. The model accounts for changing incident risk along Arctic passageways and corresponding ice-class vessel and icebreaker escort requirements, lower speeds, increased insurance premiums, higher accident probabilities, and constraints on path-based maximum risk exposure. The resulting mixed-integer program involves path-based, continuous decision variables. The solution technique is applied on a model of the global maritime container network including 80 ports, 76 routes, 426 links and 4,303 legs associated with the world’s largest carrier alliance. Embedded acceleration techniques and a label-correcting algorithm that employs specialized fathoming rules for a non-additive, constrained path subproblem enable solution at this global scale. The outcome is an estimate of seasonal future global maritime trade flows along key global routes and through ports predicted under six climate-related scenarios. Results illustrate that the developed model can provide support to companies, nations and regions as they prepare for a changing global landscape and climate.},

This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to tackle the DJSP based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. A novel state representation method that expresses state features as multi-channel images is proposed to simplify the state characterization process. Various heuristic-based priority dispatching rules (PDRs)are used to construct action space. By converting scheduling instances into images and leveraging the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) module for feature extraction, this model can handle scheduling instances of varying scales and map size-independent processing information matrix to fixed action space. Additionally, a dense reward based on a predefined scheduling region is developed to offer detailed guidance to the agent, enabling more precise and comprehensive policy assessment. Static tests are conducted on well-known benchmarks, and the experimental results indicate that our scheduling model surpasses the performance of the three latest DRL approaches on average. Compared with PDR methods, dynamic experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL model excels in adaptability and robustness when new tasks arrive and the processing time fluctuates with uncertainty.},

  abstract     = {Optimal scheduling of maintenance activities requires the solution of combinatorial optimization problems that need to be efficiently modeled and solved with optimization techniques. Maintenance scheduling and operations-associated problems in the aviation industry can efficiently enhance competitiveness. In the maintenance and scheduling problem, aircrafts need to undergo tasks for both line (A check) and base (C check) maintenance at various hangers at MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) based on resource availability (both human and material). The determination of the optimal maintenance plan, in terms of allocating the resources to the aircraft, and resource movement from one aircraft to another based on availability and licensed skills in the presence of multiple tasks and capacity constraints so as to obtain maximum utilization of resources at maintenance site and minimize the turnaround time is a complex combinatorial optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first CP (Constraint Programming) based mathematical solution that jointly integrates zone, task precedence, technician-pool sharing, and multi-shift continuity for large-scale aircraft maintenance scheduling. In this article, we proposed an efficient optimization strategy that overcomes many of the drawbacks of the formulation/strategies available in literature and helps in determining efficient execution of maintenance work packages. The proposed strategy is generic, encompassing multi-aircraft, multi-skill and multi-shift scheduling capabilities and is validated on two real scenario business case studies, one each for line maintenance (A check) tasks and base maintenance (C check) tasks, as well as six large-scale synthetic scenarios with up to 20,000 tasks, demonstrating feasibility and scalable performance. The proposed strategy is demonstrated on MRO scheduling and it shows an improvement of up to 30.68% in the turn-around time by incorporating the proposed optimization strategy.},

  abstract     = {In railway systems, preventive maintenance plans are essential for ensuring the safety of train operations. However, these tasks are often subject to various disturbances (e.g., bad weather), leading to unpredictable deviations between planned and actual maintenance durations, which can further disrupt train schedules. Unlike most studies that assume constant maintenance durations, this paper introduces a data-driven, two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for jointly optimizing train scheduling and maintenance planning. In the first stage, we determine the initial train schedule and maintenance plan. In the second stage, we allow for slight adjustments to train departure and arrival times at each station to accommodate disturbances affecting maintenance tasks. Our objective is to minimize both the expected travel time of trains and the deviation from the planned schedule under worst-case scenarios for maintenance disturbances. To capture the uncertainty of maintenance disturbances, we construct an ambiguity set using historical data and the Wasserstein metric. We show that the proposed two-stage DRO model, formulated over the Wasserstein ambiguity set, can be reformulated into an efficiently solvable equivalent form. Finally, we apply our model to a real-world case study of the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway and compare it with traditional stochastic programming methods, including sample average approximation and robust optimization. The results highlight the efficiency of our approach and provide valuable insights for railway management.},

A novel dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the pricing subproblem for constellation tasks, augmented with dual stabilization techniques to improve convergence. Comprehensive computational experiments on realistic instances derived from nanosatellite operations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Results show that our structured formulation significantly outperforms a naive approach, particularly for large instances, while effectively balancing workload distribution and energy management across the constellation.

This phase also allows the identification of search zones that may contain other nondominated points. The second phase focuses on exploring these search zones to locate the remaining points, which typically accounts for most of the computational cost. Ranking algorithms are frequently employed to explore each zone individually, but this approach leads to redundancies, causing multiple visits to the same solutions. To mitigate these redundancies, we propose several strategies that group adjacent zones, allowing a single run of the ranking algorithm for the entire group.

This algorithm combines a rolling horizon approach, which divides the problem into manageable subproblems solved sequentially, with a local branching technique that enhances solutions by exploring promising neighborhoods. To evaluate the algorithm’s performance, we conduct a comprehensive computational study.

Due to high costs, such fleets are owned mainly by large enterprises or cooperatives, where fair task allocation and profit sharing are critical. Addressing both coordination and fairness, in this paper, we introduce the Agricultural Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Implements (AFVRPI). We propose a distributed model derived from a centralized formulation also presented in this paper. This model is embedded within a Distributed Multi-Agent System Architecture (DIMASA), where autonomous vehicle agents manage routing and implement use under limited fuel autonomy, while implement agents ensure compatibility and sufficient capacity to meet task demands. Our solution applies systematic egalitarian social welfare optimization to iteratively maximize the profit of the worst-off vehicle, balancing fairness with system efficiency. To enhance scalability, we use column generation in the distributed model, achieving solution quality comparable to the centralized model while significantly reducing computing time. Simulation results on new benchmark instances demonstrate that our distributed multi-agent AFVRPI approach is scalable, efficient, and fair.},

  abstract     = {Mega-events such as the Olympics and the World Championships face significant challenges in evacuating large numbers of attendees after the events conclude, which consume substantial transportation resources. Under the global pressure to reduce carbon emissions, energy conservation and emission reduction are increasingly becoming top priorities. This paper focuses on the efficient scheduling of customized buses (CB) after green mega-events, incorporating skip-stop operations and coordinated bus services to minimize energy consumption, fixed and transportation costs, and facilitate the evacuation of attendees, while accounting for practical constraints such as the availability of customized buses, vehicle capacity, time windows, and flow balance. A distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model is developed, using a novel ambiguity set to model uncertain demand via parametric interval-valued fuzzy variables. To ensure computational tractability, the model is reformulated as an integer linear programming model. To address the computational challenges of large-scale instances, an improved variable neighborhood search heuristic is designed by incorporating the reinforcement learning techniques, including the KL-UCB algorithm and a sliding window mechanism. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed heuristic. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed DRO model effectively handles uncertainty, offering robust and adaptable solutions. Compared to existing heuristics, the proposed heuristic improves performance by 6.51% on average, and incorporating reinforcement learning into VNS enhances computational efficiency by 4.88% on average. A real-life case study further validates the model, demonstrating that the skip-stop strategy significantly reduces vehicle travel time and enhances overall operational efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Power Distribution networks are essential infrastructures that should be designed by satisfying two conflicting requests: cost minimization and reliability. While traditional network planning aimed at radial configurations, which are more similar to the typical working configuration of a network but are not fault-tolerant, modern techniques seek for meshed configurations, since these architectures are more fault-tolerant. Due to the complexity of the problem and the large size of nowadays instances, most of the techniques used for planning are based on heuristic approaches. Thus, they are usually unable to guarantee optimality and not even able to provide an assessment of the distance from the optimal solution. In this work, we address the challenge of planning a fault tolerant network through an exact approach, by introducing innovative Mixed-Integer Linear Programming models designed for the planning of meshed distribution networks with loop-feeder or open-loop topology. Differently from other techniques, our approach simplifies the formulation by avoiding the need for fault scenarios, significantly reducing the computational burden of the optimization problem. The outcomes of our approach are the generation of optimal meshed network, which effectively balance cost and reliability of the electric distribution system. Comprehensive studies on realistic test instances show the advantages of the proposed formulations.},

The internal layer represents the network where individuals can share their real opinions with the close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. The significant positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significant negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time are found. The proposed algorithms are verified by a series of experiments from two aspects: the accuracy and the efficiency. The algorithms are novel and can be considered as a contribution to the network theory independently of opinion dynamics as they can be used to calculate node centrality in any weighted graph.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) automatic ordering and producing decisions on fairness-concerned supply chains under the newsvendor model. We develop a dyadic supply chain model in which the manufacturer acts as the Stackelberg leader while the retailer serves as the follower in a push supply chain. In contrast, their roles are switched in a pull supply chain. We assume that only human decision-making leads to decision regret behavior, whereas AI-automated decision-making does not. Without adopting AI, our results show that fairness concern does not necessarily lead to a decreasing quantity in ordering or producing, which is different from most previous studies. Different from the prior findings, our work reveals that in binding equilibrium, if fairness concerns are considered, the order quantity will decrease, while in non-binding equilibrium, the order quantity may not necessarily be less than the previous results. Interestingly, when decision regret bias is considered for fairness-concerned decision-makers, we can obtain quantity coordination solutions for supply chains under specific conditions. With adopting AI, our results show that increasing fairness concerns are beneficial for improving the follower’s profit while at the expense of sacrificing the leader’s profit margins, while the leader can only benefit from AI adoption when the decision regret bias of the follower is relatively high. It is noteworthy that under certain conditions, AI automation may negatively impact the profits of both push and pull decentralized supply chains. For instance, in low-margin profit scenarios where decision-makers exhibit moderate regret bias and fairness concerns, such effects can emerge. This indicates that under specific circumstances, the human behavioral factors — regret bias and fairness concerns — may sometimes enhance the performance of decentralized supply chain members. Our research findings provide significant practical implications for the adoption of AI-automated decision-making in real-world supply chains.},

  abstract     = {Supply chain management in a global scale involves addressing numerous uncertainties, from demand fluctuations to unforeseen disruptions. Developing advanced solution approaches is critical to manage such complexities and ensure resilience. This study presents a multi-stage stochastic–dynamic model for the global supply chain, incorporating hedging policies. The aim is to identify optimal order scheduling for bill of materials, production planning, and inventory management across warehouses (i.e., materials and finished products). Due to the dynamic nature of the global supply chain (e.g., demand fluctuations, disruptions, and lead time), a multi-stage stochastic model is developed for the stochastic–dynamic supply chain network. To address dynamic factors of real-world global supply chain, an accelerated parallel stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) approach is proposed to deal with disruptions (e.g., political unrest, natural disasters, and pandemics), enhancing supply chain resiliency. To validate the proposed parallel SDDiP , various scenarios with different sizes are generated using the case study and compared to the SDDiP with Benders cuts and integrated stage-wise Lagrangian dual cut ( SWLDC ) (i.e., SDDiP-SWLDC ). According to the obtained results, the proposed parallel node strategy for accelerated SDDiP consistently outperforms the basic stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) and demonstrated robust CPU scalability. Evaluation across various scenario sizes shows stochastic dual dynamic integer programming-mixed integer rounding cuts ( SDDiP-MIR ) achieving faster computation and a smaller 7% optimality gap compared to SDDiP-SWLDC and SDDiP in large-size instances, highlighting its superior performance in complex supply chain settings.},
