  abstract     = {This study investigates the influence of heat treatment at different temperatures (600, 800, and 1200 °C) on the microstructure, dislocation stability, and element segregation of 316L stainless steel fabricated by direct energy deposition. To understand how these changes affect hydrogen embrittlement resistance and the mechanical properties of the samples, tensile testing and digital image correlation (DIC) were employed to examine the strain/instability evolution under combined conditions after heat treatment and hydrogen charging. Results show that dislocation densities decreased after heat treatment, which in turn increased the hydrogen embrittlement resistance of samples with emergence of recrystallization and twin grains. DIC revealed that heat-treated samples exhibited more strain hotspots, which initiated and developed more extensively compared to as-received (AR) samples. In comparison, AR samples showed fewer sites of strain accumulation, leading to wider crack propagation and earlier failure. Hydrogen-charged specimens exhibited narrower strain ranges and more localized strain distributions, indicating a shift toward brittle fracture behavior. In contrast, hydrogen-free samples exhibited higher mean magnitude values and spatial variation across the range of spatial frequencies, as confirmed by two-dimensional Fourier Transform analysis. The methods and analyses in this paper provide a new perspective on evaluating hydrogen embrittlement via demystifying strain/instability evolution.},

  abstract     = {This study systematically investigates how cooling rate mediates the evolution of lamellar α colony microtextured regions (MTRs) in a near-α titanium alloy during β processing. The initial MTRs formed after β processing can be inherited into subsequent processing steps, critically influencing dwell-fatigue life. To address this, two β processing routes—β deformation only (β-Def) versus β deformation plus β annealing (β-Def + HT)—were compared, with samples cooled from the β phase at rates between 2 and 0.125 °C/s. In the β-Def route, slower cooling (0.125 vs 2 °C/s) nearly doubled the mean α colony MTR size and significantly coarsened prior β grains. Conversely, the β-Def + HT route showed only a modest increase in MTR size under slow cooling. The β-Def route introduced an intragranular transformation texture (<11–20 > α), while complete β recrystallization in the β-Def + HT route randomized the MTR orientations. Double-colony MTRs (paired colonies spanning special β grain boundaries) formed only in β-Def at the slowest cooling rate, but occurred across all cooling rates in β-Def + HT, indicating that prior β crystallography governs double-colony formation. An optimized processing strategy using β deformation with an intermediate cooling rate (∼0.25 °C/s) produced relatively small (∼150 μm), randomly oriented α colonies without double-colony MTRs.},

JNPs were synthesized and characterized using TEM and SEM, confirming their size (85.3 ± 4.1 nm). Cytotoxicity on CT26 cells was evaluated via MTT assay. Cellular uptake, in vivo biodistribution, and potential hepatic damage were evaluated through ICP-OES and liver enzyme measurements. MRI was utilized to study tumor targeting, while temperature changes laser exposure, and alternating magnetic field (AMF) conditions were monitored using an IR camera. Western blotting assessed Hsp70, and VEGF protein expression. In addition, histological examination, tumor volume, and survival time in CT26 colon tumor-bearing mice were monitored to assess the antitumor efficacy of the JNPs. The JNPs demonstrated good hemocompatibility and effective magnetic tumor targeting in MRI studies. In vivo experiments showed significant tumor volume reduction and increased Hsp70 and VEGF expression in mice treated with the combination of JNPs, radiotherapy, and concurrent AMF and NIR hyperthermia (p < 0.0001). The JNPs are promising as multifunctional platforms for cancer therapy, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility, magnetic targeting, and enhanced hyperthermia and radiotherapy, which may improve treatment outcomes in targeted multimodal cancer therapies.},

Three common patterns—meander, stripe, and chessboard—were evaluated to capture the associated thermal profiles and melt pool (MP) dynamics. While conduction dominated across all strategies, the stripe and chessboard patterns showed greater susceptibility to keyhole and transition melting modes. Thermal simulations revealed variations in remelting depth: the stripe pattern exhibited the deepest remelting (∼150 μm), while the meander pattern showed the shallowest (∼50 μm), influencing grain refinement and morphology. Crystallographic orientation analysis indicated that interactions between keyhole, transition, and conductive MPs altered preferred growth directions. The meander strategy promoted [101] and [111] orientations, whereas the stripe and chessboard strategies showed stronger alignment toward [111]. By correlating thermal parameters—temperature gradient (G) and solidification rate (R)—with local crystallographic orientation and grain structure, a solidification orientation map was developed. This map demonstrates how scan strategy–driven MP interactions control microstructural features, providing a predictive tool for grain morphology and texture design in LPBF-316LSS components.},

  abstract     = {Lightweight refractory complex concentrated alloys (LRCCAs) exhibit remarkable advantages of high strength and low density. However, their inherent brittleness remains a key factor limiting their applications. This study found that hot rolling and annealing treatments can synergistically optimize the strength and ductility of the Ti 66.8 V 11.2 Al 9.6 Zr 6.2 Nb 6.2 LRCCA. After hot rolling and annealing, the LRCCA developed a heterogeneous grain structure consisting of “fibrous grains + equiaxed grains.” This heterogeneous structure promotes significant deformation inhomogeneity. Through these multi-scale coupling mechanisms, the alloy achieves a simultaneous improvement in both strength and ductility. Notably, the HRA580 alloy, annealed at a low temperature of 580 °C, precipitated nano-sized HCP phases. This resulted in a multi-scale heterogeneous structure of “fibrous grains + equiaxed grains + HCP precipitates”, while maintaining a high dislocation density. As a result, the alloy achieved an outstanding combination of ∼1400 MPa yield strength and ∼13 % fracture strain, along with a specific yield strength as high as 286 MPa·cm 3 /g. The coordinated deformation within the heterogeneous structure endows the alloy with exceptional mechanical properties. The findings of this study provide an important theoretical basis for advancing the application of LRCCAs in advanced manufacturing.},

A MATLAB-based parametric modeling framework was established to generate SGGPSs with continuous porosity transitions using six gradient functions: linear (Lin), exponential (Exp), logarithmic (Ln), quadratic-concave (QuaC), quadratic-convex (QuaV) and uniform (Uni). Results demonstrated that mass and porosity deviations between the fabricated and designed SGGPSs ranged 13.5 %–25.1 % and 13.5 %–15.7 %, respectively, due to powder adhesion and surface irregularities. Among all variants, the QuaC variant exhibited the highest yield strength of 205.2 MPa, which was 1.55 times greater than the Ln variant, owing to its central layered reinforcement design rather than overall mass. The structural stability of LPBF-fabricated SGGPSs was enhanced through layer-by-layer collapse and slip deformation, facilitating smooth stress transfer and mitigating localized failure. Stress concentrations within high-porosity regions led to the formation of rigid support layers, thereby prolonging the stress plateau phase. The LPBF-fabricated SGGPSs achieved superior energy absorption capacities ranging 12.75–24.60 kJ/g, attributed to sustained plateau stress and delayed densification. These findings offer valuable insights for design and application of graded TPMS structures for lightweight engineering components.},

This review synthesizes contemporary literature on natural polysaccharides from diverse sources, focusing on studies published over the past five years that explore hydrogel design, preparation strategies, and biomedical applications. Among polysaccharide-based hydrogels, chitosan and alginate dominate current applications, but cellulose derivatives show emerging promise. We assess the advantages and limitations of current preparation strategies and outline potential directions for improvement. Furthermore, this review provides a systematic survey of the applications of natural polysaccharide hydrogels in tissue engineering, alongside a rigorous analysis of the challenges to clinical translation.

However, they often compromise low-temperature performance, increasing fatigue cracking risk and reducing pavement durability. To address this, a coupled organic additive (COAPN), composed of polyethylene wax (PEL) and naphthenic oil (NO), was developed to improve asphalt workability by reducing viscosity while maintaining rheological performance at both high and low temperatures. Asphalt binders (COAWMA) with varying COAPN contents were evaluated through a series of tests. The results showed enhanced penetration and ductility, with FTIR confirming physical modification and good thermal stability. The synergistic effect of PEL lubrication and NO weakening of intermolecular forces significantly reduced viscosity with increasing COAPN content, and the cumulative viscosity reduction effect reached its optimum at 2 % content. DSR results indicated non-monotonic trends in the G ∗ , δ , G ∗ /sin δ , and G ∗ sin δ of COAWMA due to alternating dominant effects of NO and PEL. At 2 % COAPN, rutting resistance remained comparable to matrix asphalt while fatigue factor reduction expanded from 4.6 % at 1 Hz to 6.3 % at 10 Hz, demonstrating enhanced fatigue resistance. BBR results revealed progressive improvement of low-temperature crack resistance with increasing COAPN content.},

This study proposes a novel method to fabricate high-aspect-ratio cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) nanowires using a mixture of waste Si and graphite powders through laser processing. The mixture is placed between two plates to sandwich the laser-induced plume. This confinement promotes nanowire growth, increases the aspect ratio, shortens the lithium-ion diffusion length, and enables the fabrication of flexible electrodes. High-speed camera observations confirmed that the sandwiched plume was compressed and remained in air for nearly 10 s. Consequently, nanowires approximately 100–1200 nm in length and 15–60 nm in diameter (aspect ratio greater than 25) were generated. Electron diffraction and XRD analyses revealed that the nanostructures mainly comprised 3C-SiC. Battery performance evaluation tests of the generated nanowires showed that after 10 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 50  mA/g, the SiC nanowires exhibited a specific capacity of 455 mAh/g, significantly higher than that of Si nanoparticles (291 mAh/g) and comparable to that of C-coated SiC nanoparticles (477 mAh/g). The SiC nanowires outperformed both Si nanoparticles and graphite anodes, demonstrating the potential of the proposed method in next-generation lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode fabrication.},

The innovative aspect of this study lies in the direct comparison of electromagnetic wave attenuation in two fundamental and most widely used textile structures—woven and knitted fabrics. Although both structures are commonly applied in technical textiles, the influence of conductive yarn arrangement within the structure on their shielding effectiveness, under otherwise constant parameters, has not been thoroughly investigated until now. The experimental investigation was complemented by theoretical analysis, including analytical calculations, and verified through numerical simulations. The results reveal that weft-knitted fabrics, consisting of a single continuous conductive yarn, form parallel-oriented conductive pathways and therefore exhibit lower shielding effectiveness. In contrast, woven fabrics, with two orthogonal systems of conductive yarns forming a grid, demonstrate superior performance by attenuating electromagnetic waves more effectively in multiple directions. Importantly, the findings confirm that woven structures provide a higher level of electromagnetic shielding at the same volume fraction of conductive component compared to knitted fabrics.},

Traditional qualitative empirical analysis has limitations in addressing this complexity. This study introduced an Random Forest prediction model that integrates microstructure analysis, tribological experiments, and machine learning. It quantitatively analyzed the relationship between microstructure and performance in Cr-V alloy steel using feature importance weights generated by the model. The analysis revealed that external loads had the most significant impact on the friction coefficient, with the highest weight (0.246). This effect was attributed to changes in surface contact and plastic deformation mechanisms. VC (weight: 0.204) and Cr 23 C 6 (weight: 0.148) followed, showing a stronger influence compared to other carbides. The wear rate was primarily governed—by approximately 80 %—by the internal microstructure, with Cr 7 C 3 (weight: 0.431) and VC (weight: 0.381) being critical factors. Cr 7 C 3 , as the main wear-resistant phase, directly improved spalling resistance, while VC at lower content helped suppress crack initiation by refining the microstructure and enhancing the interface. The new paradigm based on feature weight-assisted analysis had demonstrated the practical value of machine learning in optimizing tribological performance.},

Herein, DLP 3D printing is used to lay SiC whiskers (SiC w ) in a 2D polymer flat by designing a printing thickness smaller than the length of the whiskers. The resulting SiC w composites show randomly distributed SiC whiskers in the in-plane direction, and aligned SiC whiskers in the out-of-plane direction. We studied the positive effects of 2D-aligned SiC w composites on the mechanical and surface breakdown performances. Strong anisotropy in the mechanical strength was observed with the tensile strength of 82 MPa in the in-plane direction versus that of 48 MPa in the out-of-plane-90° direction at the SiC loading of 6 wt%. More importantly, the out-of-plane oriented SiC w composites exhibit a higher surface flashover voltage than that of the in-plane oriented ones, in which the flashover voltage of the 4 wt% SiC w composites in out-of-plane-90° direction is 38 % higher than that of pure resin. Applying the DLP 3D printing technique to orient 1D fillers in polymer is of great significance for enhancing the reliability of electrical equipment.},

  abstract     = {Laser beam powder bed fusion (PBF-LB) can manipulate material properties through control of texture. However, current research suggests homogeneous texture distribution in PBF-LB materials. The lack of investigation into texture heterogeneity may mischaracterize the properties of printed specimens. This study addresses this gap by exploring heterogeneous textures in PBF-LB SS316L. Through experimental analysis of cubic samples (10 × 10 × 10 mm) and those with varying heights (10–35 mm), we systematically characterized the texture of PBF-LB 316L samples. Then we uncovered the fundamental mechanisms that drive heterogeneous texture formation, revealing that significant texture transitions exist in different directions. Along the scanning direction, heterogeneous textures formed in the outer 25 % of the sample, while the core remained uniform. Additionally, a finite element analysis was used to discuss how to eliminate such heterogeneous textures. In the transverse direction, uneven heat dissipation at the edges led to a dominant <100>//BD texture in the outer 6 %, with the center retaining a <101>//BD orientation. Along the building direction, while no significant texture shift was observed in the 35 mm sample, increased inter-track remelting ratios with height caused localized <100>//BD stray grains to appear in the upper regions. This work offers new insights for controlling texture and tailoring properties in PBF-LB.},

This study fabricated such plates via a two-pass hot rolling process and systematically compared the effects of Quenching − Tempering (QT) and Quenching- Intercritical Quenching − Tempering (QLT) heat treatments on their mechanical properties and microstructure. The QLT-treated specimens exhibited optimal performance: shear strength reached 465.98 MPa (surpassing QT’s 413.99 MPa), ultimate tensile strength increased to 654.9 MPa (7.8 % improvement over QT), while elongation and fracture strain doubled compared to the as-rolled state, reaching 53.41 % and 49.53 % respectively. Microstructural analysis revealed that QLT significantly enhanced homogeneous recrystallization, increased intragranular misorientation, and reduced internal stress, achieving an exceptional strength-ductility balance correlated with elongation. Crucially, QLT generated unique slender, willow-leaf-shaped reversed austenite in the 9Ni steel layer and promoted denser Cr 23 C 6 precipitation at S30408 SS grain boundaries. These microstructural modifications demonstrate that QLT successfully coordinated matrix refinement and interface optimization, enabling synergistic enhancement of strength and plasticity in the composite plates.},

  abstract     = {Instable metal flow easily occurs during the forming of thin-walled hollow components due to inappropriate control of forming load in conventional forming processes, thereby leading to forming failure. Accordingly, a Pseudo-Bulk Forming (PBF) method was proposed in this work, aiming at achieving the self-consistency of internal pressure and tubular blank’s deformation in a simple and stable way. In this process, Low-Melting-Point Alloy (LMPA) was solidified inside of tubular blank to constitute a composite rod and deformed simultaneously under compression. Then forming of thin-walled hollow component was converted to pseudo-bulk plastic deformation of a composite rod. PBF of a rectangular tube was taken as an example to study the loading conditions, stress state, and deformation behavior of tubular blank during this process experimentally and numerically. The results showed that PBF exhibited the advantages in preventing excessive thinning of shell thickness in hydroforming and inward buckling during roll-forming. The strong stability of LMPA’s plastic flow stress, which was caused by its low strain hardening behavior, could induce self-adaptive inner pressure on tubular blank, thereby resulting in the balanced metal flow in sidewall and corner regions. Besides, due to tangential friction generated by LMPA at LMPA/tubular blank interface and along metal flow direction, circumferential metal flow towards the corner region could be enhanced, and thereby leading to the conversion of stress states from tension-tension to tension–compression. The risk of fracture was then reduced and forming stability was improved in the case of forming structures with sharp corners.},

This study innovatively constructs a three-dimensional (3D) oxygen-releasing scaffold Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)-Calcium Peroxide (CPO)/Gelatin Methacryloyl (PLGA-CPO/GelMA) featuring a core–shell structure achieved via emulsification-photocrosslinking technology. PLGA-CPO microspheres provide sustained oxygen release for over 14 days, while the GelMA hydrogel establishes a biomimetic microenvironment. In vitro experiments confirmed that under hypoxic conditions, the hydrogel composite scaffold maintained the proliferative activity of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells during 3D co-culture. Furthermore, when co-cultured with neurons in a 2D system simulating the in vivo SCI environment, the scaffold significantly promoted neuronal survival and proliferation. In a T9 complete transection SCI rat model, the scaffold transplantation group exhibited significantly improved Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan locomotor scores compared to control groups. Histological analysis revealed increased axonal regeneration, reduced glial scarring, and high survival rates of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells at the implantation site in the scaffold-treated group. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the composite scaffold exerted a triple synergistic effect, encompassing promotion of angiogenesis and neural regeneration, alongside suppression of apoptotic responses. The developed Organic/Inorganic Composite scaffold sustainably ameliorates the injury microenvironment and synergistically enhances stem cell-mediated repair efficacy, providing a promising tissue engineering solution with significant potential for clinical translation in spinal cord injury.},

In this study, a hybrid process combining template replication and reaction sintering was developed, enabling the fabrication of SiC wire-mesh structured packings. A synergistic approach combining finite element analysis (FEM) and experimental validation was applied to optimize the traditional wire-mesh structural parameters. Mechanical performance was further enhanced by strategically inserting planar SiC sheets between adjacent corrugated layers, resulting in a remarkable 12-fold increase in compressive strength (from 1.8 MPa to 21.4 MPa). The fabricated wire-mesh SiC also exhibited superior anti-acid corrosion ability compared with the metallic counterparts.

Here, we developed an injectable dynamic hydrogel co-loaded with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) and verteporfin (VP) for enhanced scarless wound healing. The hydrogel matrix was prepared through dopamine-grafted oxidation of hyaluronic acid and carbohydrazide-modified gelatin via Schiff base reaction and catechol-mediated chemical bondings, exhibiting good injectability and self-healing properties. Moreover, the dynamic reversible cross-linked network of hydrogels mimics extracellular matrix conditions to provide an adaptable microenvironment for ADMSCs. Additionally, the encapsulated ADMSCs exert angiogenesis and wound closure effects by releasing various cytokines during the early stage of wound healing, while secreting antifibrotic factors to reduce scar formation in later stages. Notably, the sustained release of VP from the hydrogel matrix effectively inhibits scar formation through Yes-associated protein signaling pathway modulation. In vivo evaluation using both rat full-thickness skin defect and rabbit ear hypertrophic scar models demonstrated the hydrogel’s high efficacy in promoting scarless tissue regeneration. The presented multifunctional hydrogel platform, which integrates stem cells and chemical drugs, offers a promising therapeutic strategy for scarless wound repair.},

  abstract     = {In laser-based powder bed fusion of plastics, peak temperature and cooling behavior critically affect density and dimensional accuracy, as particle fusion is temperature- and time-dependent. However, temperature–time profiles vary with part geometry, scan vector length, hatch distance, and scan speed. Therefore, this study investigates how bidirectional scanning shapes thermal behavior and part properties across different part dimensions. Infrared thermography process monitoring of single tracks, single layers, and cuboid samples reveals how the thermal signal and melt depth change with energy input and scan parameters. Results show that while density stabilizes within 0.30–0.45  J/mm 3 for Polyamide 12, dimensional accuracy remains sensitive to geometry-dependent temperature–time profiles influenced by scan parameters, overlap ratios, laser return times, and hardware limitations like laser delays and scanner dynamics. Smaller hatch distances and shorter scan vectors increase local heating, but hardware constraints reduce local energy input, causing significant dimensional asymmetry along and parallel to the scan direction. We introduce narrow geometry-dependent thermal process windows based on characteristic thermal signal features to achieve density >0.998  g/cm 3 and height accuracy within ± 30  μm. The findings support adaptive scan strategies that adjust exposure conditions to part geometry and thermal history instead of using fixed parameter sets across different part sizes.},

This tunability originates from the CO 2 -responsive protonation–deprotonation equilibrium of dimethylethylamine (DMEA), which modulates the ionic strength of the medium and consequently shifts the electrostatic potential at the interface between gel and water. By quantitatively correlating gel surface charge density with DMEA concentration and employing a controllable centrifugal force method to measure electrostatic forces between gels, this study systematically elucidated how CO 2 -mediated ionic perturbations govern the hierarchical organization, packing density, and mechanical stability of the assembled network.

Notably, the elongation of annealed alloy (∼17.5 %) is about 84.2 % higher than as-deposited alloy, while maintaining high ultimate tensile strength (∼1174 MPa). To comprehensively examine the impact of microstructure on cryogenic deformation, in-situ cryogenic TEM strain testing and other analytical techniques were employed, which offer new insights into the multiscale deformation mechanisms at cryogenic temperature. Larger α phase facilitates twin nucleation and effectively accommodates the strain gradient resulting from inhomogeneous deformation. Multiple twins promote non-basal dislocation slip and introduce additional heterogeneous interfaces, enhancing both twinning-induced plasticity and dynamic Hall-Petch effect. As flow stress increases, <c + a> dislocations near twins dissociate into and  dislocations, contributing to dislocation strengthening. The notable enlargement of grain size in annealed alloys facilitates more active dislocation behavior driven by extensive twinning, promoting sustained strain hardening.

The highest density and elastic modulus were found in the specimen cold sintered at 150 °C. Additionally, the hardness of the cold sintered samples was higher than that of the conventional reference due to finer grain size and reduced porosity. Fracture toughness measurements by the Vickers indentation test indicated a value of 1.26 MPa·m 0.5 for cold sintered specimens, compared to 0.93 MPa·m 0.5 for the conventionally sintered specimen.

A soft robotic wrist functions as a passive compensator, mounted at the end of a robotic arm to mitigate such errors during automated assembly. To develop an innovative wrist with an extended compensation range and reduced contact forces, this study introduces a topology optimization method that determines the optimal material layout under specified boundary conditions. The method incorporates both geometric and material nonlinearities and is designed to synthesize compliant wrists that compensate for positioning and angular errors through the elastic deformation of flexure hinges, guided by translational and rotational constraints. A novel planar soft robotic wrist is presented, featuring flexure hinges fabricated through 3D printing using a thermoplastic elastomer. Experiments—including allowable translational and angular deviations, as well as the resultant force during peg-in-hole insertion—validate the proposed design. Overall, this work introduces a new optimization framework for soft robotic wrists, enabling simultaneous translational and angular error compensation in low-accuracy systems while providing a cost-effective, adaptable, and resilient automation solution.},

  abstract     = {The management of infectious wounds is still a critical clinical challenge. This study introduces a multifunctional hydrogel composed of oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) and carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS), enhanced with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and copper-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin-manganese (Cu-TCPP-Mn) nanozymes for advanced wound-healing applications. The hydrogel was synthesized via a Schiff base reaction, crosslinking the aldehyde groups of OHA with the carboxymethyl groups of CMCS to create a dynamic network with tunable rheological properties and excellent biocompatibility. Incorporation of PRP enriched the hydrogel with growth factors, markedly promoting tissue regeneration, whereas Cu-TCPP-Mn nanozymes effectively scavenged reactive oxygen species by mimicking superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Furthermore, the hydrogel modulated macrophage polarization, and the synergistic effects of PRP and Cu-TCPP-Mn helped to alleviate persistent inflammation in infected wounds. A series of experiments showed that the CHPM hydrogel enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, modulated inflammatory responses, and accelerated wound healing. The hydrogel also exhibited superior swelling capacity, self-healing behavior, and shape-memory functionality. These results underscore the potential of this hydrogel to be an innovative bioactive dressing for infectious wound healing with substantial promise for clinical antibacterial applications.},

  abstract     = {Abdominal wall tissues, including the linea alba (LA) and anterior rectus sheath (ARS), exhibit pronounced structural and mechanical heterogeneity that critically influences function and surgical outcomes. Current hernia repair meshes often fail to replicate this complexity, highlighting the need for a mechanistic understanding linking microarchitecture to tissue mechanics. This study combines uniaxial tensile testing with two-photon confocal microscopy to quantify collagen fiber orientation and elastin distribution in ARS and LA samples from eight human donors. Mechanical testing in longitudinal and transverse directions revealed pronounced anisotropy in ARS, with collagen alignment strongly predicting tissue stiffness (R 2 = 0.79–0.88) and explaining inter- and intra-individual mechanical variability. LA displayed a layered collagen network with higher elastin content, consistent with its role in strain accommodation. By directly correlating microstructural organization with mechanical performance, this work uncovers key design principles for bioinspired implants: anisotropic collagen fiber orientation and elastin distribution must be considered to replicate native tissue mechanics. Specifically, the findings demonstrate that replicating the anisotropic collagen–elastin architecture is essential for achieving biomechanical compatibility in surgical meshes. This study provides a novel framework for engineering heterogeneous materials that faithfully reproduce native tissue mechanics, bridging fundamental biomechanics and translational biomaterials design.},

For this purpose, full-annealed, normalized, martensitic, and spheroidized samples were produced and then intercritical-annealed at 830 °C for 15 min, followed by water quenching to produce ferrite-martensite DP microstructures. The full-annealed sample with the highest average ferrite grain size (D f ) of 8.66 µm before IA, yielded a banded ferrite-martensite structure (successive hard and soft domains) with superior performance after IA. A chain-like morphology developed in the initial and normalized specimens, while the martensitic sample exhibited a lath morphology after IA. Also, grain boundary martensite was formed in the spheroidized microstructure after IA. The hardness values for the DP initial, full-annealed, and normalized steel sheets with 0.34–0.37 martensite volume fraction (V m ) were almost 226 HV, while the lowest hardness for DP samples was observed in the DP spheroidized sample with almost 143 HV, and only 0.14 V m ; also, the DP martensitic sample showed a moderate hardness of ∼197 HV and 0.27 V m . All DP samples exhibited superior properties, accompanied by the disappearance of the yield point phenomenon after IA. The highest yield and tensile strength values were achieved for the DP full-annealed sample (413.4 MPa and 661.5 MPa, respectively); whereas the lowest values were observed in the DP spheroidized sample with 308.3 MPa and 499 MPa, respectively. The full-annealed sample after IA revealed the best combination of ductility and strength. The occurrence of recovery of the strain hardening rate (RSHR) mechanism led to higher strength and ductility in the full-annealed sample after IA compared to other DP samples. All DP samples exhibited a perfect ductile fracture. The dominant void initiation in the DP samples was ferrite/martensite decohesion.},

This research focuses on optimizing the protective environment of the welding zone by varying the precharge duration of the protective gas. A systematic investigation was conducted to assess the impact of these adjustments on the quality of weld formation. By employing a combination of multi-scale characterization techniques, including macro-morphological analysis of the weld, plasma spectroscopy assessments, and microstructural evaluations, the fundamental physical phenomena occurring during the welding process and the patterns of weld quality evolution were elucidated. Additionally, a real-time monitoring approach utilizing plasma spectroscopy diagnostics was developed. This method allows for the reverse inference of the welding process state through the interpretation of plasma spectral characteristics, thereby establishing connections with the oxidation behavior of titanium alloys and facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to disturbances in the molten pool fluid dynamics. Furthermore, a numerical model grounded in thermodynamic principles was created to simulate the dynamic evolution of the molten pool, offering a quantitative explanation of the mechanisms by which the state of the protective gas influences the fluid behavior and thermal stability of the molten pool.},

Two types of precipitate, δ ′ Al 3 L i and T 1 ( Al 2 C u L i ) , were identified, exhibiting different distributions, attributed to variations in Cu content and thermo-mechanical processing. Mechanical tests showed slight anisotropic mechanical properties of the consolidated samples. By estimating the precipitate strengthening effect using physical models, the strengthening of δ ′ was found to be more prominent than that of T 1 , which might be more prone to strain localization. Overall, the results demonstrate the feasibility of FC in processing Al-Cu-Li alloys and serve as basis for further improvements in the final product through the addition of minor alloying elements, demonstrating an energy-efficient manufacturing process for such alloys.},

To design and achieve superior processed surfaces, a combined method of theoretical calculations and experimental analysis was utilized to investigate the influence mechanism of machining on the performance and quality of the machined shallow layer in high-strength alloy steel (HSAS) in this study, aiming to reveal the intrinsic correlation between microstructure evolution, surface quality, and mechanical performance. The results demonstrate that machining can generate a gradient microstructure in the processed surface, which significantly enhances the surface’s performance. Quantitative analysis revealed a 33.35 % reduction in grain size, a 114.98 % surge in crystallographic defects and a 57.26 % decrease in lath dimensions, indicating severe grain refinement. The machining process induces considerable disturbances and randomization in crystal orientation, leading to uniform crystal orientation across the surface layer of the workpiece. Performance testing demonstrates that machining substantially improves the nano-hardness of the surface layer in HSAS, while also resulting in a modest enhancement of toughness. These improvements are attributed to the combined effects of fine-grain strengthening, grain-boundary strengthening, and dislocation strengthening, all of which are induced by the processing process described above.},

The prediction accuracy R 2 of the best model reached 0.96, and a mathematical expression linking the modulus to these four key alloy factors was established using symbolic regression algorithms, achieving a direct correlation between input and target performance. Experimental verification revealed that, in addition to B and Si enhancing the modulus of titanium alloys, the element Ga can also significantly improve the modulus of titanium alloys. Alloys with elastic modulus exceeding 135 GPa were successfully prepared, achieving an increase of over 25 % in elastic modulus compared to TC4 alloy.

Understanding these phase transformation sequences and their synergistic interactions is essential for controlling precipitate architectures and achieving multi-property optimization. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of tailoring precipitate characteristics to enhance specific properties; however, a systematic framework for coordinating precipitate types, distributions, and evolution pathways toward synergistic performance enhancement remains lacking. This review systematically elucidates the formation mechanisms, phase transformation behaviors, and co-evolution dynamics of key precipitates during long-term aging, emphasizing their influence on dislocation interactions and oxidation resistance.

Central to our design is a mechanically oscillating valve, termed a metacap, constructed from a spherical shell with metamaterial architecture. By strategically tuning geometric parameters and material stiffness, the metacap transforms a constant input pressure into self-regulating, periodic inflation-deflation cycles. This enables pneumatic actuators to drive rhythmic finger flexion and extension across a wide bending range, accommodating diverse rehabilitation requirements related to spasticity and muscular weakness. Operational space experiments demonstrate the robot’s adaptability, enabling finger movements with a range of motion comparable to that of a human hand. Clinical evaluations reveal alleviated hand and upper-limb spasticity, along with improved upper-limb motor function. Our PI-based design provides a scalable, low-complexity framework for next-generation rehabilitation devices, particularly suited to resource-constrained clinical settings and home-based therapy.},

  abstract     = {Surgical treatment of rectal cancer is difficult due to anatomical complexity. To improve tumor resection, fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has been developed using near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF, approximately 800 nm) and a dedicated camera system. Indocyanine green (ICG), an FDA-approved NIRF probe, enables optical imaging. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor family, is widely expressed in rectal cancer cells. This abundant expression makes GRPR an ideal biomarker for molecular targeting and imaging of rectal cancer. In this study, the location and expression levels of GRPR were measured by immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and western blot. Our data confirmed significant overexpression of GRPR in rectal cancer cells and tissue samples, providing a significant indication for GRPR targeting evaluation. We designed the novel GRPR-targeting peptide, GRP-derived peptide (GRP-DP) derived from the natural GRPR-binding gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). The newly developed GRP-DP demonstrated strong in vitro GRPR-targeting capabilities for rectal cancer imaging, potentially aiding surgeons in achieving complete tumor resection. Additionally, we investigated the use of ICG encapsulated within poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol (ICG/PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs) as a vehicle for fluorescent tumor imaging in rectal cancer. The ICG-NPs were functionalized with GRP-DP, exhibiting favorable physicochemical properties, including controlled ICG release kinetics and biocompatibility.},

  abstract     = {Bone defects have long posed a challenge in trauma orthopedics. Despite advancements in bone tissue engineering, there remains a bottleneck in developing bone implants that are less toxic, more effective, and reduce the need for secondary surgeries. To address this, we devised a light-responsive bone-targeted smart nano-delivery system. This system integrates polydopamine (PDA)-coated TAX-loaded ZIF-8 nanoparticles into a hydrogel with strong bioadhesion and biocompatibility (TAX@ZIF-8@PDA/ODEX-HD, TZPG). When exposed to near-infrared light, TZPG + NIR demonstrated a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 51.79 %. It exhibited a 99 % inhibition rate against Staphylococcus aureus, while also enhancing the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1), thereby accelerating bone defect repair in a rat cranial bone defect model. Additionally, TZPG + NIR accelerates bone tissue repair by upregulating osteogenic-related proteins (ALP, RUNX2, OSX, OCN) while enhancing the expression of COL-I and PDGFA proteins to promote angiogenesis. Overall, TZPG + NIR created an antimicrobial microenvironment in vitro , enabled intelligent controlled release, and programmed degradation during the bone repair cycle, achieving a one-time therapeutic effect. This study highlights the promising applications of near-infrared light-responsive material TZPG in regenerative medicine, offering a novel approach to developing multifunctional bone scaffolds for repairing bone defects as a viable alternative to autografts.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid nanocomposites of nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs) embedded in a carbon matrix hold significant promise for environmental remediation by integrating the adsorption capacity of carbon with the antimicrobial effects induced by localized heating of Ni NPs under magnetic hyperthermia. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the structural, magnetic and thermal properties of Ni@C nanocomposites as a function of the carbonization temperature. Samples within the magnetic single domain and multidomain regimes have been used to explore their potential for magnetic hyperthermia-assisted water remediation. To assess the influence of these different regimes on the tranverse suscepbility (TS) and magnetic heating performance, two representative samples, S600 and S1000, were selected to span the single-domain to multi-domain particle regimes. TS measurements show that S1000 exhibits a higher effective anisotropy field ( H Keff ) , attributed to its larger particle size and enhanced magnetic anisotropy. However, calorimetric magnetic heating studies reveal that S600 demonstrates significantly higher specific absorption rate (SAR) and intrinsic loss power (ILP) values, especially at lower concentrations. This enhanced heating efficiency is linked to its smaller particle size, reduced dipolar interactions, and magnetically soft behavior at room temperature. Consequently, more effective magnetic relaxation under moderate fields is enabled, highlighting the importance of optimizing nanoparticle size, anisotropy, and matrix dispersion to improve magnetic heating performance, offering design strategies for non-biomedical applications such as water purification and microbial inactivation.},

  abstract     = {This work presents experimental and modeling studies of a high-speed bead mill. In the experimental part, the influence of key process parameters such as rotation speed, bead size, and powder concentration was investigated. The results showed that both deagglomeration and deaggregation occur during bead milling. This phenomenon was confirmed using TEM–EDX analysis. The evolution of particle size distribution over time revealed that erosion is the dominant mechanism governing the deaggregation process. Moreover, increasing the powder concentration resulted in a reduced breakage rate, which may be attributed to the increased viscosity, leading to greater drag forces acting on the beads. Experiments with different bead sizes showed that while the final particle size was similar, smaller beads led to a faster particle size reduction. This observation supports the conclusion that collision frequency is a key parameter controlling the breakage process in a bead mill. In the modeling part, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods were employed, the Eulerian granular multiphase model was applied to simulate bead motion inside the milling chamber. Based on the CFD results, a Population Balance (PB) model was developed to predict particle size evolution. The PB equations were solved using the Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM). The model predictions showed good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, CFD simulations were used to verify that collision frequency governs the breakage rate. The simulations were used to determine the required fill level of smaller beads that would maintain the same collision frequency as the system with larger beads used in the experiments. The results confirmed that maintaining the same collision frequency results in a similar breakage rate.},

  abstract     = {Multi-stage plateau stress structures have recently attracted increasing attention for impact protection and energy absorption. However, most existing designs either provide limited in-plane energy absorption or exhibit multi-stage features only in one loading direction. To address the above-mentioned limitations, this research proposes a novel star-isosceles triangular honeycomb (SITH) structure. It combines the tunability of star-shaped geometries with the stability of triangular frameworks. The mechanical performance of SITH was systematically investigated through quasi-static experiments and numerical simulations. The results show that SITH provides excellent energy absorption in both directions under in-plane biaxial loading. Uniquely, it achieves three plateau stages in the Y direction. A theoretical model was formulated based on the deformation mechanisms that were observed. This model accurately predicts plateau stresses and critical strains. Parametric analyses of the key geometric angles further reveal their influence on the mechanical response. These insights support the optimization of structural performance. Compared with previously reported hybrid honeycombs, the proposed SITH structure demonstrates superior stability, tunable multi-stage energy absorption, and effectiveness in both loading directions. This work establishes a theoretical basis for design of star-shaped hybrid honeycombs. It also offers a promising strategy for impact protection in complex engineering environments.},

This work presents a bio-reinforced PDMS/BaTiO 3 composite incorporating date palm leaf fibers (DPLF), which enhances durability and energy harvesting performance while valorizing agricultural waste. Composites were fabricated via solution casting with varying fiber concentrations (0–10 wt.%) and systematically characterized for their structural, mechanical, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties. The addition of DPLF improved the dispersion of BaTiO 3 particles, leading to notable enhancements. At the optimal 7.5 wt.% DPLF concentration, the generator delivered a maximum output voltage of 6 V, a power density of 13 µ W/cm 2 , and a 180 % increase in Young’s modulus, together with improved dielectric behavior. Furthermore, the device achieved an energy conversion efficiency of 40.5 %, demonstrating effective electromechanical coupling even in the absence of electrical poling. Long-term fatigue testing over 500,000 cycles confirmed excellent stability, with minimal degradation in output performance. A demonstration powering a green LED validated its practical potential for low-power, self-sustaining electronics.

  abstract     = {Cuproptosis, a copper-dependent programmed cell death, provides opportunities for copper-enriched nanomaterials to achieve cancer therapy. However, existing copper-delivery systems are hampered by critical limitations, such as nonspecific copper release, insufficient endogenous substrates, especially hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), all of which restrict their therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a pH-responsive nano-delivery system (CuO 2 -DSF@ZIF-8, CDZ NCs) was developed via integrated multifunctional design to address above issues, enabling targeted copper delivery for synergistic induction of cuproptosis, ferroptosis and apoptosis. The core–shell architecture of CDZ NCs enables pH-responsive targeted release of cargos, in which the ZIF-8 shell remains stable in neutral healthy tissues but degrades rapidly in the acidic tumor microenvironment, preventing premature drug leakage and reducing off-target toxicity. Encapsulated CuO 2 acts as an in-situ H 2 O 2 generator via catabolism, overcoming the insufficient endogenous H 2 O 2 levels in tumors which would otherwise limit the induction of ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the co-loaded disulfiram (DSF) reacts synergistically with released Cu 2+ , forming cytotoxic bis(diethyldithiocarbamate)copper (CuET) to induce apoptosis and drive Cu 2+ -to-Cu + conversion. The generated Cu + further amplifies therapeutic effects through triggering mitochondrial lipoylated protein aggregation-mediated cuproptosis, as well as accelerating ferroptosis. Collectively, this integration of pH sensitivity, H 2 O 2 self-supply, and multi-pathway crosstalk enbles CDZ NCs as a powerful weapon for enhanced cancer therapy.},

However, the inherent characteristics of the tumor microenvironment limit oxidative stress. In addition, traditional photosensitizers have problems such as poor water solubility, poor photostability and complex synthesis, which hinder the clinical application efficacy of PDT. To further enhance the efficacy of PDT, this study constructed a manganese-doped carbon dots (Mn-CDs) nanosystem with a dual-functional synergistic mechanism. It can catalyze endogenous H 2 O 2 to undergo a Fenton-like reaction in response to the weakly acidic microenvironment of tumors, continuously generating OH. Under laser irradiation, it can accelerate the Fenton like reaction to produce 1 O 2 (quantum yield of 0.39), deplete glutathione (GSH) to disrupt the intracellular redox balance, and the apoptosis rate can reach 86.14 %. The tumor-bearing mouse model showed that the tumor growth inhibition rate could reach 95.5 %. Notably, the treatment dose was precisely delivered through hyaluronic acid dissolved microneedles for transdermal delivery, ensuring a local effective drug concentration while reducing systemic toxicity, providing a new solution that is both highly efficient and safe for targeted treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma.},

Controlled compression tests (4–10 mm s −1 deformation rates) were used to measure rupture force, toughness, yield strength, and elastic modulus. Increasing the deformation rate decreased the rupture force and toughness but increased yield strength and stiffness. Taiyou 398 consistently exhibited the highest mechanical resilience, while Yueyou 3700 was the weakest.

  abstract     = {TiAl alloys are promising for aerospace structures but limited by poor high-temperature deformability. β-phase solidified TiAl alloys exhibit improved HT formability but suffer β-induced brittleness and coarse lamellae, affecting serviceability. We developed a cyclic heat treatment protocol for Ti-44Al-4Nb-1.5Mo-0.1B alloy sheets that concurrently eliminates β-phase and refines lamellar colonies, achieving β-free full lamellar structure. The cycling process led to β-phase reduction, lamellar colonies coarsening, lamellae orientation fixing, and lamellar spacing was first densified then sparsened. The above phenomena are attributed to two phase transition processes: β → α and α → α 2 + γ. In the β → α stage, only a diffusive phase transformation occurred. Extended cycling alleviated Nb/Mo segregation, raising β-phase lattice constant and lowering its content. The α → α 2 + γ transformation involves martensitic (α → L1 2 ) and diffusion (L1 2 → γ) transformation stages. The difference in transformation rates between these two processes during the cyclic heat treatment leads to the residual presence of L1 2 phases within the lamellar colonies. During lamellae formation, the L1 2 phase acts as a “guide”, influencing the extension direction of the lamellae and playing a role in fixing lamellae orientation. This heat treatment resolves the processability-service performance trade-off, advancing TiAl alloys for aerospace engine components.},

In this work, we report the scalable fabrication of flexible thermoelectric films by aerosol jet printing of Bi 2 Te 3 -based nanowires onto a PLA nanofiber-based substrate, followed by optimized intense pulsed light (IPL) sintering. We optimized atomizer, ink, and sheath flows, as well as print speed, to ensure uniform and precise pattern deposition. Optical and SEM analyses revealed that the as-printed films form an intertwined, agglomerated network. This network is distinct from the aligned nanowires observed in drop-cast samples. The difference likely arises from the high shear forces and rapid solvent evaporation inherent to the aerosol jet process. Subsequent IPL sintering, performed at an optimized sintering distance and number of pulses, effectively densified the films without damaging the underlying PLA nanofiber on the substrate. These enhancements in film morphology and densification are crucial for minimizing interparticle resistance and promoting efficient carrier transport, ultimately boosting the thermoelectric performance. This study demonstrates a promising approach for the fabrication of high-resolution, flexible thermoelectric devices suitable for powering next-generation flexible Internet of things (IoT) devices by tapping on waste heat energy.},

  abstract     = {Conventional concave cylindrical shells, though lightweight, are prone to early failure under compression due to instability, limiting their energy absorption potential. This study introduces a hybrid shell–core design by integrating three types of concave shells with a Gyroid-based triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) core to form a hierarchical structure that enhances both compressive stability and energy dissipation. Compression tests were conducted to examine mechanical performance and deformation behavior. Results show that alternating positive–negative units (NAP) consist of alternating positive and negative Poisson’s ratio units. Their peak load is ∼ 16 % higher than negative Poisson’s ratio units (NPR) and ∼ 60 % higher than positive ones (PPR), though specific energy absorption (SEA) is reduced.With TPMS integration, the NPR-based composite achieves 47 % improvement in both peak load and SEA, while the NAP composite attains a 63 % SEA increase. The failure modes of the three types of composite structures were different, with the PPR structure producing a peeling of the inner core and outer shell during failure, the NPR structure fracturing due to the extrusion of the inner and outer structures, and the NAP structure maintaining high loads due to the coupling of the first two deformations. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of shell-core synergistic mechanisms in optimizing structural properties and opens new avenues for designing lightweight, impact-resistant protective metamaterials in fields such as aerospace and automotive engineering.},

  abstract     = {Although Al-Li alloys possess advantages of low density and high stiffness, their severe hot cracking susceptibility (HCS) limits practical applications. Herein, we attempted to decrease HCS without sacrificing mechanical performance by replacing Sc with cost-effective light rare earth (LRE) elements. Results showed that the introduction of La, Ce, Nd, and Pr reduces the HCS to half that of the Base alloy due to grain refinement and melt purification. Finite element analysis (FEA) revealed that compared to elongated LRE phases characterized by high aspect ratios and interfacial curvature, blocky LRE phases with lower aspect ratios and interfacial curvature hinder crack propagation, leading to improved cracking resistance. Among the low-HCS variants, Pr-modified alloy shows remarkable yield strength of 398 MPa, exhibiting competitiveness compared to existing Sc-containing alloys. More importantly, Pr-modified alloy achieves a significant cost reduction of ∼27 %. The narrowed δʹ-Al 3 Li precipitation free zone (PFZ) and the uniformly distributed fine T 1 precipitates contribute to the promising mechanical properties of Pr-modified alloy. First-principles calculations indicated that the higher vacancy binding energies of Nd and Pr atoms suppress δʹ-PFZ coarsening, while their doping increases the coarsening energy barrier of T 1 precipitates. These benefits mitigate stress concentration and enhance deformation compatibility.},

The solidification microstructure and the type of silicide show strong dependence on Si content from 1 % to 15 %, with the former changing from hypoeutectic to hypereutectic structure, and the latter evolving from M 3 Si-type to tetragonal-M 5 Si 3 -type silicide, and finally to the co-existence of both tetragonal- and hexagonal- M 5 Si 3 -type silicide. The formation of silicide phase enhances the strength both at the ambient and elevated temperatures, and a significant improvement of peak compressive strength from 221.3 MPa to 511.59 MPa at 800℃ was obtained after alloying 15 % Si to the prototype TiZrHfNb alloy. It was found that heterodeformation-induced strengthening, resulting from dislocation pile-ups at phase boundaries, was responsible for the enhancement in the strength. During hot deformation, the flow stress begins to decrease after reaching the peak value due to the presence of the dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization, which becomes more pronounced at higher Si content.},

Herein, we present a unique polyphenol crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) fibrous membrane (CMC/TA-FM), which was synthesized by converting commercial chitosan fibrous membranes into CMC and crosslinking them with tannic acid. This design not only enhances hemostatic efficacy but also introduces strong antibacterial and antioxidant capabilities. CMC/TA-FM achieves rapid haemostasis with minimal blood loss in both rat and pig liver injury models, outperforming clinically used hemostatic materials such as CELOX and other CMC-based products. In infected wound models, CMC/TA-FM significantly reduces bacterial load and accelerates wound closure, with results comparable to or even better than antibiotic-loaded gelatin sponges. CMC/TA-FM represents a promising hemostatic material that combines rapid bleeding control with strong antibacterial properties and promotes effective healing of infected wounds, positioning it as a potential next-generation hemostatic wound dressing for emergency trauma and infected wound management.},

It allows for faster, easier, and more scalable production. The sustainability credentials of this method can be further improved by exploiting bio-based (i.e., from vegetable oils) open-cell polyurethane foams to generate porous and sustainable metamaterials. This work investigates the effect of manufacturing parameters (compression ratio, heating temperature and time) and compression direction on bio-based foam’s quasi-static and dynamic mechanical performance, converted through uniaxial thermoforming. ZPR behaviour was observed independently of processing parameters when thermoforming along the foam’s rise direction. NPR foams were, however, obtained when thermoforming occurred perpendicularly to the rise direction and the processing parameters were minimised. A two-level, three-factor full factorial experimental design was implemented for thermoforming along the foam’s rise direction. Results showed that the compression ratio mainly affected the material stiffness, whereas quasi-static energy dissipation strongly depended on heating temperature and time. NPR and ZPR foams presented suitable properties for tissue engineering and cushioning applications, further highlighting the potential of this manufacturing technique for use in bio-based porous substrates.},

Herein, a clinical treatment strategy integrating customizable biomimetic structural scaffold with a novel minimally invasive delivery technique is proposed. First, inspired by the collagen fiber network of rotator cuff, a biomimetic bilayer heterogeneous fibrous scaffold was designed and fabricated. The tendon layer combines aligned and crimped fibers to replicate natural tendon collagen and guide tendon cell migration, while the bone repair layer features randomly-oriented crimped fibers to provide osteogenic topological cues. Results demonstrated that crimped (36.17 % porosity, 30-μm pore diameter) and parallel-fibered (50-μm spacing) scaffolds enhanced tendon stem cell adhesion and directional alignment compared to control groups. Second, a specialized minimally invasive delivery system was pioneered to transport a 50 × 30 mm scaffold to the intra-articular target site through a minimal incision (≤10 mm), while preserving structural integrity and spatial orientation. Finally, arthroscopic simulations and implantation experiments validated the efficacy of this minimally invasive delivery strategy. This integrated solution for rotator cuff repair combines structural biomimetics, functional compatibility, and clinical feasibility, demonstrating strong translational potential.},

Therefore, a multi-scale hybrid nanoindentation testing strategy integrated with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was developed to evaluate the surface mechanical properties of induction-cladded in-situ TiC/Ti multi-phase composite coating in this study. The coating consisted of α-Ti, a small amount of β-Ti and a diffusely distributed TiC reinforced phase. The microhardness stabilized at ∼ 600 HV 0.2 , and the TiC phase exhibited a “shallow hard − deep soft” behavior. The mechanical properties of within the TiC region (WTR) were between those of TiC and the matrix phase, and the β-Ti matrix phase exhibited superior performance to that of α-Ti. A correlation model between microhardness and single nanoindentation hardness was constructed using the modified rule of mixtures (ROM) method, revealing the evolution of the phase structure with an increase in the TiC volume fraction. GMM-based decoupling of nanoindentation data indicated that hardness and elastic modulus followed a three-peak Gaussian distribution, corresponding to TiC, WTR, and matrix phases. This study provides a theoretical foundation for the optimization of MMCs properties.},

In this work, the effect of the tip bluntness on indentation responses and scaling relationships for film/substrate composite systems is investigated via finite-element (FE) simulations and dimensional analysis. A novel indentation method is proposed to measure the intrinsic elastic modulus of thin films based on the scaling relationship among the curvature of the loading segment in P - h curves and material properties. FE simulations indicate the significant effect of tip bluntness on indentation responses. However, the curvature is essentially independent of the dimensionless parameter of h m / t . Furthermore, the tilt effect during the direct calibration procedure is corrected through spatial mapping transformation of atomic force microscopy data. Herein, the measured tip rounding radius fitted by 2D profile and 3D topography are 70 ± 4.8 nm and ∼72.83 nm, respectively. The indentation data acquired with the actual Berkovich indenter are used to verify the scaling relationships. The elastic modulus of ITO films is calculated as ∼135.26 GPa, and the measured error is only ∼3.59 %.},

Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) method served for examining the austenite grain morphology and the orientation of annealing twins at different aging temperatures.

Furthermore, the deformation mechanisms under different tensile strains were explored using TEM and EBSD, with particular attention to the evolution of dislocations and other substructures in the deformed specimens. Quantitative evaluation was conducted on the yield strength variation under varying strengthening mechanisms through theoretical modeling. According to relevant results, with rising aging temperature, the finely dispersed spherical κ-carbides gradually transform into a uniformly distributed rectangular morphology. The strength and toughness of the experimental steel both increase with aging temperature, and the steel aged at 500 °C exhibits an outstanding overall property, with a tensile strength of 1199  MPa and an elongation of 37 %. Planar dislocation slip is the primary deformation mode, and the favorable strength-ductility balance results from the microband-induced plasticity.

The composite leverages the broad absorption in the near infrared region and excellent electrical conductivity of tungsten carbide MXene to overcome the photoinstability of ZnO, achieving a photothermal conversion efficiency of approximately 29.78 % and strong catalytic activity through reactive oxygen species. Upon irradiation at 808 nm, ZWMx rapidly eliminates over 90 % of MRSA in vitro within five minutes and disrupts established biofilms, indicating a synergistic and multifaceted bactericidal mechanism. In vivo , ZWMx promotes near-complete healing of MRSA-infected wounds within twelve days, with minimal thermal damage to surrounding tissues, high biocompatibility, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor one, suggesting enhanced angiogenesis.

The spiky surface topography of the nanoparticles enhanced cellular penetration, while their hollow-tubular and porous structure allowed for high-capacity loading of photosensitizers. This dual-functional design enhanced tumor uptake and increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within cells, thereby boosting PDT efficacy. By integrating photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), we were able to visualise tumor location and margins, which improved treatment precision in the orthotopic UM model. The nanoparticles also demonstrated remarkable tumor-specific accumulation, achieving efficient retention and deep penetration within hours post-administration. VSP-mediated PDT effectively inhibited tumor progression while preserving ocular integrity. This study presents a versatile nanoplatform with excellent tumor penetration and theranostic capabilities, offering a promising approach for minimally invasive treatment of UM.},

  abstract     = {This study presents an investigation of both the joining and controlled disassembly of resistance-welded carbon-fibre-reinforced low-melting poly(aryl ether ketone) (CF/LM-PAEK) thermoplastic composite joints. A Taguchi design of experiments followed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to explore the effects of welding time, power and pressure on lap-shear strength. Optimised welding parameters—35 s, 140 W and 0.6 MPa—produce a lap-shear strength of (50.5 ± 1.5) MPa. Subsequent annealing at 190 ∘ C (cooling rate 5 ∘ C/min) increases strength to (63.2 ± 1.5) MPa. Disassembly trials are carried out via resistance heating. By applying 2–3 V to the heating element, different weld-zone temperatures are generated, and the influence of temperature and cross-head speed on joint separation is assessed. An operational window for successful disassembly is identified at a traverse speed of 175 mm/min and a temperature of 285 ∘ C. Under these conditions, the joint cleanly separates into the heating element and the adherends without visible heat-induced deformation of the laminates. The residual separation force is (371 ± 125) N, corresponding to a 98 % loss of mechanical strength. These results demonstrate an efficient cycle of welding and disassembly for CF/LM-PAEK composites, laying the groundwork for part exchange, reuse and recycling in lightweight-structure applications.},

This study focused on enhancing the sCO 2 immersion resistance of aramid fiber-reinforced ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber composites through strengthened interfacial bonding. Combined modification with coupling agents and polyisocyanate was applied to the surfaces of phosphoric acid-etched aramid fibers. H pull-out tests revealed that after modification, the interfacial bonding strength between the fibers and rubber significantly increased from 12.9 to 51.1 N. Scanning electron microscopy analysis further confirmed this enhanced interfacial bonding. Notably, the modified interface had minimal impact on the high-temperature compression set, thermal aging resistance, thermal decomposition temperature, or low-temperature performance. However, sCO 2 immersion tests (165 °C, 17 MPa, 3 days) revealed that interface reinforcement improved the tensile strength retention of EPDM composites containing phosphoric acid-treated aramid fibers modified with coupling agents and polyisocyanate. Specifically, this modification reduced tensile strength loss from 41 % to 33 %. This study provides a simple and effective surface impregnation-based interfacial reinforcement strategy to enhance the sCO 2 resistance of rubber composites.},

These properties make it suitable for use in electronic devices, sensors, and energy storage systems. However, current methods for producing graphene films face several problems. They are often expensive, require specific substrates, and have low success rates during transfer. These issues limit the large-scale use of graphene films. In this study, we propose a low-cost method to prepare graphene films. The method uses a flexible polyimide (PI) mask. Laser etching is used to create specific patterns on the PI mask. Then, a printing technique is applied to deposit graphene films onto quartz substrates. Compared to traditional approaches, this method is cheaper, works with various substrates. We used systematic characterization to evaluate the method. The results show that it can produce uniform and high-quality graphene films. We also studied the effects of film thickness, substrate treatment, and vacuum annealing on film performance. Hydrophilic treatment improves the dispersion of the graphene slurry. This helps the film become more uniform and improves its adhesion to the substrate. Vacuum annealing removes some dopants and makes the film cleaner. This method provides a promising solution for low-cost and large-scale production of graphene films.},

However, how scaffold structure affects this process remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to address this challenge from the perspective of the hydromechanical microenvironment. We employed Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method to simulate dynamic cell seeding in porous scaffolds with varying structures, using the Discrete Phase Model (DPM) to model seeded cells. A novel Cell Impingement Energy Model (CIEM) was implemented to capture cell-scaffold interactions, where adhesion was determined by impingement energy. The simulation results were validated through in vitro dynamic seeding and in vivo animal experiments. The results showed that despite comparable morphological parameters, TPMS and Voronoi scaffolds presented lower overall cell adhesion but a more uniform spatial distribution, while Diamond scaffolds exhibited higher cell adhesion, primarily localized on the surface. Adjusting the morphological parameters can improve the uniformity of cell distribution in Diamond scaffold. More importantly, the computational and experimental results were highly consistent, suggesting that CFD combining DPM and CIEM can effectively simulate dynamic cell seeding. This study presents a reliable approach for predicting cell adhesion in porous scaffolds, offering valuable insights for scaffold design and optimization.},

Using isothermal calorimetry (TAM Air), the effects of S i O 2 / K 2 O molar ratio, slag type, and activator concentration on reaction kinetics were investigated. The results indicate that lower molar ratios accelerated reactivity and heat release, whereas higher ratios delayed setting—beneficial for printability but potentially compromising strength. Moreover, Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) measurements correlated setting times (initial and final) with the peak heat flow rate, enabling direct determination of setting behavior from calorimetry data via the first derivative of the heat flow curve, bypassing conventional tests. For hardened AAS, the same parameters influenced compressive strength and pore structure, with mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) revealing distinct differences from hydrated CEM III mortar. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses confirmed the absence of Q 4 species, minimal Q 3 content, and significant carbonation alongside polymerization and hydration reactions. This work supports a shift from traditional trial-and-error mix design toward a more predictive approach, correlating calorimetry, UPV, and microstructural characteristics to guide binder formulation.},

However, systematic investigations of its effects on melt-pool dynamics, temperature field and microstructure are still required. In this work, we propose an integrated approach combining a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, in-situ temperature measurements and metallographic analysis to explore programmable ring beam profiles, ranging from Gaussian-dominant to ring-dominant configurations. This method, initially proposed on Ti-6Al-4V bead-on-plate tracks, validates melt-pool temperatures measured in-process by a dual-wavelength pyrometer against CFD predictions, which are in turn validated with metallographic cross-sections. Ring modes lowered peak temperature by up to 35 %, transforming deep-narrow pools (aspect ratio ≈0.9) into shallow-wide ones (≈0.4). This suppressed humping at line energies ≥ 0.28 J mm − 1, whereas lower energies produced only superficial melting. Simulations matched pyrometer data within 5 % whenever pool width equalled the pyrometers’ sensing spot; all tracks solidified into ultrafine α with retained β, independent of beam mode. Therefore, the combination of in-situ, ex-situ and CFD tools offers a practical workflow for assisting data-driven process optimization and can be easily extended to other LMF processes, with its potential implementation in industrial Laser Powder Bed Fusion.},

Hyaluronic acid functionalization was employed to improve scaffold biocompatibility. In vitro experiments confirmed the biocompatibility of these scaffolds, while in vivo assessments over eight weeks demonstrated significant efficacy in restoring muscle function. Compared with PCL-Ce scaffolds, mice implanted with piezoelectric scaffolds exhibited faster grip strength recovery, more mature muscle regeneration, a more hierarchical arrangement of muscle fibers, and increased fiber diameter. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of Ce NPs reduced adipocyte infiltration and excessive collagen deposition and were associated with enhanced angiogenesis. Grip strength measurements further highlighted the superior regenerative performance of P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds combined with Ce NPs. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of piezoelectric scaffolds integrated with antioxidants in promoting structural and functional muscle regeneration following VML.},

Experimental results show that the multimodal model achieves high prediction accuracy, with an R 2 of 0.98 and MAE of 5.23 HV for hardness prediction. Furthermore, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is introduced to preprocess the wear curve, reducing noise and improving the robustness of friction performance prediction.

The nanocrystallites are formed by partial devitrification of the amorphous matrix and the properties of the composite are a result of the devitrification process. Understanding the rate-dependent crystallisation kinetics is therefore essential for tailoring the properties of such nanocomposites. In this study, we monitor the devitrification process in situ during rapid heating of metallic glasses with composition (Fe 0.75 Co 0.25 ) 95 − x Nb 5 B x , x = 15 , 20 at.%, by using high-energy wide angle X-ray scattering. The results are compared to samples devitrified at low heating rates, analysed using differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and magnetometry. Additionally, we present a model describing the crystallisation kinetics based on classical nucleation and growth theory coupled with thermodynamic data for a generalised Fe-B system. The model successfully reproduces the onset of devitrification as a function of time, temperature, and B-concentration, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of advanced soft-magnetic metal amorphous nanocomposites.},

  abstract     = {Woven carbon fiber composites are increasingly adopted in advanced structural applications due to their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and tunable design features. However, high-fidelity simulations of their complex woven architecture are computationally intensive. This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework that combines a dual-input Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for mechanical property prediction with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for reinforcement learning-based optimization. The CNN achieves R 2 values above 0.96 for elastic deformation, plastic deformation, and strain energy density prediction. Using the DQN, the optimized design achieves a 2.37-fold improvement in strain energy density, increasing from 3590.78 J/m 3 to 8527.85 J/m 3 . Furthermore, by replacing the original woven geometry with a reduced model using stress–strain behavior, simulation time is reduced from 534 min to 2 min, a 267-fold speedup. This approach significantly enhances efficiency in composite design and optimization workflows, enabling rapid exploration of high-performance configurations.},

  abstract     = {SiO 2 contact holes having high aspect ratios were etched using a cyclic-etching process employing heptafluoropropyl methyl ether (HFE-347mcc3) which exhibits a low global-warming potential (GWP ≈530) compared with conventional perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). In this cyclic process, the etching steps involving HFE-347mcc3/O 2 /Ar plasmas were alternated with deposition steps involving HFE-347mcc3/Ar plasmas to precisely control the fluorocarbon passivation films on the sidewalls. The effects of the deposition- and etching-step durations on the contact-hole profiles were systematically investigated. Increasing the duration of the deposition step initially improved sidewall protection, thereby significantly reducing bowing and enhancing anisotropy; however, excessively long deposition-step durations caused narrowing. Similarly, the duration of the etching step was optimized to achieve sufficient fluorocarbon-film hardening to prevent bowing while avoiding excessive narrowing. The degree of exposure to fluorocarbon plasma was introduced as a critical parameter to optimize the anisotropy. Under optimized conditions, a nearly vertical and highly anisotropic SiO 2 contact hole having a diameter of 100 nm and an aspect ratio of 24 was successfully obtained with minimal bowing (1 nm). The results revealed that HFE-347mcc3 is a viable and environmentally sustainable alternative to high-GWP PFCs or HFCs and provide both environmental benefits and excellent etching performance.},

The research question focuses on how to rigorously capture large deflections and bending–membrane interactions to establish reliable benchmarks beyond the critical load. A series expansion method within the von Kármán framework is employed to derive analytical solutions with high numerical accuracy. Compared with existing analytical and numerical approaches, the present solutions achieve five to six significant digits of accuracy, representing a substantial improvement in precision and reliability. A comprehensive parametric study demonstrates how varying the biaxial compression ratio influences post-buckling responses, providing deeper insight into boundary-sensitive and load-dependent behaviors. The results establish new analytical benchmarks that can be directly used to validate approximate and numerical methods, thereby improving the robustness of computational models. In addition, they offer practical guidance for the safe and efficient design of thin-walled plate structures in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering. This work highlights both the novelty of deriving truly accurate, verifiable analytical solutions and their dual value as theoretical milestones and engineering tools.},

The developed methodology suggests that the martensite-to-ferrite phase ratio has a stronger impact on damage tolerance than martensite strength, while the elongation of martensite is the dominant parameter for martensite fracture. For the newly introduced phase boundary decohesion indicator, the grain sizes of both phases exhibit the highest influence. A homogenized indicator for overall damage resistance and a trade-off for the two damage mechanisms further revealed the importance of phase morphology, providing insights into additional influencing factors not captured by individual mechanisms. Convergence analyses confirmed that 200–250 datapoints suffice for stable determination of the Sobol indices, confirmed by different surrogate modeling approaches. Radar chart analyses indicated that optimal microstructures for enhanced damage tolerance consist of smaller fractions of strong martensite combined with fine, spheroidal grains in both phases, aligning with established knowledge on DP steels. This approach establishes a validated basis for future optimization of microstructures and loading paths to improve damage tolerance under complex forming conditions.},

The potential to improve the fatigue crack propagation resistance by transformation-induced crack closure was studied for a high-speed steel grade in which significant fractions of metastable austenite were retained. The austenite’s resistance to martensitic transformation under cyclic thermal loads was evaluated. Transformation-induced plasticity was studied using tensile tests with in situ determination of austenite content by X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation. The cyclic R–curve behavior and the threshold for fatigue crack propagation were determined for stress ratios of R = 0.1, −1, and −5. Critical parameters regarding fatigue behavior, such as the slope of the cyclic R-curve and the long crack threshold of the stress intensity factor range, were significantly improved relative to comparable industry-relevant material states.},

The proposed approach extends the ordered SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) framework to incorporate a composite material failure criterion. Specifically, a modified Tsai–Hill yield criterion is employed to characterize the anisotropic yielding behavior of the heterogeneous lattice, which is subsequently integrated into the optimization as a stress constraint. To address the variation in yield strength across different lattice configurations, a normalization strategy is applied to the stress field. Additionally, a P-norm aggregation scheme is introduced to efficiently handle local stress constraints while reducing computational cost. The equivalent elastic tensor and yield strength of each lattice configuration are obtained using a representative volume element (RVE) based on homogenization theory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of 2D cases, achieving lightweight structural designs that satisfy stress constraints. Finally, full-scale mechanical analysis and 3D printing experimental validation further confirm the strength reinforcement of the optimized results.},

A CALPHAD-based pseudo-binary diagram guided the optimization of solidification and annealing conditions, promoting nanoscale coherent precipitate (NCP) formation within each phase. Multiscale analysis (SEM, EPMA, TEM, 3D APT) revealed a dual FCC-phase composite where each region contains NCPs of the other phase. During annealing, secondary NCPs grow more slowly than primary phase-separated regions, enabling effective control through heat treatment. Mechanical testing via nanoindentation and micropillar compression showed that coherent NCPs enhance strength via a shearing mechanism. In particular, LE NCPs in the HE matrix effectively distribute the applied strain and suppress dislocation motion and slip band formation, resulting in stable strain hardening without stress drops. Upon coarsening beyond the size applicable for shearing, transition to the Orowan bypass mechanism resulting in a decrease in nano-hardness. These findings highlight the importance of coherent phase-separated nanostructures in strengthening and deformation control, and present a thermodynamically guided microstructural design strategy for fabricating HEA-based hierarchical nanocomposites with tunable mechanical performance, offering a promising approach for developing next-generation high-strength, ductile structural materials.},

Furthermore, the properties of cementitious composites incorporating CNMs, including workability, mechanical strength, durability, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, are summarized. The impact of dispersion strategies on these properties is analyzed, and potential causes behind performance inconsistencies are discussed. This review found that the current research faces several challenges: the lack of standardized mix proportions and dispersion protocols hinders result comparison, and inconsistent characterization methods, insufficient cost/lifecycle analyses, combined with unclear links between CNMs’ properties and enhancement, collectively limit practicality. Therefore, future works should focus on establishing unified guidelines for production and characterization, conducting cost-sustainability assessments, and clarifying CNMs’ property-performance relations to advance engineering applications.},

The present study explores automated, data-driven workflows to investigate geometry-dependent optical asymmetry, with the aim of predicting the asymmetry factor (g-factor) of Au NR-helical assemblies and retrieving their geometric features. A forward artificial neural network (ANN) has been developed to predict the g-factor from geometric inputs. Conversely, a combination of ANN with particle swarm optimisation (PSO) has been demonstrated to retrieve geometric parameters necessary to achieve a target g-factor. The findings demonstrate that the forward ANN attains a high level of prediction accuracy ( r = 0.9833), and the inverse ANN-PSO workflow effectively identifies geometries that yield g-factors with a high degree of proximity to the target values. This demonstrates the significant value of these automated workflows for the fundamental geometric design and optical asymmetry prediction of Au NR-helical assemblies.},

The increase in the laser energy density promoted the formation of columnar grains and the widening of subgrain structures, and made the Mg 2 Si phase transformed from continuous to discontinuous morphology. The as-printed alloy exhibited 439 MPa tensile strength and 11.3 % elongation, attributed to grain refinement, reduced porosity, and the formation of the high dislocation density, 9R phase, and nanotwin.

In vitro and in vivo studies generally demonstrate therapeutic potential, but limitations such asincomplete toxicity evaluation, lack of standardized synthesis protocols, and variability in biological outcomes remain major obstacles. Unlike other chitosan-based nanocarriers, the application of artificial intelligence in CS–GO design is still limited and has not been systematically assessed. Overall, this review synthesizes current knowledge, identifies gaps between experimental findings and translational requirements, and highlights directions for future work, including long-term safety assessment, reproducible large-scale fabrication, and integration with computational optimization tools.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease worldwide. Current therapeutic approaches are limited by rapid drug clearance from the joint cavity, necessitating frequent administrations and failing to provide sustained therapeutic effects. Injectable hydrogels that can persistently remain within the joint space represent a promising strategy for comprehensive OA treatment. Herein, an injectable hydrogel system based on dermal-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) engineered with N-isopropylacrylamide, tannic acid, and sodium tetraborate was developed to achieve superior lubrication and strong tissue adhesion. The hydrogel exhibits exceptional lubrication properties and robust tissue adhesion, enabling prolonged retention within the joint cavity while providing continuous cartilage protection. Its excellent shear-thinning behavior and rapid self-healing capability facilitate minimally invasive injection and ensure conformal coverage of defect sites. In vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated that the hydrogel promotes cell proliferation, modulates anti-inflammatory responses, and significantly preserves cartilage integrity with enhanced proteoglycan and type II collagen (COL-2) expression. The sustained therapeutic efficacy was attributed to the hydrogel’s ability to maintain prolonged residence time while continuously delivering bioactive components and providing mechanical lubrication. These findings demonstrate that this multifunctional dECM-based injectable hydrogel represents a promising therapeutic platform for OA treatment suitable for clinical translation.},

  abstract     = {In this study, an innovative three-dimensional Negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) chiral structure was designed based on a 2D staggered rib architecture. This design integrates horizontally oriented chiral alternating ribs and vertically oriented Z-shaped configurations. Two optimized architectures, namely the wave-optimized structure (W-NPR) and the node-enhanced structure (N-NPR), were proposed and compared with the original folded structure (F-NPR). Characterization analysis revealed that the N-NPR structure exhibited superior formability, making it suitable for Digital Light Processing (DLP) fabrication. A parametric study on the mechanical performance of the N-NPR structure demonstrated that an increased volume fraction enhances the mechanical properties at the expense of structural compliance. Uniaxial tensile testing along the XY-plane and Z-axis confirmed the anisotropic Young’s modulus. Experimental and finite element simulations further revealed anisotropic behavior and a unique two-stage rotation-torsion compressive deformation mechanism of N-NPR, which enables advanced mechanical designs by enhancing the degree of freedom for deformation mode conversion. This work proposes a novel method for designing 3D NPR structures and elucidates its mechanical deformation mechanism, enabling transformative advances in aerospace, personalized healthcare, and adaptive wearable technologies.},

The evolution of the microstructure, defects, and hardness was investigated using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentation tests. The GIXRD results showed that diffraction peaks shifted towards lower 2θ values, indicating that lattice swelling was caused by irradiation-induced defects after irradiation at elevated temperatures. According to the TEM observations, the size of the dislocation loops remained nearly constant, while their number density decreased with an increase in irradiation temperature. The precipitation of Cr was not observed in the W-0.3Cr alloy after irradiation at 773 K. In contrast, it was significant in the samples irradiated at temperatures of 1073 and 1273 K, showing increases in both the size and number density of the precipitates. Irradiation hardening was observed in all samples, primarily attributed to the presence of dislocation loops. The hardness change was estimated with the dispersion barrier hardening model by taking into account the contributions of dislocation loops and Cr precipitates. The values evaluated with the model were significantly larger than those obtained with the nanoindentation tests. This difference was ascribed to the depletion of solute Cr atoms from the W matrix by precipitation.},

Thermodynamic calculations guided nitrogen adjustment in the shielding gas to control solidification and develop high-performance microstructures. Thermodynamic–kinetic modeling predicted nitrogen uptake from the arc plasma, enabling gas composition selection to promote a shift from δ-ferrite to γ-austenite as the primary solidification phase. Nitrogen content analysis and Scheil simulations confirmed a transition to austenite-first solidification at approximately 0.7 wt% nitrogen. Electron Backscatter Diffraction and optical microscopy revealed that nitrogen-enriched (HN) samples exhibited a continuous γ-austenitic matrix with finely dispersed δ-ferrite, whereas nitrogen-lean (LN) samples had a δ-ferritic matrix with isolated γ-austenite islands. HN samples showed greater grain orientation spread, indicating increased internal misorientation. Despite pronounced crystallographic texture, the HN samples demonstrated nearly isotropic tensile behavior along with enhanced yield strength, tensile strength, ∼11 % higher hardness, and improved elongation. These findings demonstrate that melt chemistry control via gas-phase alloying enables phase-engineered microstructures with superior mechanical performance without modifying the filler wire.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of solid resin prepregs (SRPs) − namely the inability to drape at room temperature and hindered gas evacuation during vacuum-bag-only (VBO) processing − by 3D-printing a regular, uncured solid epoxy resin (SR) pattern on a dry woven textile. The locally patterned resin distribution preserves dry textile regions, enabling room temperature drapeability and more robust VBO-processing due to improved gas evacuation. By adjusting pattern parameters such as element geometry and coverage, the draping behaviour can be controlled to adapt to a desired draping condition. In order to be able to design the right pattern for given draping conditions, the influence of these parameters on bending and shearing was studied. Manual draping showed that bending radii down to 4 mm were achievable, governed only by the element length in bending direction, while coverage had no significant effect. In contrast, picture-frame-tests showed that the shearing is mainly influenced by the coverage and that a maximal shearing angle of 30° can be achieved. These results show that the SRPs bending and shearing can be independently influenced through pattern design. The derived structure–drapeability relationships enable targeted design of SRPs for robust, autoclave-free composite manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Silver (Ag) sputtering targets are crucial in electronic information materials, particularly with the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has further increased their demand. However, the extremely high reflectivity and poor laser absorption of pure Ag in the infrared range make it challenging to process using conventional laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, limiting its wide application. In this study, a novel hatch spacing-to-scanning speed ratio ( h / v )-centered low-energy–density strategy was proposed to overcome this challenge and enable high-quality additive manufacturing of pure Ag. By optimizing the ( h / v ) value to 1.0E-04, we successfully fabricated dense, low-defect Ag sputtering targets without increasing energy input. The results demonstrated that this method significantly shortened the manufacturing cycle and produced high-performance Ag targets with refined grains (3–7 μm), high density (≥99.8 %), a smooth surface (Ra = 11.5 μm), and stable sputtering performance (sputtering rate = 31.8 nm/min). Furthermore, the hardness increased by 45.1 % compared to Ag targets prepared by traditional methods. This work offers a practical pathway for applying laser-based AM in the production of highly reflective metal sputtering targets, advancing their industrialization in thin-film electronics, while also contributing to the understanding of AM process–structure relationships in metallic materials.},

Enhancing OPD performance requires optimizing key layers such as the electron transport layer (ETL) using low-temperature processes to prevent thermal degradation. This study explores the use of low-temperature electron beam annealing (EBA) to improve the performance of Al-doped ZnO (AZO)-based ETLs. The impact of EBA irradiation time (1–8 min) on the structural, morphological, and electrical properties of AZO films was systematically analyzed. EBA effectively modulated oxygen vacancies and reduced surface roughness, lowering trap density and leakage current while enhancing charge transport. An OPD with an ETL treated by 8 min of EBA exhibited superior detectivity (2.22 × 10 13 Jones at 0 V) and significantly reduced leakage current compared to a device with conventionally annealed ETLs. Importantly, the low-temperature EBA process preserved the amorphous state of AZO, making it suitable for heat-sensitive and flexible substrates. These findings demonstrate that EBA is a powerful, scalable method for ETL optimization in OPDs and offers a pathway toward high-performance, energy-efficient, and flexible optoelectronic devices.},

The tensile–shear strength and cross-tension strength of the joints were measured at 32.6 MPa and 3.2 MPa, respectively. Detailed microstructural characterization revealed that mechanical interlocking occurred in the laser-ablated zones of the PA66 resin and that synergistic physicochemical reinforcement was achieved via covalent Al‒O‒Si bonds coupled with molecular chain entanglement/hydrogen bonding in unablated regions. Defect-free continuous interfacial transitions were confirmed through the penetration of nanolamellar structures by amorphous silane films.

  abstract     = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are widely used as ideal high-voltage sources in high-voltage equipment. However, there are still some high-voltage application demands that exceed the voltage range of traditional TENG. Here, we propose a high-voltage rotary freestanding TENG (HRF-TENG) with a simple structure. The HRF-TENG device is obtained by changing the relative positions of the electrode pairs (reducing the capacitance) in the traditional RF-TENG, which is inspired by the finite element (FEM) calculation of the traditional RF-TENG. The high-voltage mechanism is initially studied through FEM calculation and experiments, and the calculated output voltage can reach over 30 kV at 500 rpm. In addition, the current direction remains unchanged regardless of the rotation direction. The ultrahigh voltage from HRF-TENG is sufficient to break down the air gap to generate ozone, which achieves the ozone drinking water sterilization system. Drinking water containing 10 7 CFU/ml of E. coli and S. aureus can be completely sterilized within 24 min and 28 min, respectively. Meanwhile, the electrospinning system can be directly driven by HRF-TENG without any circuit. All of these demonstrations prove the feasibility of HRF-TENG in the field of high-voltage applications.

The research focuses on enhancing the properties of 3D-printed soil composites by utilizing mycelial hyphal networks to create sustainable construction solutions. A primary challenge lies in calibrating the nutrient levels to support mycelium growth while ensuring the admixture remains printable and suitable for sustaining mycelial development. The study assesses the effects of malt extract agar (MEA) as an additive in soil composites, examining its impact on mycelium growth, water-related properties, and self-regenerative capabilities. Findings indicate that soil composites containing 10 wt% MEA supports balanced mycelium growth across aerial, surface, and penetrative levels. Mycelial networks within the soil composite ink improve water-related properties, enhance structural integrity, and reduce shrinkage compared to composites without mycelium. Furthermore, the mycelium-soil composite demonstrates self-regenerative capabilities by bridging gaps created within the samples. This research contributes to the advancement of LBMs for sustainable earth-based construction, utilizing the inert properties of mycelium to enhance soil characteristics for 3D printing.},

While various therapeutic strategies, including pharmacotherapy, have been developed and demonstrate some efficacy, however their clinical application is significantly limited by challenges, such as low drug bioavailability and undesirable side effects. Moreover, a critical limitation is their frequently neglect the SCI microenvironment, which serves as the essential foundation for nerve regeneration. In contrast, intelligent nanoparticles-based delivery systems, owing to their excellent biocompatibility and high drug-loading capacity, they can modulate the SCI microenvironment on demand, hold great promise for improving SCI therapy.

  abstract     = {Background Persistent inflammation in diabetic skin wounds poses significant therapeutic challenges. Fibronectin domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5), or its cleaved form irisin, is an exercise-induced myokine with anti-inflammatory activity. However, its effect on skin wound repair remains unclear. Methods FNDC5/irisin-overexpressing mesenchymal stem cell-derived apoptotic nanovesicles (apoVIs) were generated. A gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)/platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) composite hydrogel encapsulating the engineered apoVIs, termed PRF-GEL@apoVIs, was developed for the sustained release of apoVIs. Their effects on macrophage-related inflammation were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results Priming bone marrow-derived macrophages with apoVIs promoted macrophage recruitment, efferocytosis, M2 polarization and attenuated inflammatory response resulting from efferocytosis defects. The initial PRF scaffold was effectively stabilized and preserved upon rapid centrifugation of the GelMA precursor solution and whole blood mixture. Following UV crosslinking, the composite hydrogel demonstrated superior stability and sustained-release capabilities of apoVIs. In db/db mice, PRF-GEL@apoVIs significantly accelerated wound closure, enhanced granulation tissue formation, collagen deposition, and angiogenesis, promoted clearance of apoptotic neutrophils, and increased M2 macrophage polarization. Conclusions The PRF-GEL@apoVIs system promotes resolution of inflammation and tissue repair in diabetic wounds by enhancing efferocytosis and modulating macrophage phenotype, representing a promising therapeutic strategy for chronic diabetic wounds.},

This review presents the first systematic analysis of these protein degradation platforms to address ’undruggable’ targets in ocular pathologies. Harnessing distinct cellular machinery through the engagement of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the lysosomal pathway with PROTACs and LYTACs, respectively, these heterobifunctional molecules enable the targeted elimination of disease-driving proteins implicated in ocular surface diseases, such as dry eye, and fundus diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. We review the mechanistic basis of these technologies, their translational potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional therapies, and ocular-specific challenges such as optimizing bioavailability and intraocular target selectivity. Central to this discussion is the role of advanced linker engineering in achieving spatio-temporal control of degradation activity. While barriers to ocular biodistribution and sustained delivery remain, targeted protein degradation represents a paradigm shift in ophthalmology, offering durable therapeutic effects that could significantly improve clinical outcomes and patient compliance through reduced dosing frequency.},

The BG/HPMC films, fabricated by electrospinning with 5 wt% BG incorporated into HPMC matrices, were thoroughly characterized for their structural and bioactive properties. In a rat oral ulcer model, the BG/HPMC films significantly accelerated re-epithelialization and reduced ulcer size compared to both control and chitosan-treated groups.

The key step in nerve regeneration involves the dedifferentiation of Schwann cells into a repair phenotype, followed by their orderly migration to form Büngner bands that guide axonal elongation. However, due to the lack of bioactive factors for stimulation, the repair of current nerve conduits is generally slow. In this study, we designed a bioactive glass microspheres-embedded nerve conduit. The ions released from these microspheres activate c-Jun to induce Schwann cell dedifferentiation. Meanwhile, the microspheres coated onto the conduit surface provide physical anchoring sites, which accelerate integrin- β 1-mediated Schwann cell adhesion and orderly migration to facilitate Büngner bands assembly. This study confirms that dual-function bioactive glass microspheres promote nerve regeneration through ion-regulated dedifferentiation and particle-anchored migration, offering a novel approach for the design of nerve conduits.},

This study explored the radio wave propagation, gamma-ray shielding efficiency, and electrical resistivity of alkali-activated blast furnace slag (BFS-AAM) compared to hydrated Portland cement (PC). BFS-AAM demonstrated superior relative permittivity (ε r ≈ 7.6 at 2.4 GHz) and loss tangent (∼0.33) at lower radio frequencies (0.02–10 GHz), leading to enhanced signal attenuation compared to PC (ε r ≈ 5.6, loss tangent ≈ 0.07). BFS-AAM showed similar performance to PC at frequencies between 10–20 GHz, while its characteristics below 10 GHz make it suitable for secure signal environments. In terahertz spectrum (0.2–2 THz), relevant for 6G wireless communication, both materials displayed comparable permittivity (∼5.3 and ∼4.2) and loss tangent (∼0.09 and ∼0.04), indicating compatibility with residential and commercial applications. Simulations at 0.7, 2.4, and 6.0 GHz confirmed higher signal attenuation by BFS-AAM. Additionally, BFS-AAM exhibited higher resistivity (26–110 Ω·m), greater compressive strength (60 MPa), and lower porosity (∼11 %), contributing to its favorable dielectric properties. Although BFS-AAM demonstrated slightly lower gamma-ray shielding efficiency (at 0.661 MeV) than PC, its multifunctional properties position it as promising material for advanced electromagnetic and radiation shielding technologies.},

Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of complex lattice geometries with customized mechanical properties, making them ideal structures for energy absorption scenarios. However, optimizing these structures to achieve spatially varying density distributions for enhanced performance remains a significant challenge. In this study, a data-driven design framework has been proposed for the AM of energy absorption lattice structures with spatially graded densities. The approach enables the tailoring of geometric parameters, including cell arrangement and strut diameters, to realize variable-density architectures optimized for specific performance requirements. The proposed framework is validated through experimental testing of 3D-printed lattice specimens. Compared to the lattices with uniformly distributed cells, the variable-density structures evidence a 218 % increase in maximum load and a 246 % improvement in specific energy absorption. The finite element analysis and experimental comparisons are used to investigate the influence of relative density gradients on energy absorption performance, peak stress mitigation, and deformation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the data-driven design approach in enabling the fabrication of functionally graded lattice structures with enhanced mechanical performance.},

Results show that γ′ phases exhibit spherical, cubic, or lath-like morphologies, and their average size increases from ∼ 180  nm to ∼ 450  nm after thermal exposure; and superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase gradually precipitate topologically close-packed (TCP) phase.

For superalloys with lower volume fraction of γ′ phase, yield strength decreases from 670  MPa to 505 MPa and ultimate compressive strength from 4690  MPa to 4240 MPa as the γ′ phase coarsens. In contrast, for superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then increases, accompanied by rise in failure strain from 22 % to 46 % after thermal exposure. With increasing loading angle, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then rises, whereas yield strength, failure strain and hardening modulus exhibit more complex trends.

TPU performance was compared with polypropylene–polyethylene copolymer (PPcoPE), the current state-of-the-art binder for Mg alloys. Unlike conventional multi-component systems, the single-backbone TPU eliminates plasticisers, preventing phase separation and enabling stable extrusion at high powder fractions. The absence of plasticisers also suggests that solvent debinding can be bypassed, saving time, cost, and energy while avoiding solvent reactions with Mg. Rheological analysis revealed a unique viscosity-reduction mechanism in TPU, where powder particles disrupt polymer chain entanglements. This effect improves flow at high loadings, while TPU’s cohesive melting profile ensures uniform extrusion and prevents nozzle clogging, unlike the four-step melting of PPcoPE. Preliminary sintering studies between 500 and 700 °C for up to 64 h showed no densification for both binders, probably due to carbonate and oxide surface layers (detected via EDS, XRD, and OPTIR) on Mg-5Ca after debinding, suggesting a change in Mg alloy composition for higher sinterability. These findings highlight TPU’s potential for record-high powder loadings in next-generation powder-based additive manufacturing.},

The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in different types of tumors. The results demonstrated that cRGD-BTZNDs effectively entered cancer cells and exhibited enhanced cytotoxic effects against cancer cells compared to BTZ. Moreover, cRGD-BTZNDs exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy against solid tumors, significantly inhibiting 4 T1 tumor growth while reducing biological toxicity. Additionally, in the treatment of bone metastases, cRGD-BTZNDs demonstrated excellent therapeutic potency, effectively alleviating bone damage in mice with high biocompatibility. This study not only self-assembled nanomaterials with great potential in cancer therapy, but also affirmed the correctness and universality of the Zn(II) coordination peptide self-assembly theory, providing a theoretical basis for the improvement of peptide-based nanomedicine.},

  abstract     = {Ti-15V-3Cr-3Sn-3Al is a metastable-β alloy initially developed to improve cold formability and reduce downstream processing costs compared to hot-forming Ti-6Al-4V. It is primarily used in sheet and welded forms, with secondary applications in castings and forgings. However, high formulation costs and strict process windows reduce expected cost benefits. This study explores an alternative manufacturing route for large-scale components using the available thick wire format (Ø3.0 mm). Ti-15V-3Cr-3Sn-3Al was deposited via plasma-based wire-arc directed energy deposition. Samples were evaluated in two conditions: (1) solution-treated (2) solution-treated and aged. Mechanical testing included tensile and hardness measurements, while microstructural analysis used a broad range of techniques. Deformation behaviour and fracture surfaces were also examined. The β-phase microstructure in the as-built condition contained α GB at grain boundaries, which dissolved during solution treatment, leaving a fully β-phase matrix. Aging resulted in the precipitation of fine α-laths, providing expected strengthening. In this condition, the material achieved an ultimate tensile strength > 1150 MPa and failure strain > 6 %, with anisotropy observed only in ductility. In the solution-treated condition, continuous softening was observed during tensile testing. This study provides insight into properties of Ti-15V-3Cr-3Sn-3Al in additive manufacturing, laying the groundwork for alternative processing routes for titanium alloys.},

  abstract     = {Processing Cu-Zn alloys (brass) using fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques presents significant challenges due to volatile elements and the inherently high thermal conductivity of these alloys. Addressing these issues often demands increased energy input, modifications to laser systems, and compositional adjustments to mitigate zinc loss. However, such solutions are complex and remain in the early stages of development. In contrast, Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD), a solid-state AM technique, offers a promising alternative to overcome these limitations. This study represents a pioneering effort to deposit dual-phase brass (Cu-40Zn) using a closed-loop temperature-controlled AFSD. The influence of processing temperature (ranging from 0.38 to 0.61 T p /T m ) on microstructural evolution and mechanical performance was systematically investigated along the build and longitudinal direction. The resulting microstructure was predominantly governed by dynamic recrystallization and post-dynamic recrystallization (P-DRX) due to repeated thermal cycles. The as-deposited brass exhibited a balanced strength-ductility combination, with yield strength ranging from 215 to 437 MPa and elongation from 34 % to 67 %. Tensile properties in longitudinal and build directions revealed that grain boundary strengthening was the primary mechanism for improving the mechanical performance. The as-deposited properties were comparable to those of wrought counterparts, thus highlighting the potential of AFSD for fabricating high-performance brass components.},

  abstract     = {Mastering the high-temperature creep behavior of SiC fibers plays pivotal role in designing reinforced ceramic matrix composites. Creep viscoelastic behavior is activated at higher temperatures due to complicated interactive coordination between grain interiors and grain boundaries. This study investigated the tensile creep behaviors at different generations of SiC fibers under conditions of various stress and temperatures. The creep recovery behaviors after unloading exhibits the viscoelastic nature, which comes from the possible motion of amorphous phase near massive grain boundaries. It is driven by the release of elastic energy of the grain boundary, evidenced by frequency shifts in Raman spectroscopy. Then classical diffusion creep theory is modified to a viscoelastic model incorporating physical parameters such as the elasticity, viscosity, and threshold stress for SiC fibers. The proposed equations have been well supported by creep test results. The viscosity and elasticity parameters decrease with increasing temperature, the latter being more sensitive. 3rd generation fiber exhibits higher viscosity and elasticity, explaining better creep resistance. The model can evaluate the elastic and plastic contributions and predict creep results at higher temperatures. This work helps to understand high-temperature SiC fiber creep, and to guide optimizing fiber-reinforced composites.},

Water is a reliable and sufficient resource for future clean energy generation, as it can be used to enhance photovoltaic performance in a hybrid system. This study designs and investigates a novel aqua-voltaic hybrid solar cell by integrating an ultra-thin gallium oxide layer (2.3 nm) with a polycrystalline silicon solar cell under water-based conditions. The amorphous Ga 2 O 3 layer grown by sputtering enhances optical absorption, reduces surface reflectance in the ultraviolet (UV) region, and serves as a protective barrier against environmental degradation. Photovoltaic characterisations reveal an efficiency enhancement from 19.04 % to 21.56 % in Si solar cell when Ga 2 O 3 and water are introduced. Under illumination, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) exhibits capacitance and resistance, indicating strong interfacial charge dynamics. These phenomena are attributed to electronic double-layer capacitance, quantum capacitance modulation, and charge redistribution at the Ga 2 O 3 -water interface. The results illustrate the dual role of water in enhancing charge transport while influencing surface-state interactions, leading to improved solar cell performance.

The laser-irradiated area exhibited a conical molten zone, predominantly composed of sapphire with a small amount of Invar alloy particles. No new phases were detected in the joint region, and the primary joining mechanism was identified as mechanical interlocking and embedding. After optimizing the nanosecond laser welding parameters, the joint’s shear strength reached 123.2 MPa. Additionally, the sealed sapphire/Invar alloy samples welded by nanosecond laser passed a 336-hour water resistance test without any leakage.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of TiN x films with 1.18 ≤ x ≤ 1.37 reveal additional N 1s spectral components at lower binding energies. Ab initio calculations predict that these components are caused by either Ti vacancies, which induce an N 1s BE shift of − 0.54 eV in their first N neighbors, and/or N tetrahedral interstitials, which have their N 1s BE shifted by − 1.18 eV and shift the BE of their first N neighbors by − 0.53 eV. However, based on ab initio data the tetrahedral N interstitial is estimated to be unstable at room temperature. We, therefore, unambiguously attribute the N 1s spectral components at lower BE in Ti-deficient TiN x thin films to the presence of Ti vacancies. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the vacancy concentration in Al-capped Ti-deficient TiN x can be quantified with the proposed correlative method based on measured and predicted BE data.

Ultrasonic temperature sensors (UTS) are widely used in high-temperature sensing due to their extreme operating temperature close to the melting point of the waveguide materials. In this work, YAG single-crystal fibers (SCF) with spatially distributed acoustic reflection microstructures have been successfully fabricated via the laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) method and employed as acoustic waveguides. Herein, anisotropic acoustic waveguide behaviors were revealed in YAG SCF, where the [110]-oriented YAG SCF demonstrates enhanced unit sensitivity with the S-wave polarization direction of [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ], primarily attributed to the lower acoustic velocity and the more substantial velocity variations with temperature. Furthermore, quasi-distributed ultrasonic temperature sensing in the range of 30-1800℃ has been achieved based on the [110]-oriented YAG SCF with two discrete sensing units, reaching the maximum unit sensitivities of 47.18 ns·℃ -1 ·m - 1 and an optimal temperature resolution of 5.04℃ at 1800℃. Superior acoustic waveguide characteristics, a wide working temperature range, and the positive temperature-dependent sensor performance suggest that the [110]-oriented microstructured YAG SCF is an ideal candidate for distributed high-temperature sensing in harsh environments.},

In recrystallization–controlled regime of TMCP, successive rolling passes facilitate microstructural refinement through dynamic and static restoration mechanisms. This work illustrates static recrystallization (SRX) characteristics and kinetics in three ASS alloys designed by varying N, Mn and Nb contents. Interrupted (double–hit) compression tests were conducted to characterize the flow behaviour and microstructural evolution across different deformation conditions. SRX kinetics were formulated using a fractional–softening framework, where the time to 50 % recrystallization was correlated with strain, strain rate, temperature, and initial grain size. While the exponents of strain (−3.1) and strain rate (−0.3) were consistent across all compositions, the apparent activation energies of SRX varied in the range 251.5–298 kJ·mol −1 , with 7 wt% Mn showing a more noticeable effect in comparison with 0.1 wt% Nb. Detailed metallographic analysis confirmed the accuracy of the derived models. Suitable semi-empirical relations were established enabling prediction of statically recrystallised grain size across various processing conditions. These results define the processing windows needed to design TMCP schedules for advanced ASSs for LH 2 and cryogenic environments.},

Moreover, a dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network for monitor healing over time was developed. As proof of concept, this algorithm was tested on a cancer cell line stimulated by TGF-β, a drug stimulating cell migration.

In this study, AJ printed traces with different print speed (0.3–20 mm/s) under commonly used deposition rate values (0.0002, 0.0004 and 0.0006 mm 3 /s) were examined. After evaluating the corresponding morphology and conductivity of the printed traces, the optimal print speed range of each deposition rate was determined as follows: deposition rate of 0.0002 mm 3 /s as 0.3–1.5 mm/s, 0.0004 mm 3 /s as 0.7–4 mm/s, and 0.0006 mm 3 /s as 1–6 mm/s, respectively. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is proposed to elucidate the fundamental aerodynamic behaviors of AJ printed traces under different deposition rate, and its trends align with experimental observations. The mechanism by which print speed influences conductivity was analyzed, revealing that internal porosity is the primary factor reducing conductivity at low print speed. The analysis of morphology, conductivity, and printing efficiency across various print modes revealed that the morphology of printed traces under the respective deposition rate and print speed combination remained consistent in single-layer printing. Notably, printing efficiency is substantially enhanced at elevated deposition rate and high print speed. Compared to multi-layer printing at low deposition rate, high deposition rate single-layer printing emerges as the optimal method for achieving superior efficiency and conductivity. Ultimately, a correlation was established between resistance, print speed, and deposition rate, that enabling the successful printing of 15 resistors with specific resistance values (20 Ω) for different geometries, within an average error of 5.9 %, thereby broadening the applicability of AJ printing in printed electronics.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-fiber reinforced polymers are widely used in additive manufacturing for high-performance composites. However, the aerospace and automotive sectors seek lighter materials compatible with practical processing methods. This study introduces hollow carbon fibers (HCFs) with a honeycomb cross-section as lightweight reinforcements in composites, fabricated via direct ink writing. The printability, mechanical performance, and microstructural features of HCF-based composites were systematically evaluated. Rheological testing showed that HCF-based inks exhibit similar pre-printing properties to conventional, densified carbon fiber (DCF) inks. However, mechanical tests revealed superior strength in traditional DCF composites due to differences in fiber morphology, density, and diameter. Microstructural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical microscopy indicated comparable fiber alignment, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed complete epoxy infiltration in HCF channels, evidenced by the pullout of cured epoxy strands. While fiber–matrix interlocking was expected to enhance strength, weak bonding within HCF interiors contributed to reduced mechanical strength. Despite lower strength, HCFs offer advantages for applications prioritizing weight reduction, thermal insulation, or fluid permeability, such as lightweight aerospace and automotive components, thermal management systems, and filtration media. The hollow structure also enables integration with functional materials for smart materials and energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Graphene aerogels (GAs), a class of three-dimensional porous structures, are limited by a fundamental challenge: low thermal conductivity stemming from high interfacial resistance between constituent layers and structural defects. This study systematically investigates a strategy to enhance thermal transport properties by engineering the interlayer bonding via platinum atomic layer deposition (Pt-ALD) and compares it with conventional high-temperature annealing (1873 K). The Pt-ALD-modified graphene aerogel (GA-ALD) exhibited a 199 % increase in thermal conductivity, significantly surpassing the 113 % enhancement from heat treatment. SEM, Raman, XRD, XPS, and FTIR data explicitly indicate that Pt-ALD forms covalent Pt O C bonds that bridge adjacent graphene layers while preserving the original porous morphology. Owing to the synergistic effect of enhanced solid-phase thermal conductivity and efficient convective heat transfer through the preserved porous structure, the GA-ALD sample achieved a total thermal resistance comparable to that of an equal-sized aluminum heat sink under identical forced-convection conditions, while weighing only ∼12 % of its aluminum counterpart. Moreover, cyclic compressive tests confirmed GA-ALD durability, retaining 99.5 % height and 94.7 % stress after 1000 cycles. These findings demonstrate that interfacial bond engineering via ALD is a powerful route to ultralight, high-performance carbon aerogels for weight-sensitive thermal-management applications.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is poised to revolutionize the manufacturing of high-value metallic materials, allowing for intricate, geometrically complex designs while minimizing material waste. The primary challenge lies in formulating alloys compatible with L-PBF that also maintain properties suitable for the demanding conditions encountered in energy, space, and nuclear applications. We introduce a category of high strength, defect-resistant octonary CoNi-based high entropy superalloy (CoNi-HESA), comprising roughly equal parts of Co and Ni, along with Cr, Al, V, Ti, Ta, and W. This alloy exhibits as-printed tensile strength exceeding 1 GPa and tensile ductility exceeding 30 % at room temperature. Furthermore, compression tests demonstrate that the as-printed parts maintain a yield strength of about 1 GPa at room temperature up to 700 °C, which decreases to 0.9 GPa and 0.7 GPa as the test temperature reaches 800 °C and 900 °C, respectively. With a careful combination of laser powder and scan speed, the developed HESA is well-suited for crack-resistant, high-density component production through L-PBF. Alloy design principles are elucidated through CALPHAD calculations based on the high entropy alloy (HEA) database, including the structure and properties of L-PBF processed CoNi-HESA.},

Here, we chose Zr 45 Ti 15 Nb 20 Ta 20 alloy with a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure as a matrix and added a small amount of Al to promote a unique spinodal decomposition. The results show that the introduction of Al-X negative mixing enthalpy induces the RHEAs spinodal decomposition to form a nanocubic structure in the form of a basket-like fabric morphology with a characteristic periodicity of 12 nm. Nanocubic structures consist of (Nb, Ta)-rich cubes and Zr-rich channels as well as generate strong localized strain fields at the interfaces. Spinodal decomposition strengthening enables the as-cast RHEA to achieve a yield strength of 1405 MPa. Periodically distributed nanostructures make dislocations move slowly, causing plugging and cross-slip, facilitating dislocation interactions, multiplication, and accumulation. In summary, the chemical heterostructure produced by spinodal decomposition has been remarkably effective in improving the strength of RHEAs.},

  abstract     = {Eutectic high-entropy alloys (EHEAs) have attracted considerable interest due to their superior multifunctional performance. However, the inherent tendency of stress concentration at irregular phase boundaries frequently leads to premature fracture. This study presents a facile hot-rolling strategy to achieve synergistic strength-ductility enhancement in AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 EHEA via constructing a hierarchical hetero-lamellar structure (HHLS). Through controlled per-pass rolling reduction (PPRD), we induce strain-partitioning-mediated microstructural refinement in the hot-rolled EHEA and activate synergistic deformation mechanisms including stacking faults, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and deformation twinning. The resultant HHLS (aligned FCC/B2 lamellae, partially recrystallized FCC regions, and intragranular B2 precipitates) triggers pronounced hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) strengthening. Consequently, the EHEA with HHLS exhibits exceptional properties: yield strength of 1202 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1489 MPa, and uniform elongation of 11.5 %, which are 112 %, 45 %, and 6 % higher than those of the as-cast alloy, respectively. The superior properties originate from HDI effect and FCC phase-mediated deformation mechanisms, which enable the EHEA to maintain exceptional work-hardening rate despite high dislocation density, effectively delaying plastic instability. These findings not only establish a readily implementable thermomechanical processing strategy for EHEAs, but also provide a novel paradigm for improving mechanical properties, paving the way for their application in high-performance structural materials.},

The residual stress of the electroplated copper layer and the cure shrinkage of the photo-imageable dielectric (PID) were evaluated using bi-layer beam specimens designed based on Timoshenko beam theory. To analyze the mechanism of residual stress generation in the copper layer, the grain size was quantified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was measured using a thermomechanical analyzer (TMA). Warpage and thermal fatigue reliability were evaluated under varying electroplating current densities and post-annealing conditions. These experimental results were validated by comparing them with stress analysis data obtained through finite element analysis (FEA). In the RDL structure, the optimized current density condition effectively reduced the residual tensile stress in the electroplated copper layer and improved both warpage and thermal fatigue life. In addition, the post-annealing relieved cure shrinkage-induced stress in the PID, enhancing the reliability of the RDL structure.

The LP observations are validated by correlative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) carried out in air atmosphere. With the decreasing O incorporation in the MAX phase, an increase in the oxidation temperature was observed from 450 °C to 780 °C.

Current research is hindered by the lack of robust physiological models to evaluate the mechanical interactions between catheter materials and urethral tissue during intermittent catheterisation. This study introduces the first ex vivo porcine urethral model to investigate tribological performance and material-tissue interactions during intermittent catheter (IC) use, enabling more informed catheter design. We examined four commercial hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated ICs and a coating-free integrated amphiphilic surfactant (IAS) IC. ICs were inserted into porcine urethras using a texture analyser, held for two minutes, and withdrawn while measuring force and work done. Post-catheterisation, urethras were examined for microtrauma. Three of four PVP-coated catheters required significantly greater withdrawal force compared to the IAS catheter, correlating with increased urethral transitional membrane damage post-catheterisation. Ex vivo findings suggest that IAS catheters may lower the risk of complications compared with PVP-coated catheters in intermittent catheterisation. This study provides a new platform for comprehensive evaluation of IC-tissue interactions. It underscores the importance of tribological design in medical devices, aiding future innovation in device design and ultimately improve the QOL of patients undergoing intermittent catheterisation.},

Efficient EH requires maximizing focused wave intensity, typically achieved by tuning the GRIN PnCs unit-cell shape. However, existing designs often exhibit energy concentration near the GRIN lens boundary and incorporate narrow gaps and sharp corners, making them susceptible to manufacturing errors and limiting their practical applicability. Understanding the potential performance changes caused by manufacturing errors is important because geometrical alterations can compromise wave-focusing performance. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the unit-cell shape toward maximum focused intensity at the desired locations for EH devices. To assess manufacturability, the effects of minor geometric variations on the focal position and focused intensity are evaluated via a sensitivity analysis. The optimal shape is derived using a deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model trained to predict focal position and focused intensity. This model accelerates a genetic algorithm (GA) used to perform the optimization. Our optimized designs exhibit 1.5 to 2.0 times higher focused intensity across the target focal positions compared with the conventional design. Thus, these optimal shapes, along with their sensitivity analysis results, provide practical guidelines for defining manufacturing tolerances and achieving consistent, efficient EH performance.},

  abstract     = {A natural crack exhibits a surrounding stress field, which may overlap considerably with a stress field caused by any material inhomogeneity, influencing the crack driving force and extension direction. To utilize this effect for potentially increasing the apparent toughness, a defined pore is introduced near a potential crack path, whereby upon interaction, the crack tip can be deflected or trapped, depending on the intermediate distance. Since fundamental mechanics is well-known, a miniaturized notched bending specimen geometry incorporating a pore was selected to investigate the application potential for parts manufactured via multi-photon lithography. The size regime is representative of the smallest available objects and requires in situ SEM testing, which was completed with finite element modeling based on crack path prediction through analyzing the local crack driving force. The high dimensional repeatability of the process allowed for testing reliably reproduced specimens with variation of crack to pore distance only. The prediction represented the actual crack paths well, underlining successfully facilitated crack path alteration. The toughness was mainly increased by crack trapping within the pore, where deflection had a quantitatively negligible effect.},

However, conventional homogeneous modeling often oversimplifies internal microstructural variations and limits the accuracy of stress prediction, especially under thermal cycling. In this study, a region-refined modeling framework is proposed to account for epoxy-regulated porosity and mechanical inhomogeneity across the joint. Pressureless die-attach joints were prepared using submicron silver pastes with varying epoxy contents (0∼4 wt%). The joint was divided into five sub-regions from the center to the fillet for localized characterization. Nanoindentation, SEM, and EDS analyses were conducted to assess region-specific mechanical properties and microstructure. Power-law constitutive models were extracted for each region and implemented into finite element simulations of thermal cycling (−55 ∼ 150 °C, 2 cycles/h, 250 h). The sub-region FEM model more accurately captured local stress concentrations and identified failure-prone areas, particularly near the fillet, compared to conventional homogeneous models. Experimental validation confirmed a good correlation between simulated stress zones and observed degradation. This sub-region strategy provides a robust framework for reliability prediction and design optimization of sintered silver joints in high-performance, large-area packaging applications.},

  abstract     = {Design strategies for β -Ti alloys either aim at the suppression of the diffusion-assisted, isothermal ω i s o precipitation or at the controlled transformation of these precipitates into α phase by an ω -assisted route, with the kinetics of ω i s o formation playing an essential role in both cases. Therefore, controlling the ω i s o formation is pivotal in the design of β -Ti alloys with targeted properties. We propose that by controlling the Sn content added to β -Ti alloys a wide range of achievable microstructures for modulus engineering is accessible. Upon Sn addition, we observe an exponentially slowed down ω i s o formation based on blocking of diffusion pathways for the β -stabiliser atoms without the transformation being thermodynamically inhibited. This suppression of ω i s o formation allows the β -Ti alloys to maintain a lower elastic modulus necessary for biomedical applications. Furthermore, as byproduct, reducing the number density of ω i s o precipitates upon Sn addition also impedes the ω -assisted α -formation, while the Sn-free forms fine, acicular intragranular α plates and α G B side-plates with similar morphology after low temperature pre-ageing. These results provide solid evidence for the previously proposed Sn-induced kinetic deceleration and suggest that the mechanical properties can be tailored as required by the application by tuning the ω i s o precipitation kinetics using Sn.},

The bi-material lattice is designed by filling the metal lattice with epoxy material. By this way, the stiffness of the bi-material lattice is guaranteed, and the effect of vibration absorption is realized at the same time. Different from the traditional proportional damping method of single-material structure, the non-proportional damping model is used for the bi-material lattice structure. The homogenization method is used to calculate the equivalent complex modulus of the lattice. An inverse method is proposed in this paper to obtain the loss factor of in-situ epoxy material filled in the metal lattice.

While pharmacotherapy remains a mainstay of pain management, its utility is limited by adverse side effects and the potential for dependency. Acupuncture has shown great potential in pain management through its ability to induce analgesic effects via acupoint stimulation. However, its poor specificity and ill-defined stimulation parameters compromise therapeutic specificity and reproducibility. Herein, we developed a biomaterial-based acupoint activation strategy for pain management. Adhesive polydopamine-coated hydrogel microspheres were fabricated using microfluidic techniques for accurate attachment and activation of acupoints. Adhesive hydrogel microspheres loaded with adenosine can slowly release exogenous adenosine at the ST36 acupoint to simulate the analgesic effect of acupuncture. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that single-dose administration of adhesive microspheres can effectively target acupoints, elevate mechanical pain thresholds, and provide systemic anti-inflammatory effects for up to 7 days. Overall, the proposed adhesive hydrogel microsphere system offers a new perspective on acupuncture practice and pain management.},

By depositing material only where it's needed, it drastically reduces waste material and energy use, obtaining a sustainability advantage that is further enhanced on larger scale. However, a deeper understanding of material recycling is critical to achieving the next milestone in sustainability. In this work, a methodology was proposed that uses both molds and final parts, manufactured in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene reinforced with short glass fibers (ABS-GF), which had reached the end of their useful life to be used as feedstock. It is observed that recycling reduces fiber length by 47.3%, which directly impacts the mechanical properties in the longitudinal printing direction, resulting in around a 9% decrease in maximum tensile stress. However, this reduction falls to 5.1% in the transverse direction to the printing, and in some cases, the recycled material even surpasses the virgin material due to improved interlayer adhesion. An analysis on the adhesion reveals that the shorter monomer chains obtained during recycling allow better interlacing between layers. These results suggest that the reuse of the molds is viable and by adjusting the printing parameters we can obtain properties suitable for demanding applications.},

The resultant lack of design fidelity and toolpath dependent anisotropy has been found to negatively impact structural performance if not accounted for in the design. This paper addresses both characteristics in the design process of cellular material architectures by expanding upon the Nozzle Constrained Topology Optimization algorithm and experimentally validating the results against a typical baseline. An experimental method of deriving bond region material properties is detailed. A direct toolpath generation method from topology optimized results is proposed. Comparisons are made with conventional topology optimization design methods and performance is measured both experimentally and numerically against theoretical bounds. At relative densities ≤ 70 % , designs with nozzle constraints were able to more closely align numerical and experimental results for both performance and design fidelity (measured by relative density). In contrast, conventional topology optimized designs had higher overall performance, but little alignment between intended design and resultant experimental result. Typical designs consistently overdeposited material and inconsistently predicted performance.},

A large-scale simulation campaign across eight isotropic material models and 42,669 configurations identifies the arch rise-to-radius ratio as the dominant factor in post-forming thickness evolution, with non-uniform profiles causing up to deviations in rupture pressures and altering failure modes compared to uniform assumptions. Modal, buckling, and rupture analyses highlight significant impacts on natural frequencies, critical loads, and mechanisms. Experimental validation on 36 Monel Alloy 400 rupture discs achieves high accuracy, with thickness root-mean-square error of (maximum mean absolute percentage error ) and rupture pressure errors below , supported by uncertainty analysis (expanded uncertainties at confidence).

More crucially, existing research predominantly focused on nanopore diameter, neglecting other geometric characteristics (alignment, texture/roughness) on soft-tissue cells that impeded optimized TNPs design for ideal soft-tissue integration. This study showed nanopore dimensions were voltage-dependent on micro-patterned Ti but remain stable on smooth counterparts. Varied TNPs with similar diameters but different alignment/roughness were selected and identified with similar chemistry/hydrophilicity, but their protein adhesion and stability were length-dependent, showing their feasibility as implant devices. Finally, human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and HaCaT epithelial cells functions on varied selected TNPs reflected that nanopores inherently promoted cell responses, but hybrid microgroove-nanopores dramatically enhanced HGF’s collagen and fibronectin secretion, while irregular textured nanopores significantly improved HaCaT adhesion.

Systematic loading experiments were performed on unconfined shale fractures using a six-dimensional rock pressure detection and displacement monitoring system. High-resolution three-dimensional point cloud datasets of fracture surfaces were acquired via laser profilometry, while pressure-sensitive films were employed to quantitatively map contact behavior under varying normal stresses. Spatial integration of point cloud data with pressure-sensitive film measurements demonstrated that initial contact occurs preferentially at asperities with elevated heights. A wear distribution model was constructed by computationally aligning and subtracting pre- and post-loading topographic datasets. Mesh-based analytical methods identified a robust correspondence between extreme wear loci and regions of concentrated contact stress. The steady-state wear rate of shale fractures followed a power-law relationship with normal stress, consistent with micromechanical wear theories. Statistical evaluation of 3D surface topography parameters revealed that the root-mean-square height ( S q ) displayed significant correlations (Pearson’s r > 0.85, p < 0.01) with mechanical metrics.

Certain numerical studies highlighted a possible influence of powder particle size on the velocity condition at the nozzle exit, yet no experimental studies confirmed this effect. The experimental campaign described in this paper quantifies this relation between powder particle size and velocity distribution at the nozzle outlet and a strong decrease of particle speed with particle size is observed. Moreover, smaller particles are observed to travel at speeds higher than the mean carrier gas speed suggesting powder particle segregation within the nozzle as one of the mechanisms driving speed differences at the nozzle outlet.},

  abstract     = {The design of specified nonlinear mechanical responses into a structure or material is a highly sought after capability, with significant potential impacts in areas such as wave tailoring in metamaterials, impact mitigation, soft robotics, and biomedicine. Here, we present a topology optimization approach to design two-dimensional structures for desired uniaxial polynomial nonlinear behavior, wherein we formulate the objective function to match nonlinear coefficient ratios, such that the linear stiffness is decoupled from the desired nonlinearity of the response. We suggest that such linear stiffness decoupling can help aid convergence for problems with fixed, but poorly matched, constituent materials and design volumes. This benefit can be understood by considering, if large absolute force values and stiffnesses are targeted, thicker structures with less open space generally result. Such high volume ratio structures reduce the kinematic freedom (available to, e.g. , long thin structures) which is needed for strong geometrically nonlinear responses. We show designs achieved using this approach that match a range of qualitatively different polynomial behaviors with high precision, which are of interest, in particular, within the domain of dynamical systems where nonlinear elasticity of relatively simple polynomial forms can confer greater analytical tractability.},

  abstract     = {Pressurized gyration allows the scaled-up production of polymeric fibre under the simultaneous application of pressure and rotation. This study investigates the influence of orifice design on fibre formation and production rate in pressurized gyration, aiming to optimize the technique for industrial-scale applications. Transparent vessels with varying orifice heights (7.5 mm, 15 mm, and 22.5 mm), orifice numbers (24 and 48), and dual-level orifice distributions were fabricated and tested under pressures of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa. Morphological analysis showed that fibre diameter decreased from 2.2 µm to 1.8 µm when pressure was raised from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa when increasing the number of orifices to 48. Two-level orifice designs yielded mixed diameter distributions, enabling tunable fibre architectures. High-speed imaging revealed that the 7.5 mm orifice height achieved fluid ejection 7.5 % faster than 22.5 mm at 0.1 MPa and increasing pressure from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa reduced ejection time by up to 33 %. Production rate increased with more orifices (48 compared to 24), by 9.8 % at 0.2 MPa, and declined at higher pressure for vessels with dual-level designs. Overall, the findings provide quantitative insights into how vessel geometry influences fibre morphology and throughput in pressurized gyration systems.},

  abstract     = {Despite excellent oxidative properties of the Alloy 718 Ni-based superalloy, long-term exposure to oxidative environments in service creates a chemical gradient in the sub-surface affected by oxidation. Its characterization is key to assessing the evolving mechanical behavior of such affected materials. The present study focuses on the γ '- γ ” precipitation depletion induced by the chemical gradient and benchmarks micro-mechanical testing techniques to assess local mechanical properties. Local techniques such as nanoindentation and micro-pillar compression were used to measure both elastic and plastic properties of a pre-oxidized Alloy 718 Ni-based superalloy, having a chemical gradient. These results were compared to a global approach by tensile testing and high resolution-digital image correlation (HR-DIC) on model materials corresponding to regions of the chemical gradient: the solid-solution and the precipitation-hardened Alloy 718. The plastic behavior was investigated in terms of macroscopic yield strength and slip activity. Results obtained by the local and global techniques were found to be different but complementary. The relevance of the association of multiple micro-mechanical tests and sample preparation techniques to probe chemical gradients is discussed and technique advantages and drawbacks are exposed based on the single crystalline or polycrystalline nature of the micro-mechanical testing.},

  abstract     = {Multi-functional materials are increasingly essential in many applications due to their ability to serve multiple purposes, simultaneously. Metamaterials can offer tailored functionality based on carefully designed tessellating basic building blocks, or unit cells, in space. These unit cells are most commonly designed for a single objective, for example, to mitigate an impact, insulate sound, or dampen vibrations. However, a metamaterial that can mitigate impact, attenuate elastic vibrations, insulate airborne sound, while being ultra-light and ultra-stiff remains elusive. Here, we present three gyroid-based metamaterial designs, which are numerically and experimentally examined, that can simultaneously serve all these functions in all directions. Our designs have band gaps reaching 60 % with as low as 367 Hz starting band gap frequency, while being up to 77 % lighter than a homogeneous block of the same material. Our findings highlight the potential of metamaterials for applications that require wave manipulation, mechanical resilience, and impact mitigation with limited mass and volume, simultaneously.},
