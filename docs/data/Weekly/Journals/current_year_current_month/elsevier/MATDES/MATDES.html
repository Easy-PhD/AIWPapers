The solidification microstructure and the type of silicide show strong dependence on Si content from 1 % to 15 %, with the former changing from hypoeutectic to hypereutectic structure, and the latter evolving from M 3 Si-type to tetragonal-M 5 Si 3 -type silicide, and finally to the co-existence of both tetragonal- and hexagonal- M 5 Si 3 -type silicide. The formation of silicide phase enhances the strength both at the ambient and elevated temperatures, and a significant improvement of peak compressive strength from 221.3 MPa to 511.59 MPa at 800℃ was obtained after alloying 15 % Si to the prototype TiZrHfNb alloy. It was found that heterodeformation-induced strengthening, resulting from dislocation pile-ups at phase boundaries, was responsible for the enhancement in the strength. During hot deformation, the flow stress begins to decrease after reaching the peak value due to the presence of the dynamic recovery and dynamic recrystallization, which becomes more pronounced at higher Si content.},

  abstract     = {To improve the applications of indium tin oxide (ITO) films, higher measurement requirements are implemented due to the significant effects of more complicated stress states and limitations of testing conditions on the mechanical properties. In this work, the effect of the tip bluntness on indentation responses and scaling relationships for film/substrate composite systems is investigated via finite-element (FE) simulations and dimensional analysis. A novel indentation method is proposed to measure the intrinsic elastic modulus of thin films based on the scaling relationship among the curvature of the loading segment in P - h curves and material properties. FE simulations indicate the significant effect of tip bluntness on indentation responses. However, the curvature is essentially independent of the dimensionless parameter of h m / t . Furthermore, the tilt effect during the direct calibration procedure is corrected through spatial mapping transformation of atomic force microscopy data. Herein, the measured tip rounding radius fitted by 2D profile and 3D topography are 70 ± 4.8 nm and ∼72.83 nm, respectively. The indentation data acquired with the actual Berkovich indenter are used to verify the scaling relationships. The elastic modulus of ITO films is calculated as ∼135.26 GPa, and the measured error is only ∼3.59 %.},

Here, we report a photothermally responsive nanoplatform, (ZWMx), engineered via hydrothermal synthesis to integrate efficient photothermal conversion, reactive oxygen species generation, and bacterial membrane disruption. The composite leverages the broad absorption in the near infrared region and excellent electrical conductivity of tungsten carbide MXene to overcome the photoinstability of ZnO, achieving a photothermal conversion efficiency of approximately 29.78 % and strong catalytic activity through reactive oxygen species. Upon irradiation at 808 nm, ZWMx rapidly eliminates over 90 % of MRSA in vitro within five minutes and disrupts established biofilms, indicating a synergistic and multifaceted bactericidal mechanism. In vivo , ZWMx promotes near-complete healing of MRSA-infected wounds within twelve days, with minimal thermal damage to surrounding tissues, high biocompatibility, and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor one, suggesting enhanced angiogenesis. These findings establish a light-responsive therapeutic strategy for the targeted elimination of drug-resistant infections and effective stimulation of wound repair, providing a promising alternative to conventional antibiotic therapies.},

  abstract     = {Graphene has excellent electronic mobility, high electrical conductivity, and strong thermal conductivity. These properties make it suitable for use in electronic devices, sensors, and energy storage systems. However, current methods for producing graphene films face several problems. They are often expensive, require specific substrates, and have low success rates during transfer. These issues limit the large-scale use of graphene films. In this study, we propose a low-cost method to prepare graphene films. The method uses a flexible polyimide (PI) mask. Laser etching is used to create specific patterns on the PI mask. Then, a printing technique is applied to deposit graphene films onto quartz substrates. Compared to traditional approaches, this method is cheaper, works with various substrates. We used systematic characterization to evaluate the method. The results show that it can produce uniform and high-quality graphene films. We also studied the effects of film thickness, substrate treatment, and vacuum annealing on film performance. Hydrophilic treatment improves the dispersion of the graphene slurry. This helps the film become more uniform and improves its adhesion to the substrate. Vacuum annealing removes some dopants and makes the film cleaner. This method provides a promising solution for low-cost and large-scale production of graphene films.},

However, systematic investigations of its effects on melt-pool dynamics, temperature field and microstructure are still required. In this work, we propose an integrated approach combining a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, in-situ temperature measurements and metallographic analysis to explore programmable ring beam profiles, ranging from Gaussian-dominant to ring-dominant configurations. This method, initially proposed on Ti-6Al-4V bead-on-plate tracks, validates melt-pool temperatures measured in-process by a dual-wavelength pyrometer against CFD predictions, which are in turn validated with metallographic cross-sections. Ring modes lowered peak temperature by up to 35 %, transforming deep-narrow pools (aspect ratio ≈0.9) into shallow-wide ones (≈0.4). This suppressed humping at line energies ≥ 0.28 J mm − 1, whereas lower energies produced only superficial melting. Simulations matched pyrometer data within 5 % whenever pool width equalled the pyrometers’ sensing spot; all tracks solidified into ultrafine α with retained β, independent of beam mode. Therefore, the combination of in-situ, ex-situ and CFD tools offers a practical workflow for assisting data-driven process optimization and can be easily extended to other LMF processes, with its potential implementation in industrial Laser Powder Bed Fusion.},

Piezoelectric scaffolds have shown promise in enhancing muscle repair by converting mechanical cues into bioelectric signals. In this study, we investigate the regenerative potential of electrospun scaffolds composed of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] and polycaprolactone (PCL), with or without cerium dioxide nanoparticles (Ce NPs), in a VML mouse model. Hyaluronic acid functionalization was employed to improve scaffold biocompatibility. In vitro experiments confirmed the biocompatibility of these scaffolds, while in vivo assessments over eight weeks demonstrated significant efficacy in restoring muscle function. Compared with PCL-Ce scaffolds, mice implanted with piezoelectric scaffolds exhibited faster grip strength recovery, more mature muscle regeneration, a more hierarchical arrangement of muscle fibers, and increased fiber diameter. Additionally, the antioxidant properties of Ce NPs reduced adipocyte infiltration and excessive collagen deposition and were associated with enhanced angiogenesis. Grip strength measurements further highlighted the superior regenerative performance of P(VDF-TrFE) scaffolds combined with Ce NPs. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of piezoelectric scaffolds integrated with antioxidants in promoting structural and functional muscle regeneration following VML.},

The structures were fabricated from 316L stainless steel using laser powder bed fusion and evaluated through quasi-static compression, Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests, and finite element simulations with the Johnson–Cook model. Compared with conventional counterparts of equal mass and thickness, the antiprism tubes achieved 6.4–14 % higher specific energy absorption (SEA), 7–79 % higher crushing force efficiency (CFE), and 7–68 % lower undesired load-carrying capacity (ULC). Under dynamic impact, they also exhibited the lowest initial peak crushing force.

In this cyclic process, the etching steps involving HFE-347mcc3/O 2 /Ar plasmas were alternated with deposition steps involving HFE-347mcc3/Ar plasmas to precisely control the fluorocarbon passivation films on the sidewalls. The effects of the deposition- and etching-step durations on the contact-hole profiles were systematically investigated. Increasing the duration of the deposition step initially improved sidewall protection, thereby significantly reducing bowing and enhancing anisotropy; however, excessively long deposition-step durations caused narrowing. Similarly, the duration of the etching step was optimized to achieve sufficient fluorocarbon-film hardening to prevent bowing while avoiding excessive narrowing. The degree of exposure to fluorocarbon plasma was introduced as a critical parameter to optimize the anisotropy. Under optimized conditions, a nearly vertical and highly anisotropic SiO 2 contact hole having a diameter of 100 nm and an aspect ratio of 24 was successfully obtained with minimal bowing (1 nm). The results revealed that HFE-347mcc3 is a viable and environmentally sustainable alternative to high-GWP PFCs or HFCs and provide both environmental benefits and excellent etching performance.},

The research question focuses on how to rigorously capture large deflections and bending–membrane interactions to establish reliable benchmarks beyond the critical load. A series expansion method within the von Kármán framework is employed to derive analytical solutions with high numerical accuracy. Compared with existing analytical and numerical approaches, the present solutions achieve five to six significant digits of accuracy, representing a substantial improvement in precision and reliability. A comprehensive parametric study demonstrates how varying the biaxial compression ratio influences post-buckling responses, providing deeper insight into boundary-sensitive and load-dependent behaviors. The results establish new analytical benchmarks that can be directly used to validate approximate and numerical methods, thereby improving the robustness of computational models. In addition, they offer practical guidance for the safe and efficient design of thin-walled plate structures in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering.

The developed methodology suggests that the martensite-to-ferrite phase ratio has a stronger impact on damage tolerance than martensite strength, while the elongation of martensite is the dominant parameter for martensite fracture. For the newly introduced phase boundary decohesion indicator, the grain sizes of both phases exhibit the highest influence. A homogenized indicator for overall damage resistance and a trade-off for the two damage mechanisms further revealed the importance of phase morphology, providing insights into additional influencing factors not captured by individual mechanisms. Convergence analyses confirmed that 200–250 datapoints suffice for stable determination of the Sobol indices, confirmed by different surrogate modeling approaches. Radar chart analyses indicated that optimal microstructures for enhanced damage tolerance consist of smaller fractions of strong martensite combined with fine, spheroidal grains in both phases, aligning with established knowledge on DP steels. This approach establishes a validated basis for future optimization of microstructures and loading paths to improve damage tolerance under complex forming conditions.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a topology optimization method for heterogeneous lattice structures subject to stress constraints. The proposed approach extends the ordered SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) framework to incorporate a composite material failure criterion. Specifically, a modified Tsai–Hill yield criterion is employed to characterize the anisotropic yielding behavior of the heterogeneous lattice, which is subsequently integrated into the optimization as a stress constraint. To address the variation in yield strength across different lattice configurations, a normalization strategy is applied to the stress field. Additionally, a P-norm aggregation scheme is introduced to efficiently handle local stress constraints while reducing computational cost. The equivalent elastic tensor and yield strength of each lattice configuration are obtained using a representative volume element (RVE) based on homogenization theory. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a series of 2D cases, achieving lightweight structural designs that satisfy stress constraints. Finally, full-scale mechanical analysis and 3D printing experimental validation further confirm the strength reinforcement of the optimized results.},

  abstract     = {The Cu-Sn alloy system exhibits diverse stable and metastable phases with complex phase transformations, making it attractive for applications requiring tailored mechanical and electrical performance. This study investigates the mechanical response of individual phases during ongoing phase transformations in a Cu-20 m.% Sn alloy. Heat treatments produced large-grained microstructures containing distinct phase combinations in equilibrium and non-equilibrium states. The evolving microstructure was characterized using light optical and scanning electron microscopy. Phase-specific hardness, Young’s modulus, and strain rate sensitivity were determined through room-temperature and high-temperature nanoindentation combined with electron back-scattered diffraction phase mapping, alongside compression testing. This method enables direct quantification of phase properties under phase transformation, separating the contributions of stable and metastable phases. Results reveal how transformation kinetics and solute interactions govern the phase-specific deformation bulk performance, offering new insights into structure–property relationships in Cu-Sn alloys. The methodology provides a framework for phase-specific property characterization in transforming systems, supporting the design of materials with transformation-informed properties optimization.},

A CALPHAD-based pseudo-binary diagram guided the optimization of solidification and annealing conditions, promoting nanoscale coherent precipitate (NCP) formation within each phase. Multiscale analysis (SEM, EPMA, TEM, 3D APT) revealed a dual FCC-phase composite where each region contains NCPs of the other phase. During annealing, secondary NCPs grow more slowly than primary phase-separated regions, enabling effective control through heat treatment. Mechanical testing via nanoindentation and micropillar compression showed that coherent NCPs enhance strength via a shearing mechanism. In particular, LE NCPs in the HE matrix effectively distribute the applied strain and suppress dislocation motion and slip band formation, resulting in stable strain hardening without stress drops. Upon coarsening beyond the size applicable for shearing, transition to the Orowan bypass mechanism resulting in a decrease in nano-hardness. These findings highlight the importance of coherent phase-separated nanostructures in strengthening and deformation control, and present a thermodynamically guided microstructural design strategy for fabricating HEA-based hierarchical nanocomposites with tunable mechanical performance, offering a promising approach for developing next-generation high-strength, ductile structural materials.},

This review introduces the dispersion strategies of CNMs in cementitious composites fabrication procedures before providing a comprehensive summary of the corresponding principles, advantages, limitations, and critical considerations. We also reviewed the latest CNMs dispersion characterization techniques and the dispersion effectiveness evaluation methods. Furthermore, the properties of cementitious composites incorporating CNMs, including workability, mechanical strength, durability, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, are summarized. The impact of dispersion strategies on these properties is analyzed, and potential causes behind performance inconsistencies are discussed. This review found that the current research faces several challenges: the lack of standardized mix proportions and dispersion protocols hinders result comparison, and inconsistent characterization methods, insufficient cost/lifecycle analyses, combined with unclear links between CNMs’ properties and enhancement, collectively limit practicality. Therefore, future works should focus on establishing unified guidelines for production and characterization, conducting cost-sustainability assessments, and clarifying CNMs’ property-performance relations to advance engineering applications.},

However, such assemblies frequently proceed without adequate theoretical guidance on structure–property relationships, hindering precise control and rational design of tailored optical activity. The present study explores automated, data-driven workflows to investigate geometry-dependent optical asymmetry, with the aim of predicting the asymmetry factor (g-factor) of Au NR-helical assemblies and retrieving their geometric features. A forward artificial neural network (ANN) has been developed to predict the g-factor from geometric inputs. Conversely, a combination of ANN with particle swarm optimisation (PSO) has been demonstrated to retrieve geometric parameters necessary to achieve a target g-factor. The findings demonstrate that the forward ANN attains a high level of prediction accuracy ( r = 0.9833), and the inverse ANN-PSO workflow effectively identifies geometries that yield g-factors with a high degree of proximity to the target values. This demonstrates the significant value of these automated workflows for the fundamental geometric design and optical asymmetry prediction of Au NR-helical assemblies.},

However, producing high-strength aluminum alloys with excellent mechanical properties remains hindered by poor printability and complex microstructural control. In this study, an Al-4.79 Mg-1.3Si-0.51Sc-0.27Zr-0.47Mn (wt.%) alloy was developed and processed via SLM. The SLM process-structure-property relationship of this alloy was investigated. Crack-free samples were achieved across a broad process window, indicating excellent crack resistance and adaptability. Good printability and high relative density over 99.5 % can be achieved at a laser power of 200-230 W and scanning speed of 1050 and 1150 mm/s, corresponding to a volumetric energy density (VED) of 60 J/mm 3 -73 J/mm 3 . The increase in the laser energy density promoted the formation of columnar grains and the widening of subgrain structures, and made the Mg 2 Si phase transformed from continuous to discontinuous morphology. The as-printed alloy exhibited 439 MPa tensile strength and 11.3 % elongation, attributed to grain refinement, reduced porosity, and the formation of the high dislocation density, 9R phase, and nanotwin. After aging, strength increased to 483 MPa and elongation decreased to 6.5 %. This study defines the process window and demonstrates a balance between high specific strength and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent degenerative joint disease worldwide. Current therapeutic approaches are limited by rapid drug clearance from the joint cavity, necessitating frequent administrations and failing to provide sustained therapeutic effects. Injectable hydrogels that can persistently remain within the joint space represent a promising strategy for comprehensive OA treatment. Herein, an injectable hydrogel system based on dermal-derived decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) engineered with N-isopropylacrylamide, tannic acid, and sodium tetraborate was developed to achieve superior lubrication and strong tissue adhesion. The hydrogel exhibits exceptional lubrication properties and robust tissue adhesion, enabling prolonged retention within the joint cavity while providing continuous cartilage protection. Its excellent shear-thinning behavior and rapid self-healing capability facilitate minimally invasive injection and ensure conformal coverage of defect sites. In vitro and in vivo evaluations demonstrated that the hydrogel promotes cell proliferation, modulates anti-inflammatory responses, and significantly preserves cartilage integrity with enhanced proteoglycan and type II collagen (COL-2) expression. The sustained therapeutic efficacy was attributed to the hydrogel’s ability to maintain prolonged residence time while continuously delivering bioactive components and providing mechanical lubrication. These findings demonstrate that this multifunctional dECM-based injectable hydrogel represents a promising therapeutic platform for OA treatment suitable for clinical translation.},

This design integrates horizontally oriented chiral alternating ribs and vertically oriented Z-shaped configurations. Two optimized architectures, namely the wave-optimized structure (W-NPR) and the node-enhanced structure (N-NPR), were proposed and compared with the original folded structure (F-NPR). Characterization analysis revealed that the N-NPR structure exhibited superior formability, making it suitable for Digital Light Processing (DLP) fabrication. A parametric study on the mechanical performance of the N-NPR structure demonstrated that an increased volume fraction enhances the mechanical properties at the expense of structural compliance. Uniaxial tensile testing along the XY-plane and Z-axis confirmed the anisotropic Young’s modulus. Experimental and finite element simulations further revealed anisotropic behavior and a unique two-stage rotation-torsion compressive deformation mechanism of N-NPR, which enables advanced mechanical designs by enhancing the degree of freedom for deformation mode conversion.

The evolution of the microstructure, defects, and hardness was investigated using grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentation tests. The GIXRD results showed that diffraction peaks shifted towards lower 2θ values, indicating that lattice swelling was caused by irradiation-induced defects after irradiation at elevated temperatures. According to the TEM observations, the size of the dislocation loops remained nearly constant, while their number density decreased with an increase in irradiation temperature. The precipitation of Cr was not observed in the W-0.3Cr alloy after irradiation at 773 K. In contrast, it was significant in the samples irradiated at temperatures of 1073 and 1273 K, showing increases in both the size and number density of the precipitates. Irradiation hardening was observed in all samples, primarily attributed to the presence of dislocation loops. The hardness change was estimated with the dispersion barrier hardening model by taking into account the contributions of dislocation loops and Cr precipitates. The values evaluated with the model were significantly larger than those obtained with the nanoindentation tests. This difference was ascribed to the depletion of solute Cr atoms from the W matrix by precipitation.},

Thermodynamic calculations guided nitrogen adjustment in the shielding gas to control solidification and develop high-performance microstructures. Thermodynamic–kinetic modeling predicted nitrogen uptake from the arc plasma, enabling gas composition selection to promote a shift from δ-ferrite to γ-austenite as the primary solidification phase. Nitrogen content analysis and Scheil simulations confirmed a transition to austenite-first solidification at approximately 0.7 wt% nitrogen. Electron Backscatter Diffraction and optical microscopy revealed that nitrogen-enriched (HN) samples exhibited a continuous γ-austenitic matrix with finely dispersed δ-ferrite, whereas nitrogen-lean (LN) samples had a δ-ferritic matrix with isolated γ-austenite islands. HN samples showed greater grain orientation spread, indicating increased internal misorientation. Despite pronounced crystallographic texture, the HN samples demonstrated nearly isotropic tensile behavior along with enhanced yield strength, tensile strength, ∼11 % higher hardness, and improved elongation. These findings demonstrate that melt chemistry control via gas-phase alloying enables phase-engineered microstructures with superior mechanical performance without modifying the filler wire.},

  abstract     = {This study presents a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of solid resin prepregs (SRPs) − namely the inability to drape at room temperature and hindered gas evacuation during vacuum-bag-only (VBO) processing − by 3D-printing a regular, uncured solid epoxy resin (SR) pattern on a dry woven textile. The locally patterned resin distribution preserves dry textile regions, enabling room temperature drapeability and more robust VBO-processing due to improved gas evacuation. By adjusting pattern parameters such as element geometry and coverage, the draping behaviour can be controlled to adapt to a desired draping condition. In order to be able to design the right pattern for given draping conditions, the influence of these parameters on bending and shearing was studied. Manual draping showed that bending radii down to 4 mm were achievable, governed only by the element length in bending direction, while coverage had no significant effect. In contrast, picture-frame-tests showed that the shearing is mainly influenced by the coverage and that a maximal shearing angle of 30° can be achieved. These results show that the SRPs bending and shearing can be independently influenced through pattern design. The derived structure–drapeability relationships enable targeted design of SRPs for robust, autoclave-free composite manufacturing.},

  abstract     = {Silver (Ag) sputtering targets are crucial in electronic information materials, particularly with the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has further increased their demand. However, the extremely high reflectivity and poor laser absorption of pure Ag in the infrared range make it challenging to process using conventional laser-based Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems, limiting its wide application. In this study, a novel hatch spacing-to-scanning speed ratio ( h / v )-centered low-energy–density strategy was proposed to overcome this challenge and enable high-quality additive manufacturing of pure Ag. By optimizing the ( h / v ) value to 1.0E-04, we successfully fabricated dense, low-defect Ag sputtering targets without increasing energy input. The results demonstrated that this method significantly shortened the manufacturing cycle and produced high-performance Ag targets with refined grains (3–7 μm), high density (≥99.8 %), a smooth surface (Ra = 11.5 μm), and stable sputtering performance (sputtering rate = 31.8 nm/min). Furthermore, the hardness increased by 45.1 % compared to Ag targets prepared by traditional methods. This work offers a practical pathway for applying laser-based AM in the production of highly reflective metal sputtering targets, advancing their industrialization in thin-film electronics, while also contributing to the understanding of AM process–structure relationships in metallic materials.},

  abstract     = {Organic photodetectors (OPDs) are promising candidates for next-generation optoelectronic devices due to their flexibility, low cost, and scalability. Enhancing OPD performance requires optimizing key layers such as the electron transport layer (ETL) using low-temperature processes to prevent thermal degradation. This study explores the use of low-temperature electron beam annealing (EBA) to improve the performance of Al-doped ZnO (AZO)-based ETLs. The impact of EBA irradiation time (1–8 min) on the structural, morphological, and electrical properties of AZO films was systematically analyzed. EBA effectively modulated oxygen vacancies and reduced surface roughness, lowering trap density and leakage current while enhancing charge transport. An OPD with an ETL treated by 8 min of EBA exhibited superior detectivity (2.22 × 10 13 Jones at 0 V) and significantly reduced leakage current compared to a device with conventionally annealed ETLs. Importantly, the low-temperature EBA process preserved the amorphous state of AZO, making it suitable for heat-sensitive and flexible substrates. These findings demonstrate that EBA is a powerful, scalable method for ETL optimization in OPDs and offers a pathway toward high-performance, energy-efficient, and flexible optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract     = {The extraction of biopolymers using natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) offers a promising approach for developing sustainable and biocompatible materials for biomedical applications. In this study, a novel and environmentally friendly process has been developed for extracting chitin and chitosan from organic Agaricus bisporus ( A. bisporus ) mushrooms, which serves as a readily available and renewable resource. NADES not only enhances the extraction efficiency but also preserves the structural integrity of the biopolymers. The characteristics of these biopolymers were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric (DTG/TGA) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR) techniques. By optimizing the NADES extraction conditions, high-purity chitin (98.58 %) and chitosan (98.69 %) were achieved, surpassing the purity levels achieved by traditional chemical methods. NADES-extracted chitosan exhibited a remarkable degree of deacetylation (DD) of up to 94.22 %, and a crystallinity index (CrI) of up to 61.77 %, highlighting its enhanced functionality for biomedical applications. Moreover, the NADES-derived biopolymers showed excellent biocompatibility with L929 fibroblast cells. They exhibited dose-dependent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) and exhibited promising antioxidant and biodegradability properties.},

A sequence involving silane coupling prior to laser ablation was employed, enabling dual-mode enhancement of the interfacial geometric configuration and chemical bonding. Mechanical interlocking was ensured in laser-ablated zones, whereas the chemical bonding capacity in unablated regions was enhanced. The tensile–shear strength and cross-tension strength of the joints were measured at 32.6 MPa and 3.2 MPa, respectively. Detailed microstructural characterization revealed that mechanical interlocking occurred in the laser-ablated zones of the PA66 resin and that synergistic physicochemical reinforcement was achieved via covalent Al‒O‒Si bonds coupled with molecular chain entanglement/hydrogen bonding in unablated regions. Defect-free continuous interfacial transitions were confirmed through the penetration of nanolamellar structures by amorphous silane films. This synergistic strategy provides new insights for the high-performance joining of dissimilar metal and polymer materials.},

  abstract     = {Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are widely used as ideal high-voltage sources in high-voltage equipment. However, there are still some high-voltage application demands that exceed the voltage range of traditional TENG. Here, we propose a high-voltage rotary freestanding TENG (HRF-TENG) with a simple structure. The HRF-TENG device is obtained by changing the relative positions of the electrode pairs (reducing the capacitance) in the traditional RF-TENG, which is inspired by the finite element (FEM) calculation of the traditional RF-TENG. The high-voltage mechanism is initially studied through FEM calculation and experiments, and the calculated output voltage can reach over 30 kV at 500 rpm. In addition, the current direction remains unchanged regardless of the rotation direction. The ultrahigh voltage from HRF-TENG is sufficient to break down the air gap to generate ozone, which achieves the ozone drinking water sterilization system. Drinking water containing 10 7 CFU/ml of E. coli and S. aureus can be completely sterilized within 24 min and 28 min, respectively. Meanwhile, the electrospinning system can be directly driven by HRF-TENG without any circuit. All of these demonstrations prove the feasibility of HRF-TENG in the field of high-voltage applications. In summary, this work provides useful guidance for designing TENGs for high-voltage applications.},

Developing low dielectric materials with exceptional properties for these devices has become a significant challenge. Thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (TLCP) are promising due to their excellent high-frequency performance, while microcellular foaming technology is commonly used to enhance dielectric properties. In this study, TLCP was modified with ADR and nano-SiO 2 . The synergistic modification introduces long-chain branched structures and nucleation sites, improving matrix performance and optimizing foaming behavior. In addition, long-chain branched TLCP/SiO 2 foam has highly compressive properties, excellent dimensional stability, ultra-low dielectric stability at high frequencies, great flame retardant and wonderful high-temperature infrared thermal stealth performance. It is also found by simulation that the patch antenna with long-chain branched TLCP/SiO 2 foam substrate has excellent signal transmission performance. The transmission distance up to 4793 m, which is 5.8 times higher than pure TLCP before foaming, which presents a novel solution for high-frequency and high-speed communication.

This review presents the first systematic analysis of these protein degradation platforms to address ’undruggable’ targets in ocular pathologies. Harnessing distinct cellular machinery through the engagement of the ubiquitin–proteasome system and the lysosomal pathway with PROTACs and LYTACs, respectively, these heterobifunctional molecules enable the targeted elimination of disease-driving proteins implicated in ocular surface diseases, such as dry eye, and fundus diseases, including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. We review the mechanistic basis of these technologies, their translational potential in overcoming the limitations of conventional therapies, and ocular-specific challenges such as optimizing bioavailability and intraocular target selectivity. Central to this discussion is the role of advanced linker engineering in achieving spatio-temporal control of degradation activity. While barriers to ocular biodistribution and sustained delivery remain, targeted protein degradation represents a paradigm shift in ophthalmology, offering durable therapeutic effects that could significantly improve clinical outcomes and patient compliance through reduced dosing frequency.},

However, due to the lack of bioactive factors for stimulation, the repair of current nerve conduits is generally slow. In this study, we designed a bioactive glass microspheres-embedded nerve conduit. The ions released from these microspheres activate c-Jun to induce Schwann cell dedifferentiation. Meanwhile, the microspheres coated onto the conduit surface provide physical anchoring sites, which accelerate integrin- β 1-mediated Schwann cell adhesion and orderly migration to facilitate Büngner bands assembly. This study confirms that dual-function bioactive glass microspheres promote nerve regeneration through ion-regulated dedifferentiation and particle-anchored migration, offering a novel approach for the design of nerve conduits.},

This study explored the radio wave propagation, gamma-ray shielding efficiency, and electrical resistivity of alkali-activated blast furnace slag (BFS-AAM) compared to hydrated Portland cement (PC). BFS-AAM demonstrated superior relative permittivity (ε r ≈ 7.6 at 2.4 GHz) and loss tangent (∼0.33) at lower radio frequencies (0.02–10 GHz), leading to enhanced signal attenuation compared to PC (ε r ≈ 5.6, loss tangent ≈ 0.07). BFS-AAM showed similar performance to PC at frequencies between 10–20 GHz, while its characteristics below 10 GHz make it suitable for secure signal environments. In terahertz spectrum (0.2–2 THz), relevant for 6G wireless communication, both materials displayed comparable permittivity (∼5.3 and ∼4.2) and loss tangent (∼0.09 and ∼0.04), indicating compatibility with residential and commercial applications. Simulations at 0.7, 2.4, and 6.0 GHz confirmed higher signal attenuation by BFS-AAM. Additionally, BFS-AAM exhibited higher resistivity (26–110 Ω·m), greater compressive strength (60 MPa), and lower porosity (∼11 %), contributing to its favorable dielectric properties. Although BFS-AAM demonstrated slightly lower gamma-ray shielding efficiency (at 0.661 MeV) than PC, its multifunctional properties position it as promising material for advanced electromagnetic and radiation shielding technologies.},

  abstract     = {Three-dimensional (3D) lattice structures have garnered significant attention in aerospace, architecture, automotive, and medical applications due to their lightweight and superior energy absorption capabilities. Additive manufacturing (AM) enables the fabrication of complex lattice geometries with customized mechanical properties, making them ideal structures for energy absorption scenarios. However, optimizing these structures to achieve spatially varying density distributions for enhanced performance remains a significant challenge. In this study, a data-driven design framework has been proposed for the AM of energy absorption lattice structures with spatially graded densities. The approach enables the tailoring of geometric parameters, including cell arrangement and strut diameters, to realize variable-density architectures optimized for specific performance requirements. The proposed framework is validated through experimental testing of 3D-printed lattice specimens. Compared to the lattices with uniformly distributed cells, the variable-density structures evidence a 218 % increase in maximum load and a 246 % improvement in specific energy absorption. The finite element analysis and experimental comparisons are used to investigate the influence of relative density gradients on energy absorption performance, peak stress mitigation, and deformation. The results highlight the effectiveness of the data-driven design approach in enabling the fabrication of functionally graded lattice structures with enhanced mechanical performance.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate the evaluation and prediction of hot-end component performance, scanning electron microscopy and quasi-static compression tests were carried out on Ni-based single crystal superalloys, and the influence of γ′ phase on microstructural evolution and compressive properties was systematically investigated. Results show that γ′ phases exhibit spherical, cubic, or lath-like morphologies, and their average size increases from ∼ 180  nm to ∼ 450  nm after thermal exposure; and superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase gradually precipitate topologically close-packed (TCP) phase. The compressive properties display pronounced anisotropy, governed by both microstructure and loading direction. For superalloys with lower volume fraction of γ′ phase, yield strength decreases from 670  MPa to 505 MPa and ultimate compressive strength from 4690  MPa to 4240 MPa as the γ′ phase coarsens. In contrast, for superalloys with higher volume fraction of γ′ phase, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then increases, accompanied by rise in failure strain from 22 % to 46 % after thermal exposure. With increasing loading angle, ultimate compressive strength initially decreases and then rises, whereas yield strength, failure strain and hardening modulus exhibit more complex trends. These variations are closely related to γ′ and TCP phase, and microstructure and loading direction collectively affect mechanical behavior.},

To explore the peptide self-assembly theory and overcome limitations, this study used bortezomib (BTZ) as the base material, and a novel peptide self-assembly strategy utilizing Zn(II) coordination was employed to prepare cancer cell-targeting nanofiber drugs (cRGD-BTZNDs). The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in different types of tumors. The results demonstrated that cRGD-BTZNDs effectively entered cancer cells and exhibited enhanced cytotoxic effects against cancer cells compared to BTZ. Moreover, cRGD-BTZNDs exhibited excellent therapeutic efficacy against solid tumors, significantly inhibiting 4 T1 tumor growth while reducing biological toxicity. Additionally, in the treatment of bone metastases, cRGD-BTZNDs demonstrated excellent therapeutic potency, effectively alleviating bone damage in mice with high biocompatibility. This study not only self-assembled nanomaterials with great potential in cancer therapy, but also affirmed the correctness and universality of the Zn(II) coordination peptide self-assembly theory, providing a theoretical basis for the improvement of peptide-based nanomedicine.},

It is primarily used in sheet and welded forms, with secondary applications in castings and forgings. However, high formulation costs and strict process windows reduce expected cost benefits. This study explores an alternative manufacturing route for large-scale components using the available thick wire format (Ø3.0 mm). Ti-15V-3Cr-3Sn-3Al was deposited via plasma-based wire-arc directed energy deposition. Samples were evaluated in two conditions: (1) solution-treated (2) solution-treated and aged. Mechanical testing included tensile and hardness measurements, while microstructural analysis used a broad range of techniques. Deformation behaviour and fracture surfaces were also examined. The β-phase microstructure in the as-built condition contained α GB at grain boundaries, which dissolved during solution treatment, leaving a fully β-phase matrix. Aging resulted in the precipitation of fine α-laths, providing expected strengthening. In this condition, the material achieved an ultimate tensile strength > 1150 MPa and failure strain > 6 %, with anisotropy observed only in ductility. In the solution-treated condition, continuous softening was observed during tensile testing. This study provides insight into properties of Ti-15V-3Cr-3Sn-3Al in additive manufacturing, laying the groundwork for alternative processing routes for titanium alloys.},

  abstract     = {Processing Cu-Zn alloys (brass) using fusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) techniques presents significant challenges due to volatile elements and the inherently high thermal conductivity of these alloys. Addressing these issues often demands increased energy input, modifications to laser systems, and compositional adjustments to mitigate zinc loss. However, such solutions are complex and remain in the early stages of development. In contrast, Additive friction stir deposition (AFSD), a solid-state AM technique, offers a promising alternative to overcome these limitations. This study represents a pioneering effort to deposit dual-phase brass (Cu-40Zn) using a closed-loop temperature-controlled AFSD. The influence of processing temperature (ranging from 0.38 to 0.61 T p /T m ) on microstructural evolution and mechanical performance was systematically investigated along the build and longitudinal direction. The resulting microstructure was predominantly governed by dynamic recrystallization and post-dynamic recrystallization (P-DRX) due to repeated thermal cycles. The as-deposited brass exhibited a balanced strength-ductility combination, with yield strength ranging from 215 to 437 MPa and elongation from 34 % to 67 %. Tensile properties in longitudinal and build directions revealed that grain boundary strengthening was the primary mechanism for improving the mechanical performance. The as-deposited properties were comparable to those of wrought counterparts, thus highlighting the potential of AFSD for fabricating high-performance brass components.},

  abstract     = {Mastering the high-temperature creep behavior of SiC fibers plays pivotal role in designing reinforced ceramic matrix composites. Creep viscoelastic behavior is activated at higher temperatures due to complicated interactive coordination between grain interiors and grain boundaries. This study investigated the tensile creep behaviors at different generations of SiC fibers under conditions of various stress and temperatures. The creep recovery behaviors after unloading exhibits the viscoelastic nature, which comes from the possible motion of amorphous phase near massive grain boundaries. It is driven by the release of elastic energy of the grain boundary, evidenced by frequency shifts in Raman spectroscopy. Then classical diffusion creep theory is modified to a viscoelastic model incorporating physical parameters such as the elasticity, viscosity, and threshold stress for SiC fibers. The proposed equations have been well supported by creep test results. The viscosity and elasticity parameters decrease with increasing temperature, the latter being more sensitive. 3rd generation fiber exhibits higher viscosity and elasticity, explaining better creep resistance. The model can evaluate the elastic and plastic contributions and predict creep results at higher temperatures. This work helps to understand high-temperature SiC fiber creep, and to guide optimizing fiber-reinforced composites.},

Water is a reliable and sufficient resource for future clean energy generation, as it can be used to enhance photovoltaic performance in a hybrid system. This study designs and investigates a novel aqua-voltaic hybrid solar cell by integrating an ultra-thin gallium oxide layer (2.3 nm) with a polycrystalline silicon solar cell under water-based conditions. The amorphous Ga 2 O 3 layer grown by sputtering enhances optical absorption, reduces surface reflectance in the ultraviolet (UV) region, and serves as a protective barrier against environmental degradation. Photovoltaic characterisations reveal an efficiency enhancement from 19.04 % to 21.56 % in Si solar cell when Ga 2 O 3 and water are introduced. Under illumination, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) exhibits capacitance and resistance, indicating strong interfacial charge dynamics. These phenomena are attributed to electronic double-layer capacitance, quantum capacitance modulation, and charge redistribution at the Ga 2 O 3 -water interface. The results illustrate the dual role of water in enhancing charge transport while influencing surface-state interactions, leading to improved solar cell performance.

Ultrasonic temperature sensors (UTS) are widely used in high-temperature sensing due to their extreme operating temperature close to the melting point of the waveguide materials. In this work, YAG single-crystal fibers (SCF) with spatially distributed acoustic reflection microstructures have been successfully fabricated via the laser-heated pedestal growth (LHPG) method and employed as acoustic waveguides. Herein, anisotropic acoustic waveguide behaviors were revealed in YAG SCF, where the [110]-oriented YAG SCF demonstrates enhanced unit sensitivity with the S-wave polarization direction of [ 1 1 ¯ 0 ], primarily attributed to the lower acoustic velocity and the more substantial velocity variations with temperature. Furthermore, quasi-distributed ultrasonic temperature sensing in the range of 30-1800℃ has been achieved based on the [110]-oriented YAG SCF with two discrete sensing units, reaching the maximum unit sensitivities of 47.18 ns·℃ -1 ·m - 1 and an optimal temperature resolution of 5.04℃ at 1800℃. Superior acoustic waveguide characteristics, a wide working temperature range, and the positive temperature-dependent sensor performance suggest that the [110]-oriented microstructured YAG SCF is an ideal candidate for distributed high-temperature sensing in harsh environments.},

In recrystallization–controlled regime of TMCP, successive rolling passes facilitate microstructural refinement through dynamic and static restoration mechanisms. This work illustrates static recrystallization (SRX) characteristics and kinetics in three ASS alloys designed by varying N, Mn and Nb contents. Interrupted (double–hit) compression tests were conducted to characterize the flow behaviour and microstructural evolution across different deformation conditions. SRX kinetics were formulated using a fractional–softening framework, where the time to 50 % recrystallization was correlated with strain, strain rate, temperature, and initial grain size. While the exponents of strain (−3.1) and strain rate (−0.3) were consistent across all compositions, the apparent activation energies of SRX varied in the range 251.5–298 kJ·mol −1 , with 7 wt% Mn showing a more noticeable effect in comparison with 0.1 wt% Nb. Detailed metallographic analysis confirmed the accuracy of the derived models. Suitable semi-empirical relations were established enabling prediction of statically recrystallised grain size across various processing conditions. These results define the processing windows needed to design TMCP schedules for advanced ASSs for LH 2 and cryogenic environments.},

  abstract     = {Wound healing assay is a standard method enabling investigation of cell proliferation and migration through a cell-free gap in a cell monolayer. Despite very common, it shows several weaknesses: lack of reproducibility and manual and time-based image analysis. Based on novel approach founded on innovative materials and AI-assisted processing of biological images, a promising automated barrier-wound healing assay is realized, achieving consistent results while retaining cells integrity. To increase assay accuracy, biocompatible 3D-printed resin inserts have been developed, facilitating precise control over shape and size of the wound. In parallel, a new image-detection algorithm powered by Deep Learning models was developed to identify cell-free area during the healing process, exceeding limitations of manual analysis. 3D-resin inserts combined with automated image analysis allowed the elimination of subjective errors and provided reproducible quantification of cell-free areas across multiple experiments. Moreover, a dataset to train a Convolutional Neural Network for monitor healing over time was developed. As proof of concept, this algorithm was tested on a cancer cell line stimulated by TGF-β, a drug stimulating cell migration. Innovative design of biocompatible materials combined with Deep Learning for automatically processing high-throughput data enables standardized wound healing assay, increasing efficiency, reliability, and accuracy of results.},

  abstract     = {Aerosol Jet (AJ) printing is becoming increasingly attractive for printed conformal electronics due to its non-contact capability. However, the impact of deposition rate and print speed on the morphology and electrical properties of printed traces remains unclear. In this study, AJ printed traces with different print speed (0.3–20 mm/s) under commonly used deposition rate values (0.0002, 0.0004 and 0.0006 mm 3 /s) were examined. After evaluating the corresponding morphology and conductivity of the printed traces, the optimal print speed range of each deposition rate was determined as follows: deposition rate of 0.0002 mm 3 /s as 0.3–1.5 mm/s, 0.0004 mm 3 /s as 0.7–4 mm/s, and 0.0006 mm 3 /s as 1–6 mm/s, respectively. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is proposed to elucidate the fundamental aerodynamic behaviors of AJ printed traces under different deposition rate, and its trends align with experimental observations. The mechanism by which print speed influences conductivity was analyzed, revealing that internal porosity is the primary factor reducing conductivity at low print speed. The analysis of morphology, conductivity, and printing efficiency across various print modes revealed that the morphology of printed traces under the respective deposition rate and print speed combination remained consistent in single-layer printing. Notably, printing efficiency is substantially enhanced at elevated deposition rate and high print speed. Compared to multi-layer printing at low deposition rate, high deposition rate single-layer printing emerges as the optimal method for achieving superior efficiency and conductivity. Ultimately, a correlation was established between resistance, print speed, and deposition rate, that enabling the successful printing of 15 resistors with specific resistance values (20 Ω) for different geometries, within an average error of 5.9 %, thereby broadening the applicability of AJ printing in printed electronics.},

However, the aerospace and automotive sectors seek lighter materials compatible with practical processing methods. This study introduces hollow carbon fibers (HCFs) with a honeycomb cross-section as lightweight reinforcements in composites, fabricated via direct ink writing. The printability, mechanical performance, and microstructural features of HCF-based composites were systematically evaluated. Rheological testing showed that HCF-based inks exhibit similar pre-printing properties to conventional, densified carbon fiber (DCF) inks. However, mechanical tests revealed superior strength in traditional DCF composites due to differences in fiber morphology, density, and diameter. Microstructural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical microscopy indicated comparable fiber alignment, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed complete epoxy infiltration in HCF channels, evidenced by the pullout of cured epoxy strands. While fiber–matrix interlocking was expected to enhance strength, weak bonding within HCF interiors contributed to reduced mechanical strength. Despite lower strength, HCFs offer advantages for applications prioritizing weight reduction, thermal insulation, or fluid permeability, such as lightweight aerospace and automotive components, thermal management systems, and filtration media. The hollow structure also enables integration with functional materials for smart materials and energy storage.},

  abstract     = {Graphene aerogels (GAs), a class of three-dimensional porous structures, are limited by a fundamental challenge: low thermal conductivity stemming from high interfacial resistance between constituent layers and structural defects. This study systematically investigates a strategy to enhance thermal transport properties by engineering the interlayer bonding via platinum atomic layer deposition (Pt-ALD) and compares it with conventional high-temperature annealing (1873 K). The Pt-ALD-modified graphene aerogel (GA-ALD) exhibited a 199 % increase in thermal conductivity, significantly surpassing the 113 % enhancement from heat treatment. SEM, Raman, XRD, XPS, and FTIR data explicitly indicate that Pt-ALD forms covalent Pt O C bonds that bridge adjacent graphene layers while preserving the original porous morphology. Owing to the synergistic effect of enhanced solid-phase thermal conductivity and efficient convective heat transfer through the preserved porous structure, the GA-ALD sample achieved a total thermal resistance comparable to that of an equal-sized aluminum heat sink under identical forced-convection conditions, while weighing only ∼12 % of its aluminum counterpart. Moreover, cyclic compressive tests confirmed GA-ALD durability, retaining 99.5 % height and 94.7 % stress after 1000 cycles. These findings demonstrate that interfacial bond engineering via ALD is a powerful route to ultralight, high-performance carbon aerogels for weight-sensitive thermal-management applications.},

  abstract     = {Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is poised to revolutionize the manufacturing of high-value metallic materials, allowing for intricate, geometrically complex designs while minimizing material waste. The primary challenge lies in formulating alloys compatible with L-PBF that also maintain properties suitable for the demanding conditions encountered in energy, space, and nuclear applications. We introduce a category of high strength, defect-resistant octonary CoNi-based high entropy superalloy (CoNi-HESA), comprising roughly equal parts of Co and Ni, along with Cr, Al, V, Ti, Ta, and W. This alloy exhibits as-printed tensile strength exceeding 1 GPa and tensile ductility exceeding 30 % at room temperature. Furthermore, compression tests demonstrate that the as-printed parts maintain a yield strength of about 1 GPa at room temperature up to 700 °C, which decreases to 0.9 GPa and 0.7 GPa as the test temperature reaches 800 °C and 900 °C, respectively. With a careful combination of laser powder and scan speed, the developed HESA is well-suited for crack-resistant, high-density component production through L-PBF. Alloy design principles are elucidated through CALPHAD calculations based on the high entropy alloy (HEA) database, including the structure and properties of L-PBF processed CoNi-HESA.},

Here, we chose Zr 45 Ti 15 Nb 20 Ta 20 alloy with a single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) structure as a matrix and added a small amount of Al to promote a unique spinodal decomposition. The results show that the introduction of Al-X negative mixing enthalpy induces the RHEAs spinodal decomposition to form a nanocubic structure in the form of a basket-like fabric morphology with a characteristic periodicity of 12 nm. Nanocubic structures consist of (Nb, Ta)-rich cubes and Zr-rich channels as well as generate strong localized strain fields at the interfaces. Spinodal decomposition strengthening enables the as-cast RHEA to achieve a yield strength of 1405 MPa. Periodically distributed nanostructures make dislocations move slowly, causing plugging and cross-slip, facilitating dislocation interactions, multiplication, and accumulation. In summary, the chemical heterostructure produced by spinodal decomposition has been remarkably effective in improving the strength of RHEAs.},

  abstract     = {Eutectic high-entropy alloys (EHEAs) have attracted considerable interest due to their superior multifunctional performance. However, the inherent tendency of stress concentration at irregular phase boundaries frequently leads to premature fracture. This study presents a facile hot-rolling strategy to achieve synergistic strength-ductility enhancement in AlCoCrFeNi 2.1 EHEA via constructing a hierarchical hetero-lamellar structure (HHLS). Through controlled per-pass rolling reduction (PPRD), we induce strain-partitioning-mediated microstructural refinement in the hot-rolled EHEA and activate synergistic deformation mechanisms including stacking faults, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and deformation twinning. The resultant HHLS (aligned FCC/B2 lamellae, partially recrystallized FCC regions, and intragranular B2 precipitates) triggers pronounced hetero-deformation-induced (HDI) strengthening. Consequently, the EHEA with HHLS exhibits exceptional properties: yield strength of 1202 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1489 MPa, and uniform elongation of 11.5 %, which are 112 %, 45 %, and 6 % higher than those of the as-cast alloy, respectively. The superior properties originate from HDI effect and FCC phase-mediated deformation mechanisms, which enable the EHEA to maintain exceptional work-hardening rate despite high dislocation density, effectively delaying plastic instability. These findings not only establish a readily implementable thermomechanical processing strategy for EHEAs, but also provide a novel paradigm for improving mechanical properties, paving the way for their application in high-performance structural materials.},

To analyze the mechanism of residual stress generation in the copper layer, the grain size was quantified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was measured using a thermomechanical analyzer (TMA). Warpage and thermal fatigue reliability were evaluated under varying electroplating current densities and post-annealing conditions. These experimental results were validated by comparing them with stress analysis data obtained through finite element analysis (FEA). In the RDL structure, the optimized current density condition effectively reduced the residual tensile stress in the electroplated copper layer and improved both warpage and thermal fatigue life. In addition, the post-annealing relieved cure shrinkage-induced stress in the PID, enhancing the reliability of the RDL structure.

The unit cell lattice parameters (LPs) of a MAX phase are well-established indicators in determining the degree of O substitution. The presence of O reduced the a and c LPs of the MAX phase unit cell. However, the corresponding MXenes exhibited similar a LP ( a = 3.05 Å) values regardless of the LP values of their MAX phases. The LP observations are validated by correlative thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) carried out in air atmosphere. With the decreasing O incorporation in the MAX phase, an increase in the oxidation temperature was observed from 450 °C to 780 °C.

Current research is hindered by the lack of robust physiological models to evaluate the mechanical interactions between catheter materials and urethral tissue during intermittent catheterisation. This study introduces the first ex vivo porcine urethral model to investigate tribological performance and material-tissue interactions during intermittent catheter (IC) use, enabling more informed catheter design. We examined four commercial hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated ICs and a coating-free integrated amphiphilic surfactant (IAS) IC. ICs were inserted into porcine urethras using a texture analyser, held for two minutes, and withdrawn while measuring force and work done. Post-catheterisation, urethras were examined for microtrauma. Three of four PVP-coated catheters required significantly greater withdrawal force compared to the IAS catheter, correlating with increased urethral transitional membrane damage post-catheterisation. Ex vivo findings suggest that IAS catheters may lower the risk of complications compared with PVP-coated catheters in intermittent catheterisation. This study provides a new platform for comprehensive evaluation of IC-tissue interactions. It underscores the importance of tribological design in medical devices, aiding future innovation in device design and ultimately improve the QOL of patients undergoing intermittent catheterisation.},

  abstract     = {Gradient-index (GRIN) phononic crystals (PnCs) enable energy harvesting (EH) by focusing elastic waves into electrical energy. Efficient EH requires maximizing focused wave intensity, typically achieved by tuning the GRIN PnCs unit-cell shape. However, existing designs often exhibit energy concentration near the GRIN lens boundary and incorporate narrow gaps and sharp corners, making them susceptible to manufacturing errors and limiting their practical applicability. Understanding the potential performance changes caused by manufacturing errors is important because geometrical alterations can compromise wave-focusing performance. Therefore, this study aims to optimize the unit-cell shape toward maximum focused intensity at the desired locations for EH devices. To assess manufacturability, the effects of minor geometric variations on the focal position and focused intensity are evaluated via a sensitivity analysis. The optimal shape is derived using a deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model trained to predict focal position and focused intensity. This model accelerates a genetic algorithm (GA) used to perform the optimization. Our optimized designs exhibit 1.5 to 2.0 times higher focused intensity across the target focal positions compared with the conventional design. Thus, these optimal shapes, along with their sensitivity analysis results, provide practical guidelines for defining manufacturing tolerances and achieving consistent, efficient EH performance.},

  abstract     = {Conventional α + β Ti6Al4V alloys lack sufficient strengthening mechanisms, limiting strength. While oxygen (O) offers a cost-effective strengthening route, exceeding ∼ 0.33 wt% causes significant embrittlement. Here, we explored how to efficiently utilize interstitial oxygen to enhance the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V. The copper oxide (CuO) was innovatively employed as a precursor to completely dissolve into Ti6Al4V matrix, interstitial O and substitutional Cu atoms were simultaneously utilized to strengthen the primary α-phase (α p ) while inducing the abundant secondary-α (α s ) nanoprecipitates. Surprisingly, the introduction of Cu element facilitated control of lattice distortion and redistributed oxygen between α p and β-transformed (β trans ) structure, resulting in the Ti6Al4V-2.5CuO (wt.%) alloy with high oxygen tolerance (0.62 wt%) and an ultra-high ultimate strength of ∼ 1635 MPa and a favorable ductility of ∼ 5.3 %. The dual effect of interstitial solid solution strengthening and α s precipitation strengthening were achieved under the Cu/O interaction. Additionally, the addition of Cu promoted the oxygen redistribution and activation of the basal < a > and pyramidal < c + a > slip systems, thereby ensuring improved ductility. This study presented a novel strategy for high-strength Ti alloys using interstitial oxygen, maximizing strengthening while mitigating embrittlement.},

  abstract     = {A natural crack exhibits a surrounding stress field, which may overlap considerably with a stress field caused by any material inhomogeneity, influencing the crack driving force and extension direction. To utilize this effect for potentially increasing the apparent toughness, a defined pore is introduced near a potential crack path, whereby upon interaction, the crack tip can be deflected or trapped, depending on the intermediate distance. Since fundamental mechanics is well-known, a miniaturized notched bending specimen geometry incorporating a pore was selected to investigate the application potential for parts manufactured via multi-photon lithography. The size regime is representative of the smallest available objects and requires in situ SEM testing, which was completed with finite element modeling based on crack path prediction through analyzing the local crack driving force. The high dimensional repeatability of the process allowed for testing reliably reproduced specimens with variation of crack to pore distance only. The prediction represented the actual crack paths well, underlining successfully facilitated crack path alteration. The toughness was mainly increased by crack trapping within the pore, where deflection had a quantitatively negligible effect.},

The bi-material lattice is designed by filling the metal lattice with epoxy material. By this way, the stiffness of the bi-material lattice is guaranteed, and the effect of vibration absorption is realized at the same time. Different from the traditional proportional damping method of single-material structure, the non-proportional damping model is used for the bi-material lattice structure. The homogenization method is used to calculate the equivalent complex modulus of the lattice. An inverse method is proposed in this paper to obtain the loss factor of in-situ epoxy material filled in the metal lattice.

While pharmacotherapy remains a mainstay of pain management, its utility is limited by adverse side effects and the potential for dependency. Acupuncture has shown great potential in pain management through its ability to induce analgesic effects via acupoint stimulation. However, its poor specificity and ill-defined stimulation parameters compromise therapeutic specificity and reproducibility. Herein, we developed a biomaterial-based acupoint activation strategy for pain management. Adhesive polydopamine-coated hydrogel microspheres were fabricated using microfluidic techniques for accurate attachment and activation of acupoints. Adhesive hydrogel microspheres loaded with adenosine can slowly release exogenous adenosine at the ST36 acupoint to simulate the analgesic effect of acupuncture. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that single-dose administration of adhesive microspheres can effectively target acupoints, elevate mechanical pain thresholds, and provide systemic anti-inflammatory effects for up to 7 days. Overall, the proposed adhesive hydrogel microsphere system offers a new perspective on acupuncture practice and pain management.},

  abstract     = {Large format additive manufacturing (LFAM) has proven its ability to produce high-performance components for competitive markets. By depositing material only where it's needed, it drastically reduces waste material and energy use, obtaining a sustainability advantage that is further enhanced on larger scale. However, a deeper understanding of material recycling is critical to achieving the next milestone in sustainability. In this work, a methodology was proposed that uses both molds and final parts, manufactured in acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene reinforced with short glass fibers (ABS-GF), which had reached the end of their useful life to be used as feedstock. It is observed that recycling reduces fiber length by 47.3%, which directly impacts the mechanical properties in the longitudinal printing direction, resulting in around a 9% decrease in maximum tensile stress. However, this reduction falls to 5.1% in the transverse direction to the printing, and in some cases, the recycled material even surpasses the virgin material due to improved interlayer adhesion. An analysis on the adhesion reveals that the shorter monomer chains obtained during recycling allow better interlacing between layers. These results suggest that the reuse of the molds is viable and by adjusting the printing parameters we can obtain properties suitable for demanding applications.},

The resultant lack of design fidelity and toolpath dependent anisotropy has been found to negatively impact structural performance if not accounted for in the design. This paper addresses both characteristics in the design process of cellular material architectures by expanding upon the Nozzle Constrained Topology Optimization algorithm and experimentally validating the results against a typical baseline. An experimental method of deriving bond region material properties is detailed. A direct toolpath generation method from topology optimized results is proposed. Comparisons are made with conventional topology optimization design methods and performance is measured both experimentally and numerically against theoretical bounds. At relative densities ≤ 70 % , designs with nozzle constraints were able to more closely align numerical and experimental results for both performance and design fidelity (measured by relative density). In contrast, conventional topology optimized designs had higher overall performance, but little alignment between intended design and resultant experimental result. Typical designs consistently overdeposited material and inconsistently predicted performance.},

A large-scale simulation campaign across eight isotropic material models and 42,669 configurations identifies the arch rise-to-radius ratio as the dominant factor in post-forming thickness evolution, with non-uniform profiles causing up to deviations in rupture pressures and altering failure modes compared to uniform assumptions. Modal, buckling, and rupture analyses highlight significant impacts on natural frequencies, critical loads, and mechanisms. Experimental validation on 36 Monel Alloy 400 rupture discs achieves high accuracy, with thickness root-mean-square error of (maximum mean absolute percentage error ) and rupture pressure errors below , supported by uncertainty analysis (expanded uncertainties at confidence). The generalizable framework, extensible to non-metallic isotropic shells and non-arched geometries, enables enhanced prediction, optimization, and reliability by linking forming outcomes to structural integrity.},

However, understanding how topography regulates TNP dimensions under voltage, and the clinical feasibility of diverse TNP geometries was limited. More crucially, existing research predominantly focused on nanopore diameter, neglecting other geometric characteristics (alignment, texture/roughness) on soft-tissue cells that impeded optimized TNPs design for ideal soft-tissue integration. This study showed nanopore dimensions were voltage-dependent on micro-patterned Ti but remain stable on smooth counterparts. Varied TNPs with similar diameters but different alignment/roughness were selected and identified with similar chemistry/hydrophilicity, but their protein adhesion and stability were length-dependent, showing their feasibility as implant devices. Finally, human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and HaCaT epithelial cells functions on varied selected TNPs reflected that nanopores inherently promoted cell responses, but hybrid microgroove-nanopores dramatically enhanced HGF’s collagen and fibronectin secretion, while irregular textured nanopores significantly improved HaCaT adhesion. By addressing the gaps in understanding topographical regulation and the influence of overlooked geometric features beyond diameter, this work advances spatially optimized implant designs for improved epithelial sealing and connective tissue integration at different transmucosal zones for improved implant health.},

Systematic loading experiments were performed on unconfined shale fractures using a six-dimensional rock pressure detection and displacement monitoring system. High-resolution three-dimensional point cloud datasets of fracture surfaces were acquired via laser profilometry, while pressure-sensitive films were employed to quantitatively map contact behavior under varying normal stresses. Spatial integration of point cloud data with pressure-sensitive film measurements demonstrated that initial contact occurs preferentially at asperities with elevated heights. A wear distribution model was constructed by computationally aligning and subtracting pre- and post-loading topographic datasets. Mesh-based analytical methods identified a robust correspondence between extreme wear loci and regions of concentrated contact stress. The steady-state wear rate of shale fractures followed a power-law relationship with normal stress, consistent with micromechanical wear theories. Statistical evaluation of 3D surface topography parameters revealed that the root-mean-square height ( S q ) displayed significant correlations (Pearson’s r > 0.85, p < 0.01) with mechanical metrics. These findings advocate for S q as a robust 3D geomechanical index for characterizing contact wear evolution in fractured media.},

Velocity distribution of powder particles at the DED nozzle outlet has a key influence on the results of any predictive model of powder stream and yet remains largely disputed. Certain numerical studies highlighted a possible influence of powder particle size on the velocity condition at the nozzle exit, yet no experimental studies confirmed this effect. The experimental campaign described in this paper quantifies this relation between powder particle size and velocity distribution at the nozzle outlet and a strong decrease of particle speed with particle size is observed. Moreover, smaller particles are observed to travel at speeds higher than the mean carrier gas speed suggesting powder particle segregation within the nozzle as one of the mechanisms driving speed differences at the nozzle outlet.},

Here, we present a topology optimization approach to design two-dimensional structures for desired uniaxial polynomial nonlinear behavior, wherein we formulate the objective function to match nonlinear coefficient ratios, such that the linear stiffness is decoupled from the desired nonlinearity of the response. We suggest that such linear stiffness decoupling can help aid convergence for problems with fixed, but poorly matched, constituent materials and design volumes. This benefit can be understood by considering, if large absolute force values and stiffnesses are targeted, thicker structures with less open space generally result. Such high volume ratio structures reduce the kinematic freedom (available to, e.g. , long thin structures) which is needed for strong geometrically nonlinear responses. We show designs achieved using this approach that match a range of qualitatively different polynomial behaviors with high precision, which are of interest, in particular, within the domain of dynamical systems where nonlinear elasticity of relatively simple polynomial forms can confer greater analytical tractability.},

Transparent vessels with varying orifice heights (7.5 mm, 15 mm, and 22.5 mm), orifice numbers (24 and 48), and dual-level orifice distributions were fabricated and tested under pressures of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 MPa. Morphological analysis showed that fibre diameter decreased from 2.2 µm to 1.8 µm when pressure was raised from 0.1 to 0.3 MPa when increasing the number of orifices to 48. Two-level orifice designs yielded mixed diameter distributions, enabling tunable fibre architectures. High-speed imaging revealed that the 7.5 mm orifice height achieved fluid ejection 7.5 % faster than 22.5 mm at 0.1 MPa and increasing pressure from 0.1 to 0.2 MPa reduced ejection time by up to 33 %. Production rate increased with more orifices (48 compared to 24), by 9.8 % at 0.2 MPa, and declined at higher pressure for vessels with dual-level designs. Overall, the findings provide quantitative insights into how vessel geometry influences fibre morphology and throughput in pressurized gyration systems.},
