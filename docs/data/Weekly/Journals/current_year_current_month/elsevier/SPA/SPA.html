  abstract     = {The adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW -distance) controls the calibration errors of optimal values in various stochastic optimization problems, pricing and hedging problems, optimal stopping problems, etc. However, statistical aspects of the AW -distance are bottlenecked by the failure of empirical measures ( Emp ) to converge under this distance. Kernel smoothing and adapted projection have been introduced to construct converging substitutes of empirical measures, known respectively as smoothed empirical measures ( S - Emp ) and adapted empirical measures ( A - Emp ). However, both approaches have limitations. Specifically, S - Emp lack comprehensive convergence results, whereas A - Emp in practical applications lead to fewer distinct samples compared to standard empirical measures. In this work, we address both of the aforementioned issues. First, we develop comprehensive convergence results of S - Emp . We then introduce a smoothed version for A - Emp , which provide as many distinct samples as desired. We refer them as AS - Emp and establish their convergence in mean, deviation and almost sure convergence. The convergence estimation incorporates two results: the empirical analysis of the smoothed adapted Wasserstein distance ( AW ( σ ) -distance) and its bandwidth effects. Both results are novel and their proof techniques could be of independent interest.},

  abstract     = {In this article we show that for SDEs with a drift coefficient that is non-locally integrable, one may define a tamed Euler scheme that converges in L p at rate 1 / 2 to the true solution. The taming is required in this case since one cannot expect the regular Euler scheme to have finite moments in L p . Our proof strategy involves controlling the inverse moments of the distance of scheme and the true solution to the singularity set. We additionally show that our setting applies to the case of two scalar valued particles with singular interaction kernel. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work to prove strong convergence of an Euler-type scheme in the case of non-locally integrable drift.},
