All results are in three space dimensions. We eliminate several unnecessary conditions on V , leaving just V ∈ K 0 , where K 0 is the closure of the space of test functions in the global Kato class K , meaning sup y ∈ R 3 ⁡ ∫ R 3 | V ( x ) | d x | x − y | < ∞ . For the spectral multiplier bounds, we assume that H has no zero or positive energy bound states. For V ∈ K 0 , we prove that H has at most a finite number of negative bound states. If in addition V ∈ W ˙ − 1 / 4 , 4 / 3 , then by [16] and [20] there are no positive energy bound states.},

We also provide a representation formula for finite-energy weak solutions of a class of weighted elliptic partial differential equations in the half-space R + n + 1 under Neumann boundary conditions.

Our results enclose the second order Sobolev regularity, the Bochner identity and its consequences for the regularity of harmonic mappings, the Liouville-type theorems and a counterpart of the Lewy theorem. Furthermore, the Korevaar–Schoen energy of mappings on Grushin planes is studied and proven to be equivalent to the 2-Dirichlet energy. The discussion is illustrated by several examples.

In a well-prepared setting, we derive an enhanced convergence rate of order O ( ε 2 ) between the solutions of the relaxed compressible Euler system and their first-order asymptotic approximation. Regarding the relaxed Euler-Maxwell system, we prove the global strong convergence of its solutions to the drift-diffusion model in R 3 in an ill-prepared setting.

The model can be used to describe the motion of a mixture of two viscous compressible fluids. First, we give some sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary solution via the manifold theory and the center manifold theory. Second, by using the elementary L 2 -energy method, it is shown that the stationary solution is time-asymptotically stable provided that the initial perturbation and the strength of the stationary solution are sufficiently small. Finally, the convergence rates of solutions towards the stationary one are also established by employing a time and space weighted energy method.

Specifically, we developed impulsive and feedback control mechanisms for harmonic chains coupled with a point thermostat, effectively enabling control over the boundary conditions of the corresponding kinetic equations. However, the more intricate and fundamental challenge of internal control - namely, the design of control strategies that influence the collision operators within the kinetic framework - remained open. In the present work, we address the internal control problem for stochastic lattice dynamics, with the objective of controlling the transition kernel of the limiting kinetic equation. A central innovation of our approach is the development of a novel geometric-combinatorial framework, which enables the systematic construction of control pathways within the microscopic dynamics. This methodology opens a new avenue for the internal control of kinetic equations.},

Such solutions, which are given by time-dependent rotations of a non-radially symmetric spatial profile, correspond to critical points of the underlying energy function restricted on the double constraints consisting of the mass and the angular momentum. The study exhibits new pictures for rotating Bose-Einstein condensates within the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii theory. It is proved that there exist two non-radial symmetric solutions, one of which is local minimizer and the other is mountain pass type critical point of the underlying energy function restricted on the constraints. Moreover, we derive conditions that guarantee that local minimizers are regular, the set of those is orbitally stable and mountain pass type solutions are strongly unstable.

We employ the renormalization formula to handle boundary values and provide energy estimates. An L 1 – L p type embedding estimate derived from the fundamental solution is utilized to incorporate lower-order divergence terms. This work naturally extends the boundedness theory for uniformly parabolic equations, with matching exponents for the coefficients.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we establish new results on the dynamics of a degenerate reaction-diffusion system with hysteresis. Our model determines the evolution of a biological system characterized by the interaction between a sedentary species and a diffusive species. It can be notably applied in forest ecology and in microbiology. We prove the existence of an infinite family of discontinuous stationary solutions using a generalized Mountain Pass Theorem, and analyze the continuity of this family, through an original method based on the convergence of generalized Clarke gradients. We show that the discontinuity interface of the heterogeneous patterns is very sensitive with respect to a variation of the initial condition. Furthermore, we prove a new theorem of convergence towards discontinuous patterns, which shows that the basin of attraction of each pattern contains a non-trivial set of initial conditions.},

In our previous work, we proved small-data global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on the torus in Sobolev space H s for s > 1 / 2 by combining the Fourier restriction norm method with the parabolic smoothing effect, which is available in the periodic setting. In this article, we improve the regularity range to s > 1 / 4 for the global well-posedness by constructing an effective gauge transformation. Moreover, we remove the smallness assumption by making use of the dissipative nature of the equation.},

  abstract     = {This paper considers the question of characterizing the behavior of waves reflected by a fractional singularity of the wave speed profile, i.e., of the form c ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = c 0 ( 1 + ( x 1 ℓ ) + α ) − 1 / 2 , for α > 0 not necessarily integer. We first focus on the case of one spatial dimension and a harmonic time dependence. We define the reflection coefficient R from a limiting absorption principle. We provide an exact formula for R in terms of the solution to a Volterra equation. We obtain the asymptotic limit of this coefficient in the large ℓ ω / c 0 regime as R = Γ ( α + 1 ) ( 2 i ) α + 2 ( c 0 ℓ ω ) α + lower order terms. The amplitude is proportional to ω − α , and the phase rotation behavior is obtained from the i − ( α + 2 ) factor. The proof method does not rely on representing the solution by special functions, since α > 0 is general. In the multi-dimensional layered case, we obtain a similar result where the nondimensional variable ℓ ω / c 0 is modified to account for the angle of incidence. The asymptotic analysis now requires the waves to be non-glancing. The resulting reflection coefficient can now be interpreted as a Fourier multiplier of order − α . In practice, the knowledge of the dependency of both the amplitude and the phase of R on ω and α might be able to inform the kind of signal processing needed to characterize the fractional nature of reflectors, for instance in geophysics.},

  abstract     = {Any dynamical system, whether it is generated by a differential equation or a transformation map on a manifold, induces a dynamics on functional-spaces. The choice of functional-space may vary, but the induced dynamics is always linear, and codified by the Koopman operator. The eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator are of extreme importance in the study of the dynamics. They provide a clear distinction between the mixing and non-mixing components of the dynamics, and also reveal embedded toral rotations. The usual choice of functional-space is L 2 , a class of square integrable functions. A fundamental problem with eigenfunctions in L 2 is that they are often extremely discontinuous, particularly if the system is chaotic. There are some prototypical systems called skew-product dynamics in which L 2 Koopman eigenfunctions are also smooth. The article shows that under general assumptions on an ergodic system, these prototypical examples are the only possibility. Moreover, the smooth eigenfunctions can be used to create a change of variables which explicitly characterizes the weakly mixing component too.},

We firstly prove the well-posedness of solutions by the fixed point arguments. Then by the uniform pullback estimates and tail-ends estimates of solutions, we establish the pullback asymptotic compactness of non-autonomous dynamical systems generated by the solution operators in a space of probability measures, and further obtain the existence and upper semicontinuity of measure attractors. Moreover, we yield the existence and uniqueness of invariant measures as well as ergodicity of the solutions under additional conditions. In addition, the convergence rate of invariant measures is provided when distribution dependent stochastic system converges to distribution independent one. Finally, the finite-dimensional approximations of measure attractors and invariant measures are investigated between such lattice system and its finite-dimensional truncated system, which are useful for studying numerical invariant measures.},
