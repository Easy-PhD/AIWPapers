More specifically, we are looking at a one-phase thermo-elasticity system with phase transformations where small inclusions, initially periodically distributed, are growing or shrinking based on a kinetic under-cooling-type law and where surface stresses are created based on the curvature of the phase interface. This growth is assumed to be uniform in each individual cell of the perforated domain. After transforming to the initial reference configuration (utilizing the Hanzawa transformation), we use the contraction mapping principle to show the existence of a unique solution for a possibly small but ε independent time interval ( ε is here the scale of heterogeneity). In the homogenization limit, we recover a macroscopic thermo-elasticity problem which is strongly non-linearly coupled (via an internal parameter called height function) to local changes in geometry. As a direct by-product of the mathematical analysis work, we present an alternative equivalent formulation which lends itself to an effective pre-computing strategy that is very much needed as the limit problem is computationally expensive.},

The model describes the microtube-driven migration of glioma consisting of an ODE equation describing the dynamics of the tumour bulk and a reaction-diffusion equation for the tumour microtubes. We derive an explicit formula for the minimum wave speed c ¯ based on system parameters such that travelling waves exist for speeds c ≥ c ¯ while no travelling wave solution exists for c < c ¯ . We prove the existence of travelling wave solutions by constructing upper and lower solutions and employing Schauder's fixed point theorem. We obtain non-existence for small speeds by use of the negative one-sided Laplace transform. Our result is one of the few complete results on travelling waves of a non-cooperative partially degenerate reaction-diffusion systems. The findings have implications for understanding glioma spread dynamics and potential modelling applications in predicting tumour progression based on cellular migration speeds.},

A key contribution is the development of a novel normal form theorem for planar almost-periodic mappings under a weighted Diophantine-type nonresonance condition (1.7) . Unlike prior approaches relying on twist conditions or spatial averaging, our framework eliminates geometric constraints by leveraging the spatial structure of infinite-dimensional frequencies. As a direct consequence, we prove two main results: 1. The existence of infinitely many almost-periodic solutions; 2. The boundedness of all solutions for the asymmetric oscillator, even when traditional twist integrals (e.g., (1.5) ) vanish. This work unifies periodic/quasi-periodic boundedness theories and extends them to the almost-periodic regime, resolving long-standing limitations in planar Hamiltonian systems with asymmetric potentials.},

We first establish the equivalence between stable solutions and topological solutions with respect to the two distinct parameters in the Chern-Simon type regime. To address stability of our elliptic system, we study a reduced functional involving the Laplacian, and biharmonic terms appear in the corresponding linearized operator of the second Fréchet derivative. So, meticulous analysis is required to handle the biharmonic terms as well as the disparate scales of the two parameters. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness of stable solutions in the Chern-Simon type regime.},

The model under study is a prototype for a suspension bridge under the effects of unstable flow of gas. To counteract the unwanted oscillations a damping mechanism of a nonlinear nature is applied. From the point of view of nonlinear PDEs, we are dealing with a non-dissipative and nonlinear second order in time dynamical system of hyperbolic nature subjected to nonlinear damping. One of the first goals is to establish ultimate dissipativity of all solutions, which will imply an existence of a weak attractor . The combined effects of non-dissipative forcing with nonlinear damping-leading to an overdamping-give rise to major challenges in proving an existence of an absorbing set. Known methods based on equipartition of the energy do not suffice. A rather general novel methodology based on “barrier's” method will be developed to address this and related problems. Ultimately, it will be shown that a weak attractor becomes strong, and the nonlinear PDE system has a coherent finite-dimensional asymptotic behavior.},

This paper is the first since the seminal work by Bandle et al. (2000) [24] , to focus on the study of critical exponents in exterior problems for semilinear parabolic equations with a forcing term. By employing a method of test functions and comparison principle, we derive the critical exponents p C r i t in the sense of Fujita. Moreover, we show that p C r i t = ∞ if N = 2 , 3 , 4 and p C r i t = N N − 4 if N ⩾ 5 . The impact of the forcing term on the critical behavior of the problem is also of interest, and thus a second critical exponent in the sense of Lee-Ni, depending on the forcing term is introduced. We also discuss the case f ≡ 0 , and present the finite-time blow-up results and lifespan estimates of solutions for the subcritical and critical cases. The lifespan estimates of solutions are obtained by employing the method proposed by Ikeda and Sobajama (2019) [13] .},

In further developing our method originally formulated for the heat equation, we obtain analogous global BMO-maximal regularity associated to the Schrödinger operator L = − Δ + V , where the nonnegative potential V belongs to the reverse Hölder class RH q for some q > n / 2 . This extension includes several inhomogeneous estimates as ingredients, such as Carleson-type estimates for the external forces. Our new methodology is to exploit elaborate heat kernel estimates, along with matched space-time decomposition on the involving integral-type structure of maximal operators, as well as some global techniques such as those from de Simon's work and Schur's lemma. One crucial trick is to utilize the mean oscillation therein to contribute a higher and necessary decay order for global-in-time estimates.},

The problem is mathematically described by an elliptic or parabolic variational inequality of the second kind, to which weak solvability in the Sobolev space H 1 is well known. However, higher regularity up to the boundary in a bounded smooth domain seems to remain open. This paper indeed shows such H 2 -regularity if the problems are supplemented with the so-called perfect slip boundary condition and if the yield stress vanishes on the boundary. For the stationary Bingham–Stokes problem, the key of the proof lies in a priori estimates for a regularized problem avoiding investigation of higher pressure regularity, which seems difficult to get in the presence of a singular diffusion term. The H 2 -regularity for the stationary case is then directly applied to establish strong solvability of the non-stationary Bingham–Navier–Stokes problem, based on discretization in time and on the truncation of the nonlinear convection term.},

  abstract     = {We consider the Keller-Segel systems in R d , coupled with a bipolar source and sink flow. Focusing on the two-dimensional case ( d = 2 ), we establish finite-time blow-up of solutions under an axis-symmetric setting, without requiring the solutions to be radial. In particular, we prove that multiple blow-up points appear in pairs (i.e., in even numbers) away from the origin, lying on the x 1 -axis and exhibiting axis-symmetry about the x 2 -axis. This result holds for initial data with total mass strictly greater than 16 π , and stands in contrast to the classical radial setting, where blow-up is confined to the origin. A crucial part of our analysis is a sharp ε -regularity theorem, originally developed for the classical Keller-Segel systems and first established by Luckhaus–Sugiyama–Velázquez [12] . This theorem states that if the local mass around x 1 is sufficiently small at some time t 1 , then the solution remains locally bounded in a suitable parabolic cylinder in space–time centered at ( x 1 , t 1 ) . Compared to the classical ε -regularity theorem, it requires weaker assumptions and yields weaker conclusions, making it a form of partial regularity that is particularly essential for analyzing blow-up singularities. Based on this sharp ε -regularity theorem, we further prove that only finitely many blow-up points appear as singular sets, and the asymptotic profile is characterized as the sum of a finite number of δ -functions and a regular part in L 1 ( R 2 ) . Moreover, our results reveal that multi-peak blow-up phenomena can occur with or without the presence of non-trivial flow, highlighting the intricate interplay between diffusion, chemotaxis, and persistent advection. By accounting for non-decaying flow and employing precise blow-up criteria, we establish that the blow-up time can be bounded above by any prescribed threshold. These findings are justified through the construction of a time-local existence and extension theory for strong solutions, which incorporates both advection and mass conservation.},

In the first part, we consider the following Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality: ( ∫ R n | x | − p a | ∇ u | p d x ) 1 p ≥ S ( p , a , b ) ( ∫ R n | x | − q b | u | q d x ) 1 q , ∀ u ∈ D a p ( R n ) , where S ( p , a , b ) is the sharp constant and a , b , p , q satisfy the relations: 1 < p < n , 0 ≤ a < n − p p , a ≤ b < a + 1 , q = n p n − p ( 1 + a − b ) . We establish gradient stability of this inequality in both functional and critical settings, and we derive some functional properties of the stability constant. Building on the gradient stability, we also obtain several refined Sobolev-type embeddings involving weak Lebesgue norms for functions supported in general domains. In the second part, we focus on various classical Hardy-type inequalities, including the standard Hardy inequality, the L p -logarithmic Sobolev inequality with weights, the logarithmic Hardy inequality, the Hardy-Morrey inequality, the Hardy-Sobolev interpolation inequality, and the interpolated Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality. We investigate their weighted versions and derive corresponding extremal functions, refinements, new remaining terms and stability constants. An important tool in our arguments is a class of simple yet super useful transformations. These transformations enable us to reduce inequalities with complicated weights to simpler forms and to establish explicit relations between stability constants.},

Under mild assumptions, the existence of a mild solution to the coupled system is proved using a surjectivity result for weakly-weakly upper semicontinuous multivalued mappings, combined with a feedback iterative method and a temporally semi-discrete strategy. Additionally, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the solution sequence as the small parameter in the inertial term approaches zero, offering deeper insights into the limiting behavior and dynamic properties of the system.},

The analysis is particularly challenging due to the loss of horizontal derivatives in the nonlinear terms and the lack of full dissipation.

In order to study these perturbed differential equations, the associated Abelian integrals I ( c ) = ∫ γ ( c ) ω are valuable tools. We assume that the polynomials H are primitive with trivial global monodromy. For these polynomials, W.D. Neumann and P. Norbury provided a classification in three large families, up to algebraic equivalence. The knowledge of these families allows us to prove as first main result, that the respective Abelian integrals I ( c ) are polynomial functions of the variable c , and to find sharp explicit upper bounds for the number of their zeros. These upper bounds depend on m , n and the number of the generators of the fundamental group of the generic fibers of H , and they work for several new families of infinitesimal perturbations of Hamiltonian differential equations. Under trivial global monodromy, there exist canonical global generators B C ( H ) = { γ i ( c ) } of the fundamental groups for all the generic fibers of H , which are complex cycles of d H = 0 . As second main result; we compute the number of complex limit cycles of d H + ε ω = 0 which originate from complex cycles in B C ( H ) . Several accurate examples are provided.},

The driven sources are assumed to be generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random fields such that the covariances are classical pseudo-differential operators. Uniqueness and stability are established for both inverse random source problems. The stability estimates consist of a Lipschitz type data discrepancy and a logarithmic stability, which decreases as the upper bound of wavenumbers increases. These increasing stability results reveal that ill-posedness can be overcome by using multi-wavenumber data. The analysis is based on integral equations and analytical continuation, which only requires multi-frequency Dirichlet data on the boundary in a finite interval and removes the limitation of data to be collected at all high wavenumbers. For the first time, the stability is established on the inverse source problems for both the Maxwell and biharmonic equations by Dirichlet boundary measurements.},

This paper mainly presents several existence and multiplicity results under explicit conditions on a , b for the focusing case ω 1 , ω 2 > 0 and attractive case ν > 0 : (1) When 2 < p < 2 + 4 / N , we prove that there exist two solutions: one is a local minimizer, which serves as a normalized ground state, and the other is of mountain-pass type, which is a normalized excited state. (2) When 2 + 4 / N ≤ p < 2 ⁎ , we prove that there exists a mountain-pass type solution, which serves as a normalized ground state. (3) When p = 2 ⁎ , the existence and classification of normalized ground states are provided for and N ≥ 5 , alongside a non-existence result for N = 3 , 4 . These results reflect the properties of the Aubin-Talenti bubble, which attains the best Sobolev embedding constant. Furthermore, we present a non-existence result for the defocusing case ω 1 , ω 2 < 0 . We believe our methods can also address the open problem of the multiplicity of normalized solutions for Schrödinger systems with Sobolev critical growth, with potential for future development and broader applicability.}},

  abstract     = {It is known that in general, generalized Mehler semigroups defined on a Hilber space H may not correspond to càdlàg (or even càd) Markov processes with values in H endowed with the norm topology. In this paper we deal with the problem of characterizing those generalized Mehler semigroups that do correspond to càdlàg Markov processes, which is highly non-trivial and has remained open for more than a decade. Our approach is to reconsider the càdlàg problem for generalized Mehler semigroups as a particular case of the much broader problem of constructing Hunt (hence càdlàg and quasi-left continuous) processes from a given Markov semigroup. Following this strategy, a consistent part of this work is devoted to prove that starting from a Markov semigroup on a general (possibly non-metrizable) state space, the existence of a suitable Lyapunov function with relatively compact sub/sup-sets in conjunction with a local Feller-type regularity of the resolvent are sufficient to ensure the existence of an associated càdlàg Markov process; if in addition the topology is locally generated by potentials, then the process is in fact Hunt. Other results of fine potential theoretic nature are also pointed out, an important one being the fact that the Hunt property of a process is stable under the change of the topology, as long as it is locally generated by potentials. Based on such general existence results, we derive checkable sufficient conditions for a large class of generalized Mehler semigroups in order to possess an associated Hunt process with values in the original space, in contrast to previous results where an extension of the state space was required; to this end, we first construct explicit Lyapunov functions whose sub-level sets are relatively compact with respect to the (non-metrizable) weak topology, and then we use the above mentioned stability to deduce the Hunt property with respect to the stronger norm topology. As a particular example, we test these conditions on a stochastic heat equation on L 2 ( D ) whose drift is given by the Dirichlet Laplacian on a bounded domain D ⊂ R d , driven by a (non-diagonal) Lévy noise whose characteristic exponent is not necessarily Sazonov continuous; in this case, we construct the corresponding Mehler semigroup and we show that it is the transition function of a Hunt process that lives on the original space L 2 ( D ) endowed with the norm topology.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, the well-posedness of two-dimensional signal-dependent Keller-Segel system and its mean-field derivation from a interacting particle system on the whole space are investigated. The signal dependence effect is reflected by the fact that the diffusion coefficient in the particle system depends nonlinearly on the interactions between the individuals. Therefore, the mathematical challenge in studying the well-posedness of this system lies in the possible degeneracy and the aggregation effect when the concentration of signal becomes unbounded. The well-established method on bounded domains, to obtain the appropriate estimates for the signal concentration, is invalid for the whole space case. Motivated by the entropy minimization method and Onofri's inequality, which has been successfully applied for the parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, we establish a complete entropy estimate benefited from the linear diffusion term, which plays an important role in obtaining the L p estimates for the solution. Furthermore, the upper bound for the concentration of signal is obtained. Based on the estimates we obtained for the density of bacteria, the rigorous mean-field derivation is proved by introducing an intermediate particle system with a mollified interaction potential with logarithmic scaling. By using this mollification, we obtain the convergence of the particle trajectories in expectation, which implies the weak propagation of chaos. Additionally, under a regularity assumption of the initial data, we infer higher regularity for the solutions, which allows us to use the relative entropy method to derive the strong L 1 convergence for the propagation of chaos.},

First, we describe the local geometries of such manifolds in terms of certain Einstein and quasi-Einstein warped products. Secondly, a global classification result is obtained when one of the underlying metrics is complete, showing that either it is a weighted space form, a special Einstein warped product, or a specific family of quasi-Einstein warped products. As a consequence, it must be a weighted sphere in the compact case.},

  abstract     = {We study diffusion processes in R d that leave invariant a finite collection of manifolds (surfaces or points) in R d and small perturbations of such processes. Assuming certain ergodic properties at and near the invariant surfaces, we describe the rate at which the process gets attracted to or repelled from the surface, based on the local behavior of the coefficients. For processes that include, additionally, a small non-degenerate perturbation, we describe the metastable behavior. Namely, by allowing the time scale to depend on the size of the perturbation, we observe different asymptotic distributions of the process at different time scales. Stated in PDE terms, the results provide the asymptotics, at different time scales, for the solution of the parabolic Cauchy problem when the operator that degenerates on a collection of surfaces is perturbed by a small non-degenerate term. This asymptotic behavior switches at a finite number of time scales that are calculated and does not depend on the perturbation.},
