  abstract     = {This note is concerned with the approximation-based adaptive control problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear spatiotemporal systems. A congealed neural network (ConNN) is first proposed to approximate nonlinear spatiotemporal uncertainties arising from system states and time-varying parameters. Unlike conventional NN approximation structures, the ConNN explicitly decomposes the time-varying coupling weight into a congealed weight and a time-dependent perturbation. The congealed weight is estimated using a standard adaptive law for constant parameters, while the residual perturbation is handled within the network structure. To enhance robustness, smooth sliding-mode-like functions are then embedded into the control architecture, effectively attenuating bias terms, particularly in reference tracking scenarios. It is shown that the resulting ConNN-based adaptive controller guarantees adjustable, bounded-error tracking performance, thereby extending the applicability of robust adaptive control to complex spatiotemporal systems and outperforming existing NN-based approaches.},

One parameter focuses on compensating for the vanishing actuator effectiveness, while the other addresses uncertain nonlinear terms. The feature of the approach is that the designed controller is linear, and its implementation do not necessitate online computation, thereby significantly conserving computational resources.

Meanwhile, to rigorously verify the safety of the whole multi-agent system, a continuously differentiable control barrier function is proposed under a relaxed feasibility condition in the sense that it is imposed on each subsystem and only needed in the boundary area.},

It is assumed that the Laplacian matrix associated with the communication graph is unavailable and that the system matrices of the leader are only available to its neighboring followers. This differs from many existing works on fixed-time FTC problems where the communication graphs are typically undirected and protocol designs often rely on certain global information. A novel distributed observer is first put forward to estimate both the state and system matrices of the leader in fixed time. Then, an adaptive scheme is developed to solve the time-varying regulator equations resulting from the estimated leader system matrices in fixed time. Based on the proposed observer and the adaptive solutions to the regulator equations, a distributed adaptive fixed-time FTC protocol is further proposed via coordinate transformation techniques. It is shown that our proposed controllers do not require the input matrices of the followers to be of full row rank. It is also shown that the concerned fixed-time FTC problem can be solved with the proposed fixed-time FTC strategy in a distributed manner. Our results can be directly applied to solve both the adaptive fixed-time cooperative output regulation problem and the leader-following consensus problems of MASs under the directed graph. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed fixed-time FTC strategy is demonstrated through a numerical example.},

The challenge is that these SOCs cannot be directly measured and their corresponding cells within the pack may change with time. This paper proposes a novel hybrid scheme that estimates the minimum and maximum SOCs within a battery pack given by the series interconnection of equivalent circuit models. The estimation scheme relies on a mechanism that determines online two cells, which are candidates for having the minimum and maximum SOCs. The dimension of the hybrid estimator is independent of the number of cells, which makes it particularly attractive for large battery packs. Moreover, the estimator is endowed with robust, global convergence guarantees despite disturbances and measurement noise. Furthermore, Zeno behavior is ruled out as any solution to the considered system is shown to exhibit an average dwell-time. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency in terms of accuracy and computational time of the proposed estimator.},

  abstract     = {The pursuit-evasion problem is widespread in nature, engineering, and societal applications. It is commonly observed in nature that predators often exhibit faster speeds than their prey but have less agile maneuverability. Over millions of years of evolution, animals have developed effective and efficient strategies for pursuit and evasion. In this paper, we provide a dynamic framework for the pursuit-evasion problem of unicycle systems, drawing inspiration from nature. First, we address the scenario with one pursuer and one evader by proposing an Alert-Turn control strategy, which consists of two efficient ingredients: a sudden turning maneuver and an alert condition for starting and maintaining the maneuver. We present and analyze the escape and capture results at two levels: a lower level of a single run and a higher level with respect to parameters’ changes. In addition, we provide a theorem with sufficient conditions for capture. The Alert-Turn strategy is then extended to more complex scenarios involving multiple pursuers and evaders by integrating aggregation control laws and a target-changing mechanism. By adjusting a ‘selfish parameter’, the aggregation control commands produce various escape patterns of evaders: cooperative mode, selfish mode, and their combinations. The influence of the selfish parameter is quantified, and the target-changing mechanism is explored from a statistical perspective. Our findings align closely with observations in nature. Finally, the proposed strategies are validated through numerical simulations that replicate some chasing behaviors of animals in nature.},

Event-triggered observers are developed to estimate position references under uncertain cyber faults and DoS attacks. Observer-based optimal controllers for the nominal position and attitude subsystems are learned by off-policy reinforcement learning without dynamical information. Fault-tolerant controllers are constructed by integrating the learned controllers and adaptive actuator fault compensators. A self-triggered strategy is further proposed to avoid continuous communication. The relationship among the time-varying topology coupled with cyber faults, the features of DoS attacks, and the closed-loop control system stability is analyzed, and the exclusion of Zeno behavior is proved.

It is observed that various connectivity conditions induce the common intrinsic property that the involved generalized opposing Laplacian matrix is nonsingular. A stability framework is proposed that addresses both the existence of potential limiting behaviors as well as their convergence properties. This involves an analysis of the positiveness of the (opinion) susceptibility functions. The domains of attraction associated with the convergent behaviors are characterized. The solvability of both problems is provided, and the attracting domains are characterized precisely. The results are applied to blended social networks composed of three specialized opinion models.

This function uniquely integrates both the current system mode and its duration, effectively addressing the challenges of incompleteness in probability information. Distinct from the conventional semi-Markov kernel technique, the sojourn probabilities involve fewer parameters and can be more readily measured using statistical techniques, thereby lessening computational burden. Additionally, a non-monotonic Lyapunov function is constructed, leading to less conservative conditions that ensure the mean-square stability of the switched systems.

Recently, a rapid computation method that guides the input toward convergence with the optimal control problem solution by employing primal–dual gradient (PDG) dynamics has been proposed for linear MPCs. However, stability has been ensured under the assumption that the controller is a continuous-time system, leading to potential instability when the controller undergoes discretization and is implemented as a sampled-data system. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time dynamical controller incorporating specific modifications to the PDG approach and present stability conditions. Additionally, we introduce an extension to enhance control performance that was traded off in the original. Numerical examples substantiate that our proposed method, which can be executed in only 1 μ s on a commodity laptop, not only ensures stability considering sampled-data implementation but also substantially enhances the control performance.},

A distributed randomized gradient-free (DRGF) protocol is thereby proposed to identify the optimal central point of the coverage region. Accordingly, a distributed control law is designed to regulate the ASV dynamic surrounding coverage operation around the optimal concentric point. Significantly, sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the asymptotical convergence of the closed-loop multi-ASV fleet governed by the present DGRF. Finally, experiments are conducted on a self-established lake-based multi-ASV fleet platform to verify the effectiveness of the present surrounding coverage scheme.},

  abstract     = {The multi-agent systems (MASs) exchange the communication information by the communication network, which is vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. DoS attacks can disrupt the communication channels and result in the collisions between agents, thus it is an important and challenging topic to study the collision avoidance formation control issue under DoS attacks. This paper investigates the asynchronous resilient collision-free formation control issue for nonlinear MASs with DoS attacks. An asynchronous resilient distributed observer is proposed to estimate the output information of leader under DoS attacks. Based on the designed distributed observer and by constructing two high-order filters, an asynchronous resilient collision-free formation control method is presented by backstepping control design theory. The presented formation control method can ensure that the formation tracking errors asymptotically converge to zero, and the collision avoidance objective is realized. Moreover, the non-differentiable problem of virtual controllers is solved. Finally, we apply the developed formation control method to multiple Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems, the simulation and comparison results verify its effectiveness.},

In the analysis, the nonlinear semigroup theory is utilized to establish the well-posedness of the resulting closed-loop coupled system.

Furthermore, the exponential stability of the closed-loop coupled system is achieved by employing a generalized Gronwall-type integral inequality and the integral multiplier method, which involves the innovative development of an energy-like functional.

  abstract     = {This paper introduces novel dynamic event-triggered control (ETC) mechanisms for 2 × 2 linear hyperbolic PDEs in three configurations: continuous-time event-triggered control (CETC), periodic event-triggered control (PETC), and self-triggered control (STC). These mechanisms ensure global exponential stability (GES) under ETC using PDE backstepping, with stability estimates provided in the spatial L 2 norm of the states. The proposed CETC and PETC designs are observer-based and require continuous boundary measurements collocated with the actuation. In contrast, the STC design requires full-state measurements; however, unlike CETC and PETC, it does not require continuous measurements for the triggering mechanism—only measurements taken at event times. In the CETC design, a lower bound on the time between two consecutive events is enforced, and a dynamic variable with appropriately designed switching dynamics is introduced. By employing a novel Lyapunov functional, GES of the closed-loop system is established under zero-order hold implementation of the backstepping control between events. Events are triggered when the dynamic variable crosses zero from the positive side, after which it is immediately reset to an appropriate nonnegative value. Detecting events, therefore, necessitates continuous monitoring of this dynamic variable. To address this limitation, PETC and STC strategies are proposed. The PETC design identifies a suitable triggering condition that requires only periodic checks and derives an upper bound on the allowable sampling period. This PETC approach preserves the GES guaranteed by CETC without requiring continuous monitoring of a triggering condition, although it still relies on continuous measurements. Unlike CETC and PETC, STC requires neither continuous measurements nor monitoring of a triggering condition. Instead, at each event, STC computes the time to the next event — beyond a suitably enforced minimal dwell-time — using only measurements taken at events. Despite relying solely on event-triggered measurements, STC is capable of guaranteeing GES of the closed-loop system. The well-posedness of the closed-loop systems under all three strategies is established. A simulation study is provided to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.},

This approach aims to conserve communication and computational resources. The event-triggered observer is designed using the backstepping method, and an event-triggering condition is proposed to determine the time instants when sampled measurements should be transmitted.

  abstract     = {Unknown inputs related to, e.g., sensor aging, modeling errors, or device bias, represent a major concern in wireless sensor networks, as they degrade the state estimation performance. To improve the performance, unknown-input observers (UIOs) have been proposed. Most of the results available to design UIOs are based on explicit system models, which can be difficult or impossible to obtain in real-world applications. Data-driven techniques, on the other hand, have become a viable alternative for the design and analysis of unknown systems using only data. In this context, a novel data-driven distributed unknown-input observer (D-DUIO) for unknown continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems is developed, which requires solely some data collected offline, without any prior knowledge of the system matrices. In the paper, first, a model-based approach to the design of a DUIO is presented. A sufficient condition for the existence of such a DUIO is recalled, and a new one is proposed, that is prone to a data-driven adaptation. Moving to a data-driven approach, it is shown that under suitable assumptions on the input/output/state data collected from the continuous-time system, it is possible to both claim the existence of a D-DUIO and to derive its matrices in terms of the matrices of pre-collected data. Finally, the efficacy of the D-DUIO is illustrated by means of numerical examples.},

We ensure that for trajectories with safe initial conditions, the violation of safety can be made arbitrarily small through appropriately chosen design constants. We also guarantee an assignable “attractivity” rate: from unsafe initial conditions, the trajectories approach the safe set, in the sense of the measured CBF, at a rate no slower than a user-assigned rate. Similarly, from safe initial conditions, the trajectories approach the unsafe set, in the sense of the CBF, no faster than the assigned attractivity rate. The feature of assignable attractivity is not present in the semiglobal version of safe extremum seeking, where the semiglobality of convergence is achieved by slowing the adaptation. We also demonstrate local convergence of the parameter to a neighborhood of the minimum of a quadratic objective function constrained to the safe set with a linear CBF. The ASfES algorithm and analysis are multivariable, but we also extend the algorithm to a Newton-Based ASfES scheme which we show is only useful in the scalar case.

However, there are few studies on this regard in the control field. In this paper, the transmission of both feedback and switching signals is affected by the unknown channel gains, which induces severe mode asynchronization in the switched systems under iterative learning control (ILC). For the faded switching signals, by designing a calibration-rounding mechanism (CRM) to recover it, the asynchronous time can gradually decrease with the iteration, and finally the system achieves synchronization, that is calibration-rounding-based iterative synchronization (CRIS). For the faded feedback signals, an improved gain estimation mechanism (IGEM) is given to correct the signal faster with fewer iterations. Moreover, a novel tracking performance-driven switching law (TPD-SL) is proposed to reasonably schedule subsystems for obtaining optimal performance. A set of new average dwell time (ADT) conditions with the minimum synchronization time is obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by numerical simulations.},

It has been shown recently that the L 2 + induced norm is effective for the stability analysis of nonlinear feedback systems where the nonlinearity returns only nonnegative signals. However, the exact computation of the L 2 + induced norm is essentially difficult. To get around this difficulty, in the first part of this paper, we provide a copositive-programming-based method for the upper bound computation by capturing the nonnegativity of the input signals by copositive multipliers. In the second part, we consider how far the L 2 + induced norm can be smaller than the standard L 2 induced norm, and derive the uniform infimum on the ratio of the L 2 + induced norm to the L 2 induced norm over all linear systems including infinite-dimensional ones. Then, for each linear system, we finally derive a computation method of the lower bounds of the L 2 + induced norm that are larger than (or equal to) the value determined by the uniform infimum.

  abstract     = {In this paper, a distributed fault-tolerant control is proposed for a class of uncertain cascaded ordinary differential equation (ODE)-partial differential equation (PDE) multi-agents. For the cascaded system under consideration, the output of ODEs serves as the input signal of PDEs such that a distributed control involving states of the ODE as well as the PDE system is expected to be designed for consensus tracking. Based on the designed distributed control, where the actuator is assumed to be healthy, a distributed fault-tolerant control is designed to guarantee the performance of the system, and it is further improved to deal with actuator failures. To enhance the robustness of the cascaded system, the system uncertainties and the external disturbances of both followers and leader are compensated using adaptive laws and an adaptive distributed observer, based on which the stabilization of the cascaded ODE-PDE multi-agent system can be achieved with partially known agents’ information. Simulation results are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract     = {This paper investigates the identification problem for finite impulse response (FIR) systems with binary-valued observations under event-triggered communication mechanism and data packet dropout. The challenge lies in the inability to distinguish between untriggered events and packet loss when no information is received, which prevents us from obtaining the statistical properties of the binary-valued sequence. A compensation-oriented difference-driven identification (CODD) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameter by recovering the mean of the original binary-valued sequence, where different values for the observation estimates are assigned when receiving 0, 1 or nothing. Even though, the convergence analysis of the parameter estimate is still challenging since the assigned values are dependent. To tackle this difficulty, the estimate error is divided into two parts: an initial assigned value related part, which is demonstrated to be convergent through the construction of an auxiliary set, and the remaining component, which happens to be a convergent martingale-difference sequence. As a result, the almost sure convergence and the asymptotic normality of the CODD algorithm are established when data packet loss probability is less than 1 2 . By calculating the communication rate, it is proven that the difference-driven mechanism can save 50% of the communication cost compared to original binary-valued systems. Furthermore, when data packet loss probability is high, an m -channel compensation-oriented identification ( m -CODD) algorithm is constructed by utilizing retransmission of the each observation for m times, which is designed based on the packet loss probability. The properties of m -CODD algorithm including convergence, asymptotic normality and communication rate are established. Numerical simulations are illustrated to show the theoretical results.},

Compared with existing works, the general linear dynamics, general directed and strongly connected networks, as well as unknown disturbances are tackled simultaneously in the aggregative games. First, by introducing certain coordinate transformation and feedback linearization method, we develop a distributed gradient-based Nash equilibrium seeking law. A dynamic average consensus dynamics is designed to deal with the challenge by unbalance of general strongly connected networks. By the graph-related property and converse Lyapunov theorem, we establish the global exponential stability of a linear system and a class of nonlinear systems, respectively. Then, we propose a gain design method to obtain the stability of the nonlinear closed-loop system, which is not in the lower triangular form. Inspired by the output regulation theory, we design an internal model and an adaptive dynamics to tackle the unknown disturbances. Resorting to the perturbation theory and the internal model principle, we demonstrate that distributed Nash equilibrium seeking for aggregative games of N players with general linear systems subject to unknown disturbances over strongly connected networks can be achieved. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed Nash equilibrium seeking approaches are verified by their applications to some simulation examples.},

Then, an adaptive fault-tolerant control scheme with self-regulating spatiotemporal performance is designed for a class of nonlinear systems with non-parametric uncertainties.

Additionally, a novel anti-target controller is designed for the guardians to enable adaptive transitions from encircling a protected target to encircling, intercepting, and neutralizing a hostile target, taking into consideration the input constraints of the guardians. Based on the guaranteed uniform observability, the exponentially bounded stability of the state estimation error and the convergence of the encirclement error are rigorously analyzed.

To accommodate the dynamic joining and leaving behaviors of the players, a status estimation mechanism, which is capable of estimating in a finite time whether the players are active or inactive, is introduced. Based on the status estimation mechanism, a gradient play based algorithm is developed for distributed Nash equilibrium seeking in the dynamic environment. It is shown that under strongly connected communication graphs, players’ actions are convergent to a small neighborhood of the new Nash equilibrium linearly every time the player set changes. Moreover, the convergence accuracy and convergence rate can be adjusted by suitably tuning the step-size. To cover more general communication scenarios, strongly connected graphs are further relaxed to be B-jointly connected graphs, under which the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm are analytically studied. Furthermore, the upper bound of the average tracking error is quantified to evaluate the dynamic performance of the proposed algorithm. In the last, a simulation study on energy consumption games is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The underlying communication network among agents is assumed to be a weight-unbalanced and strongly connected digraph. The global objective function of the whole system is the sum of privately-known local objective functions, which are assumed to be strongly convex with Lipschitz continuous gradients. To achieve the distributed optimal coordination with low communication and computational resource consumption, and to efficiently reduce the frequency of control signal updates, a new distributed event-triggered control scheme is proposed. In this scheme, an auxiliary system with adaptive edge weights is established to generate the optimal trajectories and the tracking control inputs are designed for agents to track the given optimal trajectories. It is privacy-preserving to some extent as no actual state or output information of agents is communicated with neighbors. Sufficient conditions are derived, under which the distributed optimal coordination under consideration can be exponentially achieved. Moreover, the Zeno-behavior is shown to be excluded. Additionally, for cases where agent states are unmeasurable, a new distributed event-triggered observer-based control input is designed for each agent to achieve optimal coordination.

In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then an SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a reinforcement Q-learning approach for solving adversarial dynamic games in Markov jump systems. The H ∞ control problem is first formulated as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game, where the control policy and the disturbance policy act as adversarial players. To derive the Nash equilibrium control strategies for such games, a set of coupled algebraic Riccati equations is established, with the disturbance attenuation level properly prescribed. On this basis, two novel data-driven parallel Q-learning algorithms are proposed. The advantages of the proposed method are threefold: (i) it does not require precise knowledge of the system dynamics; (ii) it learns the optimal disturbance attenuation level; (iii) it yields Nash equilibrium control strategies. Finally, two simulation examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Instead of relying on the analytical forms of gradient functions, we use the measured gradient values depending on agents’ real-time outputs and propose a novel adaptive distributed control scheme. This scheme integrates event-triggered optimal coordinators, high-order filters, and tracking controllers. To handle the interaction between optimal coordinators and filters, we incorporate a new compensation term into the updating law for the coupling weight of each edge. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive distributed dynamic event-triggering mechanism that ensures that the inter-event times of each agent are lower bounded by a positive constant. Asymptotic convergence of agents’ outputs to the optimal point is proved by constructing a composite Lyapunov function. The proposed control scheme does not depend on global topology information. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

We consider a constant damping 2 μ for the second-order ordinary differential equation in the primal variable, following Nesterov’s acceleration for strongly convex optimization. A positive constant scaling is applied to the primal variable, while a positive increasing scaling function is applied to the dual variable. We prove that the proposed dynamic achieves a fast convergence rate for both the objective residual and the feasibility violation, with the decay rate potentially reaching O ( e − μ t ) . Additionally, we show that the dynamic is robust under small perturbations. By discretizing the proposed continuous-time dynamic, we develop an accelerated linearized augmented Lagrangian method for strongly convex composite optimization with linear constraints, where the objective function has a nonsmooth + smooth composite structure. The proposed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate that matches the one of the continuous-time dynamic. We also consider an inexact version of the proposed algorithm, which can be viewed as a discrete version of the perturbed continuous-time dynamic. Numerical results are provided to verify the practical performances.},

However, communication channels in modern technological systems are not always reliable and can be attacked by malicious external agents. In that case, the plant observations obtained by the supervisor may not be deterministic, e.g., due to delays and losses, or external attacks. This paper considers a unified supervisory control framework with set-valued (nondeterministic) observations and proposes a simplified version of nondeterministic observability, together with a generalized normality. It shows how the results of hierarchical control can be extended to the networked and cyber-attacked discrete-event systems at the same time.},

A common approach is to linearize the dynamics along the trajectory, thus deriving a linear-time-varying (LTV) model, and to design a model predictive controller (MPC), which results to be computationally efficient, since only convex programs need to be solved in real time, while retaining constraint handling capabilities. Building on recent developments in gain-scheduling control design, where linearization errors and tracking error bounds are considered, a new approach to derive such LTV-MPC controllers is presented. The method addresses the systematic derivation of a suitable terminal cost. The resulting MPC law is tube-based, exploiting the co-designed auxiliary gain-scheduled controller. Computational and implementation aspects are discussed as well, and the resulting hierarchical method is demonstrated both in simulation and in experiments with a small drone with fast dynamics and limited embedded computational capacity.},

Subsequently, two distributed stochastic algorithms via optimistic gradient descent ascent (SOGDA) and extragradient (SEG) methods are developed with constant step sizes, in which the variable sample-size technique is incorporated to reduce the variance of the sampled gradients. We present the explicit selection criteria of the constant step size, under which the developed algorithms achieve almost sure convergence to an optimal solution. Moreover, the convergence rate is O ( 1 / k ) for merely convex cost functions, which matches the optimal rate of its deterministic counterpart.

  abstract     = {The stability of nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) relies significantly on stabilizing factors such as the terminal region and cost. A larger terminal region not only expands the region of attraction for the closed-loop system but also contributes to reducing online computation costs. However, existing methods in the literature often impose limitations on the degrees of freedom available for characterizing terminal ingredients. This limitation arises from the reliance on either a predetermined linear local controller or a preset control Lyapunov function. This paper introduces an innovative approach to terminal ingredient characterization leveraging value-based reinforcement learning (RL). This method provides ample degrees of freedom for expanding the terminal region. To achieve this, a deep neural network is employed to learn the parametric state value function, serving as the terminal cost for MPC. The local controller adopts a one-step MPC instead of a predetermined linear or nonlinear feedback controller. Subsequently, a terminal set sequence is constructed iteratively through the one-step set expansion. The proposed approach’s effectiveness is validated through simulations.},

And yet, systematic and readily usable methodologies, for such a significant portion of real systems, have been historically scarce. Around the year 2000, the backstepping approach to PDE control began to offer not only a less abstract alternative to PDE control techniques replicating optimal and spectrum assignment techniques of the 1960s, but also enabled the methodologies of adaptive and nonlinear control, matured in the 1980s and 1990s, to be extended from ODEs to PDEs, allowing feedback synthesis for systems that are uncertain, nonlinear, and infinite-dimensional. The PDE backstepping literature has since grown to hundreds of papers and nearly a dozen books. This survey aims to facilitate the entry into this thriving area of overwhelming size and topical diversity. Designs of controllers and observers, for parabolic, hyperbolic, and other classes of PDEs, in one or more dimensions, with nonlinear, adaptive, sampled-data, and event-triggered extensions, are covered in the survey. The lifeblood of control are technology and physics. The survey places a particular emphasis on applications that have motivated the development of the theory and which have benefited from the theory and designs: flows, flexible structures, materials, thermal and chemically reacting dynamics, energy (from oil drilling to batteries and magnetic confinement fusion), and vehicles.},

  abstract     = {Factors like growing data availability and increasing system complexity have sparked interest in data-driven predictive control (DDPC) methods like Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC). However, closed-loop identification bias arises in the presence of noise, which reduces the effectiveness of obtained control policies. In this paper we propose Closed-loop Data-enabled Predictive Control (CL-DeePC), a framework that unifies different approaches to address this challenge. To this end, CL-DeePC incorporates instrumental variables (IVs) to synthesize and sequentially apply consistent single or multi-step-ahead predictors. Furthermore, a computationally efficient CL-DeePC implementation is developed that reveals an equivalence with Closed-loop Subspace Predictive Control (CL-SPC). Time marching simulations of DeePC and CL-DeePC are conducted using Hankel matrices of past data that are updated at every time step to induce potentially troublesome closed-loop correlations between inputs and noise. Compared to DeePC, CL-DeePC simulations demonstrate superior reference tracking, with a sensitivity study finding a 48% lower susceptibility to noise-induced reference tracking performance degradation.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR. Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.},

Using the excluding degree, a quantitative specification is obtained to characterize the performance of set-based robust fault diagnosis. Furthermore, a separate gain design method and a joint gain and input design method are proposed, respectively. This is the first work to achieve a joint observer gain and input design for set-based active fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing methods that design gains and input separately, the proposed joint gain and input design method has advantages to exploit the fault diagnosis potential of observer-based schemes. Finally, several examples are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Real-world dynamic systems evolve in the continuous-time world, while their models are simulated in the digital world using discrete-time numerical simulation algorithms. Such simulation is essential for a variety of system and control problems such as system identification and performance analysis of (control) systems. Ideally, the simulated model response should be identical to the system response. However, this is typically not the case in practice, even when the effects of unmodelled dynamics and parametric uncertainty are excluded. Even in that scenario, a mismatch exists between the response of the system and the model due to the interface between the physical world and the digital computer, unknown disturbances, and simulation inaccuracies. For the class of continuous-time, nonlinear Lur’e-type systems, this paper analyses the mismatch between the steady-state system response and the steady-state model response computed using the so-called mixed time–frequency algorithm. Firstly, a bound on the mismatch between the steady-state system response and the computed steady-state model response based on continuous-time signals is derived. Secondly, a bound for the same mismatch is derived for a sampled version of the signals. The bounds are further decomposed into several components, each given an interpretation that can be used to reduce the bounds on the mismatch. In a numerical case study, we show that reducing the bounds also reduces the actual mismatch.},

  abstract     = {Lossless Convexification (LCvx) is a modeling approach that transforms a class of nonconvex optimal control problems, where nonconvexity primarily arises from control constraints, into convex problems through convex relaxations. These convex problems can be solved using polynomial-time numerical methods after discretization, which converts the original infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one. However, existing LCvx theory is limited to continuous-time optimal control problems, as the equivalence between the relaxed convex problem and the original nonconvex problem holds only in continuous-time. This paper extends LCvx theory to discrete-time optimal control problems by classifying them into normal and long-horizon cases. For normal cases, after an arbitrarily small perturbation to the system dynamics (recursive equality constraints), applying the existing LCvx method to discrete-time problems results in optimal controls that meet the original nonconvex constraints at all but no more than n x − 1 temporal grid points, where n x is the state dimension. For long-horizon cases, the existing LCvx method fails, but we resolve this issue by integrating it with a bisection search, leveraging the continuity of the value function from the relaxed convex problem to achieve similar results as in normal cases. This paper strengthens the theoretical foundation of LCvx, extending the applicability of LCvx theory to discrete-time optimal control problems.},

We propose the Differentially Private Federated Cubic Regularized Newton (DP-FCRN) algorithm, which leverages second-order techniques to achieve lower iteration complexity than first-order methods. We incorporate noise perturbation during local computations to ensure privacy. Furthermore, we employ sparsification in uplink transmission, which not only reduces the communication costs but also amplifies the privacy guarantee. Specifically, this approach reduces the necessary noise intensity without compromising privacy protection. We analyze the convergence properties of our algorithm and establish the privacy guarantee. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments on a benchmark dataset.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address a safe time-critical control problem using reachability analysis and design a reinforcement learning-based mechanism for learning online and in fixed-time the solution to the safe time-critical control problem. Safety is ensured by determining a set of states for which there exists an admissible control law generating a system trajectory that does not reach a set of forbidden states at a user-prescribed time instant. Specifically, we cast our safe time-critical problem as a Mayer optimal feedback control problem whose solution satisfies the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation and characterizes the set of safe states. Since the HJB equation is generally difficult to solve, we develop an online critic-only reinforcement learning-based algorithm for simultaneously learning the solution to the HJB equation and the safe set in a fixed time. In particular, we introduce a non-Lipschitz experience replay-based learning law utilizing recorded and current data for updating the critic weights to learn the value function and the safe set. The non-Lipschitz property of the dynamics gives rise to fixed-time convergence, whereas the experience replay-based approach eliminates the need to satisfy the persistence of excitation condition provided that a recorded data set is sufficiently rich. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to the problem of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle collision avoidance.},
