  abstract     = {For uncountable downwards closed subtrees U and W of an ω 1 -tree T , we say that U and W are strongly almost disjoint if their intersection is a finite union of countable chains. The tree T is strongly non-saturated if there exists a strongly almost disjoint family of ω 2 -many uncountable downwards closed subtrees of T . In this article we construct a Knaster forcing which adds a Suslin tree together with a family of ω 2 -many strongly almost disjoint automorphisms of it (and thus the square of the Suslin tree is strongly non-saturated). To achieve this goal, we introduce a new idea called ρ-separation , which is an adaptation to the finite context of the notion of separation which was recently introduced by Stejskalová and the first author for the purpose of adding automorphisms of a tree with a forcing with countable conditions.},

As applications, we further obtain a new characterization of Muckenhoupt weights and, in the framework of ball Banach function spaces, an inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms on cubes, a Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality, and a Bourgain–Brezis–Mironescu formula. All these obtained results have wide generality and are proved to be (nearly) sharp.},

We also show that the K-moduli spaces P ‾ K ( c ) coincide with the Hassett-Keel-Looijenga (HKL) models F ( s ) of an 18-dimensional locally symmetric space associated with the lattice E 8 ⊕ U 2 ⊕ E 7 ⊕ A 1 under the transformation s ( c ) = 1 − 2 c 56 c − 4 . This implies that the K-moduli spaces interpolate the GIT partial compactification and the Baily-Borel compactification for the moduli space of smooth Del Pezzo pairs. Some discussions concerning the relationship to KSBA moduli spaces are also provided.},

  abstract     = {Let D ⊆ A be a quasi-Cartan pair of algebras. Then there exists a unique discrete groupoid twist Σ → G whose twisted Steinberg algebra is isomorphic to A in a way that preserves D . In this paper, we show there is a lattice isomorphism between wide open subgroupoids of G and subalgebras C such that D ⊆ C ⊆ A and D ⊆ C is a quasi-Cartan pair. We also characterize which algebraic diagonal/algebraic Cartan/quasi-Cartan pairs have the property that every subalgebra C with D ⊆ C ⊆ A has D ⊆ C a diagonal/Cartan/quasi-Cartan pair. In the diagonal case, when the coefficient ring is a field, it is all of them. Beyond that, only pairs that are close to being diagonal have this property. We then apply our techniques to C*-algebraic inclusions and give a complete characterization of which Cartan pairs D ⊆ A have the property that every C*-subalgebra C with D ⊆ C ⊆ A has D ⊆ C a Cartan pair.},
