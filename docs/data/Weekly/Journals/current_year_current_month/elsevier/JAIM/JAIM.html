It was previously established that the large- N limit of the second moment (the planar two-point function) satisfies a non-linear integral equation. By employing tools from complex analysis, in particular the Lagrange-Bürmann inversion formula, we identify the exact solution of this non-linear problem, both for finite N and for a large- N limit to unbounded operators E of spectral dimension ≤4. For finite N , the two-point function is a rational function evaluated at the preimages of another rational function R constructed from the spectrum of E . Subsequent work has constructed from this formula a family ω g , n of meromorphic differentials which obey blobbed topological recursion. For unbounded operators E , the renormalised two-point function is given by an integral formula involving a regularisation of R . This allowed a proof, in subsequent work, that the λ Φ 4 4 -model on noncommutative Moyal space does not have a triviality problem.},

Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpiński sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.},

This holds without imposing any a priori decay condition on channel eigenstates and even for models including long-range potentials of Dereziński-Enss type. In this paper we improve for short-range models on the known weak continuity properties in that we show that all non-threshold energies are stationary complete , resolving in this case a conjecture from [21] . A consequence is that the above scattering quantities depend strongly continuously on the energy parameter at all non-threshold energies (improving on previously almost everywhere proven properties). Another consequence is that the scattering matrix is unitary at any such energy. As a side result we obtain a new and purely stationary proof of asymptotic completeness for N -body short-range systems.},

  abstract     = {Given a foliation F on X and an embedding X ⊆ Y , is there a foliation on Y extending F? Using formal methods, we show that this question has an affirmative answer whenever the embedding is sufficiently positive with respect to ( X , F ) and the singularities of F belong to a certain class. These tools also apply in the case where Y is the total space of a deformation of X. Regarding the uniqueness of the extension, we prove a foliated version of a statement by Fujita and Grauert ensuring the existence of tubular neighborhoods. We also give sufficient conditions for a foliation to have only trivial unfoldings, generalizing a result due to Gómez-Mont.},

As applications, we further obtain a new characterization of Muckenhoupt weights and, in the framework of ball Banach function spaces, an inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms on cubes, a Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality, and a Bourgain–Brezis–Mironescu formula. All these obtained results have wide generality and are proved to be (nearly) sharp.},

We also show that the K-moduli spaces P ‾ K ( c ) coincide with the Hassett-Keel-Looijenga (HKL) models F ( s ) of an 18-dimensional locally symmetric space associated with the lattice E 8 ⊕ U 2 ⊕ E 7 ⊕ A 1 under the transformation s ( c ) = 1 − 2 c 56 c − 4 . This implies that the K-moduli spaces interpolate the GIT partial compactification and the Baily-Borel compactification for the moduli space of smooth Del Pezzo pairs. Some discussions concerning the relationship to KSBA moduli spaces are also provided.},

We also prove homological mirror symmetry for Greene–Plesser mirror pairs in all characteristics such that the B-side family has good reduction, generalizing work of the fifth author and Smith over the complex numbers. A key technical ingredient is a new versality argument which allows us to work throughout over a Novikov-type ring with integer coefficients.},

  abstract     = {Let D ⊆ A be a quasi-Cartan pair of algebras. Then there exists a unique discrete groupoid twist Σ → G whose twisted Steinberg algebra is isomorphic to A in a way that preserves D . In this paper, we show there is a lattice isomorphism between wide open subgroupoids of G and subalgebras C such that D ⊆ C ⊆ A and D ⊆ C is a quasi-Cartan pair. We also characterize which algebraic diagonal/algebraic Cartan/quasi-Cartan pairs have the property that every subalgebra C with D ⊆ C ⊆ A has D ⊆ C a diagonal/Cartan/quasi-Cartan pair. In the diagonal case, when the coefficient ring is a field, it is all of them. Beyond that, only pairs that are close to being diagonal have this property. We then apply our techniques to C*-algebraic inclusions and give a complete characterization of which Cartan pairs D ⊆ A have the property that every C*-subalgebra C with D ⊆ C ⊆ A has D ⊆ C a Cartan pair.},
