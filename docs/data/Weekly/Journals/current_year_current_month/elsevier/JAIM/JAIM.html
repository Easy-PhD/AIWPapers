From this perspective, we then prove a multiplicative double coset formula for the restriction of this norm to dihedral groups of order 2 m . This informs our new definition of Real Hochschild homology of rings with anti-involution, which we show is the algebraic analogue of Real topological Hochschild homology. Using extra structure on Real Hochschild homology, we define a new theory of p -typical Witt vectors of rings with anti-involution. We end with an explicit computation of the degree zero D 2 m -Mackey functor homotopy groups of THR ( Z _ ) for m odd. This uses a Tambara reciprocity formula for sums for general finite groups, which may be of independent interest.},

In this paper, we study a broader family of q -series that contains the collection { U t } t ∈ N . Using the theory of quasi shuffle algebras, we show that this extended family also lies in the algebra of quasimodular forms. Moreover, we determine the precise weights and levels of these functions, thereby making Amdeberhan–Andrews–Tauraso's result sharp. We further investigate the limiting behavior of these functions. In particular, we demonstrate that the sequence of quasimodular forms { U t ( 1 ; q ) } t ∈ N gives an approximation for the ordinary partition function. We also establish infinitely many closed formulas for reciprocals of certain infinite products in terms of U t ( a ; q ) .},

At first, we prove that these entropies are well-defined for non-intersecting intervals. This is accomplished by an inequality of Alexander V. Sobolev. Then we compute this entropy using a trace formula for Wiener–Hopf operators by Harold Widom. For intersecting intervals, we discuss an extended entropy formula of Casini and Huerta and support this with a proof for polynomial test functions (instead of entropy).},

In order to obtain such results, we demonstrate suitable quantitative upper and lower estimates for the L 2 -norm of the solution within a spatial lattice ( h Z ) d .

We compare the structure of elements of Sp 2 ( A , σ ) with Manin matrices over general noncommutative rings; this naturally leads to a quantization Sp 2 ( A , σ ) q . In contrast to the usual definition of the quantum group as a deformation of the ring of matrix functions on SL 2 ( R ) , this quantization produces a group of matrices over a new noncommutative ring with involution. We finish the comparison by constructing a generalization of a Hopf algebra structure on the noncommutative ring of matrix functions of our quantum group. Finally, we use the noncommutative surface-type cluster algebras of Berenstein and Retakh to give a geometric interpretation of our Hopf algebra structure and to produce noncommutative generalizations of Markov numbers over many rings with involution including the complex numbers, dual numbers, matrix rings, and group rings.},

  abstract     = {By a pointed vertex operator algebra (VOA) we mean one whose modules are all simple currents (i.e. invertible), e.g. even positive definite lattice VOAs. This paper systematically explores the interplay between their orbifolds and tensor category theory. We begin by supplying an elementary proof of the Dijkgraaf–Witten conjecture, which predicts the representation theory of holomorphic VOA orbifolds. We then apply that argument more generally to the situation where the orbifold group G (a subgroup of the automorphism group of the VOA) fixes all VOA modules, and relate the result to recent work of Mason–Ng and Naidu. Here our results are complete. We then turn to the other extreme, where the automorphisms act fixed-point freely on the modules, and realize any possible finite nilpotent group as such a G . This affords a considerable generalization of the Tambara-Yamagami categories. We conclude by considering some hybrid actions. In this way we use tensor category theory to organize and generalize systematically several isolated examples and special cases scattered in the literature. Conversely, we show how VOA orbifolds can be used to construct broad classes of braided crossed fusion categories and modular tensor categories.},

It was previously established that the large- N limit of the second moment (the planar two-point function) satisfies a non-linear integral equation. By employing tools from complex analysis, in particular the Lagrange-Bürmann inversion formula, we identify the exact solution of this non-linear problem, both for finite N and for a large- N limit to unbounded operators E of spectral dimension ≤4. For finite N , the two-point function is a rational function evaluated at the preimages of another rational function R constructed from the spectrum of E . Subsequent work has constructed from this formula a family ω g , n of meromorphic differentials which obey blobbed topological recursion. For unbounded operators E , the renormalised two-point function is given by an integral formula involving a regularisation of R . This allowed a proof, in subsequent work, that the λ Φ 4 4 -model on noncommutative Moyal space does not have a triviality problem.},

  abstract     = {We establish variational principles for the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of a class of statistically self-affine sponges, including in particular fractal percolation sets obtained from Barański and Gatzouras-Lalley carpets and sponges. Our first step is to compute the Hausdorff and packing dimensions of non-degenerate inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures supported on the associated random limit sets. This is not a straightforward combination of the existing approaches for the deterministic inhomogeneous Bernoulli measures and the Mandelbrot measures on random Sierpiński sponges; it reveals new structural features. The variational principles rely on a specific subclass of inhomogeneous Mandelbrot measures, which are connected to localized digit frequencies in the underlying coding space. This connection makes it possible to construct effective coverings of the random limit set, leading to sharp upper bounds for its Hausdorff and packing dimensions.},

  abstract     = {It is known that the large cardinal strength of the Axiom of Determinacy when enhanced with the hypothesis that all sets of reals are universally Baire is much stronger than the Axiom of Determinacy itself. Sargsyan conjectured it to be as strong as the existence of a cardinal that is both a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of strong cardinals. Larson, Sargsyan and Wilson used a generalization of Woodin's derived model construction to show that this conjectured result would be optimal. In this paper we introduce a new translation procedure for hybrid mice extending work of Steel, Zhu and Sargsyan and apply it to prove Sargsyan's conjecture.},

For this purpose, we prove new geometric properties of the Curve and of the associated function, in relation with its local Hölder and reverse Hölder continuity, with explicit estimates that had not been obtained before. We also show that the Codimension 2 − D W is the optimal Hölder exponent for the Weierstrass function W , from which it follows that, as is well known, W is nowhere differentiable. Then, the formula, that yields the expression of the volume of the ϵ -neighborhood, consists of a fractal power series in ϵ , with underlying exponents the Complex Codimensions of the sequence of prefractal graphs. This enables us to obtain the associated (effective local and global) tube fractal zeta functions , whose poles yield the corresponding set of Complex Dimensions. We prove that the Complex Dimensions are exact and simple, as well as periodically distributed along countably many vertical lines, with the same oscillatory period.},

  abstract     = {For a general class of N -body Schrödinger operators with short-range pair-potentials the wave and scattering matrices as well as the restricted wave operators are all defined at any non-threshold energy. This holds without imposing any a priori decay condition on channel eigenstates and even for models including long-range potentials of Dereziński-Enss type. In this paper we improve for short-range models on the known weak continuity properties in that we show that all non-threshold energies are stationary complete , resolving in this case a conjecture from [21] . A consequence is that the above scattering quantities depend strongly continuously on the energy parameter at all non-threshold energies (improving on previously almost everywhere proven properties). Another consequence is that the scattering matrix is unitary at any such energy. As a side result we obtain a new and purely stationary proof of asymptotic completeness for N -body short-range systems.},

In this article we construct a Knaster forcing which adds a Suslin tree together with a family of ω 2 -many strongly almost disjoint automorphisms of it (and thus the square of the Suslin tree is strongly non-saturated). To achieve this goal, we introduce a new idea called ρ-separation , which is an adaptation to the finite context of the notion of separation which was recently introduced by Stejskalová and the first author for the purpose of adding automorphisms of a tree with a forcing with countable conditions.},
