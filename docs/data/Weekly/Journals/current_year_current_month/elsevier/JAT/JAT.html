  abstract     = {A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions Ψ 1 and Ψ 2 , and also on the Appell function F 2 , is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the 1 D Glauber–Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.},

  abstract     = {We study Nevai’s condition from the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the real line. We prove that a large class of measures with unbounded Jacobi parameters satisfies Nevai’s condition locally uniformly on the support of the measure away from a finite explicit set. This allows us to give applications to relative uniform and weak asymptotics of Christoffel–Darboux kernels on the diagonal and to limit theorems for unconventionally normalized global linear statistics of orthogonal polynomial ensembles.},
