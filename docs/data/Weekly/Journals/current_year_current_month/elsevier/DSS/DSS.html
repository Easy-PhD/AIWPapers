  abstract     = {This paper investigates a trade agent decision optimization problem (TADOP), in which a trade agent (TA) selects a subset of retailers and suppliers to maximize its profit under uncertain demand and spot price. The TA operates between suppliers and retailers as a third-party platform and decide which subset of retailers to serve, taking into account capacity reservations with option suppliers in advance. Once demand and spot price are realized, the TA decides how much to procure from each channel to fulfill retailers' demand. The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program. Due to the high complexity and large number of scenarios, we reformulate the problem as a set-partition model, where the master problem (MP) selects the combination of retailers to serve, and the subproblem (SP) identifies the optimal procurement plans, thus reducing the number of variables and constraints. To further enhance tractability, the SP is transformed into an equivalent shortest-path problem (SPP) to address issues of non-linearity and non-convexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the decomposition approach, providing TAs with a practical decision-making tool for procurement and sales. Furthermore, the insights gained into TAs' procurement and sales strategies across various scenarios offer valuable guidance for decision-making in uncertain supply chain environments.},

  abstract     = {The highly volatile nature of the stock market makes predicting data patterns challenging. Significant efforts have been dedicated to modeling complex stock correlations to improve stock return forecasting and support better investor decision-making. Although various predefined intrinsic associations and learned implicit graph structures have been discovered, they have limitations in fully exploring and leveraging both types of graph information. In this paper, we proposed a Hybrid Structure-aware Graph Neural Network (HSGNN) framework. Unlike models that rely solely on predefined or learned graphs, HSGNN utilizes money-flow graphs to complementarily learn implicit graph structures and applies sparse supply-chain graphs to jointly enhance stock return forecasting. Extensive experiments on real stock benchmarks demonstrate our proposed HSGNN outperforms various state-of-the-art forecasting methods, offering a robust decision-support system for financial stakeholders.},

  abstract     = {Social recommender systems help address data sparsity in user–product interactions by leveraging social relationships to infer user preferences. However, existing models often overlook the role of social capital that influence decision-making in social commerce. Social capital consists of structural, relational, and cognitive dimensions, all of which shape user preferences. To better understand these influences, we propose a multi-task learning framework named DeepSC that integrates social capital theory into preference modeling. Its user preference learning module extracts structural features through graph-based pre-training, learns relational features from dynamic user embeddings, and models cognitive features using a hypergraph attention network. Additionally, the dual graph-based product feature learning module enhances cognitive feature extraction by incorporating product co-interactions. DeepSC is optimized through a joint learning objective, combining point-wise and pair-wise learning with an auxiliary social link prediction task to refine user representations. Experiments on three e-commerce datasets demonstrate that DeepSC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating social capital into social preference learning. Our research advances social recommendation by providing a social capital theory-driven approach to modeling user behavior in digital commerce.},

  abstract     = {Assessing cybersecurity policies is crucial for any organization to combat evolving cyber threats. The absence of a comprehensive dataset has prevented previous studies from analyzing the risk of organizations’ cybersecurity policies. Past studies have not considered temporal information in the policies. Analysis of cybersecurity policies using attention mechanism requires automated determination of optimal number of attention units which remains unaddressed. Moreover, absence of interpretation in cybersecurity studies creates a barrier to understanding policy vulnerabilities and developing targeted solutions. To address these challenges, we develop a decision support system which (i) enhances risk classification of organization’s cybersecurity policies, (ii) develops a comprehensive cybersecurity policy dataset from the websites of 190 companies, transformed into a knowledge graph to capture entity relationships among various policies, (iii) integrates temporal information into the knowledge graph by incorporating time stamps from event sequences in cyberattack information, (iv) develops Explainable Factor Analysis based Multi-Head Attention mechanism, which automates the determination of the optimal number of attention units and optimizes data allocation across attention units using factor analysis, and (v) utilizes attention heatmaps and shapley values for interpretability. Our cybersecurity policy dataset is used as a case study with four benchmark datasets for further validation. Results reveal that our model outperforms the other state-of-the-art, achieving an 87.78% F 1 score, followed by robustness checking and statistical significance testing. Finally, Shapley values are used to interpret the model’s output to identify vulnerabilities within the organizational policies, providing crucial insights enabling decision-makers to enhance their cybersecurity policies and mitigate potential threats.},

(2025). A field study on the impact of the counter ad-blocking wall strategy on user engagement. <em>DSS</em>, <em>198</em>, 114525. (<a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2025.114525'>www</a>)

  abstract     = {Ad-blocking tools prevent ads from being shown to web users. Their increasingly widespread usage poses an existential risk to online publishers who provide free content and rely on display ads for revenue. Studies on counter ad-blocking strategies taken by publishers are limited, especially with regard to how these strategies affect user engagement, thus posing additional uncertainties to the selection of a suitable counter ad-blocking strategy. Through a randomized field experiment with a large global publisher, our study seeks to understand how the two most common counter ad-blocking strategies, (i) Wall and (ii) Acceptable Ads Exchange (AAX), affect user engagement differently. Our results show that the Wall strategy causes a lower overall engagement compared to AAX, mainly due to users who refuse to whitelist and leave the website. Over time, the negative impact increases, albeit at a slower speed. Furthermore, heavier users, identified based on the amount of engagement in the pre-treatment period, are less affected by the Wall strategy than lighter users; instrumental users, who read for practical purposes, are less affected than entertainment users. Finally, the Wall strategy has a bigger negative impact on the engagement of popular and new articles, compared to niche and old articles, respectively, as observed by a longer tail in engagement distribution with respect to content. These results on the heterogeneous effects of counter ad-blocking strategies on engagement offer novel and important managerial implications on a publisher’s choice of counter ad-blocking strategy and editorial decisions.},

  abstract     = {The anonymity and widespread popularity of online social platforms (OSPs) allow users to share uncertain posts freely, leading to numerous rumors. Similar rumors spread widely across OSPs, resulting in frequent cross-platform rumors (CPRs). Owing to the unique nature of the cross-platform spread, the dual challenges of data privacy protection constraints and differences in the data and detection capabilities of OSPs exacerbate the difficulty of CPR detection. Thus, to detect CPRs effectively, we designed and implemented a novel deep learning framework named Cross Platform Rumor Detection based on Improved Federated Learning (CPRDIFL), which integrates and improves federated learning and the pre-trained Masked and Contextualized BERT (MacBERT). Our framework uses FL to analyze data from OSPs independently, thus avoiding the need for data integration and ensuring the data privacy protection of OSPs. Moreover, MacBERT is deployed on the clients of CPRDIFL to extract contextual features from posts and dynamically update local weights based on the data and detection performance. Weight parameters are dynamically shared between clients and servers and between clients to achieve complementary advantages across OSPs. Our framework was used in six comprehensive experiments in different scenarios, and the experimental results showed that it achieved the best results in CPR detection. This study not only provides an effective solution for CPR detection but also marks a significant step toward the automated detection of cross-OSP information pollution.},
