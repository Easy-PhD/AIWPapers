  abstract     = {We develop a discrete Sobolev inequality, and we use this inequality to analyse the nonlocal discretised Kirchhoff equation − A ( ( a ⁎ ( g ∘ | Δ u | ) ) ( b + 1 ) ) ( Δ 2 u ) ( n ) = λ f ( n , u ( n + 1 ) ) , n ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , … , b } , where ⁎ represents a finite convolution. The equation is a discrete analogue of the classical steady-state Kirchhoff equation in one space dimension. Existence of at least one positive solution is investigated under the assumption that the equation is subject to two-point boundary data such that u ( 0 ) = 0 . Thus, both Dirichlet and right-focal data are captured by our results. An interesting aspect of our theory is that the coefficient function A may be both vanishing and sign-changing.},

We present the basic reproduction number of the continuous model and conduct a theoretical analysis of the model. For such a hybrid infinite-dimensional system with abstract nonlinear terms, the comprehensive numerical analysis is still pending. We address this problem by establishing a fully discrete linearly implicit scheme, and the non-negativity of the numerical scheme is confirmed by utilizing the theory of M -matrix. With a solvability analysis, the finite time convergence is proved for strong solutions. For long-time dynamics, by utilizing the exponential decay characteristic of the fundamental solution matrix, we established a 1-order convergence analysis for the numerical reproduction number R 0 Δ t , and further proved the 1-order convergence property of numerical equilibria. By applying linearization techniques and comparison principles, we demonstrate that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 Δ t < 1 , and the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when R 0 Δ t > 1 . Hence, numerical processes almost completely replicate the dynamic properties of continuous system. At last, some numerical experiments demonstrate the obtained results.},

We obtain the basic reproduction number R 0 and show that if R 0 ≤ 1 , then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, whereas if R 0 > 1 , then the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and an endemic equilibrium exists. In a special two-group case, we show sufficient conditions for Hopf bifurcation and obtain index values that determine the direction, stability and period of bifurcated periodic solutions. By numerical simulation, we investigate the occurrence of periodic solutions in two groups representing an urban area and a non-urban area. We conclude that the epidemic size, response intensity of population behavior change and heterogeneity in two different groups can be the key factors of the occurrence of recurrent epidemic waves.},

In the case of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer operators, we establish new identities for the kernel arising from the composition of two and three operators. Like the well-known representation in terms of Legendre polynomials, they show the commutativity of these operators naturally. While this Legendre representation contains all possible products p k , i ( x ) p k , j ( y ) , 0 ≤ i , j ≤ k ≤ n , of Bernstein basis polynomials, the new representation has the beautiful property to contain only products p k , ℓ ( x ) p k , ℓ ( y ) , 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ k ≤ n , where n is the smallest degree of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer polynomials involved. This fact immediately implies that the composition can be written as a linear combination of the operators themselves. Building on the eigenstructure of the Bernstein–Durrmeyer operator M n , we obtain a representation of its r -th iterate as a linear combination of the operators M k , for k = 0 , 1 , … , n . We also address the composition of Szász–Mirakjan–Durrmeyer operators and revisit a known result giving an elementary proof.},

By using an energy equality of our heat system, we prove the existence of a unique global-in-time strong solution to the system with large initial data. The key idea of constructing strong solutions to our system is to make use of nice properties of the heat semigroups and kernels for R + 3 , R − 3 , and R 2 .

These bounds for w ρ ( X ) are sharper than those presented by J. A. R. Holbrook. Furthermore, the cases of equality are investigated. We prove that the ρ -operator radius exposes certain operators as projections. We establish new inequalities for the ρ -operator radius, focusing on the sum and product of operators.

We characterize the value function as a strict viscosity solution of the corresponding Bellman equation using the notions of ε -subdifferentials and ε -superdifferentials. The main paper's result is the fact that continuous subsolutions and supersolutions of this Bellman equation yield lower and upper bounds for the value function. These estimates rely on proximal calculus in the space of probability measures and the Moreau–Yosida regularization. Furthermore, the upper estimates provide a family of approximately optimal feedback strategies that realize the concept of proximal aiming.},

Previously, Hare et al. in [11] defined families of dimensions that interpolate between the Minkowski and Assouad dimensions for measures. Additionally, Fraser, in [8] introduced an additional family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and Sobolev dimensions of measures. Our results address a “gap” in the study of dimension interpolation for measures, almost completing the spectrum of intermediate dimensions for measures: from Hausdorff to Assouad dimensions. Furthermore, Theorem 3.13 can be interpreted as a “reverse Frostman” lemma for intermediate dimensions. We also obtain a capacity-theoretic definition that enables us to estimate the intermediate dimensions of pushforward measures by projections.},

Furthermore, each nontrivial point symmetry of any linear PDE yields a corresponding nonlocally related nonlinear PDE. The mapping relating the linear PDE and the corresponding nonlinear PDE is not one-to-one. As examples we consider the linear heat equation, the linear wave equation, Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in two or more independent variables. We exhibit some exact solutions of the corresponding nonlinear system of PDEs from a known solution of the associated linear PDE.

In this second part of the study, we investigate the structure of the image of the pre-Schwarzian derivative map, viewing it as a fiber space over the Bers embedding of the Teichmüller space, and prove that it forms a real-analytic disk-bundle. Furthermore, we consider the little Zygmund class and establish corresponding results for the closed Teichmüller subspace consisting of mappings in this class. Finally, we construct the quotient space of this subspace in analogy with the asymptotic Teichmüller space and prove that the quotient Bers embedding and pre-Bers embedding are well-defined and injective, thereby endowing it with a complex structure modeled on a quotient Banach space.},

To our knowledge, there are not many studies on discrete diffusive epidemic models, therefore, this article investigates the existence, nonexistence, and asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions for a discrete diffusive epidemic model incorporating stage structure and a nonlinear incidence rate. Concretely, to begin with, we obtain the basic reproduction number. And then, we get that the critical wave speed determines the existence and nonexistence of traveling wave solutions. Meanwhile, by establishing an appropriate Lyapunov functional and applying Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, we derive the boundary asymptotic behavior of traveling wave solutions. Ultimately, we employ these results to two examples (i.e. discrete diffusion stage epidemic models).},

  abstract     = {The cross-regional transport of sheep breaks geographical restrictions and expands the range of sheep, leading to the spread of brucellosis, one of the most widely spread zoonotic diseases transmitted by animals, and exposing more sheep and people to the threat of infection. To this end, a two-stage sheep brucellosis transmission dynamic model in a patchy environment is formulated based on the transmission characteristics of brucellosis. Firstly, the basic reproduction number is determined, and the global stabilities of disease-free, nontrivial boundary, and endemic equilibria are established, respectively. Subsequently, numerical simulations are applied to verify the correctness of the theoretical results. Finally, based on the recruitment rates of lambs and the basic reproduction number of two patches, the optimal transportation scheme for lambs and adult sheep is provided to reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis.},

  abstract     = {A sofic shift is a discrete dynamical system which consists of bi-infinite sequences of labels corresponding to paths in a labeled graph. If it is subjected to a certain automorphism called a flip, then it forms a sofic shift-flip system. The flip system is regarded as an action of infinite dihedral group on the sofic shift. The distribution of finite orbits under this action may indicate the complexity of the flip system. For this purpose, the prime orbit counting function is used to describe the growth of the finite orbits. In the literature, the asymptotic behavior of the counting function has been obtained for shift-flip systems of finite type (SFT-flip systems), which are a subclass of the sofic shift-flip systems. In this paper, we will prove a similar asymptotic result for a sofic shift-flip system. The proof relies on the construction of an underlying SFT-flip system to serve as a presentation of the sofic shift-flip system. The number of finite orbits in the said system is then estimated from the SFT-flip system via combinatorial calculations. Our finding here is complete since it is applicable to both irreducible and reducible sofic shifts.},

Additionally, the paper demonstrates that the solution, particularly for infinite series of fractional power, satisfies the generalized Ulam-Hyers stability.

  abstract     = {Centrifugal Pendulum Vibration Absorbers (CPVAs) have been in use for over a century and have become integral in addressing torsional vibrations in rotating machinery across a wide range of applications in both the aerospace and automotive industries. Proper tuning of the pendulum, such that it counteracts the engine-order fluctuating torques acting on the rotor during operation, enables the device to effectively attenuate vibrations across the full range of engine operating speeds. However, as operating amplitudes increase, the dynamic stability and performance of these passive torsional smoothing devices are highly dependent upon the motion path defined for their pendulous masses. In fact, the pendulum natural frequency commonly shifts as a function of their swing amplitude. Tautochronic motion paths can eliminate this resonant frequency shift as excitation levels increase and can thus overcome the common detuning issues associated with existing paths within the epicycloid family. At present, approximate tautochrone motion paths for CPVAs are derived using simplifying assumptions, which uncouples the pendulum and rotor dynamics. In this paper, using variational calculus, a system tautochrone motion path that accounts for the pendulum to rotor inertial coupling is derived. Its use results in tautochronic motion of the entire oscillatory system including both pendulum and rotor. Numerical simulations of the system forced response show that a system tautochrone motion path has distinct vibration control advantages, including enhanced stability and vibration correction performance. Most fundamentally, a new concept of order-tuning in these systems is for the first time identified, where a pendulum following a system tautochrone motion path retains a fixed order tuning for all feasible system energy levels. That is, the paper presents a more exact order tuning concept, expressed in terms of the square root of system energy, thereby accounting for pendulum motion in addition to rotor speed effects on tuning order.},
