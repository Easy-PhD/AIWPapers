  abstract     = {The complex network has garnered significant attention over the past few decades, with optimization and information extraction problems show significance in practical applications. The competitive influence maximization, along with its robustness, has emerged as a recent focal point, which is aimed at identifying seeds with robust and influential capabilities across multiple propagative groups within a specific network. Existing studies indicate the damage percentage of link-based failures can be pre-defined, and solving the problem in a single-objective manner. However, it has been demonstrated that multiple damage scenarios are prevalent, and the corresponding search processes may yield the synergy. Therefore, the correlation between the optimization directed at different damage scenarios of link-based attacks is analyzed first, which has shown non-conflict relation. Consequently, the multitasking optimization paradigm is thus introduced to modeling the related robust influence maximization problem. A numerical metric is also designed to reflect the significance of links on competitive networks. Equipped with this metric, a multifactorial evolutionary algorithm has been developed to tackle the seed determination problem under multiple damage scenarios, termed MFEA-RCIM MD . The involved operators consider diverse information from both genetic and fitness domains, and a multi-phase transfer operation is included to leverage knowledge across different tasks. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the remarkable performance of the algorithm over existing single-objective and multitasking approaches. With enhanced efficiency, multiple candidates are provided for decision-makers to address diffusive challenges in practical systems.},

  abstract     = {Tricot fabrics, though widely used in household and automotive sectors, have not been investigated for their acoustic behaviour despite structural advantages. This study examines their sound absorption performance and models it using metaheuristic optimisation algorithms. Experimental results showed underlap pitch as the most influential structural variable, linked to reductions in straight pore fraction and increases in areal density. Acoustic modelling was performed with Maa’s micro-perforated panel, Garai-Pompoli’s equivalent fluid, and Johnson-Champoux-Allard (JCA) microstructural models. Microstructural parameters (tortuosity, shape factor, scale factor, and porosity correction factor) were estimated using particle swarm optimisation (PSO), dynamic multi-swarm PSO (MPSO), artificial bee colony optimisation (ABCO), and fish school search optimisation (FSSO). Among these, JCA-PSO achieved the best agreement with experimental sound absorption coefficient (SAC) data, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) from 0.053 to 0.045 when effective porosity was introduced. While all algorithms gave comparable SAC predictions, MPSO proved the fastest and most stable, and FSSO the least efficient. Overall, the integration of metaheuristic algorithms with microstructural modelling offers a robust and computationally efficient approach for parameter estimation in fibrous media. The findings highlight tricot fabrics as lightweight, high-performance acoustic materials with potential for automotive and architectural noise-control applications.},

To bring the problem closer to real-world scenarios, this study proposes a scheduling problem for three-stage remanufacturing system considering machine blockage, deterioration and maintenance. Rate-modifying activity (RMA), as a type of maintenance activity, is executed to address the time-dependent deterioration. To solve this problem, first, a new deterioration model with RMAs is proposed to estimate the actual reprocessing time and determine the strategy for RMA execution. Second, a new blocking scheduling model is established to minimize the makespan. To find satisfactory solutions in a reasonable time, a new metaheuristic called modified monarch butterfly optimization (MMBO) algorithm is proposed. In MMBO algorithm, a problem-specific constructive heuristic and a new machine load balancing strategy are proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions. Then, two improved operators, adaptive to the solution representation scheme, are designed for exploring the solution space. Finally, experiments and comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms are made to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the MMBO algorithm for this problem.},

We define this problem as the Mobile Parcel Locker Problem with Delivery Robot and Drone Resupply (MPLPDR-DR). To solve it, we formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and develop a matheuristic approach. This approach integrates a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm for optimizing the routing of MPLs and delivery robots, while a MILP model determines the optimal drone resupply decisions. The hybrid metaheuristic is built on the artificial bee colony framework and integrates a large neighborhood search procedure, a variable neighborhood descent procedure, and a mutation mechanism. The proposed approach also addresses synchronization challenges related to timing in parallel and sequential deliveries. Extensive experiments highlight the algorithm’s effectiveness on large set MPLPDR-DR instances, and the results offer valuable managerial insights.},

However, a key challenge for organizers is how to meet the diverse demands of enterprises regarding booth pricing and related services. By analyzing real exhibition data, this study explores a method to improve the overall revenue of both exhibitors and organizers. However, previous studies have overlooked three key factors that affect exhibitors’ overall revenue: booth pricing, enterprise competitiveness, and internal enterprise strength. To address this gap, we propose a booth pricing model that incorporates exhibitor competitiveness and price sensitivity, along with multiple constraints, to better accommodate their flexible demands. To effectively solve the proposed mathematical model, this study presents the Staged Crossover Hybrid Genetic Algorithm (SCHGA). The algorithm adopts a fine-grained coordinate-point crossover mechanism, in which crossover is performed at the coordinate-point level. After identifying the better-performing coordinate points in one direction, the algorithm accelerates the matching of better points in the other direction, thereby speeding up convergence and improving solution quality. Experimental results on real exhibition data show that SCHGA outperforms two advanced algorithms and five basic algorithms in terms of convergence quality and stability. Therefore, SCHGA can effectively assist exhibition organizers in booth pricing and allocation decisions.},

  abstract     = {The crayfish optimization algorithm (COA) is a novel metaheuristic algorithm. In response to issues such as poor search capability, as well as the tendency to fall into premature convergence when COA solves complex optimization problems, an improved crayfish optimization algorithm based on multimodal collaborative search and dynamic distribution perturbation (MDCOA) is proposed. In MDCOA, a multimodal collaborative search strategy is proposed, which consists of two sub-strategies: dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) search and equilibrium hybrid search (EHS). Firstly, the DLH strategy is utilized to expand the neighborhood of crayfish population, enhancing the crayfish's utilization of neighborhood information. Secondly, the EHS is proposed to balance the intensity of global and local searches, and the global optimal solution is updated by comparing the fitness of DLH and EHS. To avoid premature convergence, dynamic distribution perturbation is proposed to nonlinearly disturb the algorithm. To verify the performance of the MDCOA, the parameter sensitivity of the algorithm and the impact of the two improvement mechanisms are analyzed using the CEC 2020 benchmark suite. Subsequently, MDCOA is compared with 18 other algorithms across multiple dimensions using the CEC 2022 and CEC 2017 benchmark suites. To verify the ability of MDCOA to deal with practical problems, it is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the Transformer-LSTM model for establishing a lithium-ion battery State-of-Health (SOH) estimation model. Simulation results based on actual data demonstrate that the Transformer-LSTM model optimized by MDCOA exhibits high estimation accuracy, with R² values above 97%, RMSE below 0.035, and MAE below 0.02 across four different lithium-ion battery datasets under various operating conditions. Therefore, MDCOA can be used to optimize the hyperparameters of Transformer-LSTM and apply it to lithium-ion batteries SOH estimation. The source code of MDCOA is publicly available on https://github.com/yylcsuft/MDCOA .},

However, such problems often exhibit inherent challenges, including high-dimensionality, multimodality, expensive evaluations, and mixed-variable characteristic, which impose high demands on optimization algorithms. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Surrogate-Assisted Niching Differential Evolution (SANDE), which efficiently optimizes CNN architecture hyperparameters through landscape delineation, surrogate-assisted optimization, and computational resource allocation. Specifically, SANDE employs a niching technique that integrates information from both the decision and objective spaces to divide the hyperparameter landscape into multiple simpler and promising sub-regions. These sub-regions are then efficiently searched using a surrogate-assisted integrated differential evolution, where a hybrid differential evolution and a surrogate model serve as the optimizer and objective function, respectively. An information integration strategy is also incorporated to enhance the optimization robustness and convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic resource allocation strategy is introduced to distribute computational resources across sub-regions based on their accumulated historical optimization outcomes, thereby enhancing resource utilization efficiency. The resulting SANDE-CNN is compared with six manually designed CNNs and 23 CNNs obtained by 14 advanced CNN optimization methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SANDE can achieve competitive performance at the cost of limited computational resources.},

First, the single-domain and synchronous MTO is classified into single-objective MTO, multi-objective MTO, constrained MTO, many-task optimization, and other variants based on the task types. Second, technical applications that employ MTO techniques to solve other types of optimization problems are also collated, which differ significantly from MTO variants.

  abstract     = {The efficient allocation of satellite communication resources has become increasingly vital due to the dynamic and growing nature of traffic demand. The beam-hopping resource allocation technique addresses this challenge by enabling sequential and adaptive beam illumination, along with a dynamic distribution of power and bandwidth based on existing user demand. This work formulates the large-dimensional and highly constrained beam-hopping problem for low-power, low earth orbit satellites as a multi-objective optimization problem. It considers three key objectives: unserved capacity (UC), which measures the portion of traffic demand that remains unmet; extra served capacity (EC), which reflects excess traffic delivered beyond the requested demand, indicating possible inefficiencies; and time to serve (TTS), which represents the average waiting time for users in non-illuminated cells. Aiming at innovating in optimization, specialized initialization, crossover, mutation, and local search operators for multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been proposed. Performance is assessed through Hypervolume (HV) metrics and statistical confidence analysis. An extensive experimental analysis is presented first for a canonical NSGA-II algorithm, characterizing the impact of the new operators and hybrid components on performance. Then, beyond Pareto-based approaches such as NSGA-II, a study of both decomposition- and indicator-based MOEAs, namely MOEA/D and SMS-EMOA is assessed, demonstrating the generalizability of the presented approach. Compared to previous results in the literature, our hybrid approaches achieve up to 5% improvement in UC, up to 100% gains in EC, and up to 60% improvement in TTS for the best configuration.},

This challenge has motivated significant research interest in solving FJSP-SDST through both exact and approximate methods. Although existing exact methods, such as mixed-integer linear programming and constraint programming (CP) have been explored, they remain inefficient in solving large-scale instances. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a collaborative multi-CP model, inspired by the collaborative optimization paradigm, which integrates global and local optimization stages to effectively solve large instances. Due to the NP-hard nature of FJSP-SDST, an approximate method, the meta-feedback learning-assisted matheuristic (MFLA-MH) algorithm, is proposed. The algorithm adopts collaborative variable neighborhood search as its main framework and incorporates meta-feedback learning to adaptively guide search operator selection. Additionally, two mathematical neighborhood structures and a mathematical evolution operator, as matheuristic techniques, are designed to optimize the subproblem solutions and overcome the limitations of traditional encoding-decoding methods. Experimental results on 20 real-world cases demonstrate that the collaborative multi-CP model and MFLA-MH efficiently generate high-quality solutions, and outperform state-of-the-art methods.},

This work investigates a discrete berth allocation problem considering berth shifting in dry bulk terminals. It includes two shifting strategies: 1) load-reduction shifting, where large vessels first unload partial cargo at deep-water berths to lighten their draft, and then shift to shallow-water berths to complete operations; and 2) berth-releasing shifting, where small vessels shift from deep-water berths to shallow-water berths when a large vessel needs the space. A mixed-integer linear programming model is formulated to minimize the total vessel service time. A Deep Q-Network assisted Variable Neighborhood Search algorithm (DQN-VNS) is proposed to solve this problem. First, a Dynamic-priority-based Heuristic Initialization Strategy is proposed to generate high-quality initial solutions. Then, a Deep Q-Network is employed to guide the search by adaptively choosing the most promising neighborhood operator. Numerical experiments are conducted on real historical data from a dry bulk terminal. The results demonstrate that DQN-VNS can effectively improve search efficiency and solution quality, significantly reducing vessel service time in dry bulk terminals.

  abstract     = {Recently, multimodal multi-objective problems (MMOPs) have emerged as a prominent research focus in the field of multi-objective optimization. The key challenge in solving MMOPs is to identify multiple equivalent Pareto-optimal solution sets corresponding to discontinuous or complex Pareto fronts. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel multimodal multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D-BDN), which integrates a bi-dynamic niche strategy with an adaptive weight decomposition mechanism. Within the decomposition framework, the algorithm introduces an archiving mechanism to preserve historically outstanding individuals, thereby maintaining population diversity and convergence. Furthermore, a bi-dynamic niche distance (BDN) metric is employed to evaluate the overall density in both objective and decision spaces, enabling more effective updating and removal of solutions from the archive. To improve the uniformity of the Pareto front approximation, an adaptive weight adjustment strategy is used to dynamically guide the search direction.

  abstract     = {As CMOS technology continues to scale down, the design complexity of very large-scale integrated circuits (VLSI) is rapidly increasing. Analog circuit design, in particular, remains time-consuming due to the critical impact of component dimensions on performance. Although the application of metaheuristics in analog circuit automation dates back to the 1980s, the growing complexity of analog design tasks and the need to reduce design cycles has sparked renewed interest in using metaheuristic approaches to address these challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of existing studies on the application of metaheuristics in analog circuit design automation, including circuit synthesis, sizing, and layout synthesis, while assessing their effectiveness in meeting design objectives. The paper provides an in-depth discussion from the metaheuristics perspective and highlights key research directions for future exploration.},

However, there are only a few researchers incorporating performance indicators for designing preference-based evolutionary algorithm. In this paper, we propose a preference modified inverted generational distance indicator guided algorithm, named PIGA, for evolutionary multi-objective optimization. The main purpose is that decision-makers provide their preferences, ultimately identifying the portion of Pareto optimal solutions where are located in region of interest. A new preference construction strategy based on coordinate transformation is first proposed. The reference points in the whole objective space can be projected into the preference space, obtaining the preferred reference points. The non-preferred reference points remain in the original objective space, outside the specified preference region. In addition, we define the distance between the candidate solution and preferred reference points as the preference distance and the distance to non-preferred reference points as the penalty distance. Finally, a preference-based modified inverted generational distance indicator is formulated to obtain the preferred optimal solutions according to the preferences and penalty distances. The comparative results are comprehensively analyzed by comparing it with some related preference-based evolutionary algorithms on some test instances. Experimental results have validated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm under different scenarios with the given preference range.},

  abstract     = {The increasing demand for product customization has highlighted the importance of make-to-order (MTO) material delivery. Although manufacturers have deployed intelligent reconfigurable job shops equipped with flexible workstations and automated guided vehicles (AGVs), challenges remain due to inefficient material scheduling, delayed deliveries, and the complexity arising from diverse material types. This study proposes an active delivery strategy based on a workshop material supermarket, in which both AGV path planning and workstation layout are jointly optimized in response to dynamically changing orders. A multi-objective delivery path model is formulated to support demand splitting while minimizing material delivery costs and maximizing timeliness satisfaction. The model incorporates constraints related to AGV capacity, path feasibility, and demand alignment. To address the nonlinearity and complexity of the problem, an improved chaotic multi-verse optimizer (ICMVO) is proposed. The algorithm employs chaotic encoding to enhance population diversity and mitigate premature convergence. It further integrates gravitational and collision operators to improve global and local search capabilities and adopts adaptive orbital dynamics control to balance exploration and exploitation. A dual-population iterative strategy is employed to enable joint decision-making on workstation coordinates, path direction, and vehicle assignment. Through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art meta-heuristics, the superiority of the ICMVO algorithm and the effectiveness of its components are demonstrated. Moreover, the proposed material delivery optimization method is implemented in a cloud–edge–terminal system and validated in practical MTO reconfigurable job shops through improvements in productivity and cost efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) change over time, which require Evolutionary algorithms (EA) to track Pareto-optimal solutions (PS) and/or Pareto-optimal front (PF) in a dynamic environment. Most prediction-based algorithms solely use a single model to learn the changing pattern for solution prediction. In the face of complex DMOPs, they may achieve an unsatisfactory performance. To address this issue, a novel trend analysis-based prediction strategy (TAP) is proposed in this paper. Based on previous population information, a simple trend analysis is designed to extract the changing pattern of each solution, and classify them into different types: irregular, translational, and stationary. For irregular changing solutions, a neural network nonlinear model is presented to predict the new location. For translational changing solutions, a simple linear model is built to estimate their new positions. For stationary solutions, they are preserved. As a result, TAP is more responsive to different dynamic environments. TAP is incorporated into the dynamic multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (DMOEA) based on decomposition (MOEA/D) to construct a novel algorithm denoted as MOEA/D-TAP. To verify the performance of the proposed method, comparison experiments are carried out on 26 test instances of four different benchmarks compared with six state-of-the-art methods. The test results indicate that TAP is highly competitive.},

When dealing with unconstrained 2-3-objective LSMOPs, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are likely to get trapped in local optima, making it difficult to ensure the diversity and convergence of solutions within limited computational resources. To tackle this challenge, we propose a strategy-cooperative algorithm based on state-awareness for large-scale multi-objective optimization, abbreviated as LMOEA-SC. In LMOEA-SC, we have designed a state-aware mechanism that can monitor the evolutionary state of the population in real-time. Based on the real-time information, LMOEA-SC flexibly switches and collaborates between the proposed learning strategy based on diversity protection competitive swarm optimization (DPCSO) and the escape strategy based on global exploration sampling (GES), thus effectively coping with different evolutionary states and challenges. The obtained statistical results, with a 73% improvement, clearly show that compared with six state-of-the-art MOEAs, LMOEA-SC has significant competitiveness in numerous large-scale multi-objective test instances with up to 2,000 decision variables.},

  abstract     = {Accurate insulation thickness measurement in industrial cables presents a critical yet challenging optimization problem, characterized by an extremely large solution space and stringent requirements for sub-millimeter precision under real-time constraints. Traditional computer vision approaches struggle with computational complexity when processing irregular cross-sections, while conventional evolutionary algorithms exhibit poor convergence characteristics due to the non-convex search landscape. To address these dual challenges, we propose an Alternating Curvature-Driven Genetic Algorithm (ACD-GA) that innovatively integrates geometric prior knowledge with evolutionary computing. Our key advancement lies in establishing a multi-scale curvature gene information database that synergizes differential geometry with adaptive genetic operators. This hybrid architecture features three core innovations: (1) Adaptive generation of initial populations based on multi-scale curvature characteristics to ensure gene quality and diversity; (2) Alternating crossover-mutation operations guided by curvature information to accelerate solution convergence; (3) A population renewal mechanism combining crossover-mutation with original populations and post-selection updates to preserve high-quality genes. Experiments on both regular and irregular IEC standard specimens demonstrate the superiority of ACD-GA in terms of accuracy, repeatability, and convergence efficiency. Compared with traditional manual inspection and fitted ray methods, ACD-GA reduces the average detection time by over 95.8%, decreases the minimum insulation thickness deviation by more than 89.3%, and significantly improves measurement repeatability. When compared with classical evolutionary algorithms (GA, PSO, ACO, SA, DE) and the latest intelligent methods (PSOCO, HPDE, TDE), ACD-GA achieves reductions of 21.1%–86.7% in minimum thickness deviation and up to 88.5% in repeatability, while maintaining comparable detection efficiency.},

An effective watermarking algorithm embeds a special mark into an image that does not change the image content but can be extracted from it even after some common post-processing operations such as cropping or compression. Many authors use metaheuristic optimization algorithms to achieve a trade-off between imperceptibility and robustness of embedding. In recent years, researchers have been interested in hybrid metaheuristics, which combine operations of individual metaheuristics in some way. However, designs and compositions of hybrid metaheuristic optimization schemes for image watermarking have not been sufficiently studied to date. In this paper, we present an experimental study of various hybrid metaheuristics including sequential, interleaved, and parallel schemes for popular bioinspired optimization algorithms including genetic algorithm, differential evolution algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, firefly algorithm, and artificial bee colony algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid metaheuristics for image watermarking using an algorithm based on changing the ratio between absolute values ​​of sums of discrete cosine transform coefficient groups as an example and perform an experimental comparison of different schemes. The results of the study show that a approach to metaheuristic hybridization and a composition of hybrid scheme significantly affect the imperceptibility and robustness of the image watermarking algorithm. In particular, the interleaved hybridization type provides the best results for the algorithm under consideration.},

Due to the expensive cost of actual fitness calculations, constructing suitable surrogates for objectives and constraints is crucial for finding potentially feasible solutions. To enhance the search efficiency of surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization algorithms in complex, small feasible regions with many decision variables, a population-oriented hybrid search surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm is proposed, called PHSEA. In PHSEA, the state of the current population is determined by relevance of the objective optimization and constraint violation reduction, as well as the ideal point change rate. Three search strategies are used: unconstrained, weakly constrained and strongly constrained surrogate-assisted search strategy, to search for feasible solutions. Furthermore, according to different search requirements, three archives with separate update criteria were used to construct the surrogate model for constraint functions. On this basis, we propose a population-oriented hybrid search framework that enhances the algorithm’s ability to search for potential solutions in small feasible regions. The proposed method was compared against two surrogate-assisted algorithms and three surrogate-free algorithms on 33 benchmark problems and 6 real-world engineering problems. Experimental results demonstrate that PHSEA exhibits strong competitiveness in solving ECMOPs characterized by small feasible regions and a large number of decision variables.},

  abstract     = {Personnel scheduling remains a significant organizational challenge with substantial potential for cost and time savings. Despite extensive research in this domain, few studies have been successfully implemented in practice, and even fewer have gained widespread acceptance among end-users. This gap between research and application often arises from oversimplified real-world models, which may result from subjective solution evaluations or a lack of collaboration between modelers and end-users. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a machine learning-enhanced memetic algorithm (MLMA) that mimics schedules created by experts to solve a highly complex personnel scheduling problem involving multi-skilled workers and flexible shift types (irregular workforce)—a real-world challenge commonly faced in the hospitality sector. By leveraging historical scheduling preferences, the MLMA generates solutions that align with past practices, enhancing their practicality and appeal to end-users. Experiments conducted on real-life instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing real-world problems, where the workforce is predominantly part-time, possesses mixed skills, and requires flexible shifts. Furthermore, the results highlight the MLMA’s ability to identify shift patterns that closely resemble historical schedules, underscoring its potential for practical implementation and its role in bridging the gap between research and real-world application.},

Finally, the study evaluates the performances of the proposed algorithms on 10 cases with different scales. The experimental results and statistical tests verify the efficiency of the local search operators. It is demonstrated that the four proposed RL algorithms can further improve algorithms’ performances.

  abstract     = {Dynamic constrained multiobjective optimization problems (DCMOPs) are characterized by the variations of both objectives and constraints over time, posing two main challenges: (1) balancing feasibility, convergence, and diversity in the evolutionary search and (2) generating an effective initial population for new environments. To address these problems, this paper proposes a dynamic constrained multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with feasibility-guided search and prediction (called FGSP), which integrates a feasibility-guided evolutionary search (FGES) and a feasible information guidance prediction (FIGP). Specifically, FGES adaptively adjusts evolutionary strategies by monitoring the proportion of infeasible solutions and a time-dependent tolerance threshold for infeasibility, such that it can perform exploration without constraints to navigate through large infeasible regions and conduct feasibility-driven exploitation to refine solutions near the constrained Pareto front, thereby balancing convergence, feasibility, and diversity. Concurrently, FIGP utilizes an artificial neural network trained on historically feasible solutions to predict a high-quality initial population for new environments, significantly accelerating adaptation to dynamic changes via pattern learned from past environments. After comparing the proposed FGSP with five state-of-the-art algorithms on the latest benchmark problems and one real-world problem, the experimental results validate the effectiveness of FGSP in obtaining feasible non-dominated solutions.},

Considering these challenges, this paper aims to reduce the makespan, cost, and total tardiness in Joint Scheduling of Virtual Machines and Prioritize Tasks (JSVPT) by a multi-objective optimization framework. We designed a novel Cluster-Based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA-CD/RLPD) framework, which includes a three-tier encoding scheme with Reinforcement Learning (RL)-guided local search, preselection, and dynamic resource allocation strategy to solve the problem. To guide the search process, we employ K-means clustering to decompose the population into diverse subgroups, promoting balanced exploration. The pre-selection mechanism uses a classifier to identify promising solutions in the decision space, which allows resources to be used effectively. Reinforcement learning adaptively selects intensification operators based on reward feedback, improving exploitation by intensifying promising regions of the search space. An Improved Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (ISPEA2) is incorporated to maintain a diverse and high-quality Pareto archive. The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed on multiple test instances covering different scales and benchmarked against five state-of-the-art Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms most existing algorithms in the literature.},

  abstract     = {Most prior studies on the Distributed Assembly Flowshop Scheduling Problem (DAFSP) presume infinite buffer capacity for assembly machines. However, in practical DAFSP, assembly buffers are often limited, potentially leading to a deadlock where buffers are full of jobs yet none of them can be assembled into a product. Since the deadlock in DAFSP is caused by incorrect jobs’ sequences in assembly buffers, we formulate a Petri net to model this entry process for the first time. Based on this Petri net model and improved Banker algorithm (IBA), we develop a polynomial-complexity algorithm IDAM to ensure the deadlock-free decoding of a DAFSP solution, which is coded by job and factory permutations. The makespan of such a solution is calculated backward to maintain its deadlock-free property. Furthermore, according to the proposed coding-decoding paradigm for deadlock-free solutions, we propose a hybrid cooperative co-evolution (HCCE) algorithm for DAFSP to minimize the makespan. Notably, our HCCE algorithm incorporates an elite archive (EAR) and two subpopulations. It employs problem-specific operators for heuristic initialization and global-search procedures, and four local-search operators are successively applied to every individual in the EAR. Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HCCE algorithm.},

  abstract     = {A high-quality ensemble strategy can effectively integrate several coefficients, mechanisms, and algorithms into a single framework. The adaptability, timing of intervention, and complementarity are the key factors to consider for the selected coefficients, mechanisms, and algorithms. In this study, two complementary variants based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), namely Modified PSO (MPSO) and Social Learning PSO (SLPSO), were selected, forming IMPSO and ISLPSO after improvements. IMPSO excels at exploration, while ISLPSO excels at exploitation. The Improved Novel Ratio Adaptation Scheme (INRAS) is employed as a selection strategy and provides the ability to abandon less-optimal particles. The Modified Nonlinear Population Size Reduction (MNLPSR) enables the extension of generations, allowing for more sufficient evolution in later stages. Due to the use of MNLPSR, an improved inertia weight and adaptive acceleration coefficients are introduced to ensure compatibility with the proposed algorithm. Additionally, an improved dynamic differential mutation strategy is designed not only to be compatible with the proposed algorithm but also to enhance particle diversity. Both the Improved Sine Cosine Algorithm (ISCA) and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), which focus on searching near the global best particles, are incorporated into the proposed ensemble strategy. This PSO-based variant is named the Effective Combination of Mechanisms for a PSO-based Ensemble Strategy (ECM-PSOES). Ablation experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the individual coefficients and mechanisms. The novel PSO-based variant was evaluated on the CEC2017 benchmarks and compared with 14 state-of-the-art PSO-based variants and 11 non-PSO algorithms. Additionally, to evaluate the flexible and robust capability of the proposed algorithm, three real-world applications for long-term Transmission Network Expansion Planning (TNEP), Planetary Gear Train Design (PGTD), and Robot Gripper Design (RGD) were tested. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm displays superior performance compared to recently proposed PSO-based variants and most non-PSO algorithms. However, the proposed algorithm falls short of outperforming Differential Evolution (DE)-based algorithms and still requires time to match the performance of top-tier metaheuristics.

The weight optimization method based on problem transformation can effectively address LSMOPs, demonstrating superior convergence compared to most evolutionary algorithms. However, existing problem transformation methods often fail to balance convergence and diversity, leading to get trapped in local optima. In order to effectively solve this problem, we propose an adaptive weight optimization algorithm based on variable grouping (GWOEA). The algorithm optimizes weights within groups to accelerate population convergence, while the adaptive control strategy boosts diversity, avoiding local optima and ensuring a balance between convergence and diversity during the optimization process. To reduce the size of solving LSMOPs, weight optimization is performed by grouping decision variables. The weights of variables within each group are first computed, and then these weights are directly optimized instead of the decision variables. The adaptive control strategy is designed to detect whether population evolution has stagnated and to handle stagnant populations, ensuring that the population retains its ability to explore. To evaluate the effectiveness of GWOEA, comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted on benchmark test problems, including variable sizes ranging from 500 to 5000. The results show that the proposed algorithm has relatively better optimization performance.},

  abstract     = {Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are fundamental to numerous real-world applications, ranging from logistics and scheduling to resource allocation. For solving CO problems, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a widely used metaheuristic that simulates cooperative foraging behavior to iteratively construct high-quality solutions. However, traditional ACO suffers from handcrafted heuristic functions that fail to generalize across different instances and uniform pheromone initialization, which results in inefficient exploration and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce G raph T ransformer G uided A nt C olony O ptimization- GTG-ACO , a novel approach that jointly learns both heuristic and initial pheromone matrices, enabling the model to generalize across diverse problem instances without manual tuning. Additionally, GTG-ACO employs Graph Transformer augmented with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network as the backbone for heuristic and pheromone learner. The Graph Transformers enable adaptive representation learning by leveraging attention mechanisms to dynamically capture structural relationships in graph representation of combinatorial optimization problems. Additionally, SE networks enhance the model by recalibrating feature importance, ensuring that critical information is amplified while suppressing less relevant features. Extensive evaluations on four combinatorial optimization problems—Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Single Machine Total Weighted Tardiness Problem (SMTWTP) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP)—demonstrate that GTG-ACO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines achieving improvements ranging from 1% to 56%. Furthermore, we validate its real-world applicability by evaluating it on benchmark datasets TSPLIB and CVRPLIB. Thus, GTG-ACO establishes itself as a powerful and generalizable framework by jointly learning heuristic and pheromone matrices, enabling more informed exploration, which leads to superior solution quality in combinatorial optimization problems.

  abstract     = {Path planning is crucial for UAV task execution, underpinning effective aerial reconnaissance and precision strikes. An ideal flight path must both minimize travel distance and reduce the risk of enemy detection or destruction. Due to the inherent trade-off between these objectives, multi-UAV path planning is conventionally formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. However, as the number of obstacles, threats, and UAVs increases, the computational complexity escalates, hindering the generation of optimal path planning solutions via conventional multiobjective optimization approaches. To address this challenge, we model a multiobjective multi-UAV path planning (MOMUPP) problem that simultaneously optimizes flight distance and threat cost, with the latter quantified using line-of-sight theory and terrain occlusion effects. We further construct an auxiliary task that approximates the MOMUPP problem and develop an evolutionary multitasking framework to facilitate effective knowledge transfer between tasks. Building on this framework, we propose the evolutionary multitasking multiobjective path planning (EMMOP) algorithm. EMMOP incorporates a double deep Q-networks-based adaptive operator selection (DAOS) mechanism that dynamically selects the optimal search operators for each task based on the current evolutionary state, thereby generating high-quality offspring. Additionally, a knowledge transfer strategy based on directional information extraction and knowledge fusion (KTDF) enables efficient exchange of critical information between the main and auxiliary tasks. Experiments on 15 benchmark instances across five map scenarios indicate that EMMOP outperforms five state-of-the-art methods, enhancing hypervolume by 2.46% and pure diversity by 28.27%, while generating shorter, safer, and collision-free UAV paths with diverse trade-off solutions for decision-makers.

Multi-objective optimization algorithms (MOAs) aim to find a Pareto front of optimal solutions, but selecting the best algorithm based on solution quality and computational efficiency remains challenging. This study comprehensively evaluates MOAs from different paradigms: swarm intelligence (CMOPSO), genetic algorithms (NSGA-II, DCNSGA-III), and decomposition-based approaches (CMOEA/D) for optimizing the gait cycle of a 25 DOF NAO humanoid robot during single support phase (SSP) and double support phase (DSP) scenarios. The algorithms’ convergence, diversity, and constraint-handling capabilities are systematically analyzed in solving the gait generation problem. The bi-objective optimization simultaneously minimizes power consumption and maximizes dynamic stability subject to eight functional constraints with 12-13 decision parameters. Through performance evaluation using running inverted generational distance (IGD) and hypervolume (HV) metrics across eleven independent runs of each algorithm, NSGA-II emerges as the most suitable algorithm, demonstrating superior convergence and solution quality, while CMOPSO shows competitive performance with faster initial convergence. DCNSGA-III exhibits moderate performance with constraint-handling difficulties, and CMOEA/D demonstrates poor convergence characteristics requiring significantly more computational resources. Two distinct knee regions emerge during both SSP and DSP, representing optimal trade-off solutions, with a systematic framework provided for practitioners to select appropriate gait parameters based on operational priorities. The running IGD metric combined with HV validation demonstrates effectiveness in providing robust algorithmic insights, enabling practitioners to select suitable algorithms for similar complex real-world optimization problems.},

To address this problem, previous research proposed the concept of Repelling Restart and developed RR-CMA-ES, but issues remain regarding rigid repulsion and gradient information of local basin structures. Building on this foundation, we propose an Adaptive Landscape-aware Repelling Restart CMA-ES (ALR-CMA-ES) that enhances the original RR-CMA-ES through three key improvements: 1) A fitness sensitive dynamic exclusion mechanism that adaptively adjusts tabu region radius based on local optimality and convergence frequency, prioritizing avoidance of high-quality basins; 2) A covariance matrix mechanism preserving convergence history to geometrically align hyper-ellipsoidal exclusion regions with explored local basin landscapes; 3) A Boltzmann-like probabilistic acceptance scheme incorporating exclusion regions, permit- ting controlled exploration near tabu boundaries. Experiments on the BBOB benchmark demonstrate that ALR-CMA-ES outperforms RR-CMA-ES in 90% of tested problems spanning 2D to 50D. This method provides a practical solution for expensive black-box optimization by systematically integrating landscape topology awareness into tabu mechanisms, while proposing a new solution for multimodal optimization problems.},

  abstract     = {Driven by the “dual carbon” strategic goals, the coordinated optimization of energy consumption and production efficiency has become a core issue for manufacturing industries. As an important means to promote energy structure transformation, electric substitution has made significant progress in industrial manufacturing, transportation, household electrification, and other fields. Among them, industrial production accounts for over 60% of the total electric energy substitution, becoming the largest electricity consumer. Note that the electricity price is based on time-of-use pricing (TOU), meanwhile, electric consumption is related to the machine multi-state (MM). Regarding these matters, this study focuses on determining sensible machine states and formulating reasonable production scheduling plan, to minimize both production time and power consumption. First, a novel energy-efficient flexible job shop scheduling problem is developed, which considers both the TOU strategy and the MM conditions (EFJSP-MM-TOU). Second, a self-learning classification-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (SCMOEA) is proposed to solve the EFJSP-MM-TOU. In specific, the SCMOEA enhances population diversity through a hybrid initialization strategy, adopts a dynamic selection of cross individuals based on the self-learning classification mechanism to improve the search efficiency, and designs four local search operators to increase the potential for approaching better positions. Third, by employing the MK standard dataset in EFJSP-MM-TOU, the proposed SCMOEA is compared with its three variants and five state-of-the-art algorithms to verify its optimization performance. The experimental results suggest that SCMOEA has advantages in terms of Pareto optimal solutions’ diversity and convergence. Finally, by testing in an actual enterprise case, the results further support the effectiveness of the EFJSP-MM-TOU and the significance of SCMOEA.},

Consequently, the performance of these offline learners is highly dependent on the dataset used. Still the questions of how this data is collected and what dataset characteristics are needed are not thoroughly investigated. Simultaneously, evolutionary methods have reemerged as a promising alternative to classic RL, leading to the field of evolutionary RL (EvoRL), combining the two learning paradigms to exploit their supplementary attributes. This study aims to join these research directions and examine the effects of Genetic Programming (GP) on dataset characteristics in RL and its potential to enhance the performance of offline RL algorithms. A comparative approach was employed, comparing Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and GP for data collection across multiple environments and collection modes. The exploration and exploitation capabilities of these methods were quantified and a comparative analysis was conducted to determine whether data collected through GP led to superior performance in multiple offline learners. The findings indicate that GP demonstrates strong and stable performance in generating high-quality experiences with competitive exploration. GP exhibited lower uncertainty in experience generation compared to DQN and produced high trajectory quality datasets across all environments. More offline algorithms showed statistically significant performance gains with GP-collected data than trained on DQN-collected trajectories. Furthermore, their performance was less dependent on the environment, as the GP consistently generated high-quality datasets. This study showcases the effective combination of GP's properties with offline learners, suggesting a promising avenue for future research in optimizing data collection for RL.},

The algorithm integrates five different search directions, including a multi-point direction constructed using principal component analysis. The integrated direction is generated by the weighted sum of the search directions. Theoretical analysis shows that under mild conditions, the rate of convergence along the weighted direction is no worse than the rate of convergence along the best of single search directions by a positive constant, or even faster in certain cases. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on three benchmark test suites by computer simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms seven state-of-the-art particle swarm optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) are prevalent in practical applications, yet existing methods often struggle to handle their diverse characteristics, such as disconnected feasible regions and infeasible solutions near the true constraints Pareto front (CPF). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a constraint-tightening based adaptive two-stage evolutionary algorithm (CT-TSEA) for CMOPs, incorporating a constraint boundary tightening strategy and parameter dynamic adjustment strategy. In the first stage, a constraint boundary tightening strategy based on evaluation counts guides the population toward feasible regions. Initially, constraint boundaries are relaxed to explore the solution space thoroughly, identifying promising solutions. As evaluations increase, the search boundaries shrink, enhancing the feasibility of solutions. Additionally, a step-size adaptive adjustment method improves infeasible solutions using their information, boosting search efficiency and solution diversity. The second stage introduces a dynamic adjustment method for crossover probability and scaling factor, balancing exploration and exploitation. It better balances the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the population. The proposed method is validated via comparing with seven state-of-the-art peer competitors across 59 test instances from four benchmark suites and 21 real-world problems. The corresponding results demonstrate that CT-TSEA has the higher competitiveness in addressing complex CMOPs.},

  abstract     = {Most real-world optimization problems are poorly understood, some of which are black-box optimization problems (BBOPs). Exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) paves the way for algorithm design to deal with BBOPs. Existing ELA methods have limitations on unseen problems and lack analysis on the problem itself. To this end, this study introduces a novel ELA framework leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) upon BBOP’s surrogate model. Specifically, a neural network surrogate model is constructed whose architecture is utilized to represent BBOP in the form of graph. Then, GNN is responsible for capturing the relationships between the graph-represented BBOP and high-level features. As one of the most notable features in optimization, multimodality of multi-objective problems is to be identified for illustration. More than 99% accuracy on independent test set demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework with simultaneously avoiding the effect of problem dimensions.},

  abstract     = {Coordination optimization plays a vital role in complex multi-agent systems, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a widely adopted solution. However, MARL still faces significant challenges in this domain, including low coordination efficiency and inaccurate value estimation. To address these issues, we propose MVAPO, a novel Multi-Head Joint Value Attention-based Policy Optimization algorithm that improves policy learning through enhanced value approximation and selective attention to agent contributions. The key innovation of MVAPO lies in the introduction of a joint value network augmented with a multi-head attention mechanism. In this mechanism, context-aware team rewards serve as query inputs, directing attention to the most relevant agents in different situations. This allows the model to dynamically focus on the agents that are most critical at any given time, thus improving coordination efficiency and the accuracy of value estimates. Furthermore, MVAPO incorporates feedforward and residual layers, eliminating linear and monotonic constraints, which significantly enhances its representational capacity. Extensive experiments on a multi-UAV benchmark across a variety of scenarios demonstrate that MVAPO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reward acquisition and win rates, highlighting its superior performance and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents Dynamic Archive with Adaptive Multi-Operator Differential Evolution (DA2MODE), a new algorithm that aims to boost the performance of meta-heuristic and evolutionary methods in numerical optimization. DA2MODE introduces a Progressive Adaptive Selector with Exponential Smoothing (PASES), which dynamically updates the selection probabilities of both mutation and crossover operators. Unlike prior approaches that emphasize only mutation operators or rely on short-term success within the current generation, PASES adapts based on cumulative operator performance over time, thus favoring the best-performing operators more reliably. DA2MODE employs an Adaptive Non-Elite Archive Update (ANEAU) mechanism that injects a controlled fraction of non-elite solutions into the archive. ANEAU promotes early exploration, which is gradually reduced to strengthen exploitation. Additionally, the control parameters (crossover probability and mutation factor) are automatically tuned in DA2MODE, allowing full adaptivity of both operator selection and parameter control. Extensive experiments on the CEC2017/2018, CEC2020-2022, and 1000-dimensional CEC2013 benchmarks, along with four real-world engineering design problems, confirm that DA2MODE consistently outperforms 33 competitive algorithms, including CEC winners and recent advanced DE variants. It achieves top performance across all statistical tests, demonstrating superior convergence speed and final accuracy. These results establish DA2MODE as a robust, scalable, and reliable algorithm for solving complex numerical optimization problems. The source code of the DA2MODE algorithm is publicly available at: URL https://github.com/MohamedRedaMu/DA2MODE-Algorithm and URL https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/182019-da2mode-algorithm .},

  abstract     = {Existing attention-based methods for large-scale multi-objective optimization (LMOAM) focus only on decision variables, using their variance to guide search behavior. However, single-space strategies ignore critical information in the objective space and the diversity and search efficiency are often degraded for solving multimodal multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs). To address this problem, a novel large-scale optimization framework that integrates a dual-space attention mechanism is proposed in this paper. Different from building attention only with information in decision space, a dual-space Key matrix that quantifies variable importance by combining decision-variable and objective-space distributions is first designed in the framework to refine the precision of the attention. Subsequently, a cross-space clustering method is adopted to select the representative solutions by analyzing the characteristics of individuals in both spaces to construct the Query matrix. The accuracy of attention allocation is improved. Finally, A linear inverse mapping strategy is used to enhance the diversity of the population by translating promising objective-space solutions back to the decision space. Unlike existing approaches, the characteristics of decision and objective space are linked with a new attention mechanism, and the exploration and exploitation of the population are well balanced. Three types of experiments are designed on two benchmark test sets with 500-dimensional and 1000-dimensional decision variables and the voltage transformer optimization problem to demonstrate the efficacy of the AIDF framework, experimental results indicate that AIDF surpasses comparative algorithms in terms of the average performance of IGD and HV.},

  abstract     = {Representing and controlling the dynamics of stigmergic substances used by bio-inspired approaches pose significant challenges when applied to robotics. In order to overcome this challenge, this work proposes a framework based on the virtualisation and control of these substances at a local scope, with the primary goal of coordinating robot swarms. This framework introduces a novel pheromone representation that enables decentralisation and decision asynchronicity, while its lightweight design ensures accessibility to resource-constrained platforms. Each robot maintains an independent virtual pheromone map in its memory, which is continuously updated through its own pheromone deposits and evaporation. Additionally, each robot’s pheromone map is also updated by aggregating information from other robots that are exploring nearby areas. Consequently, individual and independent maps eliminate the need for a centralised agent to manage and distribute pheromone information. This propagation mechanism is inspired by ants’ vibroacoustic communication, which is characterised as a form of indirect communication. The framework was evaluated using an agent-based mass simulation tool and a real-world simulation platform. Experiments were conducted to validate the framework in diverse environments, with variations in shapes, sizes, and the number of robots. Results demonstrated that this proposal can effectively perform the coordination of robot swarms, and the robots have exhibited satisfactory performance while executing the surveillance task.},
