  abstract     = {This paper explores the stability issue of stochastic McKean–Vlasov equations (SMVEs) through an innovative method: stabilization via stochastic delay feedback control with discrete observation. Unlike conventional techniques, this approach leverages historical states instead of solely relying on the current state, setting it apart from traditional stochastic feedback controls. The study examines how the diffusion term contributes to enhancing system stability despite the presence of random fluctuations and delays, guaranteeing both p -th moment exponential stability and almost sure exponential stability under a specific delay threshold δ * . The primary contributions of this work include introducing a novel stability analysis framework utilizing stochastic delay feedback control, constructing Lyapunov functions that incorporate both state and distribution, and providing insights into asymptotic and moment exponential stability. Although identifying the optimal delay δ * remains a practical challenge, the theoretical foundation laid in this study offers valuable guidance for real-world applications.},

  abstract     = {The concurrent outbreak of epidemics has become a great threat to public health. An important problem is how individuals can protect themselves as the mandated protective measures are relaxed. Previous studies developed various models to investigate the correlated spreading dynamics of concurrent epidemics and the protective measures against them. However, a critical oversight remains that people’s risk perceptions on multiple epidemics are also correlated or even collaborated. In this paper, we build an SS-IS-SI-II coupled model in a multilayer network to describe two concurrent epidemics, integrating collaborated risk perception and spontaneous social distancing as individuals’ self-protection. Moreover, an adjustable coefficient is proposed to describe different levels of inter-epidemic correlations (competition/independence/cooperation). It is found that increasing the levels of inter-epidemic correlation will increase the infected density of both epidemics. Collaborated risk perception is generally more effective in reducing infections across different levels of inter-epidemic correlation, compared with independent risk perception. But its effect is dependent. For one epidemic, when its infectivity is very high or the infectivity of the other epidemic is very low, the effect of collaborated risk perception will be largely reduced. Based on the model, we further investigate the minimum social distancing required to contain epidemics under different conditions, and the priority on different layers is also explored. This research extends existing literature on co-evolutional epidemic dynamics, and lay a foundation to model correlated risk perceptions against epidemics. The results provide implications for individuals to take self-protection against concurrent epidemics.},

  abstract     = {Cooperation is a key issue attracting widespread attention across various fields. Emotions and expectations jointly participate in the decision-making process, and are key factors influencing the evolution of cooperation. Therefore, this paper proposes a game evolution model that considers the dual influences of emotions and expectations. In the model, a player’s initial strategy depends on their emotions. Subsequently, expectations influence the decision-making process, altering the player’s initial strategy to the current strategy. Specifically, high expectations lead players to maintain their initial strategy, whereas low expectations prompt them to change strategies. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner’s dilemma and the influence of expectations. Simulation results show that under high betrayal temptation, players with loneliness and defection would change their initial strategy to cooperation due to low expectations, while those players who initially gather with cooperation strategies maintain the cooperation strategies due to higher expectations, ultimately increasing the cooperation fraction and payoff of the population. Therefore, expectations effectively enhance the cooperation level and payoff of the population. When the scale of individuals changing their strategies based on expectations (ICSE) is large, the effect of expectations on enhancing cooperation and payoff is more pronounced. Frequent consideration of anticipated initial strategy changes also yields the same effect. Additionally, mechanisms of the influence of emotion on payoff, direct emotion interaction and the influence of strategy on emotion collectively contribute to enhancing the significantly evolutionary advantage of friendly emotions and cooperation strategies. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of expectations in the evolution of emotions and cooperation, laying the groundwork for enhancing social cooperation through expectation management.},

In this work, we extend Zernike-like orthogonal functions to these non-standard geometries using diffeomorphic mappings and construct sampling patterns that preserve favorable numerical conditioning. We provide theoretical bounds for the condition numbers of the resulting collocation matrices and validate them through extensive numerical experiments. As a practical application, we demonstrate accurate wavefront interpolation and reconstruction in segmented mirror telescopes composed of hexagonal facets. Our results show that appropriately transferred sampling configurations, especially Optimal Concentric Sampling and Lebesgue points , allow stable high-order interpolation and effective wavefront modeling in complex optical systems.

  abstract     = {When an epidemic spreads through a population, related information also spreads concurrently, prompting individuals to adopt protective behaviours (e.g., washing hands). Collective behaviour has been shown to play a critical role in shaping the dynamics of epidemic spreading, and higher-order networks offer a natural framework to describe such group interactions in social contact networks. Yet, the interplay between epidemic and information dynamics on higher-order structures is not fully understood, further limiting our understanding of the optimal information spreading strategy for containing epidemic spreading.In this study, we first construct a higher-order multiplex network framework based on simplicial complexes. Then, a coevolutionary spreading model is proposed, integrating epidemic spreading and information spreading on simplicial complexes. The epidemic spreads through both lower-order (pairwise) and higher-order (group) interactions, while information spreads through lower-order interactions in a degree-preferential manner. Using an extended Microscopic Markov Chain Approach, we analytically derive the dynamical equations of the system and compute the basic reproduction number using the next-generation matrix method. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical simulations of the spreading process across various parameter regimes. Our results demonstrate the role of higher-order infections in promoting epidemics. Although information spreading generally suppresses the spread of most epidemics, it can paradoxically enhance the spread of certain epidemics with a very low spreading capacity. Increases in the recovery probabilities of both the disease and the information can weaken the promoting effect of higher-order infection and enhance the suppressive effect of the information. For certain epidemics with weak spreading capabilities but strong recovery capabilities, the spread of information can completely suppress the outbreak of the disease, while the enhancement of higher-order infections can promote the outbreak of these diseases. By analysing the effects of different information spreading strategies on epidemic spreading, we find that the optimal strategy for containing the epidemic is to allow information to spread without degree preference.},

Fourth, equilibrium outcomes are proportionally fair, ensuring balanced allocation across agents.

In this paper, we investigate the edge-heterogeneous binary network game, a more general framework that incorporates heterogeneity into agent interactions. We establish two sufficient equilibrium conditions under asynchronous best-response dynamics from different perspectives. The first condition requires underlying symmetry in interactions between neighboring agents, integrating and generalizing three classical convergence situations in binary network games. The second condition focuses on network balance, positing that equilibrium is achievable if the coordination value network of a game is structurally balanced. Additionally, for games meeting this condition, we develop a method to predict the final state based on initial state information. These results reveal factors that steer edge-heterogeneous binary network games towards equilibrium, providing valuable insights for controlling such highly nonlinear systems. Lastly, we extend the analysis to higher-order network games and propose an equilibrium condition for edge-heterogeneous 2-order network games.},

  abstract     = {With a view to addressing the optimal control problem of multiplayer game nonlinear systems, an event-triggered prescribed performance control method based on the fusion of integral reinforcement learning (IRL) and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is proposed. Firstly, an auxiliary prescribed performance function (PPF) is designed to transform the original system into an unconstrained one. Drawing on the concepts of game theory, the multi-input optimal control problem is reformulated as a mixed zero-sum (MZS) game problem. Subsequently, an IRL-based event-triggered control (ETC) method is designed with a triggering condition. In this event-triggered method, ETC is updated only when the event-triggering condition is met, which reduces unnecessary communication overhead. On the basis of IRL, a critic-only neural network (NN) is established to approximate solutions of the event-triggered Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations without using the dynamic knowledge of the system. Additionally, the Lyapunov stability theorem is employed to ensure the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the system state and neural network weights. And the Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, an example is provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper.},

  abstract     = {An efficient numerical method is proposed to address a stochastic time-fractional cable equation driven by fractionally integrated additive noise. Under the reasonable assumptions, we rigorously establish for the first time, the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the mild solution for this equation. For spatial discretization, a semi-discrete scheme is constructed employing the Galerkin FEM, and the optimal spatial error estimate is derived based on the semigroup approach. In temporal discretization, a piecewise constant function is introduced to approximate the noise, leading to the formulation of a regularized stochastic time-fractional cable equation. A detailed proof of the temporal error estimates is provided via the semigroup approach. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the temporal convergence order attains O ( τ 1 / 2 ) for initial data of either smooth or non-smooth type. The order is independent of the parameters α 1 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , α 2 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , and β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) in the equation. These results perfectly align with the theoretical predictions.},

The presence of non-affine faults poses considerable challenges to the stability and performance of the system. To address these challenges, in this article, an adaptive neural network (NN) control scheme is devised within the identifier-critic-actor architecture, enabling the approximation of unknown dynamics and the design of both virtual and actual optimal controllers. In addition, Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLFs) are utilized to ensure stability while handling state constraints, and a Butterworth low-pass filter is introduced to compensate for high-frequency noise and non-affine nonlinear faults, enhancing system robustness. Furthermore, a novel hybrid event-triggered control (HETC) strategy is proposed to reduce communication and computation demands while optimizing resource utilization. The suggested control strategy guarantees the boundedness of closed-loop signals and keeps all state variables within predefined compact sets. Lastly, the efficacy of the proposed optimal control method is demonstrated through simulation results.},

The variable arterial wall rigidity and the equilibrium cross-sectional area are incorporated within the so-called tube law that gives rise to an internal pressure term. This system can be written as a conservative hyperbolic system for five unknowns. An entropy stable scheme for this augmented one-dimensional blood flow model is developed based on entropy conservative numerical flux. It is proved that the proposed scheme is well-balanced in the sense that it preserves both trivial (zero velocity) and non-trivial (non-zero velocity) steady-state solutions. Several demanding numerical tests show that the scheme can handle various kinds of shocks and preserves stationary solutions when geometrical and mechanical properties of the vessel are variable.},

To utilize limited communication resources, a complex-valued switching event-triggered mechanism is introduced. Furthermore, to mitigate the effects of complex-valued hybrid attacks, consisting of complex-valued replay attacks and deception attacks following the Bernoulli distribution, a secure controller is designed that can simultaneously counteract the interference caused by residual terms in the error systems. On this basis, a piecewise Lyapunov functional is constructed, and the sufficient condition for achieving MSES under complex-valued hybrid attacks is derived using Lyapunov stability theory and inequality techniques. Based on the derived synchronization criterion, algorithms are proposed to determine the maximum allowable replay and deception attack rates of the system.

In the majority of prior research concerning evolutionary games, it is commonly posited that external influences are absent, thereby allowing for an exclusive examination of the system’s intrinsic evolution. However, the situation in the real world is complex, dynamic, and unstable. Therefore, this paper proposes introducing an external shock that compels a change in the rate of cooperation during the evolutionary process. This approach aims to simulate environmental changes in the real world and to observe how these changes impact the rate of cooperation. When facing external shocks, the reputation mechanism has a certain degree of recovery ability, which provides certain support for the reputation theory. This paper also adds the mechanism of learning from historical strategies to the traditional reputation model, optimizing the resilience of the reputation mechanism in the face of external shocks. Simulation results show that history learning can promote the recovery of a cooperative environment faster and more stably, short memory length strengthens the role of temptation to defect, long memory amplifies the impact of the initial state, and the joint effect of history learning rate and memory length is complex.},

In this article, we construct a coupled competition mechanism to explore the impact of competition between the two types of perceptions. Specifically, individuals’ differing perceptions of social dilemmas are modeled by the snowdrift game ( S D G ) and the prisoner’s dilemma game ( P D G ), differing perceptions of payoffs are captured by conformists and imitators. Extensive simulations show that the coupled competition mechanism markedly promotes cooperation. P D G players are substantially less competitive than S D G players, which dominate the population. Conformists act as an amplifier, inclined to choose cooperation when cooperators are dominant, thus further promoting cooperation levels. When defectors are dominant, conformists may temporarily choose to defect in the short term, but defection is unsustainable due to lower average accumulated payoffs. We further find that intensified competition among imitators weakens the competitiveness of conformists and diminishes their positive impact on cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of different proportions of conformists, network structures, and noise levels on the main results to verify the robustness of the model.},

The agents need to not only form a predefined formation pattern but also track the leader’s trajectory in a prescribed time. A hierarchical control framework, which includes the communication layer and the tracking control layer, is established to address the formulated issue. In the communication layer, a distributed prescribed-time observer is established to accurately estimate the leader’s information, which can make observation error convergences to zero in a prescribed time. In particular, the leaders’ uncertainties are solved by constructing a novel adaptive law. With the estimated results, a novel transformation relationship and the prescribed-time adjustment function are constructed to guarantee that formation tracking error converges to the predefined accuracy in a prescribed time. Subsequently, the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with the fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) is devised to optimize system performance. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that the formation errors ξ i , 1 = x i , 1 − y ^ 0 , i − η i , d are consistently confined within an interval ( tan ( − π 2 μ 2 ) , tan ( π 2 μ 2 ) ) , while all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded. Ultimately, the superiority of the devised algorithm is demonstrated by a representative example.},

The accuracy of the interpolation depends on a parameter called the shape parameter . There are many approaches in the literature on how to appropriately choose it to increase the accuracy of interpolation while avoiding stability issues. However, finding the optimal shape parameter remains a challenge in general. We introduce a new method for determining the shape parameter in RBFs. First, we construct an optimization problem to obtain a shape parameter that leads to a bounded condition number for the interpolation matrix, then, we introduce a data-driven method that controls the condition number of the interpolation matrix to avoid numerically unstable interpolations, while keeping good accuracy. In addition, a fallback procedure is proposed to enforce a strict upper bound on the condition number, as well as a learning strategy to improve the performance of the data-driven method by learning from previously run simulations. Several numerical results are presented to demonstrate the robustness of our strategy in both 1- and 2-dimensional spaces.},

Traditional methods like Fuzzy TSVM and KNN-based weighting fail to simultaneously capture both global positional relationships and local density characteristics of data points. Our proposed gravitational weighting function innovatively models data samples as masses influenced by their distance from class centroids and neighborhood density, effectively prioritizing representative points while suppressing outliers. The optimization framework uniquely incorporates angular constraints between hyperplanes to enhance structural risk control and generalization capability. For scalability, we reformulate the solution into a linear system solvable via conjugate gradient methods, avoiding computationally expensive matrix inversions. Comprehensive evaluations on 92 datasets (including synthetic, noisy, medical, text, and large-scale NDC benchmarks) demonstrate GLSTSVM-CIL’s superior performance, particularly in minority-class recognition where it achieves average F1-Score improvements over baseline methods. The model maintains robust Accuracy under high noise (20 %) and extreme class imbalance (ratio 20:1) while ables to process datasets up to 50,000 samples.},

  abstract     = {Graph signal approximation plays a key role in processing irregularly distributed data on graphs, where achieving smooth and computationally efficient interpolation is essential. In this work, we introduce a new approach that combines a spectral community detection technique with the partition of unity method (PUM) applied to signal approximation on graphs. The PUM provides an effective technique for handling irregularly distributed data by dividing the graph into smaller subgraphs, constructing local interpolants and combining them to produce a global approximation. Since the first step in the PUM consists in dividing the graph into disjoint communities, we focus in particular on exploring and testing some community detection algorithms based on the maximization of the modularity. Then, we integrate the PUM with a local graph basis function approximation scheme, resulting in an accurate and computationally efficient approach for graph signal approximation.},

  abstract     = {During the disease transmission, the virus may mutate and novel strains appear. That causes the reduction of the immune effect of the vaccine against the original strain, and the vaccinated individuals may also be infected, which would lead to the generation and dissemination of negative vaccine information. However, the coupled dynamics of multi-strain disease and negative vaccine information has not yet been comprehensively investigated. In this paper, we consider both the original and mutant strains of the disease and introduce vaccination behavior in the propagation process to expand the classic susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model into five states: susceptible, vaccinated, infected by original strain, infected by mutant strain and recovered. Then, a two-layer network model is proposed to describe the coupled propagation dynamics of the negative vaccine information and the two-strain disease, and the epidemic outbreak thresholds of the two-strain disease are derived by using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Subsequently, the numerical results derived from the MMCA are compared with those from Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation to validate the correctness of the former. Finally, the phase diagrams and time history curves are presented to conduct parametric studies on the epidemic thresholds and information-disease transmission dynamics, such as the vaccination cost, vaccine effectiveness and the negative vaccine information. This research demonstrates that reducing the vaccination cost and enhancing the positive publicity of vaccine can effectively prevent the disease spreading when the infection rate of the mutant strain is low. If this infection rate is large, the effective measure is developing specific vaccines against the mutant strain to improve the vaccination efficacy. Those findings provide valuable strategies for the authorities to make appropriate disease prevention measures.},

Automatic adjoint differentiation (AAD) is employed for efficient evaluations of products of vectors and the Jacobian matrix of the right hand side of the ODE system. This approach avoids the low-level drawbacks of the black box approach of employing AAD on the entire ODE solver and opens the possibility to leverage parallelization. SIMD vectorization is employed to compute the vector-Jacobian products concurrently.

A tiling of R is a placement of dominoes (a pair of adjacent squares) so that there are no gaps or overlaps. The flip graph of R is a graph whose vertices are all tilings of R and two tilings are adjacent if we can obtain one from another by a flip ( 90 ∘ rotation of a pair of side-by-side dominoes). By using graph-theoretical approach, we prove that the flip graph of 2 m × ( 2 n + 1 ) quadriculated cylinder is still connected, but that of 2 m × ( 2 n + 1 ) quadriculated torus consists of two isomorphic components. For a tiling t , we associate an integer, called forcing number, as the minimum number of dominoes in t that is contained in no other tilings. As a consequence, we obtain that the forcing numbers of all tilings in 2 m × ( 2 n + 1 ) quadriculated cylinder and torus form respectively an integer interval whose maximum value is ( n + 1 ) m .},

While every connected graph admits a Hamilton walk, existence of a reduced Hamilton walk is not guaranteed for all graphs. However, we prove that a reduced Hamilton walk does exist in a connected graph with minimal valency at least 2. Furthermore, given such a graph on n vertices, we present an O ( n 2 ) -time algorithm that constructs a reduced Hamilton walk of length at most n ( n + 3 ) / 2 . Specifically, for a graph belonging to a family of regular expander graphs, we can find a reduced Hamilton walk of length at most c ( 6 n − 2 ) log n + 2 n , where c is a constant independent of n .},

  abstract     = {The Kirchhoff index K f ( G ) of a connected graph G is defined as the sum of resistance distances between all pairs of vertices in G . We say that v ∈ V ( G ) is a good vertex if the Kirchhoff index remains unchanged when v is removed, i.e. K f ( G ) = K f ( G − v ) . In 1991, Šoltés studied the Wiener index of a graph and posed the problem of identifying graphs for which the removal of an arbitrary vertex preserves the Wiener index. In this paper, we explore a similar concept: identifying Kirchhoff Šoltés graphs , i.e. graphs in which all vertices are good vertices. We show that the cycle C 5 is a Kirchhoff Šoltés graph. Due to the challenge of finding more examples of such graphs, we shift our focus to several relaxed versions of the Kirchhoff Šoltés problem, where the primary objective is to identify graphs containing at least one good vertex. One of them is the β - Kirchhoff Šoltés problem , which seeks to find an infinite family of graphs in which the proportion of good vertices is at least β , with β ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] being a specified rational number. Another one involves constructing infinite families of graphs where the proportion of good vertices increases and asymptotically approaches a given real number γ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] as the order of the graph grows. We demonstrate that both relaxed versions have infinitely many solutions. In particular, we prove the existence of infinitely many graphs for which the proportion β of good vertices, 1 / 7 ≤ β < 1 / 5 tends to a certain irrational number. Furthermore, we prove the existence of infinitely many graphs with half good vertices, and for each s ∈ N , we construct an infinite family of graphs whose proportion of good vertices tends to s + 1 2 s + 1 . These findings could be pivotal in addressing the original problem of determining whether there are additional solutions beyond C 5 .},

Firstly, given that the complete data transmission between CN nodes can not be always realized in practice, the system model of CNs with partial information exchange is specifically introduced. Then, considering the limitation of communication bandwidth, weighted try-once-discard (WTOD) protocol is utilized to enhance the signal transmission efficiency within each node. The delivery of the data adhered to WTOD protocol is further assumed to be compromised by false-data-injection (FDI) attack, which is a well-recognized risk in communication networks. Afterward, distributed secure observer-based synchronization controllers are designed accordingly. Based on defining the observation and synchronization errors, an augmented system model is then established, and the gain matrices for observers and controllers are obtained through an analysis of the stability conditions of the augmented system. Lastly, a numerical example is provided to validate the proposed method’s effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {Flow interaction between a plain-fluid region in contact with a porous layer attracted significant attention from modelling and analysis sides due to numerous applications in biology, environment and industry. In the most widely used coupled model, fluid flow is described by the Stokes equations in the free-flow domain and Darcy’s law in the porous medium, and complemented by the appropriate interface conditions. However, traditional coupling concepts are restricted, with a few exceptions, to one-dimensional flows parallel to the fluid–porous interface. In this work, we use an alternative approach to model interaction between the plain-fluid domain and porous medium by considering a transition zone, and propose the full- and hybrid-dimensional Stokes–Brinkman–Darcy models. In the first case, the equi-dimensional Brinkman equations are considered in the transition region, and the appropriate interface conditions are set on the top and bottom of the transition zone. In the latter case, we perform a dimensional model reduction by averaging the Brinkman equations in the normal direction and using the proposed transmission conditions. The well-posedness of both coupled problems is proved, and some numerical simulations are carried out in order to validate the concepts.},

  abstract     = {Drawing on the idea of leader-follower game theory, this paper investigates the evolution of cooperative behavior in two-layer grid networks. The two-layer network is divided into a leader layer (upper layer) and a follower layer (lower layer), where the snowdrift game (SDG) and the prisoner’s dilemma game (PDG) are conducted, respectively. Based on an updating mechanism of the modified Fermi probability function that incorporates strategy alignment, the leader layer first completes strategy update, and the follower layer then updates its strategy after acquiring information from the upper layer via perception probability. Numerical simulations reveal that the cost-benefit ratio significantly influences the differences in perception strategies between layers. Specifically, at lower ratios, there is a positive correlation between followers’ cooperation and their perception probability, whereas leaders exhibit a negative correlation. The opposite trends are observed at higher ratios. Compared with single-layer networks, the leader-follower structure with two-layer networks significantly enhances the cooperation in the follower layer and also lightly fosters the cooperation in leader layer. Additionally, factors such as inter-layer coupling strength, rewards and punishments for strategy consistency, and selection intensity all promote the emergence of cooperation to varying degrees. This leader-follower hierarchical game offers a new research paradigm for interaction mechanisms in complex social systems.},

  abstract     = {With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence, the integration of evolutionary game theory and reinforcement learning has become a hot research frontier in the last years. Evolutionary game theory provides a mathematical framework for depicting the strategy interaction among individuals, traditionally based on pre-defined, rule-based strategy update protocols. In contrast, reinforcement learning enables agents to adaptively select optimal actions through trial-and-error learning, hence better reflecting real-world decision-making. These complementary features create the foundation for their convergence. Our paper presents a didactic review of contemporary reinforcement learning applications in evolutionary game theory, focusing on those recently published works which open novel research paths to enrich our understanding of mutualistic cooperation. We summarize major concepts and terms, including the basic problem of collective cooperation, modeling of complex population dynamics, influence of algorithmic parameters, and the combination of deep learning. Finally, we discuss prospects for this interdisciplinary field, emphasizing the importance of intelligent learning through the lens of evolutionary game.},

For discretization, we adopt the Kansa method, also known as the kernel-based collocation method, combined with time-stepping. This approach ensures that the critical structural feature of energy conservation is maintained over time by embedding a quadratic constraint into the definition of the numerical solution. To address the computational challenges posed by the nonlinearity in the Hamiltonian wave equations and the EC constraint, we propose a fast iterative solver based on the Newton method with successive linearization. This novel solver significantly accelerates the computation, making the method highly effective for practical applications. Numerical comparisons with the traditional secant methods highlight the competitive performance of our scheme. These results demonstrate that our method not only conserves the energy but also offers a promising new direction for solving Hamiltonian wave equations more efficiently. While we focus on the Kansa method and corresponding convergence theories in this study, the proposed solver is based solely on linear algebra techniques and has the potential to be applied to EC constrained optimization problems arising from other PDE discretization methods.},

Furthermore, by suitably adding some parameters α i within these schemes, we show that it is still possible to get positivity, and also to preserve other qualitative properties of the exact solution. In fact, for each particular problem we can get optimal values of α i that guarantee positivity, elementary stability and the minimization of the local truncation error, being possible to achieve also third order nonstandard schemes, which are not present in the literature. As an example of use, we employ the developed theory to derive positive and elementary stable NSFD methods of order one, two and three for a predator-prey model, showing their advantages over other nonstandard methods from the literature.},

To this end, this paper proposes a variable structure encoding-decoding scheme (VS-EDS), which includes an encoder with a unitary signal generator and a corresponding decoder with an adaptive activation module. The advantages of the proposed VS-EDS are mainly in three aspects. First, it avoids the need for existing methods to perform a large amount of statistical work on the statistics of fading gains before the system runs. Second, it can eliminate the communication errors caused by fading. At the same time, it can adapt to the changing communication network environment. In addition, in order to achieve consensus control, a distributed protocol based on the VS-EDS is designed. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the VS-EDS are demonstrated through comparative simulations.},

  abstract     = {The present work addresses the challenge of training neural networks for Dynamic Initial Margin (DIM) computation in counterparty credit risk, a task traditionally burdened by the high costs associated with generating training datasets through nested Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. By condensing the initial market state variables into an input vector, determined through an interest rate model and a parsimonious parameterization of the current interest rate term structure, we construct a training dataset where the labels are future realizations, generated with a single MC path, of the Initial Margin (IM) variable. Since DIM is defined as the conditional expectation of IM, the latter can be understood as noisy and unbiased samples of DIM, allowing the application of deep learning regression techniques to its computation. To this end, a multi-output neural network structure is employed to handle DIM as a time-dependent function, facilitating training across a mesh of monitoring times. This methodology offers significant advantages: it reduces the dataset generation cost to a single MC execution and parameterizes the neural network by initial market state variables, obviating the need for repeated training. Experimental results demonstrate the approach’s convergence properties and robustness across different interest rate models (Hull-White and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross) and portfolio complexities, validating its general applicability and efficiency in more realistic scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Accurately computing sensitivities of Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) is crucial for analyzing the dynamic behavior of structures by enabling quantifying the impact that variations in geometry, material properties, and boundary conditions have on their dynamic response. However, one of the primary challenges in calculating accurate sensitivities lies in the numerical differentiation required to estimate the sensitivities of the FRFs. This paper presents a new method called the Hypercomplex Spectral Finite Elements Method (HYPAD-SFEM). HYPAD-SFEM combines the HYPercomplex Automatic Differentiation method (HYPAD) with the Spectral Finite Elements Method (SFEM) to compute highly accurate arbitrary-order sensitivities of the FRFs. To demonstrate and verify the method's performance and accuracy, we analyzed a truss structure under a harmonic axial load and compared the results with analytical equations, Finite Differences (FD), and traditional Automatic Differentiation (AD). Excellent agreement was observed between the computed displacements and their sensitivities, considering material properties, geometry, and boundary conditions. The application of HYPAD-SFEM was then extended to a more complex problem by performing shape sensitivity analysis of the dynamic behavior of a phononic lattice. Again, excellent agreement was found between HYPAD, FD and AD. In general, the proposed HYPAD-SFEM ensures high accuracy independent of the perturbation step selection, alleviating FD’s fundamental issues. Moreover, HYPAD-SFEM delivers superior computational performance when compared with traditional AD. Hence, HYPAD-SFEM provides an effective approach for FRF sensitivity analysis, facilitating design optimization, parameter tuning, robustness analysis, and model updating and validation in structural dynamics.},

Individuals adopting such solutions do not free ride on the cooperative efforts of others; rather, they act just sufficiently to prevent adverse consequences for themselves. We hypothesize that individual solutions function analogously to the defection strategy in the stag hunt game. This study examines the effects of orthodox free riding and individual solutions on the evolution of cooperation. Our analysis reveals that in well-mixed populations, the only stable rest point is the one in which all players opt for individual solutions. When interactions are structured on a square lattice, cooperation levels exhibit modest improvements, primarily sustained through cyclic dominance. Payoff values favorable to cooperation result in full cooperation; however, rare mutations can disrupt the cooperative equilibrium, promoting the adoption of individual solutions. Our analysis aligns with experimental observations and illustrates the importance of overcoming reliance on individual solutions to better understand the emergence of cooperation.},

When constructing the stiffness matrix, the resulting algebraic systems have the same bandwidth as those generated by the finite element (FE) method. We use direct and iterative solvers to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the MPC method. Our solution strategy enables automatic mesh generation, as nodes are utilized directly in the interpolation construction, eliminating the need to evaluate mesh quality.

  abstract     = {The pricing of derivatives tied to baskets of assets demands a sophisticated framework that aligns with the available market information to capture the intricate non-linear dependency structure among the assets. We describe the dynamics of the multivariate process of constituents with a copula model and propose an efficient method to extract the dependency structure from the market. The proposed method generates coherent sets of samples of the constituents process through systematic sampling rearrangement. These samples are then utilized to calibrate a local volatility model (LVM) of the basket process, which is used to price basket derivatives. We show that the method is capable of efficiently pricing basket options based on a large number of basket constituents, accomplishing the calibration process within a matter of seconds, and achieving near-perfect calibration to the index options of the market.},
