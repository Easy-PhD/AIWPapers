  abstract     = {In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) time-fractional mobile/immobile (MIM) transport equation, which incorporates the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order α ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , is taken into consideration. The space derivatives are discretized using the compact finite difference approximation, and the Caputo time-fractional derivative is estimated by employing the averaged L1 formula. Combining with corresponding alternating direction implicit (ADI) algorithms, the overall computational cost is reduced significantly. Using the discrete energy analysis methodology, we demonstrate that the suggested method possesses temporal second-order convergence and spatial fourth-order convergence under the regularity assumption. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ADI techniques is effective in computing 3D problems.},

  abstract     = {We study an American option pricing problem with liquidity risks and transaction fees. As endogenous transaction costs, liquidity risks of the underlying asset are modeled by a mean-reverting process. Transaction fees are exogenous transaction costs and are assumed to be proportional to the trading amount, with the long-run liquidity level depending on the proportional transaction costs rate. Two nonlinear partial differential equations are established to characterize the option values for the holder and the writer, respectively. To illustrate the impact of these transaction costs on option prices and optimal exercise prices, we apply the alternating direction implicit method to solve the linear complementarity problem numerically. Finally, we conduct model calibration from market data via maximum likelihood estimation, and find that our model incorporating liquidity risks outperforms the Leland model significantly.},

The numerical scheme uses a conforming virtual element method for spatial discretization and a modified leapfrog (central finite difference) scheme for time discretization, with the nonlinear term | u | p − 1 u is treated semi-implicitly. We first prove that the proposed scheme is energy dissipative in the sense of discrete energy, and then the stability of the numerical solution in the H 1 -norm is established using mathematical induction, which plays an important role in handling the nonlinear term. By applying the boundedness of the numerical solution and the Sobolev embedding inequality, we derive the optimal H 1 error estimate of order O ( h k + τ 2 ) without imposing any ratio restrictions between the time step τ and the mesh size h . Additionally, we remark that the leapfrog virtual element scheme can be applied to some more complex nonlinear damped wave equations. Finally, some numerical examples are provided to confirm the theoretical results.},

  abstract     = {Weather derivatives are financial tools that use a weather index as the underlying asset to provide protection against non-catastrophic weather events. In this article, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach for pricing weather derivatives associated with two standard processes: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with jump-diffusions. PINNs are a scientific machine learning method specifically designed to address problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). To apply the PINN technique for jump-diffusion, we convert the partial integro-differential equation into a PDE using integral discretization. We randomly select training data points within the domain and utilize the transformed PDE along with the initial and boundary conditions to construct the loss function. For the neurons in the hidden layer, we employ the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) as the activation function. The weights of the network connection are optimized using the L-BFGS algorithm. We will conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. Additionally, we compare our method with conventional numerical approaches to show that our technique serves as an effective alternative to existing pricing methods for weather derivatives. Finally, we will examine a real-world case study where the model's parameters are determined using precipitation data.},

The reference domain includes the real structure’s configuration, and a system of linear equations is established with fictitious forces and moments as unknowns. These equations are derived from traction and displacement boundary conditions. To obtain all physical values in the time domain, the Durbin’s Laplace inverse technique is applied.

We apply the proposed method to two-dimensional elastic wave scattering by a rectangular cavity, a well-known challenging problem in MFS analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with the conventional MFS using truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD).

The mortar finite element method is usually employed to discretize the variational form on the meshed contact surfaces, yielding a large-scale discretized saddle point system. Due to the indefiniteness of the discretized system, it is a challenge to solve the saddle point algebraic system. For two-dimensional tied contact problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on degree-of-freedom (DOF) condensation. In this approach, a DOFs elimination process is first performed by exploiting the tridiagonal structure of the mortar matrix.

  abstract     = {In this work, considering the solution's weak initial singularity, a rigorous error analysis of a finite difference method for simulating a two-dimensional semi-linear time-fractional reaction-diffusion equation (TFRDE) is presented. The recently introduced ADI method by Kumari and Roul (2024) [31] for solving a class of linear TFRDEs encounters with problematic mesh parameter adjustments and ignorance of the derivative bounds, potentially rendering the latest methodology deficient and erroneous. The present study aims to design a computationally efficient L1 ADI scheme for semi-linear TFRDEs and provide a comprehensive error analysis. To address intrinsically non-local characteristics of the solution, we employ sum-of-exponential approximation to the singular kernel of time-fractional derivative on a graded mesh with unequal time-steps that yield denser mesh near the initial point. As a result, we effectively mitigate the high storage and computational requirements and return the convergence point to its optimal state. The two spatial variables are treated with a fourth order compact finite difference operator. Moreover, an alternating direction implicit method is utilized to compute the solution of the derived two-dimensional system by splitting it into two separate one-dimensional problems. With the aid of local truncation error estimate and discrete fractional Grönwall inequality, the stability and convergence analysis of the scheme are carried out rigorously through the discrete energy approach. The numerical results corroborate the convergence analysis and highlight the computational efficacy of the numerical scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the CPU performance of the fast compact ADI method, and presented comparisons distinctly showcases the effectiveness of the graded mesh enhancing convergence order to achieve optimal results.},
