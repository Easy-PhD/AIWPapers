  abstract     = {In this study, we propose a new data-driven algorithm for the Perona-Malik image despeckling problem. The advantage of the proposed algorithm over neural network-based methods is that it does not need any noisy and clean image data pair for training. The proposed algorithm is implemented using a three-dimensional convolution neural network (ConvNet) architecture. We compare its output with results obtained from several existing methods, including the operator splitting RBF collocation method, the finite difference method (FDM), and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are carried out using grayscale images that have been artificially corrupted with different levels of speckle noise. Using the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as the evaluation metric, we observed that the proposed algorithm outperforms these existing methods, demonstrating superior image quality with the same numerical scheme and the same discretization. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of physics-inspired convolutional neural network for PDE-based image despeckling model.},

  abstract     = {Approximating the solution of stiff differential equations, which exhibit abrupt changes in certain regions, using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is challenging. Typically, training PINNs involves using a larger number of samples concentrated around regions of rapid changes to resolve the sharp gradients. However, this strategy leads to data imbalance, resulting in slower convergence and reduced solution quality. Here, we propose Re-spacing layer (RS-layer) to mitigate these challenges. RS-layer is a pre-trained encoding layer designed to map the skewed distribution of sampling points onto a uniform distribution, maintaining the desirable statistical properties of the input data for effective PINN training. We demonstrate that RS-layer improves PINN training by regularizing the solution gradient in the transformed space. The efficacy of our method is validated through numerical experiments on one-dimensional singularly perturbed equations, the ROBER problem, and the Akzo Nobel problem. Our results show that RS-layer not only accelerates convergence, but also enhances accuracy.},

The problem involves determining the shape and location of the unknown source's geometrical support from boundary measurements of its associated potential. Firstly, we prove the uniqueness of the inverse problem. In the second phase, we propose a novel reconstruction method that utilizes the coupled complex boundary method (CCBM) to solve the identification problem. The main idea of this method is to approximate the overdetermined problem to a complex boundary value problem with a complex Robin boundary condition coupling the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Next, we utilize the imaginary part of the solution throughout the domain to construct a shape cost function, which we then minimize with respect to ball-shaped sources by using a Newton-type topological derivative method to reconstruct the geometrical support of the unknown source.},

Transaction fees are exogenous transaction costs and are assumed to be proportional to the trading amount, with the long-run liquidity level depending on the proportional transaction costs rate. Two nonlinear partial differential equations are established to characterize the option values for the holder and the writer, respectively. To illustrate the impact of these transaction costs on option prices and optimal exercise prices, we apply the alternating direction implicit method to solve the linear complementarity problem numerically. Finally, we conduct model calibration from market data via maximum likelihood estimation, and find that our model incorporating liquidity risks outperforms the Leland model significantly.},

We first prove that the proposed scheme is energy dissipative in the sense of discrete energy, and then the stability of the numerical solution in the H 1 -norm is established using mathematical induction, which plays an important role in handling the nonlinear term. By applying the boundedness of the numerical solution and the Sobolev embedding inequality, we derive the optimal H 1 error estimate of order O ( h k + τ 2 ) without imposing any ratio restrictions between the time step τ and the mesh size h .

PINNs are a scientific machine learning method specifically designed to address problems related to partial differential equations (PDEs). To apply the PINN technique for jump-diffusion, we convert the partial integro-differential equation into a PDE using integral discretization. We randomly select training data points within the domain and utilize the transformed PDE along with the initial and boundary conditions to construct the loss function. For the neurons in the hidden layer, we employ the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) as the activation function. The weights of the network connection are optimized using the L-BFGS algorithm. We will conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique. Additionally, we compare our method with conventional numerical approaches to show that our technique serves as an effective alternative to existing pricing methods for weather derivatives. Finally, we will examine a real-world case study where the model's parameters are determined using precipitation data.},

The control volume is introduced as the local integral domain in the local weak form, where the Heaviside function is employed as the weight function, similar to traditional FVM. However, instead of the cell-centered control volume used in FVM, a vertex-centered control volume is applied for integration. The trial function is constructed using a Generalized Finite Difference approximation based on a Taylor expansion. By applying the divergence theorem, the integral of the governing equation over the control volume is transformed into a boundary integral, thereby reducing the continuity requirements for both the trial function and thermal conductivity.

  abstract     = {This paper presents a high-efficiency approach for controlled frequency response analysis of laminated multi-phase composite shells, employing high-order Chebyshev finite elements. A key feature of the composite material used in this study is its three-phase composition, consisting of a polymer matrix, carbon fiber, and carbon nanotube nanofillers embedded within the matrix phase. The inclusion of carbon nanotube nanofillers significantly enhances the mechanical and dynamic properties of the overall material. The proposed approach addresses shear/membrane locking and the computational expense of discrete layerwise models, ensuring both efficiency and precision in analyzing complex composite shells. By using high-order shape functions derived from Chebyshev polynomials, this approach achieves rapid convergence without sacrificing accuracy. The developed numerical model captures the frequency response of laminated shells across varying geometric configurations, while incorporating the effects of two-layer control patches that introduce active or passive damping. Additionally, the model accounts for the layerwise effect of the composite, allowing for accurate prediction of structural behavior under excited loads. Numerical validation confirms the robustness and versatility of the high-order Chebyshev finite elements, effectively overcoming common computational challenges such as locking and spurious modes, while providing highly accurate and reliable frequency response predictions for practical engineering applications. This study highlights the potential of using advanced numerical techniques in combination with innovative composite materials for improved dynamic performance in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering applications.},

  abstract     = {Numerical approximations of solutions of convection-diffusion-reaction problems should take only physically admissible values. Provided that bounds for the admissible values are known, this paper presents several approaches within physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and hp -variational PINNs ( hp -VPINNs) to preserve these bounds for convection-dominated problems. These approaches comprise the inclusion of the requirement for bound preservation in the cost functional, a simple cut-off strategy for the unphysical values, and two methods that enforce bound preservation via the activation function of the output layer of the neural network. Numerical simulations are performed for convection-dominated problems defined in two-dimensional domains. A variety of choices for several hyperparameters is explored. Enforcing bound preservation with the sine activation function in the output layer turned out to be superior to all other methods with respect to the accuracy of the computed solutions, and in particular, the results are much more accurate than those obtained with the standard PINNs and hp -VPINNs.},

  abstract     = {We propose a bond-based nonlocal anisotropic diffusion model with variable matrix-valued coefficients. In previous studies, the non-ordinary state-based nonlocal diffusion model [37] has been used effectively for simulating anisotropic diffusion. However, it encounters challenges such as high computational costs, complexities in implementing boundary conditions, and numerical oscillation of zero-energy mode. In this paper, we propose a novel bond-based, nonlocal anisotropic diffusion model, and the key idea is that incorporates a nonlocal operator via a kernel function, integrating matrix-valued diffusion coefficients. The influence region of our model consists of two parts: an elliptical region determined by the variable diffusion coefficient at a material point and an irregular region shaped by the coefficient at neighboring points. Furthermore, we confirm the well-posedness of the proposed model and deduce various properties, such as weak convergence and mass conservation. For computational implementation, we introduce a meshfree method that is shown to be asymptotically compatible and relies on the quadrature rule, which is compatible with the proposed nonlocal diffusion model and can effectively solve the model. To evaluate the precision and efficiency of the model, we performed comprehensive numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions. We have also confirmed the discrete maximum principle through experimental validation simultaneously.},

The key contribution of this study is the development of the Regular Boundary Element Method (RBEM) based on the new fundamental solution. The reference domain includes the real structure’s configuration, and a system of linear equations is established with fictitious forces and moments as unknowns. These equations are derived from traction and displacement boundary conditions. To obtain all physical values in the time domain, the Durbin’s Laplace inverse technique is applied. The accuracy and reliability of the proposed method are evaluated through four numerical examples, with results compared against exact solutions or the finite element method.},

The proposed method initially places an excess number of source points relative to the collocation points within the complementary domain of the analysis region and then selects the source points that efficiently reduce the residual of the system of equations. We apply the proposed method to two-dimensional elastic wave scattering by a rectangular cavity, a well-known challenging problem in MFS analysis. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing its performance with the conventional MFS using truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD). The proposed method provides solutions that more accurately satisfy the traction-free boundary conditions compared to the conventional method, indicating its potential advantages.},

  abstract     = {In contact mechanics computation, the constraint conditions on the contact surfaces are typically enforced by the Lagrange multiplier method, resulting in a saddle point system. The mortar finite element method is usually employed to discretize the variational form on the meshed contact surfaces, yielding a large-scale discretized saddle point system. Due to the indefiniteness of the discretized system, it is a challenge to solve the saddle point algebraic system. For two-dimensional tied contact problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on degree-of-freedom (DOF) condensation. In this approach, a DOFs elimination process is first performed by exploiting the tridiagonal structure of the mortar matrix. The reduced linear system, now smaller in scale and symmetric positive definite (SPD), is then solved using the preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to classical PINNs, the proposed TDD-PINNs significantly reduce training time and improve prediction accuracy by one to two orders of magnitude.

  abstract     = {In this work, considering the solution's weak initial singularity, a rigorous error analysis of a finite difference method for simulating a two-dimensional semi-linear time-fractional reaction-diffusion equation (TFRDE) is presented. The recently introduced ADI method by Kumari and Roul (2024) [31] for solving a class of linear TFRDEs encounters with problematic mesh parameter adjustments and ignorance of the derivative bounds, potentially rendering the latest methodology deficient and erroneous. The present study aims to design a computationally efficient L1 ADI scheme for semi-linear TFRDEs and provide a comprehensive error analysis. To address intrinsically non-local characteristics of the solution, we employ sum-of-exponential approximation to the singular kernel of time-fractional derivative on a graded mesh with unequal time-steps that yield denser mesh near the initial point. As a result, we effectively mitigate the high storage and computational requirements and return the convergence point to its optimal state. The two spatial variables are treated with a fourth order compact finite difference operator. Moreover, an alternating direction implicit method is utilized to compute the solution of the derived two-dimensional system by splitting it into two separate one-dimensional problems. With the aid of local truncation error estimate and discrete fractional Grönwall inequality, the stability and convergence analysis of the scheme are carried out rigorously through the discrete energy approach. The numerical results corroborate the convergence analysis and highlight the computational efficacy of the numerical scheme. Numerical examples demonstrate the CPU performance of the fast compact ADI method, and presented comparisons distinctly showcases the effectiveness of the graded mesh enhancing convergence order to achieve optimal results.},
