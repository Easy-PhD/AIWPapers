  abstract     = {In seismic exploration, the Finite Difference Method (FDM) is commonly used to simulate the propagation of seismic waves. This numerical method approximates derivatives by calculating the weighted sum of values at adjacent nodes. Currently, models are stored using regular grids. When discretizing complex structural interfaces such as inclined strata and faults, non - smooth surfaces will appear, which leads to errors in the forward modeling of wave equations. To address the forward - modeling issues caused by model errors, a meshless method called the Generalized Finite Difference Method (GFDM) has been proposed and has been successfully applied in computational geosciences. This method constructs node clouds for discrete nodes and solves derivatives based on the relationships between central nodes and surrounding nodes in the node cloud, offering flexible solutions. However, it requires substantial time for fine-grained modeling of the model, and conventional node construction performs poorly for complex models with drastic lateral variations. In this study, we analyzed the causes of errors in relation to interface dip angles and proposed an automatic interface node construction method. Testing on various models demonstrates that this method can effectively construct models with smaller discretization errors and significantly reduced scattering errors in forward modeling compared to conventional methods.},

  abstract     = {We develop the meshfree method for solving the elliptic Monge-Ampère equation with Dirichlet boundary on the bounded domain and prove its convergence in the paper. In terms of trial, we use the radial functions (for example, Whittle-Matérn-Sobolev kernels and Wendland's compactly supported radial basis functions) which can reproduce W σ , 2 ( R d ) to construct the finite dimensional approximate spaces. It allows the easy construction of approximation spaces in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary smoothness and avoids the huge workload caused by mesh-based methods at the same time. In terms of testing, it just needs to take values directly on the collocation points and greatly simplifies the difficulties caused by variation and integration. Theoretically, we obtain L 2 error when the testing discretization is finer than the trial discretization. The convergence rate depends on the regularity of the solution, the smoothness of the computing domain, and the approximation of kernel-based trial spaces. An extension to non-Dirichlet boundary condition is in a forthcoming paper.},

The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method is employed to handle the nonlinear energy potential.

We rigorously prove the unconditional energy stability of the proposed scheme and the optimal L 2 -norm error estimates for ϕ and c .

The average vector field formulas with second and fourth order accuracy in time are utilized to compute the finite dimensional Hamiltonian system. In order to improve computation velocity of these formulas, the fast computation algorithm of these formulas is proposed by decomposing the spectral matrix. Solitary wave evolution of the equations is analyzed with different initial conditions by these new computational formulas. Energy invariant property, accuracy and computation efficiently of these new formulas are also investigated.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel fundamental solution neural networks method (FSNNs) to solve inverse Cauchy problems, which combines the method of fundamental solutions (MFS) with the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To optimize the distribution of source points, the method starts by partitioning the interval into equal segments, determined by the number of the source points. The coordinate system is situated at the center of the computational domain. The resulting angles as network inputs for the FSNNs and the intermediate variable as outputs, which is subsequently substituted into a length function to obtain the final length. The coordinates of the source points are then determined, and the MFS is employed to approximate the numerical solutions. The loss function is formulated based on the boundary conditions on the accessible boundary, and the training is employed to optimize the network parameters in the FSNNs and source point intensities in the MFS. The introduction of the PINNs overcomes the challenge of source point selection in the MFS and effectively addresses the ill-posedness of inverse problems. In summary, the proposed scheme is a machine learning-based semi-analytical meshless method which is simple, accurate and easily implemented, making it highly suitable for the numerical solution of inverse problems. Four numerical experiments, including the Laplace and biharmonic equations, validate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed FSNNs.},
