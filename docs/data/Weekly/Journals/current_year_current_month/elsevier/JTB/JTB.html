  abstract     = {While many mechanisms have been proposed to drive Alzheimer’s disease, particularly the accumulation of amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorylation of tau proteins, emerging evidence suggests that they may be the byproducts of earlier damage rather than initiating events. Instead, metabolic dysfunction and the inability of neural cells to support their energetic demands may be a more plausible trigger for subsequent pathological cascade (the neuron energy crisis hypothesis). Here we highlight how type 2 diabetes (T2D) can contribute to neurodegeneration by impairing brain energy metabolism. We present a game-theoretic framework, where neurons face trade-offs between energy efficiency and information fidelity. We show that under metabolic stress, neural networks can evolve toward smaller group sizes that prioritize energy efficiency over information quality, which may underlie the observed collapse of cognitive capacity during neurodegeneration. We conclude with a discussion of interventions, ranging from antidiabetic drugs to cognitive engagement and sensory stimulation, aimed at reducing metabolic stress and preserving cognitive function.},

The research has two primary objectives: first, to assess the robustness of the two-pathogen co-infection model proposed by Fahlena et al. (Chaos Sol. Fract., 2022) in terms of structural and practical identifiability; and second, to evaluate the time variation of co-infection percentages in Italy during the winter of 2023–2024. The identifiability analysis is based on official data regarding influenza and SARS-CoV-2 cases, complemented by estimated co-infection data under two scenarios (high and low levels of co-infection). The study finds that when both weekly infection and co-infection data are available, the model’s parameters are structurally identifiable. However, if only incidence data for each virus are available, five parameters must be fixed to achieve both structural and practical identifiability, with the remaining parameters being identifiable. Additionally, the model suggests that a unimodal time profile of co-infection percentages could have occurred in Italy during the study period. These results emphasize the importance of comprehensive data for model identification and co-infection estimation during epidemics.},

  abstract     = {Plants exhibit plastic responses to the absence or presence of competitors. When competing for soil nutrients, plants often show root overproliferation compared to when they grow without competitors. This excessive investment in roots to acquire more nutrients can reduce reproductive yield (e.g., seed mass), a phenomenon known as the tragedy of the commons (TOC). The mechanisms of this phenomenon have been investigated theoretically, focusing on resource allocation strategies between the aboveground (shoot) and the belowground (roots) parts. The previous studies have primarily considered these strategies in terms of sizes of those parts or static allocation rates to those over the season, overlooking dynamic change of allocation within the season. In this study, we introduced a concept of dynamic resource allocation into the plant competition game and investigate the optimal resource allocation strategy using Pontryagin’s maximum principle. Based on the solutions of schedules, we explored the mechanism causing TOC in nutrient competition. Our findings reveal that plants adopt the singular control (i.e., simultaneous allocation to shoot and root), where the control trajectory is identical regardless of the presence or absence of competitors, although the period of simultaneous allocation become longer in the presence of competitors. This trend associates with increasing the root size and decreasing the shoot size at the end of season in the competitive case. Our analysis demonstrates that TOC in plant nutrient competition arises from differences in the allocation period to roots in the competitive scenario.},

Greta builds on Tensorflow, making it comparatively easy to take advantage of the significant gain in speed offered by GPUs. In these complex spatio-temporal models, we show a reduction of up to 70% in computational time relative to fitting the same models on CPUs. We show how the choice of covariance kernel impacts the ability to infer spread and extrapolate to unobserved spatial and temporal units.

  abstract     = {Many biological populations exhibit diversity in their strategy for survival and reproduction in a given environment, and microbes are an example. We explore the fate of different strategies under sustained environmental change by considering a mathematical model for a large population of asexual organisms. Fitness is a bimodal function of a quantitative trait, with two local optima, separated by a local minimum, i.e., a mixture of stabilising and disruptive selection. The optima represent two locally ‘best’ trait values. We consider regimes where, when the environment is unchanging, the equilibrium distribution of the trait is bimodal. A bimodal trait distribution generally requires, for its existence, mutational coupling between the two peaks, and it indicates two coexisting clones with distinct survival and reproduction strategies. When subject to persistent environmental change, the population adapts by utilising mutations that allow it to track the changing environment. The faster the rate of change of the environment, the larger the effect of the mutations that are utilised. Under persistent environmental change, the distribution of trait values takes two different forms. At low rates of change, the distribution remains bimodal. At higher rates, the distribution becomes unimodal. This loss of a clone/biodiversity is driven by a novel mechanism where environmental change decouples a class of mutations.},

  abstract     = {Transporters play key roles in regulating the movement of molecules into and out of cells. Uniporters, the simplest class of transporters, use facilitated diffusion to translocate molecules across membranes down their concentration gradient. This process can be affected by the presence of additional substrates in the intra- and extracellular environment, which can either increase the net transport rate of a molecule via trans acceleration or decrease it via competitive inhibition. In this study, we derived mathematical models to describe the net transport rate of uniporters in the presence of multiple extracellular substrates or inhibitors. Analyses of these models identified four possible states for the system when two substrates are present, with two states leading to trans acceleration and the other two states resulting in inhibition. Finally, we found that the relation between kinetic constants that controls the fraction of transporters in the inward-facing open state is responsible for these behaviors. Our theoretical results provide a mathematical framework for understanding the dynamic response of uniporters in the presence of multiple substrates and inhibitors, which could have implications for various processes, from nutrient utilization to metabolic engineering.},

In particular, the opportunity to apply nanomaterials for cancer diagnosis and treatment presents a challenge due to the complex biology of this disease, which spans multiple time and spatial scales. A systems-level analysis from mathematical modeling and computational simulation to explore the interactions between anticancer drug-loaded nanoparticles (NPs), cells, and tissues, and the associated system parameters and patient response would be of benefit. Although a number of models have explored these interactions in the past, few have focused on simulating individual cell-NP interactions. This study develops a multicellular agent-based model of cancer nanotherapy that simulates NP internalization, drug release within the cell cytoplasm, inheritance of NPs by daughter cells at cell division, cell pharmacodynamic response to intracellular drug levels, and overall drug effect on tumor growth. A large-scale parallel computational framework is used to investigate the impact of pharmacokinetic design parameters (NP internalization rate, NP decay rate, anticancer drug release rate) and therapeutic strategies (NP doses and injection frequency) on tumor growth. In particular, through the exploration of NP inheritance at cell division, the results indicate that cancer treatment may be improved when NPs are inherited at cell division for cytotoxic chemotherapy. Moreover, smaller dose of cytostatic chemotherapy may also improve inhibition of tumor growth when cell division is not completely inhibited. This work suggests that slow delivery by heritable NPs can drive new dimensions of nanotherapy design for more sustained therapeutic response.},

This situation arises in molecular epidemiology, for example, where new taxonomic groups can appear in real time as pathogen isolates are sequenced. Efficient computational methods have been developed to place new leaves in existing trees, which removes the need to reconstruct trees from scratch. But for these tree extensions to be fully integrated with classification schemes requires a stable encoding of trees that keeps existing tree structures intact as new branches appear. Here, we propose a tree encoding, which we call a folio , that records the path from a reference vertex to each leaf, giving each leaf an address . We present a simple set of rules to assign new addresses to added leaves. The encoding is stable in the sense that it does not change as further leaf addresses are added to the folio. The tree can be uniquely recovered from a folio of addresses. We illustrate the methods using Salmonella genome data. Due to the properties of our encoding framework, we anticipate that it can be used for a range of different phylogenetic analyses.},

However, most current models still suffer from high parameter complexity in the case of complex promoters. Herein, we formally derive a phenomenological approach to model RNA polymerase recruitment, stating approximations on cooperativity between transcription factors that are applicable to promoters requiring multifactorial input, which reduces parameter complexity. We then apply this method to biologically relevant networks of varying complexities to show that the approximations improved predictive ability compared to existing models. In summary, our reduced parameter model (RPM) had lower complexity while maintaining high accuracy, which leads to better scalability for complex networks.},

However, the precise impact of tumour burden, dose and dosing regimens on therapeutic outcomes remains poorly understood. We developed ordinary differential equation (ODE) mathematical modelling and utilised parameter inference to analyse in vitro FACS-based phagocytosis assay data testing CD19-positive Raji tumour cell against CAR-macrophage, and revealed that phagocytosing efficiency of CAR-macrophage increases but saturates as both Raji cell and CAR-macrophage concentrations increase. This interaction resulted in bistable Raji cell kinetics; specifically, within a particular range of CAR-macrophage concentration, low tumour burdens are effectively inhibited, while high tumour burdens remain refractory. Furthermore, our model predicted that CAR-macrophage dosages typically suggested by current clinical trials yield favourable therapeutic outcomes only when tumour burden is low. For split CAR-macrophage infusion with fixed total dosage, the first infusion with high CAR-macrophage dose delivers superior treatment outcomes. Finally, we identified alternative infusion regimens: five billion cells administered monthly for three months, or seven billion cells every two months for six months, can efficiently suppress Raji cell replication irrespective of tumour burden. Our findings highlight CAR-macrophage therapeutic outcomes are strongly influenced by both tumour burden and different dosing regimens. This work underscores that reducing tumour burden, increasing CAR-macrophage dose in the first infusion and prolonging CAR-macrophage persistence are key strategies for achieving durable responses.},

The plus and minus ends of neuronal MTs switch between growth and shrinking phases, and the nucleation of new filaments is believed to be regulated in both healthy and injury conditions. We propose stochastic and deterministic mathematical models to investigate the impact of filament nucleation and length-regulation mechanisms on emergent properties such as MT lengths and numbers in living cells. We expand our stochastic continuous-time Markov chain model of filament dynamics to incorporate MT nucleation and capture realistic stochastic fluctuations in MT numbers and tubulin availability. We also propose a simplified partial differential equation (PDE) model, which allows for tractable analytical investigation into steady-state MT distributions under different nucleation and length-regulating mechanisms. We find that the stochastic and PDE modeling approaches show good agreement in MT length distributions, and that both MT nucleation and the catastrophe rate of large-length MTs regulate MT length distributions. In both frameworks, multiple mechanistic combinations achieve the same average MT length. The models proposed can predict parameter regimes where the system is scarce in tubulin, the building block of MTs, and suggest that low filament nucleation regimes are characterized by high variation in MT lengths, while high nucleation regimes drive high variation in MT numbers. These mathematical frameworks have the potential to improve our understanding of MT regulation in both healthy and injured neurons.},

Yet, how these ISG-virus interactions shape infection progression and severity remains poorly understood. Here, we introduce a new viral infection model that explicitly incorporates intracellular ISG-virus dynamics. It structures, for the first time, infected cells based on viral load and ISG expression which offers a computationally efficient and adaptable approach to integrating ISG-virus intracellular dynamics into viral kinetics frameworks. We validate this new approach using patient data for pre-alpha COVID-19 strain and an HIV, then we use it to study the impact of ISG-virus kinetics on viral infection severity and persistence. Our simulations reveal that increased ISG induction prolongs infection by suppressing type I IFN production in infected cells and preventing tissue cell depletion. We further show that effective ISG-mediated viral suppression is critical for controlling infection severity. Finally, the model predicts that moderate viral secretion optimizes viral load production. Overall, the developed framework offers a flexible and computationally efficient tool for exploring the impact of intracellular type I interferon signaling on viral infections. It can be easily adapted to specific diseases and extended with pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics models to identify key therapeutic targets for drug development.},

We show via simulation studies that a kernel two-sample test using the proposed kernel is sensitive to the phylogenetic scale of the difference between the two populations. In a second set of simulations we also show how Gaussian process modelling with string kernels can infer the distribution of bacterial-host effects across the phylogenetic tree and apply this approach to a real host-trait prediction task.

  abstract     = {Phylogenetic trees describe the relationships between species in the evolutionary process, and provide information about the rates of diversification. To understand the mechanisms behind macroevolution, we consider a class of multitype branching processes called Markovian binary trees (MBTs). MBTs allow for trait-based variation in diversification rates, and provide a flexible and realistic probabilistic model for phylogenetic trees. We develop an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme to infer the rates of MBT parameters by exploiting the information in the shapes of phylogenetic trees. We evaluate the accuracy of this inference method using simulation studies, and find that our method is able to detect variation in the diversification rates, with accuracy comparable to, and generally better than, likelihood-based methods. In an application to a real-life phylogeny of squamata, we reinforce conclusions drawn from earlier studies, in particular supporting the existence of ovi-/viviparity transitions in both directions. Our method demonstrates the potential for more complex models of evolution to be employed in phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with likelihood-free schemes.},
