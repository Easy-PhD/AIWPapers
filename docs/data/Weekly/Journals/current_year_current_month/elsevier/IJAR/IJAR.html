  abstract     = {We study the problem of transforming a multi-way contingency table into an equivalent table with uniform margins and same dependence structure. This is an old question which relates to recent advances in copula modeling for discrete random vectors. In this work, we focus on multi-way binary tables and develop novel theory to show how the zero patterns affect the existence of the transformation as well as its statistical interpretability in terms of dependence structure. The implementation of the theory relies on combinatorial and linear programming techniques, which can also be applied to arbitrary multi-way tables. In addition, we investigate which odds ratios characterize the unique solution in relation to specific zero patterns. Several examples are described to illustrate the approach and point to interesting future research directions.},

  abstract     = {Set-valued data has traditionally been represented by considering non-empty compact and convex subsets of R d with the usual Minkowski addition. An alternative and flexible setting that admits a functional representation are the star-shaped sets. A framework based on a center-radial characterization has been introduced to treat these sets from a statistical point of view. The arithmetic is defined directionally, which is more natural for representing imprecision propagation in higher dimensions. Nevertheless, the problem of determining a center for star-shaped sets coherent with the arithmetic and sound for statistical purposes has not been fully addressed yet. The aim is to advance on the directional characterization for star-shaped sets by considering a measure-preserving arithmetic together with a center selection fully compatible with this arithmetic. The practicability of the new framework will be illustrated using a classical dataset in set-valued statistics.},
