  abstract     = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) induces oxidative stress that triggers a compensatory upregulation of intracellular glutathione (GSH), thereby diminishing PDT efficacy. The simultaneous generation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of GSH holds promise for amplifying oxidative damage and enhancing therapeutic outcomes yet remains a challenge. In this work, we present a Type-I supramolecular photosensitizer designed to deplete GSH through a hydrogen atom transfer mechanism while concurrently generating superoxide radicals. This photosensitizer is constructed through the supramolecular host–guest assembly of cyclodextrin-conjugated N -hydroxyphthalimide ( CD-NHPI ) and a BODIPY-based photosensitizer ( BDP ). Upon light irradiation, electron transfer from CD-NHPI to BDP forms a radical ion pair: CD-NHPI +• and BDP –• . CD-NHPI +• undergoes deprotonation to yield an oxygen-centered radical that oxidizes GSH by directly abstracts hydrogen atoms from GSH, while BDP –• concurrently reduces molecular oxygen to superoxide radicals. As a result, this photosensitizer exhibits remarkable photocytotoxicity and significant antitumor efficacy in mouse models. This work offers a strategy for synergistically photocatalytic oxidation of antioxidants and generation of reactive oxygen species for PDT.},

  abstract     = {A promising class of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists is the non-nucleotide, small molecule, dimeric amidobenzimidazoles (diABZI), which have recently been incorporated into polymer- and antibody-drug conjugates to improve pharmacokinetics and modulate biodistribution for disease-specific applications. These approaches have leveraged diABZI variants functionalized at the 7-position of the benzimidazole for conjugation and tunable drug release from carriers. However, since this position does not interact with STING and is exposed from the binding pocket when bound in an “open lid” configuration, we sought to evaluate the activity of macromolecular diABZI conjugates that lack stimuli-responsive release and are instead conjugated to polymers via a stable amide linker. By synthesizing stable mPEG-diABZI conjugates and N , N -dimethylacrylamide (DMA) homopolymers from a diABZI-functionalized reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) agent, we found that these conjugates could activate STING in vitro with similar kinetics to highly potent diABZI analogues. Our data indicate that although diABZI-DMA conjugates enter cells via endocytosis, they can still colocalize with the ER, suggesting that intracellular trafficking processes can promote the delivery of endocytosed macromolecular diABZI compounds to STING. Furthermore, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of these macromolecular diABZI platforms, which inhibited tumor growth to a similar extent as small molecule variants. In conclusion, we have described new chemical strategies for the synthesis of stable macromolecular diABZI conjugates with unexpected immunostimulatory activity─findings that have potential implications for the design of polymer-diABZI conjugates and further motivate investigation of endosomal and intracellular trafficking as an alternative route for STING activation.},

Here, we uncover how AC frequency synchronizes with key steps in a Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling cycle to control product selectivity between C–N and C–C coupling. We show that optimal C–N selectivity arises from minimizing the exposure of a key intermediate, Ni II (Ar)Br, to reducing conditions that otherwise promote off-cycle Ni I species and undesired C–C homocoupling. By developing a simple cyclic voltammetry-based method, we accurately predict the optimal AC frequency across diverse aryl bromides and amines, eliminating the need for time-consuming trial-and-error reaction optimization. The predicted values align well with experimentally determined frequencies, validating the approach. This work establishes a mechanistic foundation for integrating AC waveform control into metal catalysis and highlights its potential for advancing selective electrochemical transformations in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The C–H functionalization represents a universal and important method for constructing new C–C bonds by carrying out reactions directly on inert C–H bonds. The major challenges are to control the site-selectivity and chemoselectivity because most complex organic compounds have many similar C–H bonds or different functional groups, such as a C═C bond or O–H bond. Here, we develop a versatile copper cluster (Cu 3 NC (NHC) ) with high stability and dynamic catalytic sites. Unlike traditional copper catalysts (which activate diazoesters to form intermediate Cu-carbenes, catalyzing cyclopropanation and O–H insertion), the Cu 3 NC (NHC) , as a versatile catalyst, has resolved the site-selective and chemoselective challenges of the C(sp 3 )–H bond and C(sp 2 )–H bond functionalization by forming Cu 3 NC (NHC) stabilized carbocations. Moreover, turnover number (TON) values of the C–H functionalization are elevated to a whole new level (up to 123,200). Mechanistic studies and density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate that site-selectivity and chemoselectivity derive from the energy differences among these key intermediates. The diverse applicability of Cu 3 NC (NHC) provides a generic platform for optimizing chemical reactions and fostering their innovative development, thereby promoting the rapid development of the intersection between cluster chemistry and organic chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Alkali metal cations (AMCs) are known to play pivotal roles in modulating electrocatalytic systems, significantly affecting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). While their macroscopic effects are well recognized, the molecular-level interactions of AMCs at the electrochemical interface remain poorly understood. Here, using constant-potential ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that AMCs (Li + , Na + , and K + ) act as molecular switches that trigger a pseudo-outer-sphere ORR mechanism. In this mechanism, surface-adsorbed water molecules serve as dynamic bridges that simultaneously mediate interfacial electron transfer and proton transport. As a result, the reactive zone extends beyond the catalyst surface, overcoming the spatial constraints of traditional inner-sphere pathways. Crucially, H 2 O 2 is generated directly within the outer Helmholtz plane via reduction of AMC-O 2 complexes, effectively bypassing the catalyst surface and avoiding over-reduction. This results in significantly enhanced selectivity and production efficiency. Our results demonstrate that AMCs activate interfacial coupling to unlock alternative reaction pathways, while concurrently elucidating the critical yet often overlooked role of solute molecules in governing electrocatalytic behavior. This work establishes a framework for the understanding of electrolyte-catalyst coupling and provides principles for designing next-generation electrochemical systems.},

While extensive research has been conducted on the structure-dependent chemical activity of 2D materials, the influence of structural transformation during the reaction has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we report the layer-dependent chemical reactivity of MoS 2 during a nitridation atomic substitution reaction and attribute it to the rearrangement of Mo atoms. Our results show that the chemical reactivity of MoS 2 decreases as the number of layers is reduced in the few-layer regime. In particular, monolayer MoS 2 exhibits significantly lower reactivity compared with its few-layer and multilayer counterparts. Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that MoN nanonetworks form as reaction products from monolayer and bilayer MoS 2 , with the continuity of the MoN crystals increasing with layer number, consistent with the local conductivity mapping data. The layer-dependent reactivity is attributed to the relative stability of the hypothetically formed MoN phase, which retains the number of Mo atomic layers present in the precursor. Specifically, the low chemical reactivity of monolayer MoS 2 is attributed to the high energy cost associated with Mo atom diffusion and migration necessary to form multilayer Mo lattices in the thermodynamically stable MoN phase. This study underscores the critical role of lattice rearrangement in governing chemical reactivity and highlights the potential of 2D materials as versatile platforms for advancing the understanding of materials chemistry at the atomic scale.},

  abstract     = {Phage display is an ideal platform for selecting peptide hits and offers a diverse array of cyclic binders with high affinity. While many recently developed phage display platforms incorporate chemical strategies, the vast majority of these are detrimental to the phage life cycle due to cross-reactivity with the capsid protein. In contrast, enzyme catalysis, which combines high efficiency and biocompatibility, offers a promising approach for phage-based cyclic peptide display. However, enzyme-mediated cyclization approaches remain underexplored. Here, we present a tyrosinase-mediated phage display platform that enables one-step cyclization via o -quinone-cysteine coupling, which is a simple and efficient strategy that does not compromise phage infectivity. Importantly, the catalytic property of tyrosinase is highly selective and spatially constrained, allowing it to bypass native tyrosine residues in the phage and selectively recognize only the engineered tyrosine residues. Using this platform, we constructed a macrocyclic peptide library that facilitated the discovery of macrocyclic peptide inhibitors targeting therapeutically relevant proteins. Notably, the cyclic peptide ACI1 demonstrated potent inhibition of PIP4K2A kinase activity with an IC 50 value of 0.93 ± 0.05 μM, while ACP1 effectively inhibited the dephosphorylation activity of PTP1B with an IC 50 of 1.06 ± 0.25 μM. The generality and efficiency of this strategy highlight its potential as a valuable tool for the development of bioactive cyclic peptides.},

  abstract     = {Birefringent crystals are a vital class of optoelectronic materials capable of modulating and detecting the polarization state of light. The pursuit of high-performance birefringent materials has largely focused on incorporating functional units with strong polarization anisotropy and favorable alignment. In this work, we introduce a novel birefringence-active group (BAG), the five-membered ring [C 5 O 5 ] 2– , and demonstrate its potential by synthesizing four alkali metal croconate crystals: Na 2 C 5 O 5 ·2H 2 O ( NNCO·2H 2 O ), Na 2 C 5 O 5 ·3H 2 O ( NNCO·3H 2 O ), NaCsC 5 O 5 ( NCCO ), and NaRbC 5 O 5 ( NRCO ). Remarkably, NNCO·2H 2 O and NNCO·3H 2 O exhibit ultrahigh experimental birefringence values of Δ n exp(010) = 1.062 and Δ n exp(01̅1) = 0.893 at 546 nm, respectively. These exceptional values arise from the highly anisotropic nature and well-aligned arrangement of the [C 5 O 5 ] 2– units, combined with their moderate spatial density. In addition, the hydrated compounds feature wider bandgaps (2.67 and 2.55 eV) than their anhydrous analogues NCCO (2.24 eV) and NRCO (2.14 eV), thereby achieving a desirable balance between large birefringence and moderate bandgap─key criteria for optical applications. First-principles calculations and quantum chemical analysis confirm that the [C 5 O 5 ] 2– unit is the primary contributor to the observed optical anisotropy. Notably, NNCO·2H 2 O , NNCO·3H 2 O , and NCCO readily form high-quality, centimeter-scale single crystals via a simple aqueous evaporation method, with NCCO reaching up to 10 × 9 × 2.5 mm 3 . This work establishes [C 5 O 5 ] 2– as a new and effective structural motif for designing advanced birefringent materials, offering both outstanding optical performance and practical crystal growth capabilities.},

  abstract     = {Doping magnetic transition metal ions (e.g., Mn 2+ ) into colloidal quantum dots endows novel optical and magnetic properties to the host materials. CsPbBr 3 quantum dots (QDs) are emerging light-emitting materials with high structural and chemical flexibility in the visible spectral regime. However, efficiently doping Mn 2+ ions in CsPbBr 3 QDs remains challenging, especially when size confinement and ensemble uniformity are needed for understanding the underexplored exciton-dopant exchange interaction. Here, we introduce a doping mechanism based on electrostatic surface Mn 2+ adsorption that enables efficient Mn 2+ incorporation in strongly confined CsPbBr 3 QDs. The resultant QDs are found to have a Cs-deficient stoichiometry compared to their undoped counterparts. A redox reaction-based purification method was developed to remove Mn 2+ cations that are tightly adsorbed on the surface to determine the concentration of lattice-incorporated Mn 2+ . Our synthesis enables a Mn 2+ doping/alloying concentration of up to ∼44% with a Mn 2+ photoluminescence efficiency exceeding 90%. This allows for the determination of the intrinsic exciton-to-dopant energy transfer rate.},

  abstract     = {Despite advances in reactions such as hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) and reductive deuteration, achieving controlled and selective deuteration remains challenging. Moreover, the difficulty of developing successful deuteration platforms is compounded by a lack of means to assess the stereoisotopic purity of deuterated products. We previously reported a highly regio- and stereoselective approach for generating semideuterated cyclohexenes via tandem protonation (H + /D + ) and reduction (H – /D – ) sequences of a dihapto-coordinate tungsten-benzene complex. While NMR and HRMS analyses suggested successful deuterium incorporation, molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy identified numerous over-, under-, and mis-deuteration impurities. At the time of publication, these impurities were attributed to H/D scrambling that could occur during thermolysis of the tungsten-bound cyclohexene ligand prior to MRR analysis. In this work, we describe the analysis of semideuterated cyclohexenes using MRR spectroscopy with an improved thermolysis apparatus that eliminates deuterium scrambling during analysis. Quantitative analysis of both racemic and enantiopure samples enables the optimization of deuteration conditions by providing multiple mechanistic insights into the formation of impurities.},

  abstract     = {The Siglec family represents one of the major classes of human glycan-binding proteins (GBPs) that regulates a broad range of biological processes through engagement with their glycan ligands. Human Siglecs have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years, as they are regarded as new immune checkpoints. The disruption of Siglec–sialoglycan interactions represents a promising next-generation strategy for cancer immunotherapy. In addition to the sialic acid moiety, it has been well established that glycan sulfation plays an essential role in the ligand binding of human Siglecs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to thoroughly understand the subtle differences in the glycan scaffolds and sulfation patterns that govern Siglec binding. N -Glycans are the most abundant class of glycans occurring in living cells, while sulfation is the most widespread postglycosylation modification of N -glycans, indicating that sulfated N -glycans serve as key ligands for human Siglecs. However, the synthetic generation of large libraries of complex sulfated N -glycans is impractical as sulfation introduces additional challenges to the already demanding process of N -glycan synthesis. Herein, we describe a de novo chemoenzymatic approach for the efficient preparation of complex sulfated N -glycans. Using this approach, a comprehensive 72-member library of sulfated N -glycans encompassing the most typical complex structures was successfully prepared. With the well-defined library (comprising 72 sulfated N -glycans and 26 nonsulfated controls), we systematically investigated the binding activities of all human Siglecs. Beyond the synthetic breakthroughs, this work provides the most comprehensive profile to date for understanding how sulfation patterns and N -glycan scaffolds affect Siglec ligand binding, which will have an immediate impact on the development of Siglec-targeted immunotherapy strategies.},

  abstract     = {Carbon-based, metal-free photocatalysts are emerging as sustainable alternatives to transition-metal-based systems due to their tunability, abundance, and environmental friendliness. Among them, carbon dots (CDs) offer unique opportunities in visible-light-driven transformations owing to their excellent photostability, electronic tunability, and surface functionalization capacity. However, the development of structurally defined CD-based catalysts that enable efficient hole transfer, a broad substrate scope, and scalability remains a key challenge. Herein, we report the first bifunctional, quasi-homogeneous CD-based photocatalytic platform that combines visible-light absorption with cooperative hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysis. Using a covalent molecular design, thiol groups were precisely anchored onto the CD surface, enabling fast and efficient hole transfer and promoting the reductive quenching of the excited CD to produce thiyl radicals. This molecular tuning facilitates efficient boryl radical generation via HAT of N-heterocyclic carbene–borane (NHC-BH 3 ), and enables broad substrate applicability on boration of naphthalenes, indoles, alkenes, and polyfluoroarenes. The method is readily scalable, performing smoothly under both gram-scale batch and continuous flow conditions. Detailed mechanistic studies reveal that the thiol groups accelerate excited-state charge separation and act as hole acceptors, highlighting a hole-transfer-driven catalytic mechanism. This work demonstrates how molecularly tailored CDs can serve as multifunctional, metal-free photocatalysts and provides a new blueprint for advancing dual catalytic organic transformations under visible light.},

As there is a strong interest in performing many of these reduction reactions in strongly acidic solutions to increase the reaction rate, efficiency, or selectivity, there is also a great interest in enabling efficient and stable OER in strongly acidic solutions. In this study, we report stable photoelectrochemical OER (POER) of a BiVO 4 photoanode in 0.1 M HNO 3 (pH 1). This was achieved by using Nb 2 O 5 as a protection layer. While Nb 2 O 5 was rarely used as a protection layer for photoelectrodes in the past, we show its excellent capability to suppress both the chemical and photoelectrochemical dissolution of BiVO 4 at pH 1. After stabilizing BiVO 4 with a Nb 2 O 5 protection layer, we added Co 2+ ions to the electrolyte as an OER catalyst to enhance the POER. We found that Co (aq) 2+ can serve as a homogeneous OER catalyst without being deposited as a CoO x solid catalyst on Nb 2 O 5 . When we performed the POER using unprotected BiVO 4 with Co (aq) 2+ under the same condition, although POER was enhanced, the enhancement could not be sustained due to the chemical dissolution of BiVO 4 . After the POER, we found that a Co 3+ -containing OER catalyst was deposited on the bare BiVO 4 surface. This result suggested that the use of Co 2+ ions as a homogeneous catalyst was possible due to the inertness of the Nb 2 O 5 surface toward the adsorption or deposition of Co ions. This study enabling stable POER of BiVO 4 in 0.1 M HNO 3 using the combination of a Nb 2 O 5 protection layer and Co (aq) 2+ as a homogeneous OER catalyst provides promising possibilities for acidic POER and OER.},

We address this issue by showcasing several different ways to steer the excited-state relaxation of new fission-active pentacene and fission-inactive anthracene oligomers, highlighting how the balance of inter- and intramolecular coupling plays a crucial role. We achieve this by engineering specific interactions via supramolecular self-assembly. These interactions promote the uncommon occurrence of strong J-aggregation in acenes. Within the aggregates, intermolecular couplings result in the formation of a strongly bound 1 TT state, which outcompetes the parasitic charge transfer process that dominates in isolated molecules. These findings highlight that balancing intra- and intermolecular interactions offers an effective strategy for regulating the singlet fission process, a critical requirement for advancing future solid-state devices and applications.},

Interestingly, crystal structures indicated dimensionally diversified coordination networks in copper(II) amino acid assemblies, including zero-dimensional (0D) discrete blocks, one-dimensional (1D) infinite chains, and two-dimensional (2D) infinite sheets. Notably, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the dimensionality of coordination networks fundamentally modulates the maximum piezoelectric strain coefficient of assemblies with the order: 1D > 2D > 0D, in which the copper(II) l -glutamate (Glu+Cu) coordination assemblies exhibited the highest value of 57.7 pC/N. The Glu+Cu crystal-based piezoelectric device produced stable open-circuit voltages exceeding 3.0 V under 55 N mechanical force, which could be fabricated into real-time monitoring systems for cervical and lumbar spine health.

Here, we present closely attached atomically dispersed Fe species and ultrafine Au-supported SrTiO 3 hollow nanotubes with oxygen vacancies (STO v ) for highly selective CH 4 conversion to CH 3 OH. An impressive CH 3 OH production rate of 7.53 mmol g –1 h –1 with a selectivity up to 95.4% has been achieved, corresponding to an apparent quantum efficiency of 15.8% at 365 nm, representing a record among all of the representative photocatalysts under comparable conditions. Experimental results and theoretical simulations elucidate that the created oxygen vacancies on SrTiO 3 without Ti 3+ facilitate CH 4 adsorption to effectively capture photogenerated holes for producing methyl radicals. In parallel, the photogenerated electrons could be rapidly extracted by the anchored Au and then transferred to the adjacent single-atom Fe sites for activating O 2 to generate the key intermediate Fe–*OOH toward highly selective CH 3 OH production. Significantly, a commendable electron transfer efficiency of 67.5% for O 2 activation is achieved on Fe–Au/STO v based on the quantitative in situ microsecond transient absorption spectra. This work provides a deep understanding of the regulation of both activity and selectivity by the engineering of adjacent sites and the investigation of electron kinetics for O 2 activation during CH 4 photo-oxidation.},

  abstract     = {The in-depth integration of gene regulation with protein modulation can enhance cellular information processing, yet it is significantly constrained by ineffective and complex protein-to-gene transduction strategies. Herein, we developed a simple protease-guided autocatalytic gene silencing platform named iPAD (intelligent peptide-programmed deoxyribonuclease) that converts the protease recognition events into versatile DNA readout signals by rationally designing a native protease-responsive cationic peptide (PP) to efficiently modulate the DNAzyme (Dz) activity. Without requiring additional chemical modifications, the multifunctional PP regulator consists simply of one cell-specific targeting peptide segment and two cationic peptide segments isolated by one protease-specific peptide substrate. The catalytic activity of Dz can be potently disrupted via the cooperatively stabilized electrostatic interactions between cationic PP and the anionic Dz. Subsequently, the Dz activity is efficiently restored via the protease-specific cleavage of the PP, which disrupts the cooperative stabilization between PP and Dz, thus achieving robust and accurate monitoring of protease activity. Molecular dynamic simulations theoretically validate that the on-demand regulation of Dz activity was indeed acquired from the programmed oligomerization of oligo-peptides. As a universal protease sensing platform, this method was successfully applied to probe Caspase-3 and thrombin, facilitating the early evaluation of tumor therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, the endogenous Caspase-3-activated Dz facilitates the construction of an autocatalytic gene regulation platform that self-adaptively upregulates the expression of apoptotic proteases, accelerating tumor cell apoptosis. This simple yet intelligent iPAD system provides a versatile toolbox for high-performance biosensing and bioengineering applications, paving the way for new strategies in smart theragnostic research.},

  abstract     = {The atom arrangement in carbon electrocatalysts is crucial for enhancing the intrinsic activity toward oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs), a key process in multiple renewable energy systems. However, the challenge of designing electrocatalysts with improved performance by manipulating atomic arrangement has been limited by synthetic constraints and a lack of understanding of the catalytic phase formation. Herein, we gain atomic-level insight into the origin of a highly active site by creating a model catalyst with a heteroatom-decorated carbon matrix of a specific configuration. The introduction of fluorine (F) during the synthesis of the nitrogen (N)-decorated carbon matrix induces structural rearrangement, converting most pyrrolic-N (P r -N) into highly stable graphitic-N (G-N), thereby achieving a N configuration predominantly composed of pyridinic nitrogen (P y -N) and G-N. The multidopant synergistic effect of F, P y -N, and G-N causes a destabilized π-conjugated electron network of the carbon matrix, resulting in a more localized electronic structure. As a result, multiple dopant configurations with high ORR activity have been explored, among which the asymmetric P y -N and G-N configurations feature the lowest theoretical ORR overpotential, ultimately enabling the optimized F@NC catalyst to exhibit excellent oxygen reduction activity. This work establishes a foundation for the rational design of metal-free carbon-based electrocatalysts toward ORR.},

  abstract     = {Localized corrosion in metallic materials is a stochastic phenomenon that causes irreversible structural failure. Its initiation, which occurs at the solid–liquid interface on the nanometer scale, remains difficult to predict and challenging to characterize. Herein, we describe an experimental platform that exploits advances in electrochemical liquid-phase scanning and transmission electron microscopy (LPSEM and LPTEM) to study pitting corrosion of thin-film pure aluminum in a saline environment in real time. Galvanostatic measurements at increasing current levels showed that localized corrosion of Al begins with the appearance of blisters in parallel with nanosized pits. It progresses with the coexistence of round and fractal-like pit morphologies before transitioning to the complete fractal-like dissolution of Al at high currents. Although gas bubble formation appeared to be more pronounced at higher currents, we were able to locally probe that the gas is produced at the corrosion front, which we experimentally confirmed to be molecular hydrogen. Our findings reveal the kinetic mechanism of the early stages of localized anodic corrosion in Al, which may have more general implications for proposing corrosion resistance descriptors.},

  abstract     = {All-soluble all-iron redox flow batteries (AS-AIRFBs) represent a highly promising next-generation technology for long-duration energy storage, leveraging their low cost, decoupled energy/power characteristics, and controllable side reactions. Achieving long-term cycling stability necessitates a stable Fe 2+/3+ -ligand chelate to mitigate the electrolyte crossover, which is the main bottleneck for the flow batteries, in particular for AIRFBs. Herein, we designed a novel ligand─2-hydroxy-1,3-propanediamine tetra-sulfonate sodium salt (HPDTS)─through tailoring both ligand structure and chelate configuration. Benefiting from the macromolecular and flexible ligand framework, HPDTS dramatically accelerates the electron transfer kinetics of Fe 2+/ Fe 3+ , leading to the highest energy efficiency (EE: 71.79% at 200 mA cm –2 ) and power density (446.9 mW cm –2 at 623.39 mA cm –2 ) reported so far. In particular, unlike the traditional penta-coordinate chelate, HPDTS forms a tightly bonded symmetric hexa-coordinate Fe chelate with thermodynamic stability, which not only inhibits the side reaction (e.g., decomposition and HER) but also suppresses the electrolyte crossover when paired with a nonfluorinated proton exchange membrane. Electrochemical testing reveals the record-long lifespan of 15,000 cycles with an ultralow fading rate of 0.000741% per cycle and an ultrahigh Coulombic efficiency of 99.25%. Furthermore, practical AIRFB was also demonstrated to stably cycle for over 6500 cycles without any decay. The new molecular configuration tailoring strategies presented here provide a new paradigm for the development of high-efficiency and long-life AIRFBs.},

Photocatalytic upgrading of p -xylene into p -TALD is a promising route but suffers from undesired overoxidation via conventional molecular oxygen-mediated oxygenation due to difficulties associated with desorbing the products from catalyst active sites. In this work, a novel photocatalytic hydroxyl radical (·OH)-mediated oxygenation route is reported for p -xylene to p -TALD conversion, in which the ·OH serves as oxygen donors to generate intermediates containing hydroxyl functional groups that readily form hydrogen bonds with surface hydroxyl groups of the P25 photocatalyst. This hydrogen bonding interaction effectively regulates the adsorption–desorption behavior of intermediates and products, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity toward p -TALD from 45.25% to nearly 100%, delivering an impressive p -TALD production rate of 3568.8 μmol g –1 h –1 .

  abstract     = {The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of precious metals plays a pivotal role in photocatalytic H 2 evolution, where plasmon-generated hot electrons are efficiently injected into the photocatalytic system, profoundly modulating interfacial electron transfer dynamics. Regrettably, the specific impact of the LSPR effect of precious metals on the ultrafast interfacial charge transfer and its kinetic characteristics remains inadequately explored in photocatalystic systems. To address these knowledge gaps, Au nanoparticles are incorporated into the CdS/ReS x photocatalyst to comprehensively investigate the LSPR-induced ultrafast interfacial charge transfer, ultimately boosting photocatalytic H 2 production activity. The experimental results reveal that the developed CdS/Au 0.5 @ReS x photocatalyst achieves a notable H 2 -production activity with a rate of 8.6 mmol g –1 h –1 (AQE = 35.9%), which is evidently higher than that of CdS/Au (1.8 mmol g –1 h –1 ) and CdS/ReS x (4.0 mmol g –1 h –1 ). In situ XAFS and fs-TAS characterizations confirm that the Au LSPR effect generates electron-deficient Au δ+ species and contracts Au–S bond lengths, dramatically accelerating electron transfer in the Au@ReS x cocatalyst. This plasmon-induced ultrafast charge transfer mechanism enables efficient photogenerated electron migration in the CdS/Au@ReS x system, promoting interfacial charge dynamics for exceptional photocatalytic H 2 evolution performance. The findings offer a new understanding of charge transfer mechanisms enabled by LSPR effects and create a blueprint for engineering next-generation plasmonic photocatalysts.},

Branched- and enantioselective allylic alkylation using synergistic dual catalysis has emerged as a powerful strategy to access multiple molecular stereoisomers with precise control of the absolute and relative configuration. Despite impressive progress in this field, the stereodivergent allylic alkylation by employing trisubstituted allylic electrophiles to construct allylic quaternary stereocenters remains an unsolved challenge. Herein, we report a combination of iridium and magnesium catalysis for stereodivergent allylic alkylation of α-benzothiazyl acetamide by using challenging trisubstituted allylic carbonates. Such a stereodivergent process gives a range of all four stereoisomers of α-allylated acetamide products containing congested allylic quaternary and vicinal tertiary stereocenters in good yields with excellent diastereo- and enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility of this methodology is demonstrated through the preparation of key intermediates for a number of natural products. Particularly, stereodivergent synthesis of an analgesic drug derivative Me -tapentadol has been achieved, exhibiting significantly enhanced μ-opioid receptor agonistic activity compared to its parent compound.},

In this article, we report on a rare-earth fluoride, NH 4 GdF 4, whose low-field magnetocaloric effect is significantly stronger than that of GGG. NH 4 GdF 4 orders at T c = 0.85 K and exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state at low temperatures as proved by the nearest neighbor exchange interaction model and the specific heat analysis. It has excellent low-field magnetization properties, as evidenced by approaching its saturation magnetization of 160 emu/g below a magnetic field of 10 kOe. Furthermore, the magnetic entropy change of up to 38.2 J·kg –1 ·K –1 and its measured temperature change of 1.1 K at an initial temperature of 1.8 K under the magnetic field change of 0–10 kOe are greater than all reported results and much greater than the entropy change and temperature change of GGG under the same conditions.

We report the first crystallographic characterization of a bent neptunyl(VI) complex, NpO 2 Cl 2 (phen) 2 , along with a linear plutonyl species that, unexpectedly, adopts the +V oxidation state. Coordination of two 1,10-phenanthroline ligands to NpO 2 2+ enforces pronounced bending of the O yl –Np–O yl unit to 162° through steric clashes with the axial phenathroline ligand, representing the sharpest angle reported for any neptunyl(VI) complex. In contrast, synthesis with PuO 2 2+ produces a reduced linear Pu(V) species, PuO 2 Cl(phen) 2 , underscoring the redox lability and the reluctance of plutonium to distort. Raman and IR spectra yield the first experimental stretching and interaction force constants for plutonyl(V). Comparison with values for plutonyl(VI) and bent and linear uranyl(VI) and neptunyl(VI) compounds shows that reduction perturbs the actinyl bond more than bending within one oxidation state. Electrochemical and spectroscopic studies clarify phenanthroline binding to Pu(VI) and the system’s reactivity. Quantum chemical calculations indicate that bending is energetically favored in the U–Np–Pu series, but the stabilization energy decreases as the actinide atomic number increases. NBO and QTAIM analyses reveal systematic trends: increasing 5f occupancy and decreasing An–O yl bond covalency from U to Pu. These results demonstrate that ligand-induced bending in neptunyl(VI) species is not only electronically feasible but also synthetically achievable, though plutonyl(VI) is constrained by redox reactivity. This work expands the frontier of nonlinear actinyl chemistry and illuminates how structure, oxidation state, and electronic configuration interrelate across the actinyl series.},

This strategy involves a voltage-gated electro-adsorption of Ru 4 POM on CNH-modified glassy carbon anodes with favorable interfacial dynamics, maintained under electrocatalytic conditions. These conditions are reached through the continuous reconstruction of the organic/inorganic interface (catch-and-release), as probed by converging thermal, microscopic, and electrochemical analyses. In fact, control experiments reveal that both pristine and N-doped CNHs display a Ru 4 POM loading in the range 13–18 nmol mg –1 with a remarkable ∼100 mV onset potential anticipation and current enhancement in the range 400–700% compared to the homogeneous conditions. By adopting the “catch-and-release” protocol, electro-esterification of aqueous EtOH features long-term stability of the productive current in the mA range ( J chrono ≈ 2 mA cm –2 at +1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl probed up to 18 h), with Faradaic efficiencies, FE EtOAc , of >90%. This effect is attributed to the crucial role of CNHs hydrophobicity to control hydrolysis equilibria, thus outperforming the solution-phase behavior, which levels off at FE EtOAc < 60%.},

A unique aspect of polymorphs is that they exhibit different physical properties, such as solubility, melting point, density, color, hardness, and bioavailability. Here, we synthesized polymorphs of colloidal crystals engineered with DNA by slow-cooling gold nanoparticle-core programmable atom equivalents (PAEs, particles with DNA sequences that control their bonding characteristics) under salt concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4 M NaCl. This approach yielded a diverse set of single-crystalline phases with cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal lattice symmetries. The structural transitions observed here arise solely from the modulation of interparticle repulsion via ionic strength and thermal processing. Notably, in certain cases, we observed diffusionless phase transformations, wherein the superlattices evolve from cubic to lower-symmetry tetragonal lattices. By tuning the thermal stability and salt concentration, we captured intermediate, metastable body-centered tetragonal structures during the slow-cool process, indicating that subtle changes in free energy can direct crystallization to low-symmetry phases. This study demonstrates that thermal and ionic parameters can be tuned to access and stabilize colloidal crystal polymorphs with emergent structures and interesting functional properties.},

  abstract     = {Renal clearance is traditionally viewed as a passive filtration process governed by fenestrated glomerular capillaries. However, proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) can still actively internalize, transform, and re-eliminate nanoparticles following glomerular filtration. Herein, we report that pH-responsive renal-clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of ∼2 nm in size can rapidly self-assemble into a single ∼180 nm nanosphere within individual PTEC endosomes in vivo once their isoelectric points (IEPs) overlapping the endocytic pH range (4.5–6.5), which has never been observed at the animal level. This pH-triggered one assembly per endosome delays subsequent reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated intracellular biotransformation into larger nanostructures while preserving membrane extrusion-based re-elimination. These findings reveal that endosomal acidity, alongside ROS, is a critical determinant of nanoparticle biotransformation and suggest that tailoring isoelectric points offers a route to control the subcellular assembly and clearance of renal-clearable nanomedicines at the animal level.},

Meanwhile, glycosyl derivatives play a pivotal role in chemical biology and drug discovery due to their widespread presence in biologically active molecules; however, the potential of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentanes (BCPs) as versatile scaffolds in glycoscience remains largely unexplored. Herein, we report an electrochemistry strategy for the synthesis of BCP–glycosides via the functionalization of [1.1.1]propellane. By leveraging an electrochemical halogen-atom transfer ( e -XAT) process, we achieved a one-step, three-component reaction of glycosyl bromides, [1.1.1]propellane, and radical acceptors under mild conditions, enabling the construction of glycosyl BCP–iodides, glycosyl BCP–H, and glycosyl BCP–pinacolboronic esters (Bpins) with exceptional functional group tolerance and scalability. Mechanistic studies suggested that the electrochemical process facilitated the generation of radical intermediates, which underwent selective addition to [1.1.1]propellane, followed by trapping with radical acceptors. This study establishes a versatile platform for late-stage functionalization and streamlined access to privileged scaffolds in drug discovery and chemical biology.},

  abstract     = {Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as a paradigm for investigating emergent quantum phenomena, particularly through their unique charge density wave (CDW) transitions and electron correlation effects. However, the inherent semimetallic characteristics of prototypical compounds such as TiSe 2 fundamentally constrain their thermoelectric performance. Herein, we unveil a breakthrough in thermoelectric TMDs through dual chemical control of both intralayer bonding and interlayer charge dynamics under valence compensation. Through partial substitution of 1/3 Ti 4+ ions with Cr 3+ in the intralayer TiSe 6 octahedral framework, we effectively suppress antibonding orbital interactions, thereby widening the bandgap from −0.46 to 0.53 eV. Simultaneously, controlled Cu + intercalation into interlayer selenium-coordinated void octahedra (i.e., van der Waals gaps) establishes three-dimensional charge transport pathways, resulting in a remarkable 50% enhancement in carrier mobility. Meanwhile, the vibrationally anharmonic Cu–Se bonding configuration dramatically reduces the lattice thermal conductivity to one-fourth that of pristine TiSe 2 . This concerted optimization culminates in a record-breaking dimensionless figure of merit ( ZT = 0.82) at 673 K in Cu-deficient composition of Cu 0.8 CrTi 2 Se 6 , representing a 40-fold enhancement over undoped TiSe 2 and setting a new benchmark for single-phase bulk TMD thermoelectrics. Our work demonstrates how atomic-scale coordination engineering can unlock superior thermoelectric performance in traditionally “non-ideal” material systems.},

  abstract     = {To address the increasingly limited water availability, using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture atmospheric water vapor as usable resources has emerged as a promising strategy. The adsorption characteristics of MOFs as well as their step pressure (i.e., the pressure when the steep rise in water uptake, if any, occurs) directly influence the amount of collectable water and thus their harvesting effectiveness. To date, a comprehensive understanding of water adsorption behaviors and how they are influenced by MOF properties remains lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically investigating water adsorption in >200 strategically selected MOFs with diverse features. The results demonstrate that water adsorption in MOFs is highly complex, revealing various subtypes of both non-S-shaped and S-shaped isotherms. Moreover, among S-shaped isotherms, distinct phase behaviors that, in turn, govern different adsorption mechanisms and hydrogen-bonding environments are identified, as evidenced by analyses of their macrostate probability distributions (MPDs), thermodynamic stability limits, and grand potential free energy landscapes. Further structure–property analyses also uncover key design principles: A moderate heat of adsorption is critical for enabling S-shaped isotherms, while the size of pores critically modulates the steepness of the adsorption step by controlling the phase transition nature of confined water. The density and, more importantly, the uniformity of adsorption sites are found as well to dictate the step pressure. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of diverse adsorption behaviors in MOFs as well as informs general design principles for the development of advanced adsorbents for atmospheric water harvesting.},

  abstract     = {Interfacial charge transfer reactions involving protons and/or electrons are fundamental to heterogeneous catalysis and many other reactions relevant to energy, chemical, and biological sectors. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with redox-active metal-oxo nodes have emerged as candidate materials to examine these reactions with near-atomic-level precision, given their crystalline nature. Here, we employed a colloidally stable, Ti-based MOF, Ti-MIL-125, with different crystal sizes to examine catalytically relevant charge transfer thermodynamics. The Ti 8 (μ 2 -O) 8 (μ 2 -OH) 4 nodes structurally mimic TiO 2 , which has shown some PCET reactivity toward reactions of H 2 , O 2 , and others. In this report, we have demonstrated that a change in crystal size induces different amounts of structural disorder to the Ti-oxo node, further changing the thermodynamics of proton/electron/hydrogen-atom transfer reactions. Using electrochemical open-circuit potential ( E OCP ) measurements, we have determined that all crystallites undergo a 1H + /1e – redox reaction, which, given the stoichiometry, can be considered as a net H atom transfer (HAT) reaction. The thermodynamics of this HAT reaction, the Ti 3+ O–H bond dissociation free energy (BDFE), was dependent on the crystal size of the MOF, as the decrease in crystal size induced more structural disorder. Our computational calculations have indicated that this difference in BDFE is due to a local change in the geometry of Ti cations, rather than the commonly invoked defects, such as the “missing-linker” defect sites. Individual proton/electron transfer (PT/ET) thermodynamics were also highly dependent on the crystal sizes. These were probed using p K a or band gaps ( E g ), respectively. These findings suggest that, particularly when MOFs are nanosized with a large amount of structural disorder, they should no longer be considered “true” single-site catalysts; this is an implicit, but widespread assumption within the MOF-based catalysis field. Implications of these findings will be contrasted with structurally similar metal oxides like TiO 2 and other redox-active MOFs.},

In this system, anodically generated α-aminoalkyl radicals mediate the activation of alkyl iodides, while aryl/heteroaryl aldehydes or nitriles undergo cathodic reduction to afford persistent ketyl radical anions or aryl radical anions. The matched redox processes facilitate selective radical–radical anion cross-coupling to furnish diverse alcohols and C(sp 3 )–C(sp 2 ) coupling products under mild conditions. This operationally simple, scalable protocol exhibits broad functional group tolerance and is applicable to a wide range of primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl iodides and structurally diverse aryl and heteroaryl coupling partners.

We present here an efficient catalytic approach focusing on the use of earth abundant iron in the form of iron carbide nanoparticles (ICNPs) activated by magnetic induction, allowing the reaction to proceed at pressures of only 3 bar of H 2 . The activity of the ICNPs responds in real time to on/off switches of the alternating current magnetic field (ACMF, 350 kHz, 70 mT), mimicking the use of intermittent renewable electricity, and the magnetic properties of the ICNPs allow for their easy separation and reuse. The reaction proceeds with higher yield and selectivities at global temperatures more than 130 °C below thermal activation, leading to at least four times higher energy efficiency. The method was successfully applied to a range of synthetic targets and to the selective depolymerization of real polyester (PET) products.},

  abstract     = {Multiple biological barriers in vivo severely restrict the delivery efficiency of nanoparticles (NPs) to tumors. To overcome biological barriers, traditional NPs usually require a complex design, which increases the difficulty of clinical translation. Therefore, there appears to be a dilemma between the complex biological barriers in vivo and clinical requirement for a simple molecular structure of NPs. Herein, an unprecedented zwitterionic polycaprolactone-poly(4-( N , N -dimethylamino- N -acetyl sulfadiazine) benzoyl oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (PCL–PSDMA) micelle is synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), capable of overcoming multiple biological barriers with minimalistic structure. First, the PCL–PSDMA micelle shows a zwitterionic state in a physiological environment, exhibiting long blood circulation without triggering accelerated blood clearance. Second, the PCL–PSDMA micelle traverses the blood–brain barrier effectively owing to the pathway mediated by the l -type amino acid transporter on cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Third, the PCL–PSDMA micelle converts from zwitterionic state to positively charged state in tumor extracellular environment, facilitating deep tumor penetration and enhanced tumor cellular uptake. Lastly, the zeta potential of the PCL–PSDMA micelle transforms to a stronger positive value in the lysosomal microenvironment, resulting in effective lysosomal escape. The outstanding performance of overcoming five sequential biological barriers endows the PCL–PSDMA micelle with high drug delivery efficiency to glioblastoma, leading to pronounced antitumor effect in two types of glioblastoma-bearing mice model. Overall, this work not only adds a new member to the zwitterionic family but also broadens the horizon of developing powerful NPs for antiglioblastoma drug delivery.},

Typically classified as self-assembly and epitaxy, heterointerface formation is generally assumed to proceed unidirectionally and irreversibly at bulk scales. Here we use in situ electron microscopy at 298 K to visualize the heterostructure formation from nanoscale mixtures of intrinsically immiscible salts at ambient conditions, NaCl and NaI. We find that both self-assembly and heteroepitaxy occur reversibly, governed by stochastic equilibria. During self-assembly, the system fluctuates between order and semiordered states, with kinetically favored iodide–graphene interactions and eventual formation of thermodynamically favored charge-neutral planes. The ions in the liquid state move rapidly. In the epitaxial regime, NaI layers repeatedly grow and exfoliate from a buffer layer. The observed motion of atoms driven by high interfacial energy occurs with an energy barrier of 18 kcal mol –1 or less as estimated from the Nyquist frequency of the frame rate of the movie. These observations reveal that heterointerface formation is governed by dynamic and stochastic processes, providing a framework for the understanding of the initiation stage of the heterointerface formation in high interface energy regimes such as surface and structural defects of bulk solids.},

However, the mechanisms for tuning microscopic reactivity of H 2 O molecules in aqueous electrolytes remain elusive. This study employs six ether molecules with distinct structures and solvation powers to regulate the microstructure of aqueous solutions. We reveal underlying correlations between the reactivity of H 2 O and microstructural parameters in organic-aqueous electrolytes. A more positive solvation power difference value between ether and H 2 O is appealing to drive enhanced microheterogeneity, which accordingly lowers the average Li + coordination number and reduces H 2 O cluster size. A small and isolated H 2 O cluster, which bridges the microstructural parameters and macroscopic electrolyte performance, is critical to suppress long-range H 2 O diffusion, thereby enhancing the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte. Diethyl ether with an optimal positive solvation energy difference with H 2 O forms minimal [Li(H 2 O) 4 ] + clusters and moderate anion aggregation, simultaneously enabling fast Li + ion diffusion and an expanded electrochemical window.

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) tin halide perovskites are highly tunable and low-toxicity semiconductors, promising for next-generation optoelectronics. However, achieving air stability and excellent photophysical properties simultaneously necessitates deliberate structure tuning using organic spacer cations and A-site cations. Here, we report a series of new quasi-2D Ruddlesden–Popper tin halide perovskites using a fluorinated aromatic spacer cation, 4-fluorophenethylammonium (4FPEA), and systematically investigate the impacts of layer thickness, spacer cation, and A-site cation on the crystal structures and optical properties of (4FPEA) 2 (A) n −1 Sn n I 3 n +1 . These 4FPEA-based 2D tin perovskites, further tuned by the A-cations, exhibit uniquely undistorted 180° out-of-plane Sn–I–Sn bond angles and low octahedral distortions compared to other quasi-2D perovskites and demonstrate prolonged air stability, excellent photophysics, and amplified spontaneous emission and lasing in exfoliated microflakes. A comprehensive survey of reported n = 2 lead and tin iodide perovskites reveals that all structures can be classified into three types (tilted, balanced, and buckled) based on the structural distortion parameters of their perovskite cages. Notably, (4FPEA) 2 (A)Sn 2 I 7 are among the handful of “balanced” n = 2 perovskites with minimal distortion and excellent optoelectronic performance. The structural insights and cage-balancing approach revealed herein motivate the deliberate design of quasi-2D perovskites through the synergy of the spacer and cage cations, further paving the way for high-performance optoelectronic applications of stable tin halide perovskites.},

  abstract     = {Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) substances, whose volume remains invariant under temperature variations, have attracted significant attention owing to their extensive potential applications in advanced technology fields. However, practical challenges persist, including thermal expansion anisotropy, ferromagnetism, high density, and restricted ZTE temperature windows. In this study, we have achieved a lightweight, nonferromagnetic, isotropic ZTE in Yb(Al,Mn) 2 alloys, which exhibits continuous shiftability of the ZTE temperature window across a wide range (140–650 K). By employing multiple advanced experimental techniques and combining first-principles calculations, we have elucidated that the ZTE behavior originates from valence fluctuations accompanied by local structural distortions. The latter manifests as the first two observed effects: the splitting of local bond lengths and the attenuation of atomic displacements. More importantly, the induced enhancement of hybridization between Mn-3 d and Yb-4 f orbitals is identified as the primary mechanism responsible for the emergence of shiftability over a wide temperature range. This work presents an unprecedented phenomenon of continuously shiftable ZTE temperature windows observed in the mixed-valence system Yb(Al,Mn) 2 , which holds significant potential for diverse thermal expansion control applications in advanced technological fields, paving the way for next-generation devices requiring exceptional dimensional stability. Furthermore, the modulation of valence fluctuations provides new strategies for the development of new ZTE materials in the future.},

  abstract     = {Recently photoinduced dynamic ligation in a metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) was reported, where a long-lived charge-transfer excited state (ca. 30 μs) featuring partial dissociation between the carboxylate linker and metal-based node was probed by time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy. The study offers a new mechanistic perspective to evaluate the potential contribution from the excited state molecular configuration to the performance of MOF photocatalysts. In this work, by employing MIL-101(Fe) as the study platform, we have further explored the influence of intramolecular interactions on the stability of relevant excited states and demonstrated the effective tuning of their lifetimes through the incorporation of different functional groups into the system. The correlations between the varied excited state lifetimes and coordination configurations with specific functional groups (−NH 2 or −NO 2 ) was inferred from the analyses of infrared spectroscopic data and theoretical calculations, revealing the essential role of the intramolecular interactions (i.e., between the added functional groups and the carboxylate group) in the modulation of system energetics. Overall, the work presents a pathway to tune the excited state dynamics and expands the knowledge regarding the photoinduced dynamic ligation in carboxylate-based MOFs.},

In this work, we present a novel enzymatic PSM strategy for functional group engineering within COFs. By taking advantage of enzymatic catalysis, 2-hydroxyethylthio (-S-EtOH) and ethylthio (-S-Et) groups were covalently implanted within the COF pore channels with high grafting efficiency under ambient aqueous conditions, highlighting the mild, efficient, and ecofriendly nature of this approach. Theoretical calculations and in situ experiments revealed that the incorporation of -S-EtOH not only promotes exciton dissociation with a superior charge separation efficiency but also strengthens the proton supply for the formation of hydrogenation intermediates and lowers the Gibbs free energy difference (Δ G ), thereby facilitating the photocatalytic H 2 O 2 production. Our work bridges the gap between enzymatic catalysis and reticular materials engineering, offering a conceptual breakthrough in COF postsynthetic modification and functionalization.},

  abstract     = {Targeted protein degradation with compounds like proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) directs disease-associated proteins to the E3 ligase ubiquitin-proteasome system for removal. However, commonly employed E3 ligases such as cereblon (CRBN) are broadly expressed. To metabolically gate PROTAC activity, we developed an enzymatic activation strategy by integrating an O-GlcNAc modification to the cyclimids, ligands derived from the natural motifs recognized by CRBN. These sugar-coated PROTACs (SCPs) were designed using structural analyses of representative cyclimid degraders complexed with CRBN and target protein BRD4. We found that glycosylation of the cyclimid reduced CRBN binding and complex formation with BRD4 until enzymatic removal of the O-GlcNAc moiety by O-GlcNAcase (OGA). The requirement for enzymatic activation is demonstrated by in vitro biochemical binding, cellular degradation, and cell viability assays in engineered and native cell lines. O-GlcNAc is thus an effective mechanism to gate targeted protein degradation modalities that motivates the development of similar strategies to enhance selectivity with other protein modifications.},

  abstract     = {Antigen-capturing nanomaterials hold great promise for cancer immunotherapy; however, the need for tumor localized administration and limited antigen-binding affinity remains the “Achilles heel” of this strategy. Herein, we present a tumor microenvironment (TME)-activatable nanoplatform, TDR848@FPB, designed for systemic administration and enhanced covalent capture of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), enabling effective immunotherapy with minimal off-target effects and independent of localized tumor administration. This platform encapsulates a photosensitizer-conjugated, light-activated toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, which induces immunogenic cell death and triggers a pro-inflammatory TME conducive to antigen capture upon light irradiation. TDR848@FPB covalently binds TAA-generated postphotodynamic therapy and promotes their efficient delivery to enhance dendritic cell maturation, T cell activation, and immunogenetic reprogramming of the TME. Following intravenous injection and light irradiation, TDR848@FPB demonstrates superior 1 O 2 generation capability and TAA capture efficiency, leading to significant tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, the captured TAAs and TLR agonists synergistically activate adaptive antitumor immunity, as evidenced by their potentiated T cell responses. These findings highlight the critical role of TME-activatable covalent antigen capture in enabling systemic delivery of antigen-capturing nanomaterials and validate TDR848@FPB as a versatile platform for precise cancer immunotherapy with a high therapeutic outcome and low off-target effects, independent of tumor localized administration.},

  abstract     = {The ultimate miniaturization of catalysts to single-atomic dimensions offers a promising route to maximize the catalytic performance through fully exposed active sites and precisely tailored electronic structures. However, the synthesis of atomically precise one-dimensional single-cluster or single-atom catalysts with the simplest periodicity remains challenging due to their thermodynamic instability. Here, we report a general strategy for fabricating single-unit-chain catalysts confined within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), where charge delocalization dramatically enhances the catalytic performance. Through a liquid-phase assembly approach, diverse clusters and atoms can be uniformly packed into ordered single-unit chains inside SWCNTs, irrespective of their electronic properties or solubility. These identical, well-defined single-unit chains maintain intimate contact with the conductive graphene walls of SWCNTs, enabling tunable positive or negative charge delocalization across the nanotube surfaces. The resulting catalysts demonstrate remarkable activity enhancements in both redox and coupling reactions, exhibiting rate constants 7.5∼28 times greater than their isolated cluster counterparts. Mechanistic studies reveal that charge delocalization simultaneously increases the density of active sites and reduces the activation barriers. This synthetic approach and catalytic mechanism show universal applicability to various single-chain catalysts. These systems maintain nearly undiminished activity in 230 h continuous-flow reactions, highlighting their exceptional stability for practical applications.},

  abstract     = {Lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries are promising next-generation rechargeable batteries due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their cycling lifespan is hindered by the poor stability of Li metal anodes. The main challenge lies in the severe Li polysulfide (LiPS) corrosion on Li metal anodes. Herein, galvanic corrosion induced by LiPSs is identified as the main cause of nonuniform Li deposition and dissolution in working Li–S batteries. Concretely, LiPSs continuously corrode the Li metal anode and thereby increase its electrode potential to different extents according to the corrosion kinetics. The electrical connection of the Li metals with different corrosion kinetics causes galvanic corrosion and consequent selective Li deposition in severely corroded locations. Consequently, spatially heterogeneous LiPS corrosion eventually induces localized Li utilization, uneven Li distribution, and accelerated cell failure. To alleviate the galvanic corrosion, a Li fluoride-rich solid electrolyte interphase is preconstructed to passivate Li metal, suppress LiPS corrosion, and extend the cycling lifespan of Li–S batteries by 57% under harsh working conditions. This work identifies the chemical nature of nonuniform Li deposition following the galvanic corrosion mechanism and highlights the importance of passivating Li metal anodes to realize long-cycling Li–S batteries.},

However, the relationship between the molecular aggregation and the magnitude of nonlinear two-photon absorption cross-section remains underexplored. Here, we systematically investigate the aggregation-dependent two-photon absorption properties of the fluorophore TPAPhCN by tuning the degree of aggregation. We observe a steady increase in the two-photon absorption cross-section as the fluorophore evolves from the single molecular state to the highly aggregated state. It is found that two-photon absorption signal emerges at an early stage of aggregation that is not observable by one-photon excitation. This divergence between the nonlinear and linear optical responses enables the construction of a dual-mode optical signature, allowing TPAPhCN to function as a self-reporting probe for each aggregation state.

In this work, we report the first method for the production of adipic acid from biomass-derived γ-valerolactone (GVL) with CO 2 and H 2 . It was discovered that the Rh catalyst with an I 2 promoter in a binary solvent system of AcOH/H 2 O could catalyze the reaction efficiently at an industrially relevant temperature (140 °C). A systematic and detailed analysis of the reaction pathway was conducted via experimental and DFT studies. The tandem one-pot process permits thermodynamic leveraging by coupling the thermodynamically unfavored GVL ring-opening with highly favored hydrocarboxylation, driving the overall reaction forward to diacid products. The reaction involves three key steps, including the reduction of CO 2 to CO and H 2 O by H 2 , the ring-opening of GVL to reaction intermediates, and the hydrocarboxylation of the intermediates with CO and H 2 O. The stable GVL can maintain a low concentration of the highly reactive intermediates and prevent their hydrogenation side reactions, which favors the high selectivity of diacids. Moreover, this strategy affords access to various diacids in high yields from different lactones, and the yield of the diacids could reach 89%.

  abstract     = {Although C(sp 2 )– and C(sp 3 )–OMe bonds are arguably the simplest and most atom-economical derivatives in the alcohol series, these linkages have rarely been utilized as coupling partners in the context of metal-catalyzed carbon-heteroatom bond-formation. Among other scenarios, Ni-catalyzed borylation of aryl and benzyl methyl ethers via C(sp 2 )– and C(sp 3 )–OMe cleavage is a particularly attractive endeavor, given that the resulting organoboranes are privileged synthons of utmost relevance in organic synthesis and materials science. Intriguingly, the nature of the boron reagent dictates whether functionalization occurs at the C(sp 2 )– or C(sp 3 )–OMe fragment. Herein, we report a detailed study aimed at understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of this reaction and the origins of site-selectivity. We conclude that the divergency in site-selectivity arises from a different nickel speciation within the catalytic cycle. Specifically, our investigations reveal that catalytic functionalization at the C(sp 2 )–OMe bond occurs via a Ni(I) manifold in the presence of B 2 nep 2 whereas a canonical Ni(0)/Ni(II) regime is responsible for the corresponding C(sp 3 )–OMe bond-cleavage with B 2 pin 2 as coupling partner. These findings focus attention on the critical role that metal speciation might have for dictating site-selectivity in other related cross-coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {Copper is an essential element for sustaining life. However, disruptions in copper homeostasis underpin disease, as illustrated by cuproptosis, an emerging form of cell death resulting from aberrant accumulation of copper pools in loosely bound, labile forms. Along these lines, activity-based sensing (ABS) offers a powerful strategy for tracking labile copper fluxes with metal and oxidation state selectivity by exploiting analyte reactivity for analyte detection. Traditional ABS probes for Cu(I), the major oxidation state of copper in cells, are selective but require O 2 as a coadditive, thus limiting their temporal resolution and sensitivity. Here, we present the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a first-generation ABS strategy for direct Cu(I) sensing by leveraging alkyne-directed cleavage reactivity. Copper Alkyne Probe-1 (CAP-1) features a rapid response to changes in intracellular Cu(I) pools with over 400-fold selectivity for Cu(I) over competing biological metals. We apply this probe to identify novel metal–metal crosstalk in cuproptosis, where we observe that Mn(II) exposure sensitizes cells to cuproptosis through upregulating the mitochondrial reductase FDX1 and depleting reduced glutathione, thus synergistically elevating labile Cu(I) levels. By revealing an interplay between copper and manganese in regulating cell death, this work provides a starting point for broader investigations of metal–metal nutrient crosstalk in biology and medicine.},

However, due to the structural complexity and the difficulty in the generation and characterization of these species, such a study at the molecular level is still challenging. Herein, a series of magic-numbered cluster ions of hydrated lanthanum oxide were studied by combining laser ablation mass spectrometry, infrared photon dissociation spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations. Based on the identified most stable isomers of the clusters, a new mechanism for OH migration has been revealed, in which the vibrational rocking of OH groups results in the migration of OH groups on the surfaces of the clusters with an energy barrier less than 12 kcal/mol. This work reveals the rocking-induced OH migration process and corresponding energy barriers, shedding light on the effects of rocking vibration modes on the mobility of OH groups and possible subsequent impacts on surface catalysis.},

Colloidal quasi two-dimensional (2D) quantum wells (QWs) possess high emission uniformity, photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), and narrow linewidths at room temperature, all contributing to ideal SPSs. However, their large lateral dimensions make excitons sensitive to environments and enhance multiexciton emission, casting long-standing doubt on their viability as SPSs. Here, we demonstrate bright room-temperature single-photon emission (SPE) with high purity and minimal blinking from in-plane-engineered (IPE) 2D QWs incorporating a doubly gradient architecture. A compositionally graded CdSe/CdSe x S 1– x core in the in-plane direction tailors electron–hole wavefunctions to control multiexciton Auger dynamics, while a graded Cd y Zn 1– y S shell in the thickness direction suppresses interfacial strain and nonradiative defects. This design unites 0D and 2D structural advantages, achieving near-unity ensemble PLQY and bright SPE (0.6–1.2 × 10 5 counts/s, NA = 0.65). Controlling the CdSe core size via IPE, we attain 92% single-photon purity (2 nm core), and suppressed blinking with a 96.9% ON-time fraction (8 nm core). This work establishes deterministic design rules for colloidal 2D QWs as high-performance SPSs for scalable quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Selective hydrocarbon oxidation processes are central in fine and commodity chemical production and are sensitive to the nature of the active metal sites and their surrounding coordination environment. Isometallic Fe-based carboxylate MOFs (MIL-100, MIL-101, and NH 2 -MIL-101) are employed to elucidate how Fe coordination environments and framework topology influence a probe aryl (styrene) oxidation mediated by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). MIL-101 shows the highest oxygenate production turnover rates, as normalized by in situ thiophene titrations, followed by NH 2 -MIL-101 and MIL-100. Post reaction e x situ Mössbauer spectroscopy elucidates Fe(II) formation under reaction conditions that underpin increased oxygenate production turnover rates; this Fe(II) formation was enabled by the reductive elimination of halide capping ligands unique to the MIL-101 family but not present in MIL-100 that only contains hydroxyls. Defect undercoordinated Fe sites promote unproductive H 2 O 2 decomposition and secondary oxygenate formation but do not perturb primary oxygenate selectivities. Conversely, stabilizing hydrogen-bonding interactions between N–H donors and postulated benzaldehyde metallocycle transition state structures confer NH 2 -MIL-101 100% selectivity for the primary oxygenate product benzaldehyde over styrene oxide at differential styrene conversions (<3%) compared to a maximum of 59% for MIL-101. Although a fraction of linker amine moieties oxidize to form nitro groups within NH 2 -MIL-101, Fe leaching, identified as a contributor to catalyst deactivation for all frameworks, is reduced. Overall, this work showcases how seemingly subtle changes and perturbations to the coordination environments local to metal sites influence the observed reactivity, selectivity, and stability for oxidative (and other) transformations within MOF-catalyzed reaction systems throughout their lifetimes.},

Using this approach, we achieve the efficient incorporation of 4-azido- l -phenylalanine into AlbC-derived cyclodipeptides, generating a diverse array of new-to-nature cyclodipeptides. Molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculations provide insights into the potential catalytic mechanisms responsible for the enhanced recognition of ncAA-tRNAs by engineered CDPS variants. Furthermore, we expand the substrate scope to additional ncAAs and extend this approach to other CDPSs, enabling the creation of an even broader range of novel compounds. Together, these findings reveal the significant potential of GCE technology to precisely engineer biomolecules beyond proteins, unlocking new structural and functional diversity.},

  abstract     = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are abundantly present in space. The grandPAH hypothesis states that small PAHs are photodissociated, while large symmetric PAHs survive the harsh environments in space. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that large aromatic molecules (C n H m with n ≥ 60) can convert to buckminsterfullerene (C 60 ). In this work, we test these hypotheses by studying the products formed upon dissociative electron ionization of two isomeric C 14 H 10 PAHs, anthracene and phenanthrene. The fragment ions that are formed following H loss and H 2 loss are isolated in a cryogenically-cooled 22-pole ion trap and tagged with neon. Infrared predissociation spectra are recorded of the thus formed van der Waals bound complexes and the PAH dissociation fragments are identified based on a comparison with density functional theory (DFT) calculated spectra. The ionized PAHs undergo radical isomerization prior to the loss of H or H 2 , resulting in a highly symmetric daughter ion that is identical for the two distinctly different parent PAHs. Moreover, the product ions are found to obey the isolated pentagon rule, which also curves fullerenes and contributes to their structural stability. We propose a mechanism for the radical isomerization based on existing molecular dynamics simulations from the literature augmented by DFT calculations. This study lends credit to the grandPAH hypothesis by showing that PAH species isomerize drastically to form a new molecule that is highly symmetric. Moreover, the formation of a daughter species that obeys the isolated-pentagon rule suggests that there is a strong chemical link between interstellar PAHs and fullerenes.},

Here, we report the controlled self-assembly of diverse supramolecular architectures by a new directional bonding approach through the integration of radical-based dynamic covalent chemistry and supramolecular synthons. A novel macrocyclic synthon, S1 , with a linear direction is constructed via radical-based dynamic covalent bonds from the phenothiazine building block substituted with two dicyanomethyl radicals. By coupling S1 with phenanthrene- and carbazole-based linkers with different angles, we achieve precise and controllable self-assembly. As anticipated, when S1 is paired with a 60° phenanthrene linker, a triangular superstructure, the macrocycle-bridged macrocycle M1 , is formed. Notably, coupling S1 with a nearly 90° carbazole linker yields two distinct superstructures, M2 and M3 , with triangular and quadrangular geometries, respectively. Interestingly, both the synthon and its assembled superstructures exhibit intriguing thermal association and dissociation behaviors, facilitated by the formation of stable chromogenic radicals. This dynamic process was thoroughly investigated by using VT-UV–vis–NIR, VT-NMR, and VT-EPR spectroscopies. More significantly, the reversible dissociation and association of radical-based dynamic covalent bonds enable the full thermal conversion of M2 and M3 . This study highlights the potential of integrating radical-based dynamic covalent chemistry with supramolecular synthons as an emerging strategy for the precise construction of sophisticated and multifunctional supramolecular architectures, paving the way for the development of novel stimuli-responsive materials.},

However, the chemical conversion capacity of most PBSs has inherent limitations, as whole-cell bacteria and isolated enzymes require fine-tuning of environmental conditions. Here, we report a new PBS developed by introducing free-standing ceria nanoparticles into the purple membrane (PM) of Halobacterium salinarum archaea, which can unidirectionally transfer charge carriers in response to incident photons, even after separation from living archaea at various conditions. Our microscopy, spectroscopy, and synchrotron X-ray scattering analyses confirm that the electrostatic assembly between ceria and PM creates seamless interfacial contact, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic capacity of ceria. Although the conversion of dinitrogen (N 2 ) to ammonia (NH 3 ) is thermodynamically challenging due to the triple bond in N 2 and a series of charge-transfer reactions, our PM–ceria (PMC) hybrid nanoparticle efficiently produces NH 3 by reducing N 2 using solar energy even under atmospheric pressure and room temperature while simultaneously converting glycerol into value-added derivatives. Additionally, our PMC nanoparticle involves neither toxic/precious metals nor bioengineering processes to achieve enhanced photocatalytic N 2 -to-NH 3 conversion. This study sheds light on the new aspect of PBSs by employing PM to potentially resolve the global energy and environmental challenges posed by the conventional Haber–Bosch process.},

  abstract     = {Monolayer MoS 2 is attractive for future photonics and optoelectronics for its direct-gap excitons with ultrahigh binding energies. However, the atomically thin structure is prone to nonradiative defects, challenging to scale for large-area production, and inherently limited in optical cross-section, all hindering technological integration. Stacking monolayers to increase the optical cross-section results in multilayers with diminished photoluminescence activity. Electrochemical molecular intercalation of multilayer MoS 2 weakens interlayer coupling, creating a bulk monolayer material that retains monolayer characteristics within a multilayered “bulk” architecture. However, the electrochemical process often severely degrades the optical quality and is difficult to implement for scalable thin film production. Here, we report a luminescent monolayer MoS 2 colloidal ink for scalable solution processing of large-area bulk monolayer MoS 2 membranes with thickness-scalable bright luminescence. Using perfluorinated sulfonic-acid ionomer (Nafion) as a multifunctional ligand, we achieve a stable dispersion of monolayer MoS 2 ink that can be readily processed into large-area stretchable membranes with diverse form factors. The Nafion interlayers decouple interlayer interactions while effectively passivating nonradiative defects, preserving direct-gap monolayer characteristics in thickness-scalable MoS 2 /Nafion membranes. This leads to unprecedented enhancements in both linear and nonlinear excitonic transitions, showing over 100-fold brighter excitonic photoluminescence and nearly 1000 times stronger second harmonic generation. These remarkable properties remain robust against intense laser irradiation, diverse environmental conditions, and mechanical deformations. Our studies overcome the longstanding challenge of poor optical quality in solution-processed monolayer MoS 2 ink materials, establishing a large-area, thickness-scalable platform for excitonic devices across diverse technological domains, including photonics, optoelectronics, solution-processable bioelectronics, and electrochemical sensing.},

  abstract     = {Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mRNA formulations have revolutionized the field of nucleic acid therapeutics, yet their broader clinical application is constrained by inflammatory side effects and oxidative stress, particularly in the context of inflammatory diseases. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a lipoic acid-based ionizable lipid library to address these limitations. By leveraging the antioxidant properties and thiol-mediated uptake potential of lipoic acid, we identified LA-A2B2CD3 as an optimal candidate through a structure–activity relationship study and design of experiment (DOE) optimization. LA-A2B2CD3 LNPs exhibited superior reactive oxygen species scavenging, enhanced mRNA translation, and reduced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo . Mechanistic studies revealed that the efficient cellular uptake and the transdermal delivery capacity of LA-A2B2CD3 heavily rely on the reducible disulfide ring of lipoic acid. Application of LA-A2B2CD3 LNPs for the localized transdermal delivery of Cas9 mRNA and CD93 sgRNA in a murine model of psoriasis resulted in effective CD93 genome editing and the inhibition of the CD93–p38 MAPK–AKT–SMAD2/3 pathway, leading to significant therapeutic improvement. This work presents a robust, biocompatible LNP platform with minimized immunogenicity and strong potential for genome-editing therapies in inflammatory conditions, offering a transformative approach for the mRNA-based treatment of skin and other inflammation-related disorders.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic water splitting offers a scalable and potentially low-cost route for the production of renewable hydrogen. Recently, a state-of-the-art system based on flux-mediated Al 3+ -doped SrTiO 3 , modified with Rh–Cr-based proton reduction and CoOOH water oxidation cocatalysts, achieved apparent quantum yields for unassisted water splitting of up to 93%. Herein, we focus on the role of Al 3+ doping and Rh–Cr-based cocatalyst deposition on the accumulation and reaction dynamics of the long-lived holes required to drive water oxidation. We employ in situ and operando photoinduced absorption spectroscopy (PIAS) under water splitting conditions complemented by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS data indicate that Al 3+ doping suppresses surface Ti 3+ defect states, coinciding with a 5-fold increase in the accumulation of long-lived SrTiO 3 holes observed by PIAS. Rh–Cr-based cocatalyst addition is observed to further enhance the yield and lifetime (s–10 s time scales) of these photoaccumulated holes, assigned to the efficient electron extraction by this cocatalyst. These photoaccumulated holes exhibit fast (ca. 1 s) and slow (ca. 10 s) decay phases. While the dominant fast phase is assigned to the desired water oxidation reaction, the slow phase is assigned to deeply trapped unreactive holes; the yield of these unreactive holes is suppressed by facet-selective photodeposition of cocatalysts or preillumination. These results provide key insights into how Al:SrTiO 3 functionalized by Rh–Cr-based cocatalysts accumulates oxidizing holes with lifetimes long enough to drive the kinetically challenging water oxidation reaction, thus achieving remarkably high quantum efficiencies for overall water splitting, insights which can be applied in the design of future photocatalytic materials.},

Despite its significant potential, ensuring efficacy in vivo typically requires rapid reaction kinetics, high-efficiency payload release, and stable reactants; however, relevant reports remain sparse. Herein, we developed a strain-promoted alkyne-nitrone cycloaddition (SPANC)-based click-release chemistry through installation of a carbamate-linked release moiety at the propargyl position of cyclooctyne, triggering a spontaneous elimination following click cycloaddition to achieve efficient payload liberation. This bioorthogonal click-release system demonstrates rapid reaction kinetics and high-yield payload liberation while maintaining exceptional stability under both in vitro and cellular conditions. Furthermore, we established a facile synthesis of highly click-reactive nitrones, enabling the construction of a systematic substrate library and validating the broad applicability of this strategy. In the context of implementation, our developed bioorthogonal anticancer prodrugs utilize nitrone-mediated activation to unmask anticancer activity. In 4T1 murine breast cancer models, this bioorthogonal prodrug activation strategy demonstrated significant tumor suppression with favorable safety profiles, validating the feasibility of this click-release chemistry for in vivo use.},

  abstract     = {The Li + solvation structure and the electrode–electrolyte interface critically determine the cell performance. Here, we systematically compare the effects of the coordination ability of ether with Li + on cell performance, from ultrastrong coordinating solvents (crown ethers) to a moderate coordinating solvent (dimethoxyethane) and weak coordinating solvents (diol dimethyl ethers). Compared with the moderate coordinating ether, both weak and strong coordinating ethers show improved antioxidation capability, while weak coordinating ethers facilitate faster Li + desolvation and enable better performance with the Li-metal anode. Dimethoxypropane shows a relatively better electrochemical performance owing to the coexistence of strong chelating and weak monodentate coordination with Li + . Furthermore, introducing interfacial passivators of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide and fluoroethylene carbonate further improves the cell performance and narrows the gap among solvents. Based on their respective benefits of solvents, we propose a hybrid electrolyte combining strongly coordinating 12-crown-4 (12-C-4) for Li + capture and weakly coordinating hexanediol dimethyl ether (HDE) as an ion-conductive diluent. The strong coordination of 12-C-4 with Li + and the dual anions in axial coordination facilitate the construction of an inorganic-rich cathode/electrolyte interphase, while the HDE diluent buffers the energy barrier during Li + desolvation and uniforms Li-plating. This hybrid electrolyte exhibits higher ionic conductivity and better interfacial stability with both the anode and cathode than single ether, significantly improving the cycling stability of Li//LiNi 0.85 Mn 0.075 Co 0.075 O 2 cells and bringing a new electrolyte design paradigm for high-voltage ether electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Carbon–hydrogen bond activation is a pillar of synthetic chemistry. While it is generally accepted that Pd is more facile than Ni in C–H activation catalysis, there are no experimental platforms available to directly compare the magnitude of C–H bond weakening between Ni and Pd prior to bond scission. This work presents the first direct measurements of C(sp 3 )–H bond acidity (p K a ) and bond dissociation free energy (BDFE) for a species containing a ligated alkane–palladium interaction (R 2 CH 2 ···Pd), also known as an agostic interaction. Through standard-state equilibrium measurements and advanced computational modeling, we show that Pd acidifies C(sp 3 )–H bonds 100,000 times more than Ni (5 p K a units), indicating that acidification is a key factor making Pd a privileged metal in C(sp 3 )–H functionalization reactions. Energy decomposition analysis (EDA) calculations show that this is primarily due to a greater electrophilicity of the palladium containing fragment, as forward charge transfer (Δ E CTf ) from the agostic methylene moiety into [Pd] is significantly increased. More broadly, these valuable findings help unravel fundamental performance differences between Earth-abundant and precious metals, potentially guiding future ligand design efforts for catalysis.},

  abstract     = {Zeolite-confined Rh-based catalysts have emerged as promising heterogeneous candidates for olefin hydroformylation. However, they face challenges of reactant- and product-induced Rh leaching and aggregation. Herein, zeolite framework-anchored Rh δ+ –(O–Zn) x sites were designed and are shown to have remarkable activity and stability for gas-phase ethylene hydroformylation. The bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by coencapsulating Rh and Zn species into Silicalite-1 zeolite, and the Rh δ+ –(O–Zn) x sites were in situ constructed during the induction period of the hydroformylation process through the interaction between mobile Rh-carbonyl species and framework ≡SiOZn–O(H). The change of the Zn/Rh molar ratio significantly affects the dispersion of Rh and the proportion of highly active Rh δ+ . The optimal 0.2Rh@Zn 3 -S-1 catalyst achieves a propanal turnover frequency as high as 148 h –1 at 363 K and shows no sign of deactivation during the 40 h test. In contrast, zinc-free 0.2Rh@S-1 suffers rapid deactivation due to Rh aggregation. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals that the transfer desorption of propanal from Rh to Zn–O contributes to the redispersion of Rh during the construction of Rh δ+ –(O–Zn) x structures. Moreover, the observed HRh(CO) 2 species together with the enrichment of Rh δ+ -propionyl intermediates on the catalyst indicates that the hydrogenation of acyl species is the rate-limiting step of ethylene hydroformylation, which is further supported by kinetic analysis. This study presents a new strategy for designing stable and efficient gas-phase ethylene hydroformylation catalysts using zeolite-anchored metal species as inorganic ligands for Rh δ+ centers and provides insights into the hydroformylation mechanism occurring on the bimetallic sites.},

  abstract     = {The cytosolic iron–sulfur cluster assembly (CIA) targeting complex maturates over 30 cytosolic and nuclear Fe–S proteins, raising the question of how a single complex recognizes such a diverse set of clients. The discovery of a C-terminal targeting complex recognition (TCR) peptide in up to 25% of CIA clients provided a clue to substrate specificity, yet the molecular and energetic basis for this interaction remained unresolved. By integrating computational and biochemical approaches, we show that the TCR peptide binds a conserved interface between the Cia1 and Cia2 subunits of the targeting complex, even in the absence of the Fe–S cluster. Since this same site also mediates binding of predominantly apo-Nar1, the proposed Fe–S cluster carrier, we provide in vitro evidence for Nar1’s role as a cluster trafficking protein in the CIA pathway. We further show that Cia1–Cia2 complex formation is essential for CIA function as substitutions disrupting this interface, including the disease-linked R65W Cia1 variant, impair TCR peptide-dependent client recruitment. Our findings also clarify the role of the poorly characterized human paralog Cia2a, proposed to act solely in iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1) maturation. We find that a Cia1–Cia2a complex can bind the TCR peptide, suggesting a broader role for Cia2a in Fe–S protein biogenesis, as IRP1 lacks a TCR motif. Together, these findings define a well-conserved molecular mechanism for client recognition in the CIA pathway and uncover how CIA targeting complex assembly and client identification are mechanistically linked to human disease.},

However, preparing stable transition phase materials is a challenge. Here, a highly active transition phase is precisely captured from a birnessite-to-spinel transition via an ion-steric strategy. The intercalation of Ca 2+ affects the thermodynamics of phase transition, hinders the migration of Co 2+ , and broadens the phase transition temperature window from 450–500 °C to 400–600 °C, enabling the capture of favorable transition phase material (Ca-TP-op) with short-range ordered spinel configuration and long-range disordered MO 6 (M = Mn, Co) octahedral framework structure at 500 °C. The novel structures within transition phases promote electron transfer, alter orbital hybridization, and activate lattice oxygen. Consequently, Ca-TP-op demonstrates efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity, surpassing both the composite and mechanical mixture of birnessite and spinel. The universality of the ion-steric strategy can be demonstrated by the intercalation of Na, K, Mg, Sr, and Ba ions.

Among these, the optimized NIR-emission ratiometric fluorescent probe Rap-9 demonstrated the most pronounced electrophilicity at its reactive site, enabling rapid and specific detection of Arg both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Rap-9 was successfully utilized for real-time imaging of Arg dynamics during O 2 ·– -stimulated NSC differentiation. Further studies revealed that Arg-mediated activation of the mTORC1 pathway could coordinate qNSC reactivation and neuronal differentiation by regulating mitochondrial energy metabolism from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

DNA-based neural networks, with their potential advantages in versatility, scalability, and energy efficiency, offer a promising alternative to traditional systems. However, despite significant advancements in pattern recognition and algorithm accuracy, current DNA-based neural networks, relying on the complementary pairing of DNA nucleobases, suffer from the nonreusability of their computing materials. This limitation not only raises operational costs but also restricts their capacity for implementing learning mechanisms. Here, we introduce an unprecedented noncomplementary DNA-based perceptron (NCP) computation strategy, marking the first successful demonstration of a reusable DNA-based neural network. We present a “tagging” strategy to facilitate the scaling-up of noncomplementary DNA-based neural network. We show that 4-bit molecular pattern recognition can be simply achieved through strand-displacement reactions between four input strands and four pairs of noncomplementary DNA duplexes in the NCP, with weighting values modulated by duplex concentrations. Furthermore, a noncomplementary “winner-take-all” module enables decision-making, as demonstrated in an “I Spy” game task. Most importantly, by utilizing removable input strands (lipid–oligonucleotide conjugates), our NCP-based neural network enables reliable multicycle computations, overcoming the critical reusability challenge in DNA-based neural network computation.

  abstract     = {Low molecular weight amines promote sulfate (SO 4 2– and HSO 4 – ) formation through acid–base reactions, contributing to fine particulate matter (PM). Heterogeneous ozonation converts nontoxic amine salts into highly toxic products, yet the ozonation activation mechanism is unclear. This work reveals a sulfate-dominant ozonation mechanism of amine salts in fine PM by combining advanced mass spectrometry and ab initio calculation methods. With the synergy of • OH-initiated oxidation, SO 4 2– activates amine ions through deprotonation, producing imine molecules as ozonation intermediates. Subsequently, HSO 4 – accelerates the formation of the intermediate aminomethanol and ozonation products. Moreover, this novel ozonation mechanism of amine salt is verified to be efficient for sulfate fine PM and is not feasible for chloride or nitrate fine PM. In this study, the key role of sulfate in the ozonation of inert organic compounds is highlighted, which needs to be considered in fine PM chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Secondary active transporters are membrane proteins involved in moving substrates across the cellular membrane. Conformational dynamics underlie this process, allowing the transporter to sample at least two conformations, nominally grouped into inward- and outward-facing states. While studies of structure and dynamics have revealed atomistic insight into transport mechanisms and transport rates, the relative free energy differences among conformations remain underexplored. In this work, we quantified free energy differences between inward- and outward-facing conformations of the multidrug E. coli transporter EmrE using 19 F NMR spectroscopy. EmrE consists of an antiparallel and asymmetric homodimer, where its quaternary structure resembles the inverted repeat structures found in larger nonoligomeric transporters. NMR experiments were performed using a minimal heterodimer of EmrE, where a single mutation was introduced into one monomer of the native EmrE homodimer. We discovered that a single conservative mutation perturbed the conformational equilibrium between inward- and outward-facing states by up to 1.5 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, we also found that as little as a single fluorine atom influenced the equilibrium by up to 0.8 kcal/mol. These measurements provide quantitative evidence that subtle changes influence the free energy landscape of a transporter, suggesting a plasticity that may be beneficial in divergent evolution to tune the transport mechanism.},

  abstract     = {On-surface synthesis via metal-surface-catalyzed C–C bond formation presents unique advantages for the design of graphitic nanomaterials with atomic precision. Following this approach, the coimplantation of nontrivial topology and flatband structures in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) has emerged as a compelling pursuit, serving as platforms for realizing exotic quantum phases of matter through the interplay of topological states and strong correlations. However, the exploration of these intriguing properties has been largely constrained by the limited known on-surface reactions capable of creating topological flatbands in GNRs. In this work, we promote the intermolecular oxidative coupling of concealed non-Kekuléan nanographenes to construct topological flatband GNRs and GNR heterojunctions on the Au(111) surface. Utilizing Clar’s goblet as a proof of concept, we demonstrate repetitive intermolecular cyclodehydrogenation with high regioselectivity to form pentagon-embedded GNRs. The coupling of the zero modes in Clar’s goblets generates extended electronic states with evident nodes between them, arising from inherent topological frustration, thus resulting in topological flatbands close to the Fermi level and topologically protected end states. Our atomically resolved measurements obtained using scanning tunneling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy, complemented by density functional theory and tight-binding model calculations, illustrate the on-surface reaction cascade and the electronic properties of the designed products. These findings open significant opportunities for the on-surface construction of low-dimensional carbon-based quantum materials.},

Subjecting the membrane-integrated circuit to an auxiliary fuel strand, in the presence of a nicking enzyme, results in the dynamic reconfiguration of the circuit into a constitutional dynamic network, CDN, in which the pre-engineered duplex interactions between the constituents lead to allosterically stabilized Met-dimer complexes. The concomitant nickase-induced separation of the CDN leads to the parent reaction circuit, and to the transient formation and depletion of the Met-dimer complex. By labeling the components comprising the reaction circuits with fluorophores, the dynamic transient reconfiguration of the CDN and the accompanying Met-dimer formation and separation within the cell membranes are characterized by temporal confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging. Moreover, the transient formation of the Met-dimer in the MCF-7 cell membrane induces intracellular signaling and activation of the Akt/FAK phosphorylation pathway. This is reflected by the network-guided control over the transient migration/motility functions of the MCF-7 cells.},

  abstract     = {Photocatalytic α-C–H activation of alcohols to form aldehydes and ketones represents an important synthetic pathway, although the selective formation of C-centered radicals remains challenging due to competing O–H activation processes. While extensive research has explored heterojunction band alignment, charge transfer directionality, and component-specific redox reactions, the atomic structure at interfaces and its catalytic role have received limited attention. Here, we demonstrate a TiO 2 -CuO heterojunction photocatalyst that achieves exceptional selectivity in the oxidation of isopropanol to acetone, with a hydrogen production rate of approximately 4400 μmol/g/h. Through complementary characterization using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), we identify the formation of asymmetric Ti-O(H)-Cu + units at the TiO 2 /CuO heterojunction interface. In situ EPR reveals a ·C(OH)(CH 3 ) 2 radical intermediate, confirming that the reaction proceeds via selective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) of the α-C–H bond in isopropanol, in contrast to that of TiO 2 or CuO, which proceed via hydrogen extraction of the OH group. These mechanistic insights into interface-mediated catalysis provide new design principles for engineering atomic-scale catalytic interfaces, offering new opportunities for developing next-generation photocatalysts across diverse catalytic applications.},

  abstract     = {RNA is a key drug target that can be modulated by small molecules; however, covalent binders of RNA remain largely unexplored. Using a high-throughput mass spectrometry screen of 2,000 electrophilic compounds, we identified ligands that react with RNA in a binding-dependent manner. RNA reactivity was influenced by both the reactive group and the noncovalent RNA-binding scaffold. In addition to known RNA-reactive electrophiles such as N -acylimidazoles and bis(2-chloroethyl)amines, covalent screening enabled the surprising discovery that common thiol-reactive electrophiles (chloroacetamide) and rarely characterized electrophiles (3-chloropivalamide) cross-linked to RNA. These results suggest that electrophiles commonly used for protein targeting can also covalently modify RNA, potentially contributing to both on- and off-target effects. This insight enabled the design of an RNA-specific covalent compound by modifying a bis-benzimidazole scaffold, originally identified to bind DNA, to react selectively with the expanded triplet repeat RNA, r(CUG) exp , that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Selectivity appears to arise from differences in the RNA and DNA binding modes, revealing that proper positioning of the electrophile toward the nucleophilic guanine residue is important for efficient covalent bond formation. Overall, this study highlights the potential of rationally designing covalent RNA-targeting small molecules.},

Revolutionary approaches in RNA-focused small molecule libraries have successfully identified RNA-binding ligands but generally remain limited in diversity and impeded by a dearth of structural insight into RNA and RNA complexes. Cyclic peptides are potential structural mimics of evolutionary RNA-protein interacting motifs and can be massively diversified and selected via genetically encoded libraries, offering a complementary approach. This study introduces genetically encoded thioether cyclic peptide libraries constructed through mRNA display using a dibromoxylene linker and its fluorosulfonyl derivative that can covalently engage RNA nucleophiles. Using an optimized mRNA display workflow for RNA binders, we discovered high affinity, covalent and noncovalent binders for SNCA 5′ UTR IRE, the upstream iron-responsive element that post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of α-synuclein, an intrinsically disordered protein implicated in Parkinsonism and related neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, a stringent selection strategy employing “base-paired” target analog counterselection enhanced specificity by deenriching nonspecific electrostatic interactions mediated by polycationic residues. Further engineering hit peptides with an imidazole tag yielded selective RNA degraders in which covalent degraders showed noticeably improved potency from noncovalent counterparts. This work provides a prototype framework for evolution-driven, high-throughput, RNA-targeted drug discovery using cyclic peptides.},

These building blocks are prepared from dipeptides and are applicable at nonobvious peptide ligation junctions, including Leu–Ile and Lys–Ile. We applied this approach to the synthesis of K48/K63 selectively protected ubiquitin monomers for chemoenzymatic ubiquitin chain formation and the total synthesis of tirzepatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist peptide therapeutic containing amino-isobutyric acid (Aib) residues and a fatty acid side chain modification.

This transformation leverages bench-stable and scalable SF 5 -transfer reagents to generate the SF 5 radical, which engages azabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes bearing ketone, ester, alkyl, or aryl substituents in strain-release difunctionalization reactions. The method proceeds under mild reaction conditions, features broad functional group tolerance, and offers operational simplicity. The resulting N –SF 5 azetidines demonstrate high aqueous stability and increased lipophilicity, positioning them as a novel class of potential bioisosteres in medicinal chemistry.},

  abstract     = {The direct transformation of C–H bonds into C–C bonds via cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) represents a powerful strategy in synthetic chemistry, enabling streamlined bond construction without the need for prefunctionalized substrates. While traditional CDC approaches rely on polar mechanisms and preactivation of one of the C–H partners, recent advances have introduced radical-based strategies that employ a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) approach to access carbon-centered radicals from unactivated substrates. Herein, we report a nickel-catalyzed CDC reaction between aldehydes and alkenes for the synthesis of skipped enones, leveraging aryl radicals as intermolecular HAT agents. The transformation proceeds via the in situ generation of aryl radicals from aryl bromides, which mediates HAT from both the aldehydic and allylic C–H bonds to generate acyl and allylic radicals, respectively. These radicals are then engaged in a nickel-catalyzed radical–radical cross-coupling to deliver the skipped enone products. This method demonstrates a broad substrate scope, high chemoselectivity, and excellent tolerance to diverse functional groups, providing a versatile platform for late-stage functionalization and synthesis of valuable skipped enone scaffolds.},

However, while many aptamers possess excellent association rates, they tend to exhibit slow dissociation kinetics. While these slow off-rates are great for single-use applications, they pose a significant challenge for applications requiring continuous, repeated measurements where hysteresis complicates subsequent binding events. The G-quadruplex represents a common motif in many high-specificity aptamers and is composed of complexed guanine residues. Here, we present a method for modulating G-quadruplex aptamer binding kinetics through use of a polycytosine strand that can destabilize quadruplex structure and accelerate target release in a predictable manner. We demonstrate this phenomenon for several aptamer targets, including thrombin, interferon-gamma, and nucleolin, and highlight the ability of these modified aptamers to capture dynamic changes in analyte concentration on minute time scales.},

  abstract     = {To achieve a sustainable future, the electrification of the chemical manufacturing industry is crucial. The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) offers a promising pathway to produce value-added chemicals and fuels, including methanol─a key chemical building block and energy carrier. This approach presents a carbon-neutral alternative to conventional, fossil fuel-based methanol production. However, replacing well-established thermochemical processes and achieving cost-competitive production requires the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts for CO 2 -to-methanol conversion, as well as systematic device-level optimization. In this Perspective, we discuss the potential of methanol production via CO 2 RR and provide an overview of recent advances in catalyst development. We also propose experimental protocols for methanol quantification, emphasizing the critical need for rigorous evaluation of catalysts to ensure the validity and reproducibility of results, and demonstrating boron phosphide as an irreproducible case. We review seminal studies on CO 2 RR by cobalt phthalocyanine to make methanol, and current understanding of the reaction mechanistic details. Lastly, we discuss the challenges associated with its translation into practical devices and outline future research opportunities to advance electrochemical CO 2 RR for methanol production at scale.},

However, practical applications are often hindered by the activity limitations inherent in the adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the stability limitations associated with the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Herein, we demonstrate structural changes induced by phase transformation in Co 1.5 Mn 1.5 spinel oxides, which yield more active octahedral sites with shortened intersite distance. This structure optimization favors a direct O–O radical coupling mechanism, which circumvents the involvement of the *OOH intermediate and prevents overoxidation of the active sites, significantly enhancing both the OER activity and stability. Consequently, the optimized CoMn-400 catalyst exhibits an overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA cm –2 in 0.1 M KOH (310 mV for commercial RuO 2 ), and maintains negligible activity loss over 300 h’ chronopotentiometry test at a current density of 100 mA cm –2 . This simple strategy provides fundamental insights into transition metal oxide catalyst design and opens new possibilities for optimizing electrochemical energy conversion.},

One-electron oxidation of trans -(depe) 2 Fe(CH 3 ) 2 (depe = 1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane) generated the corresponding isolable iron(III) dimethyl derivative that was unstable toward Fe–CH 3 homolysis. Oxidation of the corresponding iron(II) bis(aryl) complex trans -(depe) 2 Fe(tolyl) 2 resulted in rapid reductive elimination of the biaryl with formation of iron(I). These observations motivated the synthesis of the cationic iron(III) metallacycle derived from C–H activation of a neophyl ligand. This complex mediated the ortho -selective C(sp 2 )–H alkylation of a host of arene derivatives containing ketone, amide, pyridine, ester, and sulfoxide directing groups with greater selectivity and reactivity than the iron(II) counterpart. The effect of bis(phosphine) ligands was examined, where decreasing ligand lability correlated with a higher barrier. The experimental rate law, deuterium labeling studies, deuterium kinetic isotope effect experiments, and computational modeling support a reversible C–H activation step followed by rate-determining C(sp 2 )–C(sp 3 ) reductive elimination. Using design principles to minimize undesired reactivity, the iron(III) cycloneophyl complex mediated more facile and chemoselective C–H functionalization with a broader directing group compatibility than the iron(II) analog, arising from a combination of increased ligand lability, less exergonic substrate coordination, an enhanced orbital hybridization effect in C–H activation, and more facile C–C reductive elimination.},

  abstract     = {Albomycins are unusual sulfur-containing nucleosides from the species of Streptomyces that exhibit potent antibiotic activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including clinical pathogens. Previous studies demonstrated that the twitch radical SAM enzyme AbmM catalyzes an oxidative sulfur-for-oxygen swapping reaction converting CDP to a 4′-hydroxy-4′-thiocytidine 5′-diphosphate intermediate in the initial step of albomycin biosynthesis. However, the fate of this intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway has remained elusive. Herein, the above intermediate after 5′-dephosphorylation is shown to undergo AbmG-catalyzed transformations via a cryptic double phosphorylation of its 4′-hydroxyl group followed by C–O bond cleavage to yield 5′-oxo-4′-thiocytidine. X-ray crystal structure analysis and site-directed mutagenesis of AbmG revealed Glu188 as the general base to perform C5′ deprotonation. Subsequent mechanistic studies using deuterated substrates demonstrated that the deprotonation at C5′ is pro - R specific and likely occurs concerted with elimination of pyrophosphate from C4′. This study not only highlights a unique nucleoside kinase with lyase activity to complete an overall dehydration reaction but also fills the gaps in the biosynthesis of the atypical thiofuranose core essential to the biological activities of albomycins.},

Leveraging the eCO 2 R side of the teeterboard calls for a fundamental understanding of the triphasic electrode process involving a complex arrangement of electric double layers (EDLs). Herein, a series of model catalysts with tailored cavernous parameters are fabricated to geometrically and spectroscopically decipher the competing HER and eCO 2 R processes that engage different proton sources. A comprehensive set of in situ/ operando spectro-electrochemical tools, including differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, vibrational spectra (Raman and Infrared), and rotating disk electrode, are combined to interrogate the geometrically modulated HER and eCO 2 R kinetics with exceptional temporal and spectral resolutions. We uncover that an overcrowded EDL zone comprising capacitively stored K + cations in closely packed nanocages disfavors eCO 2 R at high current densities via limited reaction volume, restrained CO 2 supply, and escalated water dissociation. We further show that, by meticulously crafting the mesoporous cavity structure and suitably expanding the hierarchical EDL zone, great acidic eCO 2 R performance of near-unity CO Faradaic efficiency can be achieved across a wide current range over a prolonged operation. This work offers profound insights into the spatial regulation of mass transport, local chemical environment, and EDL arrangement via tailored catalyst geometry toward high-efficiency eCO 2 R.},

Here, we construct a refined system to accurately compare the strength of CH−π interactions between phenylalanine derivatives and aliphatic amino acids through molecular exchange processes inside a protein nanopore. Based on a quantitative comparison of binding strengths, we found that CH−π interactions are primarily governed by dispersive attraction, and a more acidic C–H bond results in stronger CH−π interactions, both of which are consistent with the literature. Most importantly, we resolved the long-standing debate regarding the deuterium isotope effect on CH−π interactions and confirmed that deuterium forms weaker CD−π interactions compared to protic CH−π interactions.},

Owing to the multiple interactions between individual oligopyrrole molecules and an A–B–C-style stacking of the 2D honeycomb layers, crystalline chloride-SOF exhibits reasonable thermal stability and retains its structure upon desolvation. Treating contaminated water containing 100 mg L –1 picric acid (PA) with the desolvated form of chloride-SOF reduced the PA concentration to the low ng L –1 (ppt) level.

  abstract     = {Single-atom Ni catalysts hold great promise for the acidic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), owing to their high CO selectivity. However, their performance under industrially relevant high current conditions is limited by the weak interaction between isolated Ni–N 4 sites and *COOH intermediates, restricting efficient CO 2 conversion. Here, we introduced edge-rich Ni–N 4 sites via support vacancy engineering to enhance *COOH adsorption, thereby boosting the CO 2 RR activity and selectivity in acidic media. Density functional theory calculations revealed that edge-rich Ni–N 4 sites induced an upward shift in the Ni d -band center, leading to stronger *COOH binding and improved reaction kinetics. Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the uniform dispersion of single-atom Ni sites at the edge of the carbon support. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy further validated the successful anchoring of Ni–N 4 sites on the carbon nanotube matrix. Furthermore, in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy directly evidenced the enhanced *COOH binding on the engineered active sites. As a result, the optimized catalyst achieved a high CO faradaic efficiency exceeding 94.5% at 800 mA cm –2 , alongside a cathodic energy efficiency above 44.2% at pH = 1, suppressing previously reported benchmarks. This work establishes a versatile strategy for electronic structure modulation through edge-site engineering, offering a pathway to unlock the full potential of single-atom catalysts for the acidic CO 2 RR at high current densities.},

Electron-deficient phenols resist selective coupling due to their high oxidation potential, while monosubstituted phenols undergo uncontrolled overoxidation, making their selective transformation highly challenging. We present a strategy that harnesses in situ biphenol-boron complexation to suppress overoxidation, unlocking the selective catalytic oxidative coupling of both electron-deficient and monosubstituted phenols. This method is broadly applicable to both heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalytic systems, each operating via distinct mechanisms. By overcoming a fundamental barrier in oxidative phenol coupling, this work not only redefines the scope of catalytic oxidative transformations but also paves the way for new advances in oxidative couplings with implications in pharmaceuticals and materials science.},

In this work, based on our developed metal-pincer nanoclusters and their unique di-coordination mode, we explored a functionalization method that allows flexible regulation of the spatial match/mismatch between the nanometal catalytic sites and the chiral organocatalytic sites of metal nanoclusters. A proline-functionalized Au 11 nanocluster was constructed as the dominant catalyst. It enables asymmetric Michael addition of aldehydes and nitroalkenes with high TON and enantio-/diastereoselectivity, affording γ-nitroaldehydes that can be further transformed into important organic molecules. Mechanism studies revealed the catalytic synergy of the metal kernel and surface ligand, endowing the metal-pincer nanocluster catalyst with significantly higher efficiency than the individual proline and nanometal catalysts.},

However, fusing different thermosets (A-B type fusion) remains challenging due to their distinct dynamic behaviors and variable activation energies for bond exchange. This study introduces catalyst-free solid-state C═C/C═N metathesis chemistry to achieve A-B type fusion between two distinct thermosets. Furthermore, by simply adjusting the mixing ratio of the parent thermosets, the thermal behavior, mechanical properties, activation energy ( E a ), and topology freezing transition temperature ( T v ) of the fused networks can be precisely tailored. This approach offers enhanced control over thermal and mechanical characteristics, rendering them suitable for diverse high-performance applications.

  abstract     = {Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as an appealing, sustainable and cost-effective candidate for grid-scale energy storage due to abundant K resources and reversible K + de/intercalation in graphite anodes (KC 8 , 279 mAh g –1 ). However, their practical operation suffers from sluggish kinetics and severe capacity deterioration in traditional carbonate electrolytes. Herein, ethoxy (pentafluoro) cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) and methyl (2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) carbonate (FEMC) are introduced as cosolvents to rejuvenate conventionally low-concentration (1 M) 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)-based electrolytes. In the resultant 1 M KFSI-DME/PFPN/FEMC (3 vol %) electrolyte, the cyclotriphosphazene group of PFPN is revealed to not only mitigate the flammability of DME but also diminish the K + -DME interaction through steric hindrance. While FEMC preempts the DME-induced corrosion of the potassium anode by facilitating the formation of a KF-enriched interface. Consequently, ether cointercalation into graphite is successfully suppressed in K||graphite cells, exhibiting 96% capacity retention over 1800 cycles (a running time of 402 days). When the temperature drops from 50 to −20 °C, the K-ion full device retains a capacity as high as 89%. The study introduces a novel electrolyte regulation strategy that harmonizes intrinsic safety, rapid kinetics at subzero temperatures, and enduring cycle stability at the same time, thereby advancing the practical implementation of PIBs for the future.},

  abstract     = {Iron homeostasis is essential for the virulence of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus . The cytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin GrxD was recently shown to play a critical role in A. fumigatus iron metabolism via regulation of iron–sulfur (Fe–S) binding iron-responsive transcription factors and interaction with components of the cytosolic Fe–S cluster assembly pathway. Interestingly, the putative copper-binding metallothionein CmtA was also identified as a binding partner for GrxD; however, the metal-binding properties of both proteins and the nature of their interactions were unclear. Here, we addressed these open questions by recombinant expression and purification of GrxD and CmtA and analysis of their metal–protein and protein–protein interactions. Using elemental analysis and UV–visible absorption, circular dichroism, EXAFS, Mössbauer and EPR spectroscopies, we demonstrate that recombinant CmtA expressed in Escherichia coli can bind a [2Fe-2S] 2+ cluster, mononuclear Fe 2+ , Zn 2+ , and Cu + , while recombinant GrxD ligates a mixture of [2Fe-2S] 2+ and [3Fe-4S] + clusters at its dimer interface. Furthermore, we discovered that the interaction between GrxD and CmtA involves thermodynamically-driven transfer of a [2Fe-2S] 2+ cluster from GrxD to CmtA. Accordingly, coexpression of GrxD with CmtA in E. coli increases in vivo Fe–S cluster loading in CmtA, supporting a role for GrxD in delivery of [2Fe-2S] 2+ clusters to CmtA. Taken together, these results suggest that the sole metallothionein in A. fumigatus represents a unique class of fungal metallothioneins that functionally interacts with Fe–S cluster trafficking and storage proteins.},

The optimized supramolecular chemosensor TympG 2 exhibited specificity, sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, rapid kinetics (∼145 ms), and photostability, enabling it to be suitable for monitoring Glu dynamics in neuronal organelles, brain tissues, and zebrafish. Significantly, we established the first Glu-associated functional network map across 24 deep brain regions using a homemade high-density fiber photometry array. It was discovered that the correlations between adjacent brain regions, especially between cortex, hippocampus and thalamic populations, were significantly reduced in the hypoxic mice compared to normal mice. Overall, TympG 2 enabled spatiotemporally resolved quantification of glutamatergic activity ranging from subcellular compartments to expansive neural networks across various model organisms. This comprehensive approach not only enhances our understanding of Glu dynamics but also aids in identifying potential neurological disruptions associated with altered glutamatergic signals.},

Calculations suggested that intermediate absorption induced structural deformation in MPcs. Moreover, hydrogen-bond interactions and conformational changes enriched with substituted methoxy groups in MPcs enhance structural flexibility. Operando Raman studies revealed that these hydrogen bonds correlated with the reversible structural deformation of NiPc.

For example, C-heteroatom bond cleavage is widely used in fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl/ tert -butyl (Fmoc/ t Bu)-based solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). Despite its usefulness, it has inextricable limitations, such as issues with hydrophobicity and side reactions, owing to the need for the use of a strong trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, a pervasive forever chemical) as the cleavage reagent. To overcome these drawbacks, alternative strategies to replace Fmoc/ t Bu-based protection and deprotection for SPPS are urgently needed. Here, we introduce a novel SPPS platform based on Fmoc/pyridinemethyl (Pic) chemistry, which enables the orthogonal protection of amino acid side chains and their efficient removal via photocatalytic C-heteroatom bond cleavage under mild conditions. Our approach utilizes the feedstock Pic group to cage amino acid side chains, which eliminates the need for TFA, thereby offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional peptide synthesis. Furthermore, this approach seamlessly integrates with automated peptide synthesizers, enabling acid-free, on-resin photorelease of structurally complex peptides, which remains challenging for conventional SPPS methodologies.},

However, the ability of solvated cations to tune and activate water for C 2+ production in the CO 2 RR has been overlooked. In this study, we report the incorporation of a covalently grown layer of functionalized phenyl groups on the Cu surface that leads to a 7-fold increase in ethylene production (to −530 mA cm –2 ) and a 6-fold increase in C 2+ products (to −760 mA cm –2 ). Our mechanistic study, notably by in situ infrared, isotope effect, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveals that the surface grafting provokes the reduction of the hydration shell around alkali cations at the electrode–electrolyte interface. This reduction weakens the hydrogen bond network and thus enhances water dissociation to provide a proton for the CO 2 RR. Moreover, it increases cation density at the outer Helmholtz plane, resulting in a larger local electric field that further stabilizes intermediates en route to C 2+ production. Our study brings to light the crucial role of cations in modulating the interfacial water structure, which has to be optimal for efficient C 2+ production in CO 2 RR.},

Employing spectroscopic and stoichiometric studies, we identified a solvent dependence on rates of the irreversible dimerization of ( t -Bu bpy)NiBr, measured rates for the activation of aryl halides and alkyl halides by ( t -Bu bpy)Ni I and ( t -Bu bpy)Ni 0 , and found that the reduction of ( t -Bu bpy)NiBr to Ni 0 is inefficient with common heterogeneous metal reductants. Taken together, these studies enable us to propose a general mechanism for cross-electrophile coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {Molecular engineering of electrolytes for practical high-power and high-energy lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is a significant challenge due to the difficulty of simultaneously achieving high Li + transport efficiency, minimal gas evolution, and stable cathode-electrolyte and anode-electrolyte interphases (CEI and SEI, respectively), with low charge-transfer resistance. Here, we introduce a fluorinated asymmetric lithium salt, lithium (2-(2-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl) ((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (LiFOA), designed to optimize electrolyte physicochemical/electrochemical properties for stable LMB pouch cells under fast cycling conditions. LiFOA features a Li + -affinitive side chain, which folds up and suppresses anion migration, resulting in a significantly heightened Li + transference number ( t Li + ). Moreover, the folding enables a self-cleaning mechanism for both the SEI and CEI. Thus, robust and ultrathin CEI and SEI with low charge-transfer resistance are self-evolved simultaneously. Importantly, a semifluorinated methyl terminal of the side chain further optimizes molecular folding strength with a tuned donor number, which not only elevates the electrochemical stability of the functional salt but also significantly mitigates the gas-evolution issue of the electrolyte during harsh cycling of the battery. Through this molecular design, industrial pouch cells with LiFOA achieve an outstanding combination of practical demanding performances in terms of high energy density (523 W h kg –1 at 0.1 C), high power density (1782 W kg –1 at 5 C), excellent cycling stability, suppressed gas evolution, modest cell volume expansion, and a significantly lowered defect under rigorous operating conditions, highlighting LiFOA’s potential for next-generation high-energy-density and high-power-density practical LMB applications.},

The concept of making use of dative boron–nitrogen (B ← N) bonds for the construction of macrocycles has been proposed, but very few examples have been prepared with functional structures, much less pillar-like and other prismatic macrocycles, and their various functionalities have not been fully exploited. Here, we introduce a “functional molecular wall” synthetic protocol based on the self-assembly characteristics of B ← N dative bonds to construct highly symmetrical macrocycles, forming a quasi-pentagonal-shaped macrocycle (named [5]pyBN- p ) with a pillar-like structure. Single-crystal analysis confirmed that its structure exhibited a 5-fold symmetric crown-shaped cavity with a diameter of approximately 9.65 Å, forming four sets of three-dimensional channel stacking structures. In solution, thermal cycling between heating and cooling allows for a fast and fully reversible conversion between monomer pyBN- p and pentameric macrocycle [5]pyBN- p . The resultant macrocycle [5]pyBN- p exhibited delayed fluorescence (DF) property and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the solid state. Notably, the supramolecular aggregates of macrocycle [5]pyBN- p possessed permanent porosity and showed an efficient C 2 H 6 /C 2 H 4 inverse separation capacity. This work highlights a new molecular design strategy for B ← N-containing macrocycles, enriching the family of molecular species and expanding new avenues for their applications.},

  abstract     = {Understanding and controlling the nucleation and growth processes of gold clusters are crucial for advancing the nucleation theory and targeted cluster synthesis. While in situ mass spectrometry has revealed the intermediate species formed during the growth process, the overall structural evolution remains unclear due to a lack of crystallographic information. In this study, we examined a new synthetic method for thiolate-protected gold clusters in their embryonic stage. In this method, only partial Au(I) precursors are reduced by a minimal amount of mild reductant in the presence of a substoichiometric amount of thiol. Under optimized conditions, we obtained a series of small gold clusters, including Au 15 (SCTMS) 13 , Au 18 (SCTMS) 14 , Au 22 (SCTMS) 18 , Au 23 (SCTMS) 17 , Au 25 (SCTMS) 18 , Au 33 (SCTMS) 25 , and Au 34 (SCTMS) 26 (TMSCS – : trimethylsilylmethanethiolate), and successfully determined their geometric structures via single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Unexpectedly, the synthetic yield of Au 25 (SCTMS) 18 with an icosahedral Au 13 core was very low despite the stability of this composition. The obtained structural information suggests that under our synthetic conditions the dominant process is the assembly of triangular Au 3 and tetrahedral Au 4 units, each with two electrons, in an anisotropic structure followed by passivation with unreduced Au(I)-SCTMS complexes. Notably, Au 33 (SCTMS) 25 and Au 34 (SCTMS) 26 have a pencil-shaped Au 16 core with an Au 3 width and exhibit strong absorption and emission in the near-infrared region. Due to their extremely thin diameter and quantized electronic structures, we propose naming these anisotropic species “gold quantum needles”. This study deepens our understanding of the cluster formation mechanism at the atomic level and provides a novel synthetic route for highly anisotropic gold clusters.},

  abstract     = {Colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can generate multiple excitons (MXs) within a single QD. Owing to their large absorption cross-section, efficient utilization of MX is anticipated for the development of light-harvesting systems. However, MXs typically undergo nonradiative decay via Auger recombination (AR). In this study, we investigated the possibility of energy transfer from the MXs in a single QD to multiple cyanine dyes (Cy3) adsorbed on the QD surface. Based on the linear relationship between the AR lifetime and QD volume, formamidinium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) with three distinct size distributions were synthesized. Simultaneous measurements of emission photon correlations and individual pristine PNC sizes revealed that the probability of multiphoton emission increased in PNCs larger than 12 nm. This was attributed to a slowdown in the AR rate, which was evaluated by transient absorption spectroscopy. Subsequently, multiple Cy3 dyes were adsorbed onto the PNCs as energy acceptors to evaluate the transfer of energy from the MXs to multiple Cy3 dyes. Photon correlation measurements of Cy3 emission via energy transfer─induced by excitation of a single PNC─showed an increased probability of multiphoton emission in PNC-Cy3 systems with PNC sizes exceeding 12 nm. These findings indicate that multiple Cy3 dyes were excited and emitted via the energy transfer from MXs. Thus, we clearly demonstrate that energy transfer from MXs to multiple surface dyes is feasible using large-sized PNCs.},

  abstract     = {We previously reported that molecules containing two cyclic hydrazide units connected by a polymethylene linker could catalyze aldol condensations via a bifunctional mechanism. One hydrazide apparently provides nucleophilic activation, via enamine formation, while the other provides electrophilic activation, via iminium formation. Here, we ask whether catalytic efficacy can be enhanced by using a conformationally preorganized linker to connect the hydrazide units. In the new catalyst series, the linkers are α/β-peptides (oligomers containing α- and β-amino acid residues). The α/β-peptide scaffold features a 1:2 α:β backbone repeat and forms a helix with approximately three residues per turn. When α residues with hydrazide-containing side chains have an i , i +3 sequence relationship, helical folding induces alignment of the hydrazides. Incremental variation of side chain length allowed us to identify an optimal spacing between the hydrazide units, comprising 16 atoms. Catalytic efficacy, as judged by relative initial rates of an aldol condensation, was ∼3.5-fold greater for this α/β-peptide relative to the dihydrazide with a flexible 16-atom spacer from the previous series. Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses of three α/β-peptide catalysts provide insight into modes of conformational flexibility available to these foldamers.},

Despite this, methods to synthesize housanes are lacking due to their highly strained nature. Herein, we report an intramolecular cyclopropanation strategy to obtain functionalized housanes using palladium carbenes (20 substrates, up to 89% yield). Key to the success of this reaction was the insight that the reactivity of Pd(0) carbenes is controlled by the supporting ligand. Strongly donating N -heterocyclic carbene ligands promote cyclopropanation reactivity, while some π-accepting phosphoramidite ligands (e.g., rac -MonoPhos) afford C–H insertion products (8 examples, up to 20:1 selectivity). Deuterium-labeling studies revealed a KIE of 2.1 at 80 °C, suggesting a palladium carbene is involved in the C–H insertion step, and the independent synthesis of alkyldiazenes confirms that they are not relevant intermediates in this reaction. The housane products were amenable to late-stage cross-coupling reactions and ring-opening reactions to provide cyclopentanes.},

The multivalent ligand design proves essential for successful self-assembly, as the smaller incarcerated cage cannot be independently synthesized in an exclusive manner. Notably, the improved solubility and exceptional stability of the nested cage even at low concentrations allow for structural characterization by high-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, solution-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Moreover, its well-defined internal cavity permits the in situ reductive formation of gold nanoparticles, demonstrating its potential as a functional nanoreactor.},

Herein, we report a radical-mediated deoxyphosphoamination of ketones to synthesize a new class of antiviral compounds, including N -(2-(diphenylphosphoryl)-1 H -inden-3-yl)- P , P -diphenylphosphinic amide (IDPA) and its homologues. This transformation proceeds under simple, mild, and easily operable reaction conditions, exhibiting a broad substrate scope and excellent functional group tolerance. Mechanistic investigations, including control and radical inhibition experiments, high-resolution mass spectrometry detection of key intermediates, and density functional theory calculations, reveal a concerted pathway involving nitrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus radicals that facilitate N–O bond cleavage and the formation of C═C, C–P, and N–P bonds. Biological evaluations demonstrate that these scaffolds possess potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity with low cytotoxicity. Proteomic analysis, molecular docking, and Western blotting further elucidate the mechanism by which IDPA inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication through its interactions with receptor protein CD163 and host protein HSP70. These findings establish a versatile strategy for developing radical-based antiviral agents and provide promising candidates for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract     = {The exceptional performance of ceria (CeO 2 ) in catalysis and energy conversion is fundamentally governed by its defect chemistry, particularly oxygen vacancies. The formation of each oxygen vacancy (V O •• ) is assumed to be compensated by two localized electrons on cations (Ce 3+ ). Here, we show by combining theory with experiment that while this 1 V O •• : 2Ce 3+ ratio accounts for the global charge compensation, it does not apply at the local scale, particularly in nanoparticles. Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) defect calculations, together with synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, show that electrons have a strong preference to localize and segregate on surfaces, which can overcome the trapping force from the V O •• sites in the bulk. At a given Fermi level, the surface V O •• tends to trap more electrons than those in bulk, resulting in a higher Ce 3+ to V O •• ratio on surfaces than that in the bulk, driven by the preferential localization of electrons and enhanced V O •• –Ce 3+ coupling. Large-scale unbiased Monte Carlo simulations on ceria nanoparticles confirmed this trend and further show that the surface segregation of electrons is more pronounced at low reduction levels and in smaller nanoparticles. In highly reduced ceria nanoparticles, however, the enhanced repulsive interactions lead to a less significant extent of defect heterogeneity or even reverse the location preference of defects in some nanoparticles. Our findings underscore the need to consider both the overall nonstoichiometry and local defect behavior in easily reducible oxides, with direct relevance to their performance in catalytic and energy applications.},

As strategic three-dimensional alternatives to ortho - or meta -substituted arenes, C2-substituted BCPs provide access to an underexplored chemical space. The pursuit of efficient and broadly applicable synthetic routes for these scaffolds remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the unique topological features of BCP cores. Here, we report a robust and modular strategy for the direct synthesis of C2-substituted BCPs from readily available bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) and diazo compounds. Leveraging homolytic cleavage of the central bond in BCBs, a triplet energy transfer-initiated carbene insertion process occurs, to form 1,4-biradical species, which are ultimately converted to the target BCPs via rapid radical recombination. This methodology establishes a modular platform for systematic access to the C2-functionalized BCP architectures, enabling expeditious diversification of the three-dimensional skeletons. Its practicability has been further demonstrated through the collective replacement of the phenyl moiety with bioisosteric BCP in 15 bioactive molecules.},

This concept has been limited to inorganic glasses. Here, we introduce metal–organic crystallized glasses (MOCGs), prepared by controlling the crystallization process within metal–organic framework (MOF) glasses, and explore their properties. By adjusting the annealing temperature and duration above the glass transition temperature ( T g ), we control the crystallinity and crystallite size in 2D Cd(H 2 PO 4 ) 2 (1,2,4-triazole) 2 -based MOCGs, enabling modulation of their micromechanical properties, dielectric constants, and proton conductivities. The MOCG with a 15% relative crystallinity exhibits a dielectric constant of 3.3 × 10 2 at 100 kHz, an order of magnitude higher than that of both the parent glass and crystalline phases across 30–100 °C. We further extend this concept to a mixed-metal MOF glass system, where solid solutions occur through the incorporation of Cd 2+ and Mn 2+ ions from the amorphous matrix into crystallizing lattices upon annealing.},

  abstract     = {Materials exhibiting coexisting exploitable properties often result in especially attractive behavior from both fundamental and applied perspectives. In particular, magnetoelectric materials combining ferroelectric and magnetic properties are increasingly becoming paramount nowadays. Here, we show that FeH 6 (PO 4 ) 3 exhibits proton conductivity and the coexistence of magnetic and polar structural features, suggesting that such frameworks may be of broader interest beyond the field of proton conductors. By a combination of neutron diffraction and second harmonic generation experiments, we have demonstrated that FeH 6 (PO 4 ) 3 crystallizes in the polar R 3 c space group. Inversion symmetry breaking is triggered by a polar proton ordering within the structure. In FeH 6 (PO 4 ) 3 , this particular cation ordering in combination with the polar displacement of the adjacent structural units results in a polar crystal structure with a calculated net polarization of approximately 10 μC cm –2 between 10 and 300 K. Together with an antiferromagnetic state below 28 K, determined from a combination of neutron diffraction and magnetic measurements and associated with the particular Fe 3+ octahedral arrangement, the result is the coexistence of both properties. By a detailed study of this system with a full description of the crystal structure as well as the ionic and magnetic properties, we aim to spark further investigations in magnetoelectric materials existing in the solid ionic conductor phase space.},

In parallel, developing diverse transformations at different sites is an appealing strategy to expand the diversity of appendages on scaffolds. Owing to the availability of C–H bonds at multiple sites of pharmacophores, diversity-oriented C–H activation reactions are an ideal approach to realize this goal. Given the pharmacophoric significance of the naphthalene scaffold in clinical drugs, diversity-oriented C–H functionalization reactions on this scaffold would be useful for drug discovery. Direct C–H activation at the challenging C6 and C7 positions has remained unexplored due to electronic similarity, remote distance from the directing group, and interference from geometrically identical positions (C7 vs C3, C6 vs C4). Herein, we report two types of templates designed to differentiate the C6 and C7 positions on the naphthalene scaffold. The success is attributed to manipulation of the distance parameter in the template and the utilization of an oligopeptide ligand. Notably, the utility of this diversity-oriented C–H activation is showcased through the divergent modification of naphthalene-containing complex molecules.},

  abstract     = {Image-guided surgery plays a critical role in improving the cancer patient prognosis. However, current clinical probes are often single-modal with “always-on” signals, failing to provide complementary and precise guidance across all perioperative phases. To tackle this hurdle, we develop a biomarker-activatable, multimodal nanoprobe – LanCop – based on redox-mediated manganese valence switching for tumor-specific, perioperative image-guided surgery. LanCop comprises a lanthanide nanoparticle (LnNP) core surrounded by high-valence manganese-rich MnO 1.69 satellites, which initially exhibits negligible T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast and second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence. In the glutathione-rich tumor microenvironment, Mn 3+ /Mn 4+ ions are reduced to free Mn 2+ ions, effectively generating strong MRI contrast via increased unpaired electrons and enhanced spin relaxation and simultaneously disrupting energy quenching between the core and satellites to restore NIR-II fluorescence. This dual-signal activation enables precise preoperative MRI tumor localization, real-time intraoperative fluorescence-guided tumor resection, and rapid optical biopsy confirmation (within 5 min) in mouse glioma models. Deep-seated tumors are detected in real-time with a high signal-to-background ratio (12.6 ± 0.7), and microtumors as small as ∼0.5 mm × 0.7 mm are precisely excised under NIR-II fluorescence guidance. Notably, it accurately distinguishes human glioma specimens from adjacent normal tissue, demonstrating its potential for histopathological assessment. To our knowledge, LanCop is the first activatable multimodal probe capable of guiding all perioperative phases, offering a promising strategy to enhance surgical precision and improve clinical outcomes in cancer treatment.},

Using lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as a catalyst, we realized carboxylic acid-initiated cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of 2-ethyl-2-oxazoline (EtOx). The dynamic exchange between carboxylate and TFSI – anions, driven by Li + –carboxylate interaction, significantly enhances the activity of oxazolinium propagating species and ensures uniform chain growth, as shown by both experiments and calculations. Interestingly, a proper solvent, γ-valerolactone, also plays a vital role, likely by promoting ion-pair separation at elevated temperatures. A wide scope of functional groups is readily introduced by commercialized carboxylic acids, especially benzoic acid derivatives and analogues, with controlled molar mass, low dispersity, and high/quantitative end-group fidelity achieved, and polymerization rate varying with the initiator structure. The end functionalities of polyEtOx are exemplified by surface adsorption–protein resistance and aggregation-induced emission properties. This catalytic paradigm breaks through long-standing limitations in weak-acid-initiated CROP, indispensably upgrading the toolkit for macromolecular engineering.},

  abstract     = {Metallofullerenes with endohedral lanthanides have emerged as a versatile class of single-molecule magnets owing to strong single-ion magnetic anisotropy, which can be realized in the interior of the fullerene cage. Since exohedral chemical modification of fullerenes is often used to adjust their properties and processability for prospective practical applications, it is necessary to understand how it can affect their magnetic properties. In this work, we studied how a popular [2 + 1] cycloaddition reaction, photochemical addition of adamantylidene (Ad), affects single-ion magnetic anisotropy and single-molecule magnetism of MSc 2 N@C 80 (M = Nd, Dy). For each lanthanide, the reaction yielded [5,6]-open and [6,6]-open isomers of the monoadduct MSc 2 N@C 80 (Ad). Paramagnetic 1 H NMR was demonstrated that the Ad-addition site in [5,6] isomers is predominantly coordinated by Sc, whereas both Sc and lanthanide coordination coexist in [6,6] isomers. Ab initio calculations and Nd-based photoluminescence showed that the [5,6] isomer has enhanced ligand-field splitting, whereas coordination of the lanthanide to the Ad-addition site in the [6,6] isomer reduces magnetic axiality and ligand-field splitting. For DySc 2 N@C 80 (Ad), Dy-Ad coordination leads to a noticeable reduction in the blocking temperature of magnetization, whereas Dy coordination to the unfunctionalized fragments of the fullerene cage improves the SMM performance in comparison to the unfunctionalized DySc 2 N@C 80 . Thus, carbene addition can enhance or deteriorate SMM properties depending on the regioisomerism and the lanthanide-cage coordination geometry in MSc 2 N@C 80 (Ad) adducts. These results demonstrate that chemical derivatization of EMFs can become a useful tool for improving their magnetic properties, but will require careful evaluation of different factors for each reaction type.},

  abstract     = {Mixed-halide perovskites of formula MAPb(Br x I 1– x ) 3 , where MA is methylammonium, are of great interest for optoelectronic applications (particularly high-efficiency solar cells) due to their finely tunable bandgap, which enables precise control over light absorption. However, their stability remains a critical challenge, notably due to reversible photoinduced halide segregation. Under continuous illumination, this process leads to the formation of Br- and I-rich domains, which lower device performance by introducing low-bandgap regions that trap charge carriers. Despite extensive efforts, the mechanism of photosegregation remains debated, partly due to the difficulty in characterizing these compositionally disordered systems, especially under illumination. Here, we report a systematic investigation across a series of MAPb(Br x I 1– x ) 3 compositions using 79/81 Br and 127 I nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, we present the first application of NQR under in situ illumination to directly probe photoinduced halide segregation, focusing on compositions with x = 0.9, 0.8, and 0.6. Our findings highlight the potential of NQR as a powerful, noninvasive technique for studying local environments under illumination. The results reveal composition-dependent light-induced segregation when comparing substantially different stoichiometries. In contrast, the 81 Br NQR spectra of MAPb(Br 0.9 I 0.1 ) 3 and MAPb(Br 0.8 I 0.2 ) 3 show the emergence of comparable local environments, with preferential formation of MAPbBr 3 -like domains.},

  abstract     = {Upgrading methane to value-added chemicals is significant but still challenging. Well-designed catalysts are required to activate methane. Extensive efforts have been dedicated to the catalytic conversion of methane over transition-metal-containing catalysts. A simple aluminosilicate FER-type zeolite has been found to activate methane and nitrous oxide to methanol stably. To further diversify the catalytic properties, zeolites with different topologies were screened in the methane oxidation reaction. Here, we show that small-pore zeolites have unique advantages in the direct upgrading of methane to light olefins. Among them, the CHA-type zeolite (SSZ-13) exhibited an outstanding performance, with a total selectivity of 90.5% to light olefins and a CH 4 conversion of 5.3% at 350 °C, accompanied by excellent regeneration. Penta-coordinated Al species as one of the active centers was figured out for methane activation and further identified as a non-framework tetra-coordinated Al species by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The acidity of the zeolite was confirmed to influence the tandem conversion of methanol to light olefins. Our study revealed a novel possibility that transition-metal-free aluminosilicate small-pore zeolites can serve as bifunctional catalysts directly and continuously upgrade methane to light olefins via methanol as the intermediate. This approach avoided energy consumption and cumbersome operations and achieved high-efficiency and low-energy production of light olefins.},

Here, we propose an oxophilic-site-mediated dynamic oxygen replenishment mechanism (DORM), in which O L actively participates in O–O bond formation and is continuously refilled by water-derived species. Oxophilic dopants modulate the local electronic structure, lower the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy healing, and reorganize the interfacial hydrogen-bond network to enhance water mobility, orientation, and proton accessibility, collectively promoting water dissociation and stabilizing O L catalysis. The optimized catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 289 mV and exceptional durability, operating continuously for 650 h at 10 mA cm –2 in acidic electrolyte and maintaining stable performance for 280 h at 1 A cm –2 in a PEMWE.

Their ubiquity and potential impact on human health motivate large-scale remediation. Conventional materials used to remove PFASs during drinking water production are functionally inefficient or energetically expensive, motivating the discovery of new materials and technologies. Here, we introduce cyclodextrin-based monoliths, featuring a highly permeable, mechanically robust porous architecture that enables rapid and continuous PFAS removal from water. The monolith was directly polymerized into flow-through columns and showed water permeability similar to packed sand due to its interconnected macroporous structure. Compared to leading benchmarks under equivalent sorbent mass or contact time, the monolith demonstrated superior PFAS sorption with later breakthroughs for most PFASs. We show the hierarchical morphology of a monolith is more efficient use of sorbent mass than particle-based sorbents, as its macropores enable facile diffusion of PFAS to meso- and microporous sorption sites. The significance of hierarchical pore design was demonstrated by instant PFAS breakthrough passing through the pulverized monolith, where the water primarily flows through interparticle pathways with limited access to sorption sites. After treating 150 L of water spiked with 25 PFAS for 37 days, 47 mg of monolith was regenerated through alcohol wash, with near-complete mass balance of adsorbed PFASs. The regenerated monolithic sorbent treated another 170 L of water for 39 days with comparable removal. The monolith offers a novel morphology with simple and direct synthesis in columns for water treatment and provides superior PFAS removal, regeneration and reuse.},

The results demonstrate that the coexistence of salts, particularly NaBr, significantly enhances PFOA degradation by promoting electron transfer reactions. Alkaline conditions (pH 9.8) and the presence of oxygen further facilitate its degradation, whereas acidic conditions hinder this process. Mechanistic analysis further confirmed that hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and hydrated electrons (e aq – ) play critical roles in the observed degradation. This work provides new insights into the transformation of PFAS under diverse conditions and offers a basis for developing strategies to degrade PFOA into environmentally benign species.},

  abstract     = {The thermodynamic equilibrium assumption often invoked in modeling ion migration in solid-state materials remains insufficient to capture the true migration behavior of Li ions, particularly in less-crystalline superionic conductors that exhibit anomalously high Li ion conductivity. Such materials challenge classical frameworks and necessitate a lattice dynamics-based perspective that explicitly accounts for nonequilibrium phonon interactions and transient structural responses. Here, we uncover a phonon-governed Li ion migration mechanism in garnet-structured superionic conductors by comparing Ta-doped Li 6.6 La 3 Zr 1.6 Ta 0.4 O 12 (LLZTO4) to its undoped analogue, Li 6.24 La 3 Zr 2 Al 0.24 O 11.98 (LLZO). Through a synergistic combination of terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS), 7 Li magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), and Raman spectroscopy, we show that Ta doping softens the host lattice and enhances anharmonic phonons, enabling collective, thereby multi-ion migration beyond the limit of single-ion hopping models. This lattice softening induces a dynamically disordered energy landscape that lowers activation barriers and yields Li ion conductivities approaching those of liquid electrolytes. Our findings demonstrate that anharmonic lattice vibrations can serve as the driving force for ultrafast Li ion migration in solid electrolytes. This paradigm shift establishes a fundamental link between lattice thermodynamics and superionic conduction, providing a conceptual and experimental framework for the design of highly conductive solid-state electrolytes.},

Recent advancements in chemical vapor deposition have enabled the batch production of these hybrid fibers, paving the way for practical implementation. However, their functionality remains constrained by the integration of a single 2D material, restricting their versatile performance. Here, we introduce a boron nitride/graphene (BN/Gr) heterostructure in the antiresonant hollow-core fiber (ARF) to modulate its optical resonance and thus enhance graphene nonlinearity by controlling the BN thickness. Hydroxyl-rich methanol is employed to improve the flatness and crystallinity of graphene, promoting the vertical epitaxy of BN with a controllable thickness ranging from 5 to 50 nm. The engineered optical resonance notably tunes the light–graphene interaction within the BN/Gr-ARF, increasing the depth of nonlinear optical modulation from 4% to 10% and enhancing all-optical modulation performance by 75%. Our methodology opens possibilities for tunable optical waveguides via the direct growth of functional 2D material-based heterostructures, offering a robust platform for the development of highly integrated photonic devices.},

A key step toward this goal has been made with the GEMS approach to biomolecular dynamics [Unke et al., Sci. Adv. 2024 , 10 , eadn4397]. This work introduces the SO3LR method that integrates the fast and stable SO3krates neural network for semilocal interactions with universal pairwise force fields designed for short-range repulsion, long-range electrostatics, and dispersion interactions. SO3LR is trained on a diverse set of 4 million neutral and charged molecular complexes computed at the PBE0+MBD level of quantum mechanics, ensuring broad coverage of covalent and noncovalent interactions. Our approach is characterized by computational and data efficiency, scalability to 200 thousand atoms on a single GPU, and reasonable to high accuracy across the chemical space of organic (bio)molecules. SO3LR is applied to study units of four major biomolecule types, polypeptide folding, and nanosecond dynamics of larger systems such as a protein, a glycoprotein, and a lipid bilayer, all in explicit solvent. Finally, we discuss future challenges toward truly general molecular simulations by combining MLFFs with traditional atomistic models.},

  abstract     = {Although HCN has been explored extensively as a precursor in the prebiotic synthesis of biological molecules, macroscopic system-level phenomena, originating from reactions of HCN, such as autocatalysis, oscillations, pattern formation, and phase separation have attracted less attention. Autocatalysis and phase separation are particularly interesting in the context of the origin of life because they are sources of self-replication and compartmentalization. In this work, we investigate the reaction between HCN and cysteamine in water, which exhibits both sigmoidal reaction kinetics and the formation of a distinct liquid phase. We studied the origin of the sigmoidal kinetics using NMR spectroscopy and other techniques, investigated the chemical composition of the products using single-crystal X-ray diffraction and mass spectrometry, and probed the absorption of inert additives into the second liquid phase. Our studies show that the sigmoidal kinetics arise from an autocatalytic feedback loop driven by both an increase in pH and the catalytic nature of the newly formed phase itself. Product analysis revealed co-oligomers with a backbone derived from HCN and branches from cysteamine. This composition suggests that co-oligomerization with thiols provides a route to tractable oligomers, mitigating the formation of insoluble HCN polymers. Furthermore, this second liquid phase effectively sequesters hydrophobic molecules like benzene, demonstrating its capacity to act as a primitive compartment. The phenomena that we observed may provide some insight into prebiotic chemical networks and early-stage chemical evolution.},

Moreover, due to the high reactivity of borane complexes and the limited methods for their modification, designing and synthesizing tetracoordinate chiral boron compounds with stable stereocenters presents considerable challenges. Herein, we report the use of prochiral NHC carbene-substituted boranes in rhodium(I)/chiral diene and copper(I)/chiral bisoxazoline-catalyzed systems, achieving the stereodivergent synthesis of organoboron compounds featuring contiguous carbon and boron stereocenters via enantioselective desymmetrization of carbene B–H insertion. Both catalytic systems delivered good yields and high stereoselectivity (up to 99% ee and 93:7 dr), allowing access to the full complement of stereoisomers at will. Structural analysis of the typical product revealed a tetrahedral character of 91.1% for the boron stereocenters, demonstrating their high configurational stability.

  abstract     = {Nitrogenase accumulates reducing equivalents in hydrides and couples H 2 elimination to the reductive binding of N 2 at a di-iron edge of its FeMo cofactor (FeMoco). Here, we describe that oxidation of a pyrazolato-based dinickel(II) dihydride complex K[L(Ni–H) 2 ] ( 1 K ), either electrochemically or chemically using H + or ferrocenium, triggers H 2 elimination and binding of N 2 in a constrained and extremely bent bridging mode in [LNi 2 (μ 1,2 -N 2 )] ( 3 N2 ). Spectroscopic and computational evidence indicate that the electronic structure of 3 N2 is best described as Ni II –(N 2 •– )–Ni II , with a rare 1e – reduced and significantly activated N 2 substrate ( ṽ ̃NN = 1894 cm –1 ). 3 N2 is also formed upon 1e – oxidation of K[LNi 2 I ] ( 2 K ) under N 2 . This is an unusual and counterintuitive scenario where the oxidation of a dinickel(II) dihydride, or of a dinickel(I) complex, induces the reductive activation of N 2 . Detailed (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations confirm that N 2 binding by the {LNi 2 } platform occurs only in the regime of the mixed-valent Ni II Ni I species, while both oxidation and reduction induce the release of N 2 from 3 N2 ; the latter represents a redox-induced electron transfer (RIET) process where metal reduction leads to N 2 •– oxidation due to intramolecular back electron transfer. These findings offer new perspectives for understanding the multi-e –/ H + scenarios of N 2 fixation via hydride intermediates inspired by the FeMoco function, and for the development of synthetic platforms that avoid strongly reducing conditions for N 2 activation.},

Current applications use metal oxides; however, these materials are plagued by slow response times to potential changes. Herein, we investigate a metal–organic framework (MOF) film loaded with a molecular ruthenium redox carrier for its electrochromic capabilities. Upon the application of a potential jump, the native MOF was found to transport charge with an apparent diffusion coefficient, D app of 8(±3) × 10 –9 cm 2 /s. That said, only 55% of the redox centers, primarily those at the MOF surface, were converted. Using a multivariate (MTV) approach to incorporate sulfonate groups into the backbone of the MOF in addition to the redox carrier allowed for charge transport throughout the MOF with a D app of around 1(±1) × 10 –7 cm 2 /s and 100% conversion, the fastest reported diffusion coefficient in the redox hopping MOF literature to our knowledge. The sulfonated MOF exhibited a rapid electrochromic response, with coloration and bleaching times of approximately 1.29 and 1.33 s, respectively, at 400 mV overpotential. The sulfonate group is hypothesized to break ion pairs, allowing for higher ionic conductivity, which facilitates fast and complete charge transfer.},

We discovered that anchored Chol-ssDNA spontaneously flips across the membrane of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs) in a nucleation-driven, defect-mediated process. This flipping enables internal signal processing through hybridization with encapsulated complementary DNA and activation of downstream processes such as RNA transcription. The phenomenon shows a high transduction efficiency, is generic across DNA sequences and lipid compositions, and can be enhanced by glycerol, which modulates membrane dynamics. Mechanistic insights using fluorescence microscopy, nuclease degradation assays, and membrane permeability assays reveal that flipping is dominated by transient membrane pores. Leveraging this facile translocation process, we demonstrate selective transcriptional activation inside synthetic cells, underscoring the potential of Chol-ssDNA flipping as a programmable tool for synthetic biology and bottom-up synthetic cell design.},

Homopolypeptides of the glutamate type form α-helical secondary structures and are considered rigid-rod polymers. They form lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in helicogenic solvents. Over the past decade, this property has been exploited in the NMR-based structure elucidation of organic compounds, making anisotropic NMR observables, such as residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), accessible. However, many alignment media are limited in their compatibility, especially with polar (nonhelicogenic) solvents like DMSO, and thus also in their analyte compatibility. Herein, we present poly-γ-(4-propargyloxybenzyl)- l -glutamate (PPOBLG) as an exceptionally versatile alignment medium compatible with several organic solvents, including DMSO and acetone. The polymer not only allows extraction of RDCs in all these solvents but also provides linearly independent orientations of a model compound by simple variation of the solvent. Moreover, a remarkably high enantiodifferentiation is observed. We furthermore show that these improved properties make it compatible with various natural products containing a wide variety of functional groups.},

  abstract     = {High-temperature oxidation reactions catalyzed by earth–abundant transition metal oxides are vital for numerous industrial and environmental processes. However, their performance is often limited by the rapid desorption of active oxygen species at high temperatures. Here, we describe a straightforward approach to constructing a CuMn spinel/Mn 2 O 3 composite oxide catalyst that addresses this limitation and demonstrate that lattice oxygen can spontaneously migrate to form interface-stabilized superoxo species under high-temperature reaction conditions. This catalyst exhibits a 14-fold enhancement in the CH 4 oxidation reaction compared to Mn 2 O 3 , with activity and stability even better than those of many reported noble-metal supported catalysts. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the superoxo species accept electrons from the neighboring Cu and Mn atoms, exhibiting enhanced ability for C–H activation. This work illustrates the critical role of interface-stabilized superoxo species in CH 4 oxidation and establishes a promising route for promoting high-temperature catalytic processes through interface engineering.},

  abstract     = {Achieving precise regioselectivity in the hydroamination of alkenes is in high demand yet remains a longstanding challenge, particularly when electronically competing β-substituents are present. Here, we report a dual boron/iron catalytic system that enables the unprecedented hydroamidation of α,β-unsaturated esters to exclusively access α-amidated esters under mild conditions. The strategy harnesses the Lewis acidity of B(C 6 F 5 ) 3 to rapidly generate reactive silyl ketene acetal intermediates, which are subsequently intercepted by in situ generated iron nitrenoids. Central to this cooperative activation mode is the dual role of the chloride anion in modulating both boron and iron catalytic reactivity. This protocol is operationally simple, requiring no tailored ligands, light, or electrochemical setup, and proceeds efficiently with only 1 mol % of boron and iron catalysts. The system exhibits a broad scope of unsaturated esters, tolerating β-aryl, -alkyl, -silyl, -perfluoroalkyl, and -boryl groups. This work lays the foundation for universal α-selective hydrofunctionalization strategies across electronically complex substrates.},

Its effective applicability to supramolecular polymers is illustrated by three representative cases that reveal accelerated exploration of diverse multicomponent systems with a universal Bayesian optimization framework. The number of experiments required to arrive at optimal compositions is significantly reduced compared to random or uninformed sampling strategies, enabling the experimental study of high-dimensional design spaces. In this way, we can tune the formulation of intricate mixtures and achieve tailored macroscopic properties with minimal experimental effort.

Traditionally, HEMs have been primarily concerned with metal alloys. However, expanding the principle to organic systems, specifically high-entropy molecular nanostructures, remains underexplored. In this study, we investigated the construction of high-entropy molecular networks on a metal surface using an on-surface chemistry approach. By employing distinct pyridyl-functionalized ligands with differently shaped aromatic backbones, we constructed 2D molecular networks stabilized through coordination with metal atoms. A high-throughput preparation approach leveraging a mask inspired by a Venn diagram was utilized to create multicomponent sample libraries. Scanning tunneling microscopy provided real-space characterization, revealing both ordered and disordered assemblies and highlighting the critical role of the molecular shape and the number of functional centers in promoting or limiting mixed entropy of these networks. Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations were further employed to model the formation mechanisms and examine factors influencing their mixed entropies. Our study provides insights into how molecular species influence disorder and stability in high-entropy molecular networks, paving the way for advancing low-dimensional high-entropy molecular systems.},

In this study, we have developed a general method for the ATH of heteroatom-containing imines and diarylimines, catalyzed by a chiral aminobenzimidazole manganese(I) complex, yielding the corresponding amines in up to 99% yield and 99% ee.

Currently, the absence of a molecular analysis method that can both quantify molecules and achieve single-molecule spatial resolution hinders our study of complex molecular systems in sorption and catalysis. Here, we propose a quantitative analysis strategy for small molecules confined in ZSM-5, a zeolite material extensively used in catalysis and gas separation, based on low-dose transmission electron microscopy. This approach enables the visualization of molecular structures with angstrom spatial resolution and facilitates their identification through detailed molecular imaging. By integrating experimental and simulated images with adsorption data, the quantity of small molecules within each zeolite channel is precisely calibrated, thereby advancing the study of the molecular sorption, transport, and reaction dynamics in ZSM-5 channels. The quantitative insights into these processes enhance our understanding of microscale mechanisms, elucidating the roles of host–guest interactions, molecular geometry, and external stimulus. This work expands the application of low-dose electron microscopy in molecular imaging and analysis, establishing it as a spatially resolved and quantitative tool for studying molecular behaviors in real space that is previously inaccessible.},

A wide range of magnetic behaviors have been observed in nonmagnetic transition-metal dichalcogenides intercalated with magnetic atoms. Beyond the incorporation of magnetic ions, we propose the controlled alkali-ion intercalation of intrinsic vdW magnets as a strategy to probe and manipulate spin populations and exchange interactions within individual magnetic layers. Unlike conventional solid-state methods typically used for atomic intercalation, this approach depends on postsynthetic, solution-based reactions, which remain relatively underdeveloped and present unique synthetic challenges. Hence, in this work, we demonstrate precise potassium intercalation of VOCl, a layered antiferromagnet with square-like motifs, using stoichiometric organic reductants, potassium naphthalene and potassium pyrene. Our synthetic approach addresses thermodynamic and kinetic challenges via redox-matching reductants and electrolyte-assisted homogenization. Magnetic measurements reveal a continuous evolution from antiferromagnetism (x = 0) to a spin-glass state (0 < x < 1) with magnetic memory and ultimately to ferrimagnetism (x = 1) in K x VOCl (0 ≤ x ≤ 1). Ab initio calculations support the existence of a spin-glass state, stabilized by mixed valence and competing magnetic interactions. Taken all together, this work establishes a programmable intercalation methodology to access metastable phases and tailor magnetic properties, offering new insights into magnetism in layered compounds with complex spin interactions.},

However, their vast compositional space, in terms of both elemental variety and atomic ratios, presents a major challenge to the rational design of high-performance catalysts, as experimental efforts are often hindered by ambiguous element selection and inefficient trial-and-error methods. In this work, a bottom-up research strategy using machine learning-assisted first-principles calculations was applied to accelerate the design of quinary HEAs toward efficient multielectron transfer reactions. Here, we report the design of PtPdRhRuMo, which exhibits key physicochemical properties favoring the methanol oxidation reaction. Notably, the incorporation of Mo as the fifth element significantly activates specific binding sites on HEA surfaces, enhancing methanol adsorption and, in particular, the water dissociation ability. This facilitates hydroxyl species formation, which effectively mitigates CO intermediate adherence while promoting the complete oxidation of CH 3 OH to CO 2 via alternative reaction pathways. Guided by theoretical predictions, experimental samples with different morphologies of mesoporous PtPdRhRuMo catalyst (m-HEANP(Mo) nanoparticles and m-HEAF(Mo) thin film) were then synthesized, demonstrating superior electrocatalysis with a large current density of up to 18.20 mA cm –2 and a mass activity of 9.89 A mg Pt –1 , alongside the long-term durability for efficient methanol electrooxidation applications.},

Chiral assemblies spontaneously occur through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of lyotropic mesophases from isotropic solutions upon a concentration increase.

  abstract     = {Emerging evidence underscores the regulatory roles of nonamyloidogenic regions in controlling the aggregation dynamics and cytotoxicity of amyloidal proteins, but the mechanism remains unclear. Herein we investigated how flanking sequences modulate the conformational heterogeneity in the p53 238–262 amyloid segment using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By comparing the wild-type (wt) and three pathogenic mutations (R248W, R248Q, R249S) in the noncore regions, we reveal that flanking alterations remodel β-sheet aggregates and induce conformational plasticity in β-strand ensembles through the generation of novel conformational substates and selective elimination of existing conformational substates. This conformational diversity establishes a highly heterogeneous intermolecular interaction network that connects different conformational substates. Quantitative mapping shows that flanking mutations drastically diversify the coexisting inter-β-strand interactions while altering the most abundant intermolecular interaction patterns. Our analysis reveals that flanking mutations induce a deterministic conformational remodeling process in the β-sheet aggregates, where specific intermolecular interactions counteract entropy through nonstochastic structural rearrangements. These findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the noncore sequence control in protein aggregation and suggest potential therapeutic targets for modulating β-sheet assembly in amyloidopathies.},

  abstract     = {Catalytic upgrading of CO 2 to value-added C 2+ products offers promising solutions to trim carbon emissions with additional economic benefits. Herein, we report a NiFe bimetallic catalyst showing efficient ambient-pressure C–C coupling performance subject to H 2 pretreatment temperature. An optimal performance was achieved after reducing NiFe/TiO 2 at 350 °C (NiFe-350/TiO 2 ), yielding 27.8% CO 2 conversion and 33.9% selectivity to C 2 –C 3 hydrocarbon (primarily ethane) at 350 °C under atmospheric pressure. Combinatorial studies employing in situ characterizations, kinetic, intermediate control experiments and first-principles calculations indicate the formation of partially oxidized Ni δ+ –O–Fe δ+ in NiFe-350/TiO 2 , the dual-site synergy of which enhances CO 2 activation and facilitates H 2 heterolytic activation into H δ− species that selectively hydrogenate *CO 2 into HCOO* and *CH 3 O intermediates, thus suppressing CO byproduct formation and resulting in effective ambient-pressure C–C coupling likely via an asymmetric *CH 2 –CH 3 coupling mechanism. In stark contrast, the fully reduced NiFe bimetallic catalyst favors a direct CO 2 dissociation pathway instead to form *CO that easily desorbs from the surface, as well as homolytic H 2 activation such that the C–C coupling process is unfavored. In brief, this work reports the ambient-pressure synthesis of C 2 –C 3 paraffins from direct CO 2 hydrogenation and provides design rationales for efficient carbon chain propagation.},

  abstract     = {Coarsening and degradation phenomena in metals have largely focused on thermally driven processes, such as bulk and surface diffusion. However, dramatic coarsening has been reported in high-surface-area, nanometer-sized Pt-based catalysts during potential cycling in an electrolyte at room temperature─a temperature too low for the process to be explained purely by surface mobility values measured in both vacuum and electrolytes (∼10 –22 and ∼10 –18 cm 2 /s, respectively). This morphological evolution must be due to a different mechanism for mass transport that is sensitive to electrochemical conditions (e.g., electrolyte composition, potential limits, and scan rate). However, there have been no notable studies of electrochemically induced coarsening in nanometer-sized electrocatalysts. Here, we unveil the origins of coarsening in an electrolyte through coupled in situ experiments and atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. Our work demonstrates electrochemical coarsening is driven by two concurrent mechanisms that can be explained at the atomistic level: (i) dissolution/redeposition during the reduction of an oxidized species and (ii) rapid surface diffusion of undercoordinated atoms.},

While the integration of multiple components into COFs has substantially expanded their structural complexity, the strategic engineering of diverse functionalities within a single framework via the random distribution of linkers with varying lengths remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a series of highly crystalline mixed-length multivariate COFs synthesized using azobenzene and bipyridine as linkers, where tuning the ratio of linkers and incorporating palladium effectively modulates the balance between near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and catalytic sites for NIR-generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). Capitalizing on the deep tissue penetration of NIR light and the generated H 2 O 2 as reactive oxygen species, as a proof of concept, the optimal mixed-length multivariate COF reduces breast cancer cell viability by almost 90% after 1 h of irradiation in a combined in vitro photodynamic therapy and drug delivery.},

In this work, we found that cyclohexene spontaneously oxidized at the gas–liquid interface of the microdroplets under mild conditions. Notably, tetrabutylammonium bromide as an electrolyte added to the reaction system can promote the directional epoxidation of cyclohexene. The control variable experiment proved that oxygen was the main oxygen source of the epoxidation reaction, and the product of cyclohexene oxide was detected by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance hydrogen spectrum. Additionally, density functional theory calculation results show that the energy barrier of the cyclohexene oxidation reaction at the interface in the presence of an electric field is reduced by 89.37 kJ/mol. The observed 89 kJ/mol reduction in activation energy represents the maximum achievable effect under optimal field-reaction axis alignment. The possible reasons for the increase in interfacial selectivity were analyzed from the electrochemistry. So far, there are a few reports on the effect of microdroplet interface on reaction selectivity; the impact of interfacial electric field may have broader applications in the electrochemistry field.},

Electronic localization function, crystal orbital Hamilton population, electron density topological analysis, and Bader charge analysis demonstrate that helium’s typically inert 1s electrons participate in chemical bonding in He 3 F 2 , thus forming unexpected polar covalent He–F bonds within the HeF 2 chains. Furthermore, molecular orbital calculations reveal that this type of bond stems from the strong interaction between the He-1s orbital and the F-2p orbital under high pressure, challenging conventional notions of helium’s chemical inertness.},

  abstract     = {Recently, the atmospheric aerosol surface, which is reported to be quite acidic, is recognized as an important microreactive medium for atmospheric chemistry, profoundly impacting air quality and global climate. Nevertheless, the molecular-level understanding of the effect of surface-bound acids on atmospheric chemical reactions remains limited. Herein, the reactions between CO 2 and NH 3 /amines at the air–water interface with organic acids are investigated using combined molecular dynamic simulations and quantum chemical calculations. The results show that the reactions of CO 2 -NH 3 /amines predominantly occur at the interface of water droplets since CO 2 /NH 3 /amines show a surface tendency. At the surface with formic acid (HCOOH), the barrier of C–N compound formation from the CO 2 -NH 3 reaction catalyzed by HCOOH is calculated to be 6.8 kcal/mol, which can be easily overcome at ambient temperature and is significantly decreased in comparison to both gas phase and surface without organic acid. Furthermore, the HCOOH-mediated mechanism can also promote CO 2 reactions with alkylamines (methylamine (MA) and dimethylamine (DMA)), as the nucleophilicity of the N-site in these amines is significantly stronger than that in NH 3 . Overall, the results highlight the significance of organic acid on the aerosol surface in efficient capture of gaseous CO 2 and uncover the catalytic role of interfacial organic acid for assessing the potential contribution of gas-particle partitioning of pollutants to aerosol formation.},

The selected pair of compounds with similar 4 × 3 Wadsley-Roth block structures are insulating Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 and metallic Nb 12 O 29 . A combination of diffraction, electrochemistry, magnetic measurements, and entropic potential measurements is employed to establish key findings for these two anode materials. We find that starting with a metallic oxide is not especially advantageous over a comparable material that readily transitions into a metallic state upon lithiation. Second, the rate performance appears to be dictated by ion mobility, and atomic Ti/Nb disorder in Ti 2 Nb 10 O 29 contributes to improved capacity retention at high rates by suppressing Li-ion ordering. However, subtle details in the nature of redox processes make Nb 12 O 29 a slightly better electrode material for long-term cycling at slower rates.},

  abstract     = {The present research introduces a novel strategy for tuning magnetic properties by overcoming the compositional limitation of stoichiometric intermetallic compounds via extension of their compositional domain into the valence electron-per-atom ( e/a ) parameter space. Focusing on approximant crystals (ACs), a “double heterovalent elemental substitution” is employed in a stoichiometric Ga–Pt–Gd 2/1 AC whereby e/a is lowered from approximately 1.98 to 1.60. Through this approach, a new family of Ga-based Tsai-type 1/1 ACs with an exceptionally wide compositional domain within e/a space is derived. Remarkably, the magnetic ground state is altered from initially spin-glass to ferromagnetic (FM) with second-order phase transition and mean-field-like critical behavior. More importantly, through this strategy, the isothermal magnetic entropy change ( ΔS M ) enhanced significantly and reached a maximum value of −8.7 J/K mol-Gd under a 5 T magnetic field change, even comparable to leading rare-earth magnetocaloric materials including RCo 2 phases. These findings demonstrate the high potential of a double heterovalent elemental substitution for tailoring magnetic properties and magnetocaloric response in stoichiometric compounds, offering a new pathway for designing high-performance magnetic refrigeration materials even beyond the quasicrystals and ACs.},

  abstract     = {Life requires chemical chiral specificity. The emergence of enantioselectivity is unknown but has been linked to diverse scenarios for the origin of life, ranging from an extraterrestrial origin to polarization-induced effects, and magnetic field-induced mineral templating. These scenarios require an originating mechanism and a subsequent enhancement step, leading to widespread chiral specificity. The common denominator in all scenarios is water, which provides an environment for the enantioselective process. Because water is a nonchiral molecule, it has not been considered as an active ingredient in either of these processes. Here, we show that water can form extended chiral ordered structures that are induced by interactions with simple chiral prebiotic molecules, such as lipids and sugars. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, chiral-sensitive and interface-specific vibrational sum frequency scattering, second harmonic scattering, and atomic force microscopy, the interfacial structure of water on nanoscale lipid membranes was investigated. Out-of-plane H-bonding interactions between achiral liposomes and simple chiral cyclic sugars lead to ordered, spectroscopically ice-like, chiral water suprastructures that extend along the self-assembled lipid-sugar complex over distances >10 μm. Such highly ordered self-assemblies could potentially have provided microenvironments that enable the enhancement of chirality.},

  abstract     = {The functional properties of nanocrystals can be finely tuned through controlled morphology and size. However, this can be challenging for metastable nanostructures that require harsh synthesis conditions, such as high temperatures. Here, we present a method for preparing large ε-Fe 2 O 3 nanorods that are not affected by magnetic relaxation. This study presents a novel growth mechanism in which high-aspect-ratio rods evolve from spherical ε-Fe 2 O 3 particles in a silica matrix containing Y 3+ . With the presence of Y 3+ , the glassy matrix undergoes a metastable binodal decomposition yielding the formation of nanodroplets of a Y-rich silicate of composition ∼Y 2 Si 2 O 7 . This Y silicate selectively coats the ε-Fe 2 O 3 planes perpendicular to the rod axis along the [100] direction but is not observed in the rod apexes. Structural optimizations and energy calculations of different crystal faces of ε-Fe 2 O 3 in contact with Y 2 Si 2 O 7 obtained using machine-learning force fields provide an atomistic interpretation of these observations: the affinity of Y with the oxygen atoms exposed at ε-Fe 2 O 3 surfaces explains the preferential capping of ε-Fe 2 O 3 surfaces that present a large density of oxygen atoms and its absence in surfaces such as (100), where this density is significantly lower. The presence or absence of the silicate capping layer results in different surface energies and/or mass transfer coefficients across the interface, originating two independent Ostwald ripening processes, which drive the high aspect ratio growth. By using La 3+ instead of Y 3+ , ε-Fe 2 O 3 rods with even larger aspect ratios are obtained. Notably, this synthetic approach counteracts the progressive diminution of the average nanoparticle size observed in ε-(Fe 1– x Cr x ) 2 O 3 upon Cr 3+ addition, enabling to elucidate the effect of this substitution on the intrinsic magnetic anisotropy and the anisotropy fields that determine the high-frequency ferromagnetic resonances of this phase.},

However, achieving high activity in H 2 production with good selectivity toward CO 2 under mild conditions poses a challenge. A thoughtful understanding of the active sites that accelerate the cleavage of the C–C bond rather than the C–O bond and the activation of the water molecule is still lacking. In this study, we developed a PtNa/γ-Mo 2 N catalyst that efficiently enables hydrogen production from ethylene glycol steam reforming (EGSR) reactions. This catalyst achieved outstanding H 2 productivity, reaching 6000 mol H2 ·mol Pt –1 ·h –1 at 250 °C under 10 bar with high CO 2 selectivity (89%) and low CO selectivity (1%) in carbon-containing products. Comprehensive characterizations revealed the crucial role of the interface between highly dispersed Pt species and Mo 2 N in activating ethylene glycol and water. Additionally, sodium (Na) was found to block acidic sites, preventing the formation of side products from C–O bond cleavage, and to modulate Pt sites, enhancing the reforming process by accelerating the water gas shift reaction.},

Yet, levels of NAPE increase during myocardial infarction and ischemia, suggesting potential signaling roles for this lipid. Here, we exploit photoaffinity labeling (PAL) to identify NAPE-interacting proteins and elucidate signaling functions of NAPE. By positioning diazirine and alkyne groups in metabolically distinct regions of the NAPE molecule, we ensured that our PAL probe reported on interactions of NAPE and not NAE. Our studies identified several NAPE interactors, including two single-pass transmembrane proteins, CD147/Basigin and CD44, both of which serve as chaperones for monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) from the SLC16A family that mediate lactate flux across the plasma membrane. Functional studies revealed that NAPE stimulates lactate efflux by MCTs dependent upon CD147 and CD44, establishing NAPE as a bona fide signaling lipid and pointing to potential physiological roles in metabolic and energy homeostasis that may be pathologically relevant in ischemia.},

In this study, we report a divided electrochemical synthesis-based cross-coupling platform in which H 2 O is oxidized at the anode surface to generate electrons that produce a lower oxidation state nickel catalyst on the cathode surface, enabling XEC reactions without the need for metallic or organic reagents.

The EDL at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface exhibits significantly different properties with a more complex structure compared to liquid electrolyte systems. Characterizing this intricate interface experimentally remains a major challenge. In this study, we directly observed the potential distribution at the electrode–polyelectrolyte interface using a delicate in situ electrochemical cell coupled with ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) at various probing depths. The electrode/polyelectrolyte (graphite/Nafion) interface was successfully constructed, and the APXPS measurements were performed under nonpolarizing conditions. The binding energy shift of the F 1s photoelectron with applied bias provided the information on potential distribution. Experimental results, simulated by the typical exponential and linear potential distribution models, indicate the formation of a 1–3 nm EDL at the electrode/polyelectrolyte interface. This work provides methodological guidance for in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies and offers valuable fundamental data for electrochemical research.},

  abstract     = {The computational discovery and design of new crystalline materials, particularly metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), heavily rely on high-quality, “computation-ready” structural data. However, recent studies have revealed significant error rates within existing MOF databases, posing a critical data problem that hinders efficient high-throughput computational screening. While rule-based algorithms like MOSAEC, MOFChecker, and the Chen and Manz method (Chen–Manz) have been developed to address this, they often suffer from inherent limitations and misclassification of structures. To overcome this challenge, we developed MOFClassifier, a novel machine learning approach built upon a positive-unlabeled crystal graph convolutional neural network (PU-CGCNN) model. MOFClassifier learns intricate patterns from perfect crystal structures to predict a “crystal-likeness score” (CLscore), effectively classifying MOFs as computation-ready. Our model achieves an ROC value of 0.979 (previous best value 0.912) and, importantly, can identify subtle structural and chemical errors that are undetectable by current rule-based methods. By accurately recovering previously misclassified false-negative structures, the MOFClassifier reduces the risk of overlooking promising material candidates in large-scale computational screening campaigns. This user-friendly tool is freely available and has been integrated into the preparation workflow for the updated CoRE MOF DB 2025 v1.0, contributing to the accelerated computational discovery of MOF materials.},

Notably, the electron-donating ability of ligands significantly enhances the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes within these frameworks, thereby promoting efficient charge migration. Herein, we developed two electron-rich macrocyclic ligands derived from phenothiazine- and phenoxazine-functionalized calix[3]arenes, alongside their corresponding cobalt-coordinated MOFs. Remarkably, the MOF designated as Co-C[3]PTZ-MOF─constructed using the more electron-donating calix[3]phenothiazine ligand (C[3]PTZ-COOH)─exhibited superior photoresponse and enhanced charge-transport characteristics. This optimized material achieved an exceptional CO 2 photoreduction initial efficiency of 17,800 μmol g –1 h –1 with 81% CO selectivity. The outstanding photocatalytic performance originates from the strong electron-donating nature of the calix[3]arene-based ligands, which facilitated efficient LMCT processes.

  abstract     = {Recently, several groups have reported remarkable observations concerning the acceleration or promotion of nonequilibrium reactions in aqueous microdroplets. Such observations often implicate the reactivity of the microdroplet interface or the energy used for the formation (i.e., by nebulization, sonication, or electrospray) of these systems with high surface-area-to-volume ratios.. While the input of energy is important for reactions, such as hydrogen peroxide formation, the spatial distribution of that energy, particularly at interfaces, may strongly influence reaction pathways and yields. Moreover, nebulized microdroplets are inherently dynamic and are, therefore, challenging to study systematically. Thus, investigating less dynamic and energetic means of increasing SA:V ratios could provide the community with a platform to explore the intricate mechanisms at play in these systems. Here, we investigated two-dimensional soap thin films, formed by using a commercial soap bubble wand, as a low-cost, low-energy model system to enhance the SA:V ratio. In this study, we evaluate the thin film’s ability to promote hydrogen peroxide formation. We demonstrate that the formation of soap films promotes the generation of H 2 O 2 . Quantitative ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy assays show the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in a soap film on a commercial bubble wand reaches 1.67 ± 0.16 mM. We confirmed hydrogen peroxide formation by commercial test-strips and 1 H NMR. This soap film experiment arguably represents the least-energy-intensive method to enhance SA:V ratio and produce hydrogen peroxide at complex phase boundaries to-date. Our findings establish soap film reactivity as an open avenue of inquiry for phase boundary curious chemistry.},

Here, we address this gap by integrating low-valent aluminum into the cadmium coordination sphere. Aluminylene insertion into Cd{N(TMS) 2 } 2 affords bi- and trimetallic cadmium aluminyls 1 and 2 , featuring covalent yet tunable Al–Cd bonding. While 1 is irreversibly formed, 2 exhibits dynamic reactivity, enabling reversible [AlCp*] 0 transfer─a rare and previously undocumented feature in heterobimetallic aluminum chemistry. Acting as a thermodynamically stable yet chemically reactive surrogate for free Al(I), 2 enables selective Al(I) shuttling to B, Cd, Zn, and Ag substrates (compounds 1 Zn , 3 – 5 ). The cooperative Al–Cd framework in 1 and 2 further promotes bond activation of heterocumulenes such as carbodiimides and CO 2 , with 1 serving as a source of nucleophilic cadmium─an unprecedented reactivity mode for this element (compounds 6 – 8 ). Detailed quantum chemical calculations elucidate the electronic structures of 1 and 2 as well as the mechanism for both Al(I) transfer and heterocumulene insertion. These findings establish a platform for bimetallic cooperativity in small-molecule activation and lay the groundwork for Al(I)-based multimetallic systems relevant to future catalysis and main group/transition-metal synergy.},

  abstract     = {We report the deletion of nitrogen atoms from multiple template sites in rotaxanes, catenanes, and a molecular knot. Nitrogen extrusion from secondary amines in the backbone of the interlocked structures is achieved using O -diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine (DPPH), forming carbon–carbon bonds while largely maintaining the integrity of the original mechanical bonding. We find that DPPH gives improved yields (up to 51%) for nitrogen atom deletions from template sites in rotaxanes compared to an anomeric amide nitrogen-deletion reagent and overcomes a major substrate limitation in that, using DPPH, only one of the substituents of the secondary amine in the rotaxane axle needs to be radical-stabilizing. Multiple template site nitrogen atom deletions were accomplished from a range of mechanically interlocked architectures, despite the potential for dethreading, unlinking, and/or strand uncrossing during each successive deletion event. Highlights include the deletion of two template sites from a doubly threaded [3]rotaxane (37% yield) and [3]catenane (45%), quadruple N -deletion of amines from both rings of a [2]catenane (33%), and six N -deletions from the six amine groups in a molecular trefoil knot (7%). The combination of skeletal editing with template synthesis provides a general strategy for synthesis that significantly increases the structural diversity of interlocked molecules that are potentially accessible.},

  abstract     = {The stereodivergent synthesis of structurally complex molecules bearing multiple stereochemical elements represents a pivotal challenge in modern synthetic chemistry, particularly for bioactive compounds, where stereochemical nuances dictate pharmacological profiles. While stereodivergent dual catalysis has advanced full access to stereoisomers with stereogenic centers, the integration of stereodefined alkenes into chiral molecules with both stereochemical and skeletal diversification remains elusive. In this study, we report stereo- and skeleton-divergent access to chiral fluorinated N -heterocycles with comprehensive stereocontrol of [( R , R ), ( S , S ), ( S , R ), ( R , S )] and [( Z , R ), ( Z , S ), ( E , R ), ( E , S )] enabled by a bimetallic Cu/Ru relay catalytic system, featuring redox-neutral efficiency and atom/step economy. The success is achieved through orthogonally merging an asymmetric borrowing-hydrogen reaction with the asymmetric Michael addition between allenic alcohols and α-fluoro azaaryl acetamides/acetates by simply tuning the chiral ligands in the copper and ruthenium catalysts associated with temporal and basicity regulation. Control experiments and kinetic studies provide insights into the underlying mechanisms, revealing that the kinetic resolution of racemic allenic alcohol is involved in this relay-catalyzed cascade dehydrogenation/Michael addition/hydrogenation sequence and Michael addition is the rate-limiting step.},

  abstract     = {Downsizing noble metal catalysts is essential for improving atomic efficiency in sustainable energy applications. Typically, strategies focus on anchoring atomically scaled catalysts onto heteroatom-rich substrates, but these interactions can unintentionally alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, complicating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanism. This study focuses on elucidating the interfacial mechanism of HER using structurally well-defined platinum single-atom (Pt SA) electrocatalysts. Unlike chemically reduced SAs, electrochemically deposited Pt SA catalysts do not rely on strong support interactions. As a result, these isolated Pt atoms can potentially achieve the theoretical maximum hydrogen production efficiency. This work introduces electrocatalysts composed solely of true SA sites, clarifying previous ambiguities surrounding the concept of SA electrocatalysis.},

Here, we employ an all-optical noncontact approach based on phase- and amplitude-resolved second harmonic generation spectroscopy to estimate the cation and anion coverages and the number density of net-aligned water molecules at fused silica surfaces in contact with aqueous solutions held at pH 5.8 and a wide range of ionic strengths of NaCl, NaClO 4 , Na 2 SO 4 , and Na 2 HPO 4 up to 8 M. At 8 M ionic strength of NaClO 4 , the data are consistent with an interface that is comprised of half of a monolayer of ions (θ Na + + θ ClO 4 - ≈ 5 × 10 14 cm 2 ) and half of a monolayer of water molecules (θ H 2 O ≈ 4 × 10 14 cm –2 ), the latter having flipped their dipolar orientation from “protons to the surface” to “oxygens to the surface”. The interfacial water:total ion ratio is close to ten times smaller than in the bulk solution at these high ionic strengths. The Helmholtz free energy associated with water disordering increases abruptly from near 0 kJ mol –1 below 2 M ionic strength to 10 kJ mol –1 at 8 M ionic strength, indicating perhaps a Kirkwood-like transition from a hydrated to a dehydrated interface.},

  abstract     = {The development of adsorbents for ammonia capture and separation is a challenging task, with significant industrial relevance. We report herein, for the first time, open aluminophosphate frameworks for on-demand ammonia adsorption. Under ambient conditions, the AlPO-18 molecular sieve exhibits exceptional dynamic ammonia uptake of 3.36 mmol/g at an extremely low ammonia concentration of 200 ppm, showing great potential as a disposable adsorbent for trace ammonia capture. AlPO-11 molecular sieve manifests a desirable ammonia dynamic uptake of 5.73 mmol/g at high ammonia concentration of 50,000 ppm, with excellent recyclability upon regeneration under mild conditions. Aspen simulations demonstrate the advantage of the adsorptive separation process employing AlPO-11 adsorbent for ammonia recovery, with huge energy savings of 51% in comparison with the compression-based process currently employed in the ammonia synthesis industry. The underlying mechanism of ammonia adsorption and the nature of ammonia binding in aluminophosphate frameworks are fully elucidated by employing a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, quasi in situ magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, and density functional theory calculations. The coordination of ammonia on the framework aluminum sites in aluminophosphates is clearly disclosed. The development of low-cost and commercially available aluminophosphate molecular sieves may unlock their potential for on-demand ammonia capture and separation in various scenarios.},

Both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites inside molecular-sized soluble cages seem to be involved during the catalytic process in solution; thus, a similar bifunctional acid solid catalyst, in a confined space, could play the desired catalytic role. We show here that commercially available, ultrastabilized aluminosilicate acid faujasites (H-USY zeolites), containing Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in microporous channels and cavities, catalyze a variety of intra- and intermolecular metathesis reactions between aldehydes/ketones and alkenes/alkynes, with diverse structural patterns, in reasonable yields and under mild reaction conditions. The zeolite can be easily recovered after the reaction in batch and reused or implemented in in-flow processes for continuous synthesis of the metathesis products.

Contrary to the assumption that the role of mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthesis is limited to the production of the lipoic acid precursor octanoate, recent studies suggest an ability to produce longer chain fatty acids. Here, we employ covalent, dual site-selective cross-linkers to trap the interactions between OXSM and its mitochondrial acyl carrier protein partner, mACP. Two high-resolution crystal structures that capture OXSM bound to mACP provide molecular details of the conformational changes that guide the chain elongation process. We identify key protein • protein and protein • substrate interactions that regulate the transacylation and condensation steps associated with this process. We also observe a conserved gating mechanism previously identified in bacterial type II ketosynthases. Complemented by site-directed mutagenesis and activity analyses, these findings provide detailed insight into the selectivity of the OXSM substrate. This study explores how the OXSM can elongate fatty acids larger than eight carbons, mirroring that of its bacterial type II progenitor.},

Both the apparent production rate and equilibrium concentration of H 2 O 2 increase with decreasing droplet size, even after normalizing for surface area, revealing an intrinsic curvature-dependent enhancement. This effect arises from the geometry-driven amplification of interfacial electric fields, and this enhancement of electric field strength accelerates redox processes. Modulating interfacial electrostatics further alters reactivity: organic surfactants suppress H 2 O 2 formation to varying degrees, whereas simple salts like NaCl and KCl have minimal impact, even at relatively high concentrations. These results highlight curvature and interfacial charge as key determinants of microdroplet reactivity, governed by mesoscale electrostatic fields that drive chemical transformations at and near the surface of the microdroplet.},

While the generation of artificial data from real data points (known as “data augmentation”) is a widely pursued strategy employed in, for example, image or speech recognition or health data evaluations, among others, to artificially expand existing data sets, it is currently unknown whether this strategy is applicable to reactivity problems at the molecular level, where predictive models are exquisitely sensitive to steric, electronic, and structural nuances. Here, we systematically evaluated the power of data augmentation for a diverse set of reactivity questions ranging from the prediction of activation barriers to stereoselectivities of catalytic transformations. We demonstrate that introducing Gaussian noise to existing data points, which is completed in under a second for a full data set, can dramatically enhance the predictive performance. It can enable model training in low-data regimes where otherwise no meaningful model could be built and achieves accuracy comparable to models built on full data sets, while needing only a fraction of the data. The approach substantially lowers the number of necessary experiments (by 20–50%), conserving time, energy, and resources, while advancing the integration of machine learning in molecular reactivity challenges.},

The similar permanent porosity of these dimension-tunable chiral SOFs is collectively proved by N 2 adsorption–desorption experiments, single-crystal structure, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By soaking octahedral SOFs in aqueous dye solutions, the chiral porous channels effectively absorb size-matched guest dyes and impart their chirality, leading to enhanced CPL with a dissymmetry factor of 1.6 × 10 –2 . This work provides insights for the efficient synthesis of chiral SOFs with pore channels from a single component, which also deepens our understanding of size-selective adsorption and chirality transfer in confined space, as well as the enhancement of circularly polarized luminescence.},

However, their practical realization is hindered by the lower intercalation voltage (<3 V Na + /Na 0 ) and limited cycle life. To tackle these issues, we utilize Li/Cu-cosubstitution into the O3–Na 0.80 (Fe 0.50 Mn 0.50 )O 2 cathode to tune the ionocovalency of Fe/Mn–O bonds, which in turn can modulate the electrochemical properties. With the cosubstitution, the intercalation voltage of Na 0.80 (Li 0.10 Cu 0.10 Fe 0.30 Mn 0.50 )O 2 is raised to >3.2 V, thanks to the introduction of Cu 3+ /Cu 2+ redox and enhanced Fe–O bond ionicity. Na 0.80 (Li 0.10 Cu 0.10 Fe 0.30 Mn 0.50 )O 2 displays extraordinary cycling stability (98 and 60% at 1C after 500 cycles in the window of 4.0–2.0 and 4.0–1.5 V, respectively) compared to the unsubstituted cathode (58 and 24% at 1C after 500 cycles in the window of 4.0–2.0 and 4.0–1.5 V, respectively). The enhanced stability is attributed to the retention of the O3-type structure and suppressed Jahn–Teller MnO 6 distortion during deep sodiation, as revealed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations. This study highlights the importance of chemical substitution strategies in the development of advanced layered oxide cathodes with higher energy densities and cycling stabilities.},

  abstract     = {Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with exotic magnetic properties have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and data storage technologies. However, the limited availability of intrinsic 2D magnetic materials has driven efforts to induce and manipulate magnetism in otherwise nonmagnetic 2D systems through approaches such as chemical intercalation, defect engineering, and substitutional doping. Herein, we present a facile, chimie douce method for incorporating 3 d transition metals (Cr, Co, and Ni) into the nonmagnetic PtSe 2 sublattice. This synthetic approach enables control over layer thickness of Pt 1– x M x Se 2 ( M = Cr, Co, Ni) nanosheets by varying the M identity and annealing conditions. Comprehensive scattering and spectroscopic characterizations confirm the successful and homogeneous substitution of M atoms at the Pt site, rather than intercalation, and reveal a strong correlation between nanosheet thickness and the identity of the substituting metal. High-temperature annealing of the nanosheets promotes an irreversible transformation toward the bulk phase, allowing for detailed characterization of structural and magnetic properties. A case study of Pt 0.8 Cr 0.2 Se 2 reveals that nanosheet thickness plays a critical role in modulating local magnetic interactions. While Cr atoms in the as-synthesized few-layers-thick nanosheets exhibit predominantly short-range antiferromagnetic interactions, the emergence of short-range ferromagnetic exchange is revealed in the bulk material. Detailed ac susceptibility and remanent magnetization measurements further demonstrate that bulk Pt 0.8 Cr 0.2 Se 2 adopts a frustrated magnetic ground state with clear signatures of ferromagnetic cluster-glass behavior. The systematic investigation presented herein establishes a clear and robust protocol for the synthesis and in-depth characterization of 2D transition-metal-substituted PtSe 2 materials with varying layer thickness and paves a path toward their realization in spintronic and magnetic device applications.},

  abstract     = {Alkenes make up an important class of compounds prevalent in biologically active molecules and synthetic intermediates. Their significance has driven the development of robust synthetic methods that allow the efficient and selective production of mono- and disubstituted alkenes. However, the selective synthesis of more highly substituted alkenes from readily accessible starting materials remains a significant synthetic challenge. Here, we present a novel approach for synthesizing tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes through the catalytic coupling of terminal alkynes with alkylboranes and organohalides. The unique reaction mechanism ties the relative positioning of substituents in the alkene products to specific coupling partners that deliver them, enabling the efficient and precise generation of multiple isomers of tri- and tetrasubstituted alkenes from readily available precursors. We also demonstrate the coupling of alkylboranes with terminal alkynes in the presence of a proton source, which unexpectedly provides complementary stereoselectivity in the synthesis of trisubstituted alkenes to further broaden access to various isomers of highly substituted alkenes.},

  abstract     = {α-Glucan, broadly distributed in nature or produced artificially by biotransformation, is fundamental to life. Amylomaltases (AMs) can modulate the biochemical properties of α-glucan through a distinctive cyclization feature to form α-1,4-glucoside-linked large-ring polysaccharides (cycloamyloses; CAs), endowing α-glucan with significant health benefits and medical value. While the industrial application of CAs continues to progress, the mechanistic intricacies of the cyclization process─and its nuanced interplay with hydrolysis─remain only partially understood. Here, we harness large-scale computations in synergy with biochemical experiments to unravel, at atomic resolution, the full covalent and noncovalent catalytic mechanism of AMs, revealing that cyclization (12.8 kcal/mol) outcompetes hydrolysis (17.5 kcal/mol) as the dominant pathway. Furthermore, we identify that postglycosylation noncovalent polysaccharide chain transfer emerges as the decisive factor in cyclization, particularly for AM–degree of polymerization (DP) greater than 30 substrate complexes, where this noncovalent step (≥13.6 kcal/mol) dictates the rate of CA production. 57 variants with enhanced activity (up to a 2.3-fold increase) were engineered in our biochemical experiments by strategically modulating the chain transfer step. Enzyme kinetics results suggest that the improvement in enzyme performance largely stems from the decrease in enzyme–substrate affinity along the substrate transfer pathway. Additionally, through mass spectrometry, CAs with DP ranging from 22 to 61 were detected, confirming our theoretical results. We also quantify the kinetic competitive balance between cyclization and hydrolysis, providing clear engineering blueprints for the AM family. This work delivers a systematic, molecular-level understanding of CA biosynthesis from an industrial-performance perspective, paving the way for next-generation CA innovations.},

  abstract     = {In principle, photocontrolled radical polymerization via near-infrared (NIR) irradiation offers spatiotemporal precision, deep tissue penetration, and biocompatibility. However, its utility is hindered by low efficiency and restricted access to high-molecular-weight polymers. To address these challenges, we report a new supramolecular NIR photoenzyme (SNIRPE) system comprising glucose oxidase (GOx) and tetrasulfonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPcS 4 – ) that combines enzymatic deoxygenation with photoredox catalysis. SNIRPE involves a spatially confined cascade mechanism: GOx-generated H 2 O 2 is photodecomposed in situ by ZnPcS 4 – under NIR irradiation to produce hydroxyl radicals (•OH). This enables oxygen-tolerant, high-throughput, reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization across microliter-to-100 mL volumes, achieving ultrahigh molecular weights (UHMWs, M n > 1000 kg mol –1 , Đ < 1.20) with ultralow catalyst loadings (50 ppb ZnPcS 4 – , which is 3–4 orders of magnitude lower than conventional NIR photoredox systems). Scalability is demonstrated through 100 mL batch synthesis, while polymerization through porcine tissue underscores its biomedical utility. By combining enzymatic efficiency with photoredox versatility, longstanding problems in NIR-driven polymer synthesis have been eliminated.},

The synthesis of the misassigned structure of elisapterosin F led us to revisit the structure elucidation of these natural products. Application of NMR calculation-based in silico structure reassignment disclosed several unheeded structural mutations for elisapterane diterpenoids and accurately revised the structures of elisapterosins A, D, and F. With a computation-rerouted synthetic blueprint, we eventually accomplished collective total syntheses of elisapterosins A–F, alongside biogenetically related aberrarone, elisabanolide, and 3- epi -elisabanolide. By integrating our inference aided by computational tools with validation through total synthesis, this work exemplifies a modern case of total synthesis detective stories, demonstrating the power of computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE) and the risks of analogical approaches for the structure assignment of natural products.},

  abstract     = {Noncanonical amino acids play a critical role in enhancing drug efficacy, specificity, pharmacokinetics, and other key therapeutic properties. However, their incorporation into peptides or small molecules often presents significant synthetic challenges. Late-stage modification of natural residues, after the primary structural framework of a molecule is established, offers an efficient strategy for generating analogue libraries. Serine, one of the most abundant natural amino acids, remains underutilized due to the incompatibility of existing deoxygenative methods with complex peptides. Currently, no method is available for the late-stage modification of serine residues in peptides through carbon–carbon bond formation. Here, we address this gap by developing a site-selective, late-stage deoxygenative functionalization of serine residues. Inspired by automated DNA synthesis, we employ a phosphoramidite reagent in combination with a photocatalytic system to achieve efficient serine deoxygenative activation and radical addition to diverse acceptors, enabling the transformation of serine into various noncanonical residues such as homoglutamine, homoglutamic acid, 5-hydroxynorvaline, phosphonates, and alanine-3- d 1 . The method proved compatible with complex peptides such as enkephalin, bradykinin, and α-MSH both on solid support and in solution. The broad substrate scope, operational robustness, and high chemoselectivity of this approach position it as a versatile platform for peptide diversification and the advancement of medicinal chemistry.},

However, the C–N coupling reaction encompasses multiple reactants and complex pathways, necessitating a catalyst that exhibits a high efficiency in both CO 2 and NO 3 – reduction. Herein, the sub-2 nm Cu and Co codoped SnO 2 ultrathin nanosheet (SnO 2 CuCo) with mesoporous structure is synthesized for the electrochemical coreduction of CO 2 and NO 3 – for urea synthesis, and the thickness of SnO 2 CuCo is only 1.8 nm, and the mesoporous size in the ultrathin nanosheet is 2 nm. The as-synthesized SnO 2 CuCo achieved a remarkable urea Faraday efficiency (FE) of 50 ± 1% with a production rate as high as 2701.2 ± 99.1 μmol h –1 g cat –1 . Additionally, the SnO 2 CuCo catalyst demonstrated exceptional stability after 10 catalytic cycles. Through in situ spectroscopic analysis combined with density functional theory computations, it has been revealed that Cu doping facilitates the reduction of CO 2 to CO and enhances CO adsorption, favoring the creation of the essential *CO intermediate species. Meanwhile, Co doping effectively reduces the activation energy required for the C–N coupling reaction, thereby promoting the catalytic performance, specifically the activity and selectivity, of the SnO 2 CuCo catalyst in the process of urea synthesis. This finding provides a whole new catalytic strategy for the electrochemical production of urea.},

  abstract     = {Biomolecular condensates enrich specific client molecules while excluding others, often modulating conformational landscapes, and hence functions, of molecules dissolved within them. NMR-based atomic resolution studies have focused on interactions between scaffold proteins and the unfolded states of client proteins to understand the factors that influence client partitioning into condensed phases. However, characterization of interactions involving the folded client conformer is required to obtain a complete picture of how dissolution within the condensed phase affects the client energy landscape. Here, we use solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate, at atomic resolution, the interactions mediating the selective partitioning of a folded client, the FUS RNA Recognition Motif (RRM), into condensates formed by the scaffold protein CAPRIN1. At 40 °C, approximately 40% of FUS RRM remains folded in the CAPRIN1 condensed phase and high-resolution [ 1 H– 15 N]-HSQC spectra can be recorded, enabling site-specific interactions between the folded client and scaffold to be mapped across the entire FUS RRM sequence. Using intermolecular NOE and PRE (mixed solutions), and chemical shift perturbation (demixed solution) analyses, we identify a set of interaction surfaces on the folded FUS RRM that enable multiple contacts with aromatic- and arginine-rich regions of CAPRIN1. These heterotypic interactions lead to a 30-fold enrichment of FUS RRM within the condensate and overlap with sites responsible for CAPRIN1 homotypic phase separation, suggesting a shared molecular basis for scaffold-scaffold and scaffold-client recognition. Notably, tyrosine phosphorylation of CAPRIN1 disrupts these interactions and reduces client partitioning by over 2 orders of magnitude, highlighting how post-translational modifications can profoundly regulate condensate composition.},

Herein, a robust 3D metalloporphyrin COF with scu topology and 2-fold interpenetration is achieved by using high-connectivity metalloporphyrin, and different metal centers within the porphyrin units of 3D COFs lead to intriguing structural variations. Particularly, the 3D cobalt-porphyrin-based COF achieves efficient photocatalytic CO 2 -to-CO conversion with a rate of 21 251.0 μmol g –1 h –1 , 94.2% selectivity, and a cycle stability up to 6 cycles for 30 h. The accessible active sites of 3D COF deliver an exceptional turnover frequency (TOF) and conversion rate compared with reported pristine COFs for photocatalytic CO 2 fixation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the efficient donor–acceptor (D-A) system constructed in the framework, and the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurement confirms the superiority of the 3D network for CO 2 chemisorption. In contrast, the two-dimensional (2D) counterpart with similar composition and D–A system is restricted by the buried metal centers. Taking the high efficiency and selectivity of CO 2 -to-CO conversion, the robust metalloporphyrin-based 3D COF has been further incorporated into tandem reaction toward higher value-added chemical products.},

Artificially designed DNA origami serves as a key enabler for such systems by providing a highly programmable platform for positioning computational components with nanometer resolution. However, conventional monolayer DNA origami circuits often exhibit non-negligible signal leakage, attributed to structural fluctuation-induced crosstalk between surface-confined molecules. Here, we utilize a rigidified double-layered uniaxial DNA origami platform to suppress the intrinsic structural fluctuation, thereby achieving high-fidelity signal propagation via minimizing fluctuation-mediated leakage. The rigidified DNA origami serves as a reliable computing platform to provide site arrangements that are narrowly distributed and closer to theoretical design. Basic propagation modules of varying orientations and spacings are implemented with reduced leakage and increased on–off ratios. We further demonstrate high-performance parallel transmission lines and logic gates on rigidified DNA origami. This approach establishes a generalizable strategy for engineering reliable platforms for surface-confined DNA computing.},

However, SEE remains elusive in molecular systems due to typically weak spin–electric field coupling. In this study, we observe a relevant SEE in a mononuclear lanthanide complex using Electric Field Modulated Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. We reveal a marked anisotropy of the SEE, evidencing that the most perturbed g tensor component is the one perpendicular to the electric field, providing hints for the most convenient experimental configuration to tune ad hoc spin transitions. Ab initio calculations in synergy with the experimental results revealed that molecular symmetry breaking plays a fundamental role. We also point out the crystal field parameters that are most strongly modulated by the presence of an electric field. These parameters are all off-diagonal, indicating effective electric-field-mediated state mixing.},

  abstract     = {Ions are essential components in the anode–electrolyte interfacial microenvironment that significantly influence both the activity and the pathway of electrocatalytic molecular oxidation reactions. Nevertheless, most anions are generally considered inhibitory on electrocatalytic molecular (such as alcohols and amines) oxidation reactions due to their specific adsorption at the inner Helmholtz layer, negatively impacting the electrocatalytic performance. In contrast, we have found herein that fluorine ion (F – ) at the outer Helmholtz layer is capable of largely elevating the electrocatalytic activity and promoting the transformation of glyceric acid to lactic acid as the main product by fluorine–hydrogen bonding with water molecules, glycerol reactants, and glyceraldehyde intermediate during the glycerol oxidation reaction. It has been revealed that these interfacial H-bondings facilitate glycerol desolvation and modulate molecular charge distribution, lower the energy barrier of proton-coupled electron transfer, improve the interfacial H-bond network connectivity, and destabilize the configuration of the glyceraldehyde intermediate. Importantly, this strategy is applicable to commonly used model catalysts, including Pt, Au, Pd, and Ni(OH) 2 , and offers enhanced electrolytic oxidation performances for various alcohol and amine molecules. This work provides a new perspective for the efficient electrocatalytic upgrading of alcohol and amine chemicals by establishing interfacial H-bonding.},

Herein, a new DUV-transparent NLO borate, CsSrB 3 O 6 (CSBO), has been successfully predicted and synthesized by the cation regulation from Cs 2 KY(B 3 O 6 ) 2 (CKYBO). The structural stability of CSBO was confirmed by first-principles phonon vibration calculations, and it was eventually synthesized via a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The substitution of K + /Y 3+ cations with Sr 2+ cations eliminates the disorder and significantly reduces the thermal expansion anisotropy (CKYBO: 9.32, CSBO: 1.95), which effectively protects the crystals from cracking during crystal growth. Furthermore, CSBO successfully achieved the ordered design of B 3 O 6 functional groups, and this structural feature enables it to display well-balanced functional performance, including a strong second-harmonic generation response (5.0 × KH 2 PO 4 ), a short UV absorption edge (<190 nm), and moderate birefringence (0.075@1064 nm). All of these results demonstrate that CSBO is a promising DUV NLO material, and this study establishes an effective strategy for developing high-performance NLO crystals through synergistic computational-experimental approaches.},

  abstract     = {Redox photosensitizers exhibiting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) are widely used in the various research fields. We investigated the roles of the singlet and triplet excited states of such molecules in photocatalytic CO 2 reduction. Two TADF compounds ( 4DPAIPN and 3DPAFIPN ) were used in combination with a manganese(I) complex as a catalyst and 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1 H -benzo[ d ]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA) as sacrificial electron donors. In the case of 4DPAIPN , the quantum yield of CO 2 reduction (Φ CO+HCOO– ) was negatively correlated with the concentration of BIH, equaling 43.2% and 20.3% at [BIH] = 5 and 200 mM, respectively. The reduction of the singlet excited state by BIH afforded a singlet geminate ion pair, 1 ( 4DPAIPN • – ···BIH• + ), which experienced a markedly faster backward electron transfer affording the ground state than the corresponding triplet, 3 ( 4DPAIPN • – ···BIH• + ). The escape yield of the singlet state was approximately 10 times lower than that of the triplet state. High BIH concentrations favored the quenching of the singlet excited state and disfavored the formation of the triplet excited state, resulting in low photocatalytic efficiencies. Although the system with 3DPAFIPN exhibited a similar tendency, the maximum Φ CO+HCOO– was lower (11.9% at [BIH] = 10 mM) because of its greater oxidizing power resulting in the efficient quenching of its singlet excited state by TEOA. Based on these results, we extracted the reaction conditions and molecular designs of TADF photosensitizers suitable for constructing efficient photocatalysts, namely those minimizing the quenching of the singlet excited state and maximizing the quenching of the triplet excited state.},

Photocurrent response, in situ FTIR spectroscopy, and COMSOL simulations reveal that plasmon-derived hot electrons and heating greatly facilitate *CO formation at the CuPd interface, which diffuses to the Cu surface for subsequent C–C coupling. DFT calculations show that the increased *CO coverage on the Cu sites reduces the energy barrier for C–C coupling, ultimately enhancing C 2 H 4 generation.

This sub-200 fs decay pathway may hinder squaraine performance as dye-sensitizers. Our results provide experimental evidence of a sloped CI landscape and elucidate the role of at least two vibrational modes strongly coupled to electronic degrees of freedom.

Herein, we show that a simple terpyridine-ligated nickel(II) complex, integrated into an imine-linked covalent organic framework, can be readily reduced by photoexcited Hantzsch esters to produce a heterogeneous nickel(I) photocatalyst with a fairly low excited-state oxidation potential of approximately −3.5 V (referenced to the saturated calomel electrode). The efficient electron transfer processes within the framework support and the confinement effects that stabilize the nickel(I) species contribute to the improved performance of this innovative heterogeneous nickel photocatalysis in comparison to its homogeneous counterparts. Notably, the current system allows for substantial reductions in catalyst loadings and exhibits high recyclability in promoting reductive couplings between challenging organohalide electrophiles and allyl sulfones. Our research indicates that employing framework-based heterogenization strategies can facilitate the development of new classes of robust photoredox catalysts with earth-abundant metals for sustainable and practical organic synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Semiconducting organic nanocrystals derived from the self-assembly of conjugated polymers hold great promise for optoelectronic applications. However, fabrication of these semiconductors with high uniformity and extended dimensions remains a major challenge due to tedious multistep procedures for size control and the formidable task of attaining crystal growth oriented perpendicularly to the π–π stacking direction. Here, we present a straightforward strategy for the preparation of uniform rectangular platelet micelles with tunable size through a single-step heating–cooling–aging protocol from conjugated poly(di- n -hexylfluorene) (PDHF) block copolymers (BCPs). The nucleation and growth stages are dramatically separated during the cooling process, wherein BCPs with longer PDHF blocks spontaneously serve as in situ nuclei and induce controllable epitaxial growth, yielding uniform two-dimensional (2D) morphologies. The crystalline core structure is long-range ordered, synchronously constructed by pitched π – π stacking in the length-growth direction and solvophobic alkyl stacking in the width-growth direction. The platelet dimensions spanning ∼30,000–800,000 nm 2 can be controlled by adjusting the mixed solvent ratio. Furthermore, the universality of this one-step strategy for size-controllable platelets is affirmed by BCPs with varying corona–core block ratios (0.20–0.86) and different corona-forming chains (e.g., quaternized polythiophene (QPT) and polyfluorene (QPF)). Interestingly, complex concentric segmented structures are accessible through the one-pot self-assembly of two PDHF BCPs, whose growth rate and sequence are manipulated by differences in PDHF block lengths (17 versus 14) and block ratios (0.12 versus 0.71). This enables the customization of a facile energy funneling pathway within the integrated structures from the peripheral, crystalline PDHF core to the central, lower-energy QPT corona.},

Typically, to do so requires overcoming a challenging C–C bond-forming reductive elimination, often enabled by the intermediacy of highly oxidized Ni species or outer-sphere processes. While direct C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) reductive elimination from the Ni II base oxidation state is normally thermally inaccessible, light-activation provides an avenue to affect such transformations. Here, we investigate the mechanism of light-induced C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) bond formation from dialkyl bipyridine Ni II complexes through a variety of organometallic, spectroscopic, and computational studies. Wavelength-dependent quantum yields, ligand electronics–reactivity relationships, excited-state lifetimes, computed barriers, and product distributions from crossover studies support a photolysis/radical rebound mechanism. This reactivity paradigm complements existing strategies in the literature to promote reductive elimination from Ni II , such as the use of destabilizing, sterically hindered ligands and reduction of electron density at Ni through the binding of electron-deficient olefins. Hence, we envision that light-induced reductive elimination may enable the development of challenging C(sp 3 )–C(sp 3 ) couplings.},

  abstract     = {Circular mRNA (mRNA) exhibits promising potential in mRNA therapy due to its increased stability and extended duration of protein translation, which has sparked an urgent demand for efficient methods to prepare circular RNAs in vitro . Here, we present a versatile self-circularization strategy that employs simple motifs to synthesize circular RNAs, achieving robust efficiencies for sequences ranging from dozens to thousands of nucleotides. By leveraging an automated computational program, we optimized highly specific lock-key structures to maximize circularization efficiency, particularly for long RNA substrates. Furthermore, the shared sequence and functionality between linear precursor RNAs and circular products eliminate the need for additional purification steps to remove excess nucleic acid components, simplifying the production process. This approach also yields circular RNAs with superior stability and translation efficiency, enabling sustained protein expression in vitro and in vivo . Our computationally optimized, purification-free method holds immense promise for scalable circular RNA production and the development of advanced RNA therapeutics, significantly advancing mRNA therapy.},

  abstract     = {Urea electrosynthesis from the coelectrolysis of CO 2 and NO 3 – (UECN) has emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to traditional energy-intensive methods; however, the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts capable of achieving concurrent optimization of Faradaic efficiency (FE) and urea yield rates continues to pose a fundamental challenge in this field. Herein, we developed a phosphorus-doped Cu/Fe 2 O 3 electrocatalyst (denoted as P–Cu/Fe 2 O 3 ), where phosphorus atoms partially substitute for oxygen atoms within the Cu/Fe 2 O 3 heterostructure. This engineered electrocatalyst achieves exceptional urea electrosynthesis performance, delivering a very high Faradaic efficiency of 73.81% with a corresponding yield rate of 62.74 mmol h –1 g –1 cat. at −0.68 V vs RHE, which are superior to most UECN electrocatalysts reported to date. Notably, the urea yield rate can be further boosted to 97.11 mmol h –1 g –1 cat. at −0.88 V vs RHE. Operando spectroscopic characterization and density functional theory (DFT) simulations indicated that P doping modulates the electronic structure of the electrocatalyst surface, which promotes the formation of *CO and *NO, lowers the energy barrier for the coupling of *CO and *NO, and increases *H coverage to facilitate the hydrogenation process during UECN. This multisite cooperative mechanism establishes a new paradigm for designing high-performance electrocatalysts, demonstrating substantial potential for industrial-scale urea production.},

Herein, we synthesized a framework-anchored Ga-MFI catalyst synthesized via ligand-assisted hydrothermal crystallization, achieving 80.76% aromatic selectivity at 99.57% cyclohexane conversion (550 °C, 0.1 MPa, WHSV = 1 h –1 ) with over 110 h stability for CO 2 and cyclohexane (as a model naphthenic compound) coupling reaction. Multimodal in situ characterization (XAFS, synchrotron XRD, and FTIR) reveals that isolated Ga(III) species undergo reversible coordination switching to GaH x under reaction conditions, dynamically mediating CO 2 activation through Ga species transfer. Tetrahedrally coordinated Ga–O sites synergize with proximal Brønsted acid sites. Isotopic tracing ( 13 CO 2 ) demonstrates 56.4% of aromatic carbon originates. The catalyst’s self-recovery capability ensures structural integrity and suppresses deactivation. This work establishes a dynamic single-site catalysis framework for a CO 2 coupled alkane, advancing the design of zeolite-confined metal catalysts through precise microenvironment engineering.},

  abstract     = {The properties of supramolecules can be modulated by post-assembly modification (PAM) of their building blocks or via guest encapsulation. This work demonstrates a largely uncharted approach to property modulation that integrates both PAM and guest encapsulation in a single system to boost photocatalytic activity. Self-assembly of a “phenothiazine”-functionalized ligand ( L ) with a cis -blocked Pd(II) acceptor ( A ) generated an A 6 L 3 trifacial tube ( T ). Postassembly, T could be modified via irradiation with violet light, leading to the sulfoxidation of the “phenothiazine” moieties in T and thereby generating an oxidized tube ( TO ). Both TO and T could stabilize a C 70 molecule within their cavities, forming C 70 @TO and C 70 @T , respectively. Although T showed relatively poor photocatalytic performance mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) with respect to oxidation of terpenes ( S1–S4 ) under visible light, the modified TO was much better in that regard. Expectedly, C 70 @T showed better photocatalytic performance than T due to the presence of photosensitizing C 70 . While PAM or guest encapsulation alone led to reasonable improvements in photocatalytic ability, their combination within C 70 @TO led to a significant improvement. Catalytic amounts of C 70 @TO could instantly oxidize terpenes. Thus, we report here a new host that integrates the effects of both PAM and photosensitizer encapsulation for synergistically boosting its photocatalytic activity.},

While significant progress has been made in electrosynthesizing C–N and C═N compounds, the electrosynthesis of nitriles with C≡N bond formation via NO x as nitrogen sources remains challenging. Herein, we introduce a novel method for efficient synthesizing nitriles through electrocatalytic coupling of nitrate ions (NO 3 – ) with aldehydes under ambient conditions, employing ZnO/Sn/SnO 2 as the electrocatalyst. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the adsorption and accumulation of *NH 2 OH and *RCHO on the catalyst plays a central role in the efficient reaction. The key C–N bond-forming step is found to be the formation of hydroxylamine from nitrate reduction and its subsequent condensation with *RCHO. The C–N coupling strategy can be applied to the synthesis of fatty nitrile and (hetero)aromatic nitrile compounds. This study opens the way for nitriles electrosynthesis from nitrogen wastes, which could contribute to utilization of nitrogen resources.},

Although the HIV-1 capsid structure has been extensively studied, structural information is lacking for other lentiviral capsids, limiting our understanding. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and a liposome-templating system, we assembled capsid-like particles (CLPs) and resolved capsid protein (CA) pentamer and hexamer lattice structures from the two major phylogenetic groups of small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). These structures exhibit an overall lattice organization like HIV-1 but differ in key characteristics, notably the absence of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) in the SRLV CA lattice─a critical factor for HIV-1 capsid assembly and function. Additionally, SRLV CA pentamers show a unique N-terminal domain orientation, providing insights into SRLV capsid assembly mechanisms. These observations, together with our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, results suggest a possible mechanism for importing deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) molecules into SRLV capsids. Furthermore, key regions of host factor interaction, such as the CypA binding motifs, have diverged in the SRLV CA assemblies. Our results contribute to understanding the SRLV lentiviral capsids which may facilitate structure-based inhibitor design strategies.},

  abstract     = {As an emerging class of eutectic mixtures, deep eutectic gel electrolytes (DEGEs) exhibit unique advantages in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), particularly due to their high ionic conductivity and tunable molecular interactions. However, it is challenging to realize high interfacial stability between DEGEs and lithium metal. We developed a series of DEGEs utilizing fluorinated amides, which leverage the electron-withdrawing effects of fluorine to precisely modulate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of amides and their binding affinities for Li + . A bidirectional screening criterion is proposed, integrating the LUMO energy levels of amides and the desolvation barriers of solvated Li + ions. Among the tested amides, 2,2,2-trifluoro- N -methylacetamide (C═Oα3F) demonstrates the lowest LUMO energy level and desolvation energy barrier. The declined LUMO energy level facilitates the formation of a uniform and robust SEI layer enriched with LiF and Li 3 N. Meanwhile, the reduced Li + desolvation energy barrier renders more anions to participate in the solvation process, and this synergistic solvent–anion-derived SEI mechanism further reinforces SEI stability. Additionally, the C═Oα3F-DEGE exhibits superior nonflammability and a high ionic conductivity of 1.24 mS cm –1 . The enhanced properties enable the corresponding Li||Li symmetric battery to achieve stable cycling for over 9000 h and the Li||LiFePO 4 battery counterpart to deliver an impressive lifespan of 2500 cycles with 81.7% capacity retention. These results underscore the advantages of C═Oα3F-DEGE over other fluorinated amide-based systems, providing new insights into the development of high-performance deep eutectic gel electrolytes.},

  abstract     = {Tracking the multifarious ultrafast electronic and structural changes occurring in a molecule during a photochemical transformation is a challenging endeavor that benefits from recent experimental and computational progress in time-resolved techniques. Measurements of valence electronic states, which provide a global picture of the bonding structure of the molecule, and core electronic states, which provide insight into the local environment, traditionally require different approaches and are often studied separately. Here, we demonstrate that X-ray pulses from a seeded free-electron laser (FEL) enable the measurement of high-resolution, time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) that capture weak satellite states resulting from shake-down processes in a valence-excited molecule. This approach effectively combines the advantages of both valence- and core-state investigations. We applied this method to investigate photoexcited CS 2 molecules, where the role of internal conversion (IC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) in determining the predissociation dynamics is controversial. We present XPS spectra from photoexcited CS 2 , obtained at the FERMI FEL. High-resolution measurements, compared to the corresponding spectra obtained from accurate multireference quantum chemical calculations, reveal that shake-down satellite channels are highly sensitive to both valence electronic and geometric changes. Previous studies of the predissociation dynamics have led to uncertain assignments of the branching between singlet and triplet excited states. We derive a propensity rule that demonstrates the spin-selectivity of the shake-downs. This selectivity allows us to unequivocally assign contributions from the bright and dark singlet excited states, with populations tracked along the predissociation dynamic pathway.},

  abstract     = {What is the size limit for global aromaticity? How large can a macrocyclic π-system be and still exhibit an aromatic ring current around its circumference? We address this question by investigating a π-conjugated butadiyne-linked 18-porphyrin nanoring (diameter 8 nm). This nanoring was synthesized by two different strategies: classical template-directed synthesis, using a radial template with 18 pyridyl binding sites, and Vernier templating, using a small hexapyridyl template. Both strategies are effective when the porphyrins have octyloxy side chains, but classical templating is more effective than Vernier templating when the porphyrins have bulky trihexylsilyl substituents. The size and shape of the nanoring were confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy. 19 F NMR oxidation titrations on the nanoring bound to a fluorinated template revealed shoulder signals indicating weak global aromatic and antiaromatic ring currents in the 10+ and 12+ oxidation states, which have Hückel circuits of 242 and 240 π-electrons, respectively. These shoulder signals do not appear in control experiments with a split-ring complex consisting of the linear porphyrin 18-mer bound to the same fluorinated template, confirming that they arise from global ring currents. Nucleus-independent chemical shift calculations using the BLYP35 functional qualitatively predicted that the 18 porphyrin nanoring would exhibit global aromaticity in the 10+ and 14+ oxidation states and antiaromaticity in the 12+ and 16+ oxidation states, in keeping with the experimental results from NMR spectroscopy and with the Hückel rule. The experimental results show that the ring currents in this 18-porphyrin ring are weaker than those in the homologous 12-porphyrin ring by at least a factor of 2.},

  abstract     = {Achieving precise control over covalent bond formation and cleavage is critical for advancing material recycling and enabling repeated reuse. Here, we introduce quinolinones as versatile, multistimuli-responsive motifs enabling orthogonal and controlled covalent bond manipulation via a reversible [2π + 2π] cycloaddition triggered by light and thermal stimuli. While photochemical bond formation is well-established, thermal reversion of such bonds for material deconstruction remains underexplored. Furthermore, we demonstrate, for the first time, the exceptional ability of quinolinones to undergo symmetrical thermal cleavage, in the solid state with unprecedented efficiency, achieving over 99% monomer recovery at 210 °C within 10 min. This circular process is initially demonstrated at the molecular level, showing an effective cyclability of at least three full bond formation and cleavage cycles with quantitative efficiency. Extending to the macromolecular scale, quinolinones are incorporated into linear polymers to enable phototriggered network formation followed by thermally induced bulk deconstruction. This responsive polymer system highlights remarkable versatility and recyclability. Finally, exploiting their multiresponsivity, quinolinones are applied to advanced coatings with reversible debonding and thermal degradation capabilities. This work establishes quinolinones as a robust platform for stimuli-responsive materials, paving the way for next-generation recyclable systems with enhanced functionalities.},

  abstract     = {The selective modification of natural protein templates has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating the protein structure and function as well as for designing therapeutic bioconjugates. While significant progress has been made in modifying protein side chains and terminal groups, backbone modifications remain underexplored due to the inherent inertness of amide bonds and the challenge of achieving site specificity. Despite the critical role of the backbone in the protein function, its selective chemical modification under physiological conditions has proven to be difficult. With this research, we introduce a site-specific, chemoselective, and two-step strategy for protein backbone modification via thiol/amine coupling and cyclization reactions driven by the release of volatile methyl mercaptans via a small-molecular conjugate acceptor, operating on small-molecule cysteine mimics, peptides, and proteins. This approach leverages the unique reactivity of the conjugate acceptor to first couple a cysteine residue, followed by intramolecular cyclization with an adjacent amide, forming a five-membered heterocyclic unit under aqueous conditions without requiring catalysts or heating. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the resulting rigid structure induces a local backbone torsion, hydrogen bond disruption, and altered side-chain orientation, thereby influencing protein folding. Preliminary investigations further explore the consequent changes in the protein thermal stability and enzymatic activity induced by backbone modification. More importantly, the process is accompanied by a fluorescence turn-on signal, enabling the real-time in situ monitoring of the modification process. Thus, this unique strategy offers a new platform for backbone-specific chemical modifications, paving the way for potential protein and peptide functional studies, fluorogenic labeling, and the development of novel bioconjugates.},

  abstract     = {Upcycling C- and N-containing pollutants into value-added resources is key to achieving a sustainable society in the near future. In recent years, coelectrolysis powered by renewable energy sources to generate structurally complicated and functionally diverse C–N bonds is highly desirable yet more challenging compared with C-only or N-only reduction reactions. Oximes, which contain C=N bonds, are important precursors in medicine and the fine chemical industry. Previous attempts to coreduce carbon dioxide and nitrate or nitrite yielded formaldoxime (H 2 C=NOH) as a byproduct with low selectivity. Herein, we demonstrate a new tandem electrocatalytic pathway to produce H 2 C=NOH as the target product using NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as efficient catalysts. Upon expanding the interlayer spacing of NiFe LDH using dodecyl-sulfonate as an intercalating anion, this catalyst displays a record-high Faradaic efficiency for H 2 C=NOH of 31% in aqueous solution at −1.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. Our findings also show that the lengths of alkyl chains can tune the immediate microenvironment surrounding the dual Ni–Fe active sites, thus boosting the C–N coupling yield rate. Kinetic isotopic effect studies and control experiments under H 2 are further carried out to interrogate the electrocatalytic mechanism of this tandem C–N bond formation process. Overall, this study offers a compelling approach to form a C–N bond via a green electrosynthesis scheme in an aqueous medium. Furthermore, this study underscores the importance of precisely regulating the electrochemical microenvironment for enhancing the synergy between dual-metal active sites for efficient domino electrosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Over recent decades, the glycocalyx, an extracellular organelle composed of a multitude of glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycoRNA, has gained considerable interest in cellular biology. While research in this field has revealed its tremendous importance in ever more aspects of physiological and pathological cellular processes, many of the principles that govern the role of the glycocalyx in these processes on a molecular level are still unknown. In order to unravel the fundamental laws underlying glycocalyx function, new technologies are required that enable the distinction between individual subprocesses within the intricate environment of the glycocalyx. Here, we establish an experimental platform to investigate the dynamics of the glycocalyx at the nanometer and microsecond length and time scales in a bottom-up fashion. We synthesized defined oligosaccharides and installed them on supported lipid bilayers. This way, synthetic glycolipids were assembled to glycocalyx model systems with tunable properties. By investigating these tunable model systems with interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy, we gain access to the required spatiotemporal resolution. We found a strong correlation between the molecular structure of several investigated model glycans and global dynamics of the system. Our findings are corroborated by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations. Our results provide the first direct experimental evidence on the relationship between glycan structure, organization, and dynamics, offering a robust and versatile basis for a quantitative understanding of glycocalyx biology and physics at the molecular level.},

  abstract     = {N -alkyl arylamines are important structural motifs in pharmaceuticals, yet traditional alkylating methods rely on the nucleophilicity of the amine and make access to such compounds with valuable bioproperties challenging. While metal-mediated reactions may alleviate these limitations, they often encounter amine-metal interactions that can hinder catalysis or lead to deleterious pathways. Herein, we report a palladium(II) [Pd(II)]/sulfoxide-oxazoline(SOX)/phosphoric acid-mediated C(sp 3 )H/N(sp 2 ) cross-coupling of 53 arylamine nucleophiles and 39 terminal olefins to furnish >80 diverse tertiary (3°) arylamines in excellent yields (average 82%) and selectivities (>20:1 E / Z , >20:1 linear/branched). The reaction furnishes electron-deficient and sterically bulky arylamines as well as those housing alkyl/aryl halides, epoxides, carbonyls, epimerizable centers, carboxylic acids, and N -triflyl/tosyl alkylamines, showcasing orthogonal scope to existing aminations. The generality of this reaction enables facile synthesis of six pharmaceuticals and derivatives (e.g., zafirlukast) and five late-stage drug fragment couplings (e.g., flutamide-duloxetine). Whereas spectroscopic studies identify a catalytically inactive bis(arylamine)·Pd(II) complex 4 as the resting state, the reaction proceeds with high efficiencies (short reaction times, low catalyst loadings). Mechanistic studies reveal that the SOX ligand L1 [(±)-MeO-SOX = MaSOX)] establishes a dynamic equilibrium with 4 to generate the active catalyst. Phosphoric acids promote the reaction by affording a significant increase in the functionalization rate, rendering a lower energy allylic C–H cleavage as the rate-determining step. We anticipate that this reaction will find broad use in the discovery of complex and medicinally relevant N -alkyl arylamines and that the mechanistic insights will be leveraged to improve efficiencies of other metal-catalyzed aminations.},

  abstract     = {N -vinyl azoles are prevalent moieties in pharmaceuticals, and fluorovinyl groups are widely recognized as carbonyl bioisosteres in drug design. Thus, N -fluorovinylated heteroarenes represent highly desirable functional groups in medicinal chemistry. To streamline the development of novel N -fluorovinylation and N -pentafluoropropenylation reactions, herein we safely handle fluorinated gases, such as vinylidene fluoride (VDF) and hexafluoropropene (HFP), as solid reagents using a metal–organic framework (MOF), Mg 2 (dobdc) (dobdc 4– = 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate). We report for the first time that free (NH)-heteroarenes─including various complex, biologically active molecules, react directly with VDF via a defluorinative pathway under mild conditions, yielding terminal N -fluorovinylated products in good to excellent yields. The use of the gas-loaded MOF leads to much higher yields than reactions with the gas alone, likely due to its dual role as both a VDF delivery vessel and a Lewis acid catalyst. Mechanistic investigations, including deuterium incorporation experiments and density functional theory calculations, suggest that this transformation represents a rare example of a concerted nucleophilic vinylic substitution (S N V) process. This protocol can be performed on a gram scale, and the resulting N -fluorovinyl moieties can be further diversified to yield valuable motifs, such as N -fluorocyclopropyl groups. Finally, this defluorinative coupling can be generalized to other fluorinated alkenes, such as HFP. Overall, this robust defluorinative coupling offers a straightforward strategy for synthesizing diverse fluorinated heteroarenes from readily available starting materials, providing broad access to these valuable motifs for the first time.},

  abstract     = {pH-responsive nonlamellar liquid crystalline nano-self-assemblies are gaining substantial interest in drug delivery applications owing to their unique inherent structural architectures. Using two positional isomers of diolein (namely, 1,2-diolein and 1,3-diolein) and their mixture (designated as diolein) in combination with 2-hydroxyoleic acid (2OHOA, a therapeutic agent with anticancer activity), we report on a family of stabilizer-free and pH-responsive nanoparticles with internal architectures spanning from a lamellar (L α ) phase to inverse hexagonal (H 2 ) and discontinuous (micellar) cubic Fd3m phases. In lipid composition- and pH-dependent manners, the triggered colloidal transformations in these aqueous nanodispersions, combined with alterations in the morphological features and size distributions, were investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering, cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis. The experimental findings support the notion that molecular shapes of lipids, deprotonation/protonation of ionizable lipids, and mutual lipid–lipid and lipid–water interactions at the interfacial area play crucial roles in modulating the biophysical properties of lyotropic liquid crystalline nano-self-assemblies. We discuss how the positional isomerism of diolein can dictate the structural features of the nanoparticles by controlling the interaction modes of diolein with 2OHOA in the interfacial area. Further, the potential of these structurally tunable nanoplatforms in the future development of nanomedicines for the delivery of 2OHOA alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents is highlighted.},

In this study, an increase of lattice-oxygen release flux up to 10 5 is achieved via a lattice oxygen triggering (LOT) strategy for oxide catalysts. The LOT strategy is experimentally realized by ion implantation of titanium (Ti) and iron (Fe) elements into the sapphire substrate, followed by an annealing process for Ti migration onto the surface and Fe stable substitution in the sapphire lattice. The LOT process occurs when Fe atoms dope into Ti oxides, forming the catalysts for SWCNT growth. The continuously released lattice oxygen serves as an in situ etchant for precise removal of metallic tubes, resulting in the direct synthesis of horizontally aligned s-SWCNT arrays with >98% purity. Field-effect transistors based on the s-SWCNT arrays exhibit ultralow subthreshold swing of 60 mV dec –1 , and high carrier mobility of 2291 cm 2 ·V –1 ·s –1 .

NaF requires almost 10 times more pressure to undergo this same phase transition, which has not been observed for LiF. Herein, we provide a detailed analysis, based upon quantum chemical calculations, explaining this behavior. We show that for the heavier alkali metals, the semicore p orbitals engage in metal–metal bonding in the B2 phase, facilitating the pressure-induced B1 → B2 structural transition. These findings suggest that the semicore orbitals of heavy alkali metals can be activated without the need of strong oxidants at very mild levels of compression, resulting in the formation of chemical bonds, challenging both traditional and modern core–valence distinctions. In addition, we argue that Cs 5p–5p bonding in CsCl occurs already at ambient pressure, stabilizing the B2 phase, and suggest experiments that may be able to detect signatures of such bonding.},

  abstract     = {The inherent trade-off between activity and stability in platinum single-atom catalysts (SACs) poses a significant challenge for catalytic oxidation reactions. High-coordination Pt sites have good stability, but their overoxidation often passivates activity. In contrast, metastable low-coordination Pt structures typically display high activity but are prone to oxidation and aggregation under harsh conditions. Herein, we propose a defect-engineering strategy to address this dilemma by anchoring oxidized Pt single atoms onto vacancy LaFeO 3 (v-LaFeO 3 ) perovskite. The introduced La-vacancy substantially reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy of LaFeO 3 , enhancing lattice oxygen mobility while preserving structural integrity. Pt single-atom sites with a high oxidation state (Pt 4+ ) are anchored on the support, and their coordination environments are optimized. The catalyst exhibits high and stable activity for CO oxidation without reduction pretreatment. The structural characterization and in situ experiments indicate that vacancies in LaFeO 3 positively regulate the electronic structure between the Pt and v-LaFeO 3 interface. The longer Pt–O bonds activate interface oxygen species, accelerate O 2 activation, and promote the cycling of CO oxidation. The oxidized Pt atoms and high coordination number enable its stability in long-term and high-temperature oxidation reactions. DFT calculations further verify the structure and reaction mechanism. This work demonstrates that precise control of support defects can concurrently optimize the electronic states and stability of SACs, offering a generalized paradigm for designing robust oxidation catalysts.},

The hygroscopic betaine molecules not only bind water molecules strongly but also endow the underhydrated characteristics of the hydroxide anions that increase their activity coefficient. The underhydrated hydroxide anions can also be enriched within the inner Helmholtz plane, which forms the mixed hydroxide anion-betaine adsorbate layer that significantly increases the effective potential that drives the OER.

  abstract     = {Despite their rigid, orthogonal π-systems and synthetic modularity, allenes remain underexplored in functional material design. Here, we report that tetraaryl-substituted allenes undergo clean and reversible protonation at the central sp-hybridized carbon, triggering substantial π-electron reorganization. To investigate how substitution patterns modulate the halochromic response, we synthesized a series of five tetraarylallenes, enabling a systematic structure–property relationship study of their optoelectronic behavior. Protonation induces large bathochromic shifts in absorption of up to 500 nm, with extinction coefficients exceeding 30,000 M – 1 cm – 1 in the near-infrared region. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analysis and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations reveal pronounced delocalization upon protonation, resulting in polymethine-like electronic structures with tunable donor–acceptor character. Protonation occurs even with weak acids such as acetic acid, and the process remains fully reversible through base-mediated deprotonation. UV–vis-NIR spectroscopy and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the formation of charge-transfer states. These findings establish allenes as a synthetically accessible and tunable platform for reversible, stimuli-responsive optical modulation across the visible to NIR spectrum.},

  abstract     = {Mucins are highly complex glycoproteins that form protective and lubricating barriers around epithelial surfaces, e.g., in the respiratory tract, to protect against pathogens. The isolation and purification of natural mucins without compromising their structure and thus their properties remain challenging. Glycopolymers as mucin mimetics have shown great potential in biomedical research, for example, in mucosal barrier enhancement and respiratory disease treatment, or in improving surface lubrication and adhesion properties. Here, we introduce double-brushed mucin mimetic glycopolymers, replicating for the first time a structural design that more closely imitates key architectural features of natural mucins. By combining solid-phase synthesis of sequence-defined glycooligomers and their attachment onto polyactive ester scaffolds, we enable access to a library of linear, brushed, and double-brushed glycopolymers with controlled variations of structural parameters, such as overall chain length, number, and length of branches, as well as number of carbohydrates and degree of sulfation. By using light and neutron scattering as well as atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy and imaging, we can demonstrate that the double-brushed architecture is responsible for successfully mimicking critical mucin properties, such as their adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces and an extended conformation, properties that are not achieved with single-brushed or linear analogues. Thus, our findings show that double-brushed sulfated glycopolymers effectively replicate key characteristics of natural mucins, advancing their potential as mucin models, as well as for use in biomedical applications.},

However, their widespread application as molecular photoswitches remains limited due to synthetic challenges like robust reaction conditions, lack of commercial availability of starting material, and low reaction yield. This work presents a straightforward one-pot methodology for synthesizing thiazolylazo derivatives by reacting 2-trimethylsilylthiazole with various diazonium salts. This approach offers mild reaction conditions, short reaction times, and moderate to good yields for different derivatives. Using this de novo synthesis strategy, we developed several new phenylazothiazole derivatives and asymmetric bis-heteroaryl azo compounds. The resulting thiazolylazo derivatives exhibit excellent E -to- Z isomerization under visible light, with a tunable thermal back-isomerization half-life ranging from seconds to days in acetonitrile. The prolonged thermal stability of the metastable isomers of these visible-light switches is attributed to specific noncovalent interactions in the transition state. Our method provides a versatile platform for late-stage thiazolylazo functionalization of complex ligands and drug molecules, paving the way for visible light switchable ligands in photopharmacological applications.},

Using the thermodynamic hydricity of the donors and the hydride affinity of the acceptors the thermodynamic driving forces for hydride transfer were determined. Brønsted plots, which correlate kinetic and thermodynamic hydricity, demonstrate distinct linear free energy relationships for each complex, with different Brønsted α values. Thus, at the same driving force hydride transfer from Cp*Ir( OMe bpy)H + is faster than for Cp*Ir(bpy)H + or Cp*Ir( CO2Me bpy)H + . Experimental and computational analyses are consistent with a concerted hydride transfer mechanism for all Ir complexes. As the thermodynamic driving force increases an earlier transition state is observed and all transition states also include π-stacking interactions between the donor and acceptor, which likely contribute to the different α values. The experimental data fits well to the Marcus model, enabling the determination of reorganization energies (λ) that range from 58 to 69 kcal mol –1 . These are lower than λ values for hydride transfer reactions involving organic donors and acceptors. This work provides a rare example of the correlation of kinetic and thermodynamic hydricity using only experimental data and shows that hydride transfer reactions involving metal hydrides can follow Marcus theory. The findings offer insight into controlling metal-catalyzed hydride transfer reactions, which is valuable for designing improved systems for a range of transformations.},

Accurate prediction of the substrate specificity of adenylation domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases is crucial for genome mining of nonribosomal peptides, yet current prediction methods fall short in accuracy. In this work, we analyzed 4,100 adenylation domains from documented nonribosomal peptide synthetases and found that the flavodoxin-like subdomain universally governs substrate specificity in all bacterial adenylation domains and that its phylogenetic analysis can correlate the sequences of adenylation domains and their substrate specificity. Leveraging the sequences within the flavodoxin-like subdomain, we developed a substrate specificity prediction algorithm using a protein language model, achieving 92% overall prediction accuracy for 43 frequently observed amino acids, significantly improving the prediction reliability. The efficacy of our prediction tool was validated through targeted genome mining, which led to the discovery of novel antimicrobial peptides. Our work lays a foundation to understand the sequence-to-function relationship of the bacterial adenylation domain and will facilitate the exploitation of nonribosomal peptides.

A clear structure–activity correlation is established across Cu + , Cu 0 , and ceria defect sites in the FSP-derived catalysts. Notably, a previously underexplored carboxylate-mediated pathway, facilitated on the surface-substituted Cu + structure, is identified as the dominant route, featuring a significantly lower apparent activation energy (20–30 kJ/mol) compared to the classical formate pathway.},

  abstract     = {The conversion of CO 2 into high-value chemicals using renewable electricity offers a promising pathway toward carbon neutrality and sustainable chemical production. However, efficiently transforming CO 2 into molecules with more than three carbon atoms remains a major challenge. Herein, we propose, for the first time, a tandem electrocatalytic strategy for converting CO 2 into the highly valuable six-carbon compound 1,1-diethoxyethane (DEE, valued at ∼$7,000 per ton). This approach couples CO 2 electroreduction to ethanol with the subsequent selective electro-oxidation of ethanol to DEE. Key limitations of the latter step, such as low Faradaic efficiency, poor catalyst durability, and dependence on noble metals, are addressed by employing a large-area (100 cm 2 ) electrochemically functionalized graphite flake electrode. This catalyst achieves high FE (>90% across a wide voltage range) and excellent stability (>140 h). Combined theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the COOH functional groups and carbon defects on the graphite synergistically modulate the adsorption of the key CH 3 CH 2 O* intermediate, reducing the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. Techno-economic and carbon footprint analyses further demonstrate the economic viability and carbon reduction potential of this tandem process, with an estimated net removal of ∼370 kg of CO 2 per ton of DEE produced.},

Herein, Cs 3 Bi 2 Br 9 (CBB) QDs were covalently anchored as single-rod nanocrystals (SRNCs) within Hf-based metal–organic framework (MOF) nanosheets (Hf 12 -bpy, H 2 bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine-5,5′-dicarboxylic acid), forming a series of host–guest photocatalysts CBB@Hf 12 -bpy. By modulation of the thickness of MOF nanosheets, the length of CBB SRNCs was effectively shortened to 18 nm, exhibiting strong quantum confinement effects. Mechanistic studies reveal that the bpy-CBB dual-nitrogen chelation effect induces a discrete distribution of CBB within Hf 12 -bpy pores, and the well-matched interlayer spacing of H 2 bpy (7.95 Å ≈ d Bi···Bi ) guides the anisotropic growth of CBB along the [001] direction into SRNCs. Such a long-range-ordered SRNC architecture significantly improves the bulk-to-surface charge separation efficiency, enabling ultrafast electron supply (average charge excitation rate: 5.320 mV). Additionally, the chelated N–Bi–N moieties work as covalent electron-transfer bridges to markedly reduce charge-transfer resistance (7.75 Ω) and interfacial charge-transfer barriers (100.5 meV), accelerating interfacial charge migration kinetics. These synergistic advantages endow CBB@Hf 12 -bpy(18 nm) with an exceptional electron accumulation rate (1.54 g –1 ·min –1 ) and record-breaking CO 2 -to-CO conversion efficiency (15,982.1 μmol·g –1 ·h –1 ) with 100% selectivity.

  abstract     = {Disrupting homeostasis within tumor cells by interfering with their diverse metabolic pathways is an attractive tumor treatment method. However, current methods generally focus on one pathway within tumor cells, such as glycolysis or the glutamine (Gln) metabolic pathway, overlooking potential strong correlations between different cellular pathways and preventing a comprehensive blockade of the tumor energy supply, thereby compromising therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a photochemistry-activated peroxynitrite (ONOO – ) nanogenerator, capable of simultaneously inhibiting glycolysis and Gln metabolism in tumor cells, is proposed to achieve enhanced metabolic therapy. Specifically, the ONOO – nanogenerator is constructed by loading the thermally sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor BNN-6 onto dual-function Prussian blue (PB) nanocubes through electrostatic interaction, followed by coating with tumor cell membranes to achieve homologous targeting. Under near-infrared light irradiation, PB decomposes hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) to produce oxygen, while the converted heat induces BNN-6 decomposition to generate NO. Subsequently, NO reacts with oxygen to form nitrite, and then with H 2 O 2 to yield ONOO – under acidic conditions. ONOO – achieves simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and Gln metabolism through the nitration of key proteins. More importantly, the former effectively reduces lactate levels, and the latter increases Gln levels, which both, in turn, remodel the tumor microenvironment and stimulate a strong immune response. The in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that these changes significantly inhibited the growth and spread of primary and distant metastatic tumors in a mouse model. This approach takes advantage of tumor-specific physicochemical properties to enable localized and highly efficient ONOO – synthesis, offering promise for enhanced metabolic therapy.},

  abstract     = {Enzymes catalyze chemical reactions with remarkable rate enhancements and selectivity. Supramolecular catalysis seeks to understand and emulate these outcomes, leveraging noncovalent interactions, electric fields, and controlled active site microenvironments to enhance catalysis in an enzyme-like fashion. The effects of conformational dynamics on supramolecular catalysts and assemblies are, however, relatively unexplored, despite their crucial role in enzyme rate enhancement. Here, we elucidate the conformational landscape of a model M 4 L 4 supramolecular host through a rational approach: stabilizing a high-energy conformer through distal ligand modification and a transient intermediate state through symmetry-matched guest encapsulation, as well as tuning the conformer distribution through same-charge metal exchange at the host vertices. Each of these structural modifications induces a substantial shift in the host’s conformational landscape, offering insights into the rational design of conformationally dynamic cages and enzymes. Although the thermodynamic properties of the dynamic Ga 4 L 4 12– cage can be influenced by temperature, solvent, and guest binding, we find that conformational change occurs on a time scale that renders it rate-limiting in a model catalytic reaction, precluding rate enhancement through conformational selection. This concept is illustrated by locking the catalytically inactive conformer to a high-energy conformer that is catalytically competent. These findings demonstrate that precise modulation of the conformational landscape of supramolecular hosts provides an effective strategy for controlling their catalytic activity and binding.},

Synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that the structure of the new compound has polar hexagonal space group P 6 3 mc , representing an example of a previously unknown anti -Th 7 Fe 3 structure type. Measurements of the physical properties have shown that the material is a metallic conductor capable of emitting second-harmonic generation light. Ab initio calculations support experimental findings and reveal complex halogen–halogen interactions, anionic metallicity, anisotropic electronic structure, and the presence of Dirac and Weyl points at the Fermi level.

  abstract     = {The inherent flexibility of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs), stemming from weak interlayer interactions, often leads to structural disorder that significantly impacts their properties and functionality. However, this intrinsic, solvent-dependent flexibility and disorder pose considerable challenges for the fabrication, processing, and application of 2D COF membranes, hindering both the reproducibility of membrane synthesis and their long-term performance stability. In this work, we address these challenges by precisely controlling the number of methyl groups on the amine monomers, skillfully leveraging steric hindrance effects. Furthermore, we exploit the influence of solvent polarity on the solvent-mediated equilibria between stable and metastable states to synergistically tune the flexibility, disorder, and pore size of the 2D COF membranes. This approach simultaneously reduces the pore size and enhances the framework’s solvent resistance, yielding methyl-functionalized 2D COF membranes that demonstrate preserved permeability homogeneity across different solvent treatments while enabling highly efficient U/Th ion separation.},

In this study, we identified a hemicyanine derivative that is a potent paraptosis inducer in two cancer cell lines. This compound triggers hallmark paraptotic features, including ER swelling, mitochondrial morphological changes, increased superoxide production, and caspase-independent cell death. This activity is dependent on the ability of the probe to modify thiols covalently. Proteomic analysis using a biotinylated, activity-based probe revealed Sec23 homologue A and GDP-dissociation inhibitor alpha as potential targets implicated in paraptosis activation. This lead compound already displayed some degree of selectivity, exemplified by its minimal interaction with well-known nucleophilic protein targets such as protein disulfide isomerases. These findings establish the hemicyanine chemical family as a promising scaffold for paraptosis research and suggest potential as a therapeutic lead for diseases where traditional apoptosis pathways are dysregulated.},

Nevertheless, a significant challenge remains: the dynamic transformation pathways governing their structural evolution have remained elusive, severely impeding precise atomic-level control in NCs synthesis. Herein, we present a large conjugated quinoline thiol ligand with protonatable sites, which enables the systematic construction of seven structurally related Au 11–13 NCs. For the first time, this approach achieves continuous visualization of the total synthesis and core–shell evolution process from Au 11 to Au 13 NCs. Notably, we successfully synthesized and characterized a metastable corner-missing gold icosahedron Au 12 NC (Au@Au 11 ) as a key intermediate through crystallographic methods. These advancements provide unprecedented insights into the nucleation mechanism of classical icosahedral Au NCs, particularly by elucidating how ligand-shell modifications precisely influence geometric rearrangement, electronic structure, and functional performance. The stepwise reaction pathways demonstrated in the Au 11–13 NC series illustrate that metal NC synthesis can achieve organic chemistry-level precision when guided by strategic ligand engineering.},

Herein, this study delves into the complexities of Mn-based nanocatalysts, focusing on the impact of the Mn valence state in a test reaction converting sustainable syngas to aromatics-a process highly sensitive to the catalyst’s redox environment and active site characteristics. We conducted a thorough SAR analysis and discovered a direct correlation between the Sabatier effect, CO adsorption, and the space-time yields of aromatics. Notably, Mn in the +2-oxidation state emerged as the optimal valence for achieving the highest catalytic performance, with a maximum yield of 1.6 mmol·h –1 ·g cat –1 . Our findings provide critical insights into the role of the catalyst’s intrinsic properties in dictating the selectivity and efficiency of CO hydrogenation for the rational design of nanocatalysts that can sustainably transform small molecules into valuable chemicals and fuels.},

Herein, we demonstrate that wollastonite-bearing microdroplets prioritize defluorination over C–C scission in perfluoroalkyl chains through liquid–solid–gas triple-phase contact electrification. This process results in complete perfluorooctanoic acid mineralization with hardly detectable shorter-chain anionic PFAS byproducts, as confirmed by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Microdroplet-mediated weathering of wollastonite triggers the formation of CaF 2 –SiO 2 interfacial structures through Si–F–Ca bonding interactions, thereby enabling fluoride immobilization with negligible leaching. This work reveals that atmospheric clouds containing mineral particles intrinsically exhibit a self-cleansing capacity toward PFAS contaminants, advancing cloud-inspired interfacial engineering for next-generation water purification systems.},

In this study, we demonstrate the utility of lasso peptides as versatile scaffolds for the design of new therapeutics. A series of highly potent and selective dual αvβ6/8 inhibitors were engineered through a combination of epitope scanning, computational design, and directed evolution, whereby inhibition was fine-tuned for two out of the eight related RGD-integrin receptors. NMR structures of two lasso peptide dual integrin inhibitors are provided. Facile conjugation chemistry with a small-molecule albumin binder afforded half-life extended lasso peptide analogs, including 19 , which was fully characterized and shown to robustly and durably halt growth and regress anti-mPD-1-resistant ovarian and triple negative breast cancer tumors in mice when dosed in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor. These studies show that dual inhibition of αvβ6/8 integrins expressed in the TME represents an auspicious tumor-specific strategy to overcome TGF-β-driven resistance and enhance the antitumor efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our ability to produce lasso peptides with high titers in fermenters has enabled the first detailed demonstration of their drug-like properties, including tunable in vivo pharmacokinetics and efficacy, thus paving the way for future advances using this promising modality derived from nature.},

  abstract     = {A collection of mechanophores was computationally studied using the extended artificial force induced reaction (EX-AFIR) method, which utilizes two different sets of forces to determine the activation force level ( F act ) practically and efficiently. Identifying a mechanophore’s F act is a focus of mechanochemistry. As have been done in an existing framework, we generated the Δ G τ ‡ – F τ curve, where F τ is the value of external force and Δ G τ ‡ denotes the force-coupled free energy barrier of a specific reaction under F τ . Such a curve is then used to determine the F act of a certain mechanophore when combined with the Eyring equation. Although generating such a Δ G τ ‡ – F τ curve was tough because locating the force-coupled transition states is time-consuming, the extended AFIR method allowed an efficient exploration of all the relevant transition states on the force-modified potential energy surface (FMPES). The EX-AFIR method was later applied to study the problems encountered in current polymer mechanochemistry research, deriving a concept of “node” which could be used for the design of thermostable mechanophores. The first-ever case study of cubane using EX-AFIR is a vivid example of how the fully automated search of possible reaction pathways on the FMPES is facilitated. Furthermore, it also provided insights into the further design and application of unconventional mechanophores.},

For instance, Fe-based materials have been widely investigated for various electrocatalytic reactions, e.g., CO 2 electroreduction (CO 2 RR). However, the precise role of Fe in the catalytic mechanism remains debated and is under extensive investigation due to the complex properties of those catalysts. Herein, we successfully construct a series of monolayer Fe clusters (ML-Fe) on a single-crystal Au(111) substrate via vapor deposition under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions, which serve as model catalysts for CO 2 RR. Notably, the size of Fe clusters can be tuned at the atomic scale (∼2 nm) as observed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Experimental and theoretical calculations demonstrate that ML-Fe achieves >60% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for CO production during CO 2 RR. When the Fe layer further increases to form nanoparticles, Fe sites exhibit stronger electron interaction and binding strength with *CO intermediates, consequently shifting the dominant reaction pathway from CO 2 RR to hydrogen evolution (HER). This work could provide valuable insights into designing model catalysts with well-defined active sites to investigate the structure–activity relationships in diverse electrocatalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {The long-sought goal of dinitrogen (N 2 ) fixation chemistry is to effect facile synthesis of nitrogen-containing chemicals directly from N 2 . To date, electrophilic attack of coordinated N 2 ligands of transition metal dinitrogen complexes represents the most straightforward route to construct nitrogen-element bonds. Although electrophilic functionalization of monodinitrogen complexes to furnish diazenido and hydrazido species has been well-documented, for those complexes containing multiple N 2 moieties, analogous reactions invariably lead to N 2 extrusion and at most one N 2 can be derivatized. Herein, we describe electrophilic functionalization of a mononuclear formal chromium(−I) bis-dinitrogen complex supported by a PCP-pincer ligand. Specifically, treatment with TMSCl (TMS = SiMe 3 ) results in silylation of its two N 2 ligands and clean formation of a Cr(IV) complex bearing a diazenido and a hydrazido unit en route from a Cr(II) bis-diazenido intermediate, alongside a Cr(IV) monohydrazido species in a 1:1 ratio. This is the first time that functionalization of two N 2 ligands on a single metal center has been realized. In contrast, the reaction using TMSOTf instead of TMSCl as the electrophile generates a Cr(III) hydrazido complex. On the basis of detailed analyses of the electronic structure evolution during the trisilylation reaction using highly correlated wave function-based ab initio approaches, we identify a necessary condition for functionalization of two N 2 ligands, viz., bis-dinitrogen complexes ought to feature noncompetitive eight-electron M-(N 2 ) 2 π-backdonation. To satisfy this requirement, how to design appropriate dinitrogen complexes to effect this challenging transformation is discussed.},

  abstract     = {Sugars are produced by living organisms, and are required building blocks for life as we know it, which raises the foundational question of how sugars formed in a prebiotic environment. The abiotic formose reaction produces sugars from formaldehyde, but our understanding of its initiation step remains murky, with chemists invoking the concept of an “activated aldehyde” to seed this reaction. Singlet hydroxycarbenes, high-energy isomers of aldehydes, were recently reported to facilitate sugar formation under cold, nonaqueous conditions relevant to interstellar environments. We generate singlet methylhydroxycarbene ( 1 CH 3 –C̈–OH) from the photodissociation of pyruvic acid and experimentally measure its gas-phase reaction with d 4 -acetaldehyde using multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometry. The C 4 H 4 D 4 O 2 isomer d 4 -acetoin is the sole product, which we kinetically link to the reactant CH 3 –C̈–OH, and attribute to a carbonyl-ene formation mechanism. We see no evidence of 3-hydroxybutanal, the C–H insertion product expected in carbene chemistry. Using automated exploration we calculate stationary points on the potential energy surface and report master equation rate coefficients from T = 20–600 K, providing quantitative kinetics of this fast reaction for use in chemical models. The prereactive complex in this reaction is stabilized by both hydrogen bonding and electrophilic carbene C═O interactions. These effects create a short-range dynamical bottleneck for the reaction besides the long- and midrange barrierless bottlenecks. Combined with recent reports of 1 HC̈OH production from methanol photodissociation and pyruvic acid production in cold irradiated ices, this work provides evidence that singlet hydroxycarbene + aldehyde chemistry is a feasible path to prebiotic sugar formation.},

  abstract     = {Depression disrupts central nervous system function and may further elevate the risk of systemic diseases by triggering inflammatory responses. However, the precise mechanisms underlying its role in driving inflammation remain elusive. Adenosine (Ado), a critical molecule in depression, exhibits abnormal concentration changes that are closely associated with neuroinflammation. Thus, precise imaging of adenosine in the whole brain is essential for unraveling the mechanisms linking depression and inflammatory responses. However, current biosensors face limitations in whole-brain adenosine imaging. To address this limitation, a fluorescent nanoprobe with high spatiotemporal resolution was developed. The nanoprobe incorporates a targeting unit consisting of ferrocene-containing aptamers and phospholipid vesicles, ensuring excellent blood–brain barrier (BBB) penetration and high specificity for adenosine detection. Additionally, the nanoprobe features a near-infrared (NIR)-activated light-switching unit, enabling precise and real-time imaging of adenosine dynamics. The results revealed that adenosine activates the A 2A receptor (A 2A R) and downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway, inducing the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by microglia and driving neuroinflammation. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the blood of depressed mice further suggest that depression may exacerbate systemic disease risk via peripheral inflammation. In summary, this nanoprobe not only achieves high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of adenosine in the brain but also serves as a powerful tool for elucidating the inflammatory mechanisms linking depression to systemic diseases.},

This was first revealed by measuring the solid-state 2 H NMR spectra of a single crystal of {[Co III (D 2 bim) 3 ](TMA)·20D 2 O} n ( 1′ ), which revealed distinct hierarchical peaks of H 2 O H-bonding interactions. In addition, the frozen WMCs in 1 exhibit a premelting state, retaining some ice structures, just before melting through a first-order phase transition during the heating process. Measurements of the spin–lattice relaxation time ( T 1 ) in solid-state 2 H NMR revealed rapid rotation motions for water molecules in these premelting WMCs, resulting in a correlation time τ closer to that of bulk liquid water.},

  abstract     = {Supported chromia catalysts have been commercially used in propane dehydrogenation, which relies on Cr loading at weight fractions of up to 20 wt %. This leads to problems in managing spent catalysts with a high content of toxic chromium species. These catalysts also rapidly deactivate within 10–15 min, requiring frequent regeneration in each cycle. To overcome these problems, we developed a siliceous MFI zeolite with an ultralow Cr content (e.g., 0.09 wt %) that exhibits high activity and durability for propane dehydrogenation. A mechanism study revealed that the chromic hydroxyl species readily dissociated the C–H bonds, accelerating the rapid desorption of propylene products and resulting in a slow deactivation rate. Therefore, the catalyst lifetime can be prolonged to more than 30 days under mild operating conditions (525 °C).},

  abstract     = {The development of unnatural base pairs (UBPs) has expanded the genetic alphabet, resulting in a tremendous increase in the information capacity and function diversity of DNA. Efficient amplification of DNA containing UBPs is crucial for the broad use of the UBPs. As one of the major methods for DNA amplification, rolling circle amplification has been extensively employed in many fields ranging from biotechnology to DNA nanotechnology. Herein, we explored and revealed the good efficiency and fidelity of the phi29 DNA polymerase for replicating a representative UBP, dNaM-dTPT3, and its analogues. Based on this, we established the method of rolling circle amplification with an expanded genetic alphabet (ExRCA), together with several strategies for preparing the circular templates for ExRCA. We next demonstrated the application of ExRCA for the mass production or amplification of single- and double-stranded DNAs containing an unnatural base or UBP, as well as the use of the single-stranded DNA product for constructing a site-specifically labeled DNA tetrahedron. The great application potential of ExRCA in biotechnology and materials science of DNA was further demonstrated by utilizing ExRCA to develop an ultrasensitive method for biomolecule detection, DNA hydrogels site-specifically loaded with various cargos, programmable multivalent aptaprobes, a fine-tuned DNA cascade catalyst, and a functional DNA hydrogel with site-specific cross-links. This work not only offers an efficient method for isothermal amplification of DNA containing unnatural nucleobases but also exhibits the unique value of the UBPs with natural-like replication efficiency in constructing DNA materials with increased number of building blocks and programmable functionalities.},

Being membrane embedded receptors, they are more challenging for structural characterization, and at present, we only have a small number of X-ray and cryo-EM structures for P2X7 bound to antagonists. We demonstrate that saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR on live mammalian cells (on-cell STD NMR) overexpressing P2X7 receptors allows further structural insight on the complexes of P2X7 with two potent negative allosteric modulators, namely, AZ10606120 and JNJ-47965567, via the determination of the binding epitope mapping of the interactions, e.g., the main region of contact between the ligand and the binding pocket. This approach, reported for the first time on membrane-embedded ion channels, in combination with molecular docking, allows us to propose the first NMR-validated ligand binding models for two antagonists as bound to human P2X7 receptors and to correlate the structural knowledge acquired with the pharmacology data. We highlight the transformative potential of this application to aid drug design efforts in a less resource-demanding fashion than X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, and we envisage on-cell STD NMR to fast become an asset for structure–activity relationship studies helping knowledge-based development of efficient drugs targeting P2X7 and other ion channels/membrane-embedded proteins.},

  abstract     = {The red-emitting cyanine dye Cy5 is widely used in single-molecule imaging, but its utility is limited by triplet-state accumulation. This state facilitates energy transfer to molecular oxygen, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to photobleaching. The triplet state also causes the dye’s fluorescence intermittency and introduces temporal noise. Furthermore, Cy5 in this state is susceptible to nucleophilic attacks in cellular environments, resulting in an inactive off-state. To address these challenges, we engineered a series of phenyl-substituted meso-Cy5 derivatives to suppress intersystem crossing (ISC) and effectively reduce the triplet-state population. Theoretical calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy validated the suppression of ISC in these derivatives. Our lead compound, Cy5-N, featuring an electron-withdrawing nitro modification on the phenyl group, demonstrated a 790% increase in photostability and a 2.3-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to conventional Cy5 in single-molecule imaging. Notably, Cy5-N maintained continuous emission even in the presence of the nucleophile β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), indicating robust resistance to nucleophilic attacks. Using Cy5-N, we successfully performed long-term single-molecule tracking of membrane proteins in live U2OS cells, with enhanced SNR. This study introduces a novel molecular design strategy for enhancing cyanine dye performance in single-molecule imaging, offering substantial improvements in photostability and SNR with broad implications for bioimaging and sensing technologies.},

LLM-EO demonstrates advantages in few-sample learning due to the intrinsic chemical knowledge embedded within LLMs and their ability to leverage entire historical data collected during optimizations. Through natural language instructions, LLM-EO offers enhanced accessibility for multiobjective optimizations, potentially lowering barriers for experimental chemists without extensive programming expertise. As generative models, LLM-EO possesses the capability to propose novel ligands and TMCs with unique chemical properties by amalgamating both internal knowledge and external chemistry data, thus combining the benefits of efficient optimization and generation. With advancements in LLMs, both in their capacity as pretrained foundational models and new strategies in post-training inference, we anticipate broad applications of LLM-EO in chemistry and materials design.},

Here, we present the first circularly polarized light emission (CPL) from a chiral molecule exhibiting an inverted singlet–triplet gap. Our design is based on the achiral heptazine core, functionalized with chiral substituents. Computational screening confirmed that the inversion of the singlet–triplet gap is retained upon derivatization. Photophysical characterization, including temperature-dependent optical spectra and photoluminescence decay profiles, supported by computational results, confirms the inverted gap in both achiral and chiral derivatives. Chiroptical properties show dissymmetry factor g lum values (≈ 10 –3 ) comparable to other chromophores functionalized with chiral groups. Combined with promising photoluminescence quantum yields, these findings highlight the potential of such materials for circularly polarized OLED devices.},

The selective 6e – /6H + reduction of N 2 contrasts with a previous report of an analogous complex with propanethiolate ligands that could reduce N 2 by 4e – /4H + to N 2 H 4 .},

  abstract     = {Two methods, designed primarily for applications in diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS), are introduced. The first is a Cu–H-catalyzed multicomponent process that involves a nitrile and a trisubstituted allenyl boronate. The first set of products are homoallylic α-secondary NH 2 -amines, containing a trisubstituted alkenyl boronate, formed with >98% enantiospecificity, in up to >98:2 dr and as a single alkene isomer (>98% Z ). The second method is efficient and diastereoselective triflic anhydride-mediated conversion of an unsaturated azapane-amide, generated from modification of the products of the foregoing catalytic process to azabicyclooctanes (ABCOs). The ABCOs contain a bridged enamine moiety and a trisubstituted alkene, which can be functionalized chemo- and stereoselectively. Accordingly, natural product-like rigid bicyclic frameworks can be obtained wherein four different fragments can be installed in space in a controllable fashion.},

A key requirement for these pursuits is achieving control over local crystallographic and magnetic structure, usually through sample morphology (such as synthesis of bulk crystals versus thin films) and application of magnetic or electric fields. Here we show that V 1/3 NbS 2 can be crystallized in two ordered superlattices, distinguished by the periodicity of out-of-plane magnetic intercalants. Whereas one of these structures is metallic and displays the hallmarks of altermagnetism, the other superlattice, which has not been isolated before in this family of intercalation compounds, is a semimetallic noncollinear antiferromagnet that may enable access to topologically nontrivial properties. This observation of an unconventional superlattice structure establishes a powerful route for tailoring the tremendous array of magnetic and electronic behaviors hosted in related materials and may expand their use in low-power spintronic or topological quantum devices.},

While plastics circularity has emerged as a key strategy to reduce plastic waste and impacts, current mechanical recycling pathways face major limitations in maintaining material quality over repeated cycles. Advanced methods like chemical recycling and dissolution show promise but raise questions about environmental impacts, scalability, and cost. In this perspective, we introduce the concept of spirality as a more realistic model than perfect circularity, acknowledging the inevitable degradation of plastic quality over consecutive recycling cycles and the need for tiered recycling strategies. We emphasize the importance of early stage integration of mechanical property benchmarking, life cycle assessment (LCA), and techno-economic analysis (TEA) to evaluate emerging chemistry-enabled solutions for plastics recycling. In parallel, we underscore the critical role of high-quality data, and the need for multidisciplinary collaboration to align chemistry, materials science, engineering, systems analyses, and policy for sustainable transitions. Spirality, combined with robust assessment frameworks, can guide innovation toward more pragmatic and sustainable solutions in polymer design and end-of-life management.},

Despite the vast chemical space of potential organic cations, many remain incompatible with conventional aqueous solution synthesis, which leads to thermodynamically stable non-2D-perovskite structures or introduces chemical reactivity issues. Here, we present a room-temperature evaporation-induced crystallization approach using a mixed organic–aqueous solvent system for the exploratory synthesis of 2D perovskites. This method is compatible with an extended range of organic cations, enabling the facile discovery of 25 new 2D perovskites, including 16 that are either kinetically stable or inaccessible with the conventional method. The expanded 2D perovskite library reveals the critical role of intermolecular interactions between the organic cations in stabilizing the kinetically stable 2D perovskite structures. Moreover, the as-grown crystals exhibit near-intrinsic free exciton emission with significantly reduced defect emissions and exciton diffusion coefficients enhanced by up to 5-fold, approaching the intrinsic transport limits governed by exciton–phonon scattering. This work not only broadens the design space of organic cations for 2D perovskites but also establishes a general synthetic strategy for growing high-quality 2D perovskite crystals, which are essential for high-performance optoelectronics.},

We first examine how the introduction of N:, NH, and C═O groups changes the shape of the relaxed interaction energy curve for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. These heteroatom effects are shown to be (1) additive; (2) dependent primarily on the orientation of the heteroatom(s) relative to the displacement axis; and (3) driven by electrostatic effects. We then introduce a simple conceptual model to make sense of these results based on the interaction of a local dipole associated with each heteroatom with the electric field of the other aromatic system. Finally, we demonstrate how this model can be applied to complex parallel stacked dimers as well as T-shaped interactions, providing a way to make sense of heteroatom effects in π–π interactions without computations.},

However, a comprehensive analysis of the surfaceome remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the high hydrophobicity and low abundance of these proteins. Here, we developed a novel cell surface profiling approach, tyrosinase-mediated cell surface labeling (TYRCSL). Tyrosinase can mildly oxidize a phenol or catechol to the corresponding o -quinone, which rapidly reacts with available protein nucleophiles. Leveraging the fast-labeling kinetics (within 1 min) and minimal toxicity of this method, we explored surfaceome dynamics during early stages of influenza A virus (IAV) entry. Our findings reveal that cell surface proteins PODXL2, CNTNAP1, and GPR39 play a crucial role in virus binding and internalization, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of IAV entry. TYRCSL shows the potential to be applied to the system-wide study of the entry process across a spectrum of pathogens and other instantaneous surfaceome changes under various stimuli.},

This study presents a general oxygen-vacancy anchoring strategy for preparing oxide-based 4d/5d transition metal single-atom 2D materials as efficient and robust OER catalysts. In a typical synthesis, Keggin-structure polyoxometalate [PW 12 O 40 ] 3– clusters decompose into tetrahedral WO 4 2– anions, which in situ adhere to the newly nucleated metal (Co, Fe, Ni) hydroxide (M(OH) x ) due to the latter’s abundant oxygen vacancies, ensuring a uniform distribution of W single atoms. The anchoring of W stabilizes the ultrathin structure, resulting in the annealed W-Co 3 O 4 exhibiting a specific surface area 5–7 times greater than that of pure Co 3 O 4 , even though W has three times the atomic weight of Co. Moreover, the strengthened adsorption of OH induced by W breaks the surface structural integrity of Co 3 O 4 to form a highly active oxyhydroxide, while the increased distortion in Co–O octahedrons further enhances the intrinsic activity. As a result, the catalyst shows a low η 10 of 261 mV in alkaline media, 84 mV lower than that of pure Co 3 O 4 , and an excellent stability of over 290 h. This places it among the best OER catalysts, particularly in comparison to low-activity Ni or -unstable NiFe alternatives.},

Generally, stoichiometric quantities of activating reagents, (tri)phosgene and its derivatives, or CO are commonly used in the literature to construct such scaffolds, which represent the drawbacks of these approaches. As such, we herein report a new series of salt-stabilized carbamoylzinc pivalates prepared from the corresponding formamides through C–H metalation in the presence of TMPLi (TMP = 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidyl) and Zn(OPiv) 2 . These carbamoylzinc pivalates are obtained as powders with high air and moisture stability under ambient conditions. They also show excellent reactivity in palladium-catalyzed C–S-selective Negishi carbamoylation and copper-catalyzed electrophilic amination, thiolation, and selenolation, thus unlocking a new platform to access functionalized amides, unsymmetric ureas, thiocarbamates, and selenocarbamates through C–H zincation and C–C or C–heteroatom coupling reactions in a sustainable manner.

  abstract     = {Enzymes that catalyze the same reaction yet bear no structural resemblance challenge the view that fold dictates function. Here, we probe whether intraprotein electrostatics are a unifying factor in such cases of enzyme catalysis. Focusing on chorismate mutase (CM), a textbook case of electrostatic catalysis found in two structurally unrelated families (AroH and AroQ), we ask (i) whether disparate scaffolds can converge on a common catalytic electric field, and (ii) whether a single reaction can be accelerated by distinct electrostatic fields. Molecular dynamics simulations for six CMs, followed by tensor-based clustering of the three-dimensional electric field (EF), revealed that AroH and AroQ enzymes sample conformations whose active site EFs are nearly identical, eliminating a one-to-one link between tertiary structure and catalytic EF. QM/MM calculations showed a strong linear correlation ( R 2 > 0.8) between differential substrate–protein electrostatic interaction energy and reaction barrier, demonstrating that the active site EF controls catalytic activity. Nevertheless, enzyme conformations with highly dissimilar fields often displayed indistinguishable barriers, implying multiple electrostatic “solutions” to catalyzing the Claisen rearrangement in CMs. Through statistical analysis of the features of the electron density, distinct field-bond strategies emerged, each reallocating charge along different “electronic lever arms” to selectively stabilize the transition state through electrostatic interactions. Together, the results reframe electrostatic catalysis as a modular design space: a desired EF can be retrofitted onto diverse scaffolds, and concurrently several field-bond blueprints can deliver high catalytic efficiency. This shift from fold-based to field-based design supplies a fresh and transferable vocabulary for data-driven enzyme engineering to access novel chemistry.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable batteries with metal anodes promise superior energy storage; however, dendrite formation poses risks to safety and stability. Conventional methods to inhibit dendrite growth in zinc-based batteries (ZBs) are partially effective and may compromise their performance. Herein, a unique artificial protrusion strategy (APS) is proposed involving the mechanical incorporation of Zn powder particles on the surface of zincophilic metals. This method guides Zn 2+ ions to preferentially obtain electrons on the Zn powders and allows nucleation and growth on the more energetically favorable substrate surface, demonstrating a horizontal-diffusion mechanism of Zn nucleation on the anode surface and steering the subsequent nuclei growth to undergo uniform Zn deposition. The resulting dendrite-free Zn anode extends the Zn symmetrical cell lifespan to nearly 5000 h in the coin cell configuration, notably superior to the reported performance. Additionally, the Zn–I 2 and Zn–MnO 2 pouch cells achieve notable capacities of 480 mAh (3000 h) and 1.8 Ah over multiple cycles, respectively. These results mark a significant advance toward resolving dendrite-related issues through anode structural design, paving the way for future sustainable development.},

  abstract     = {The photochemistry of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) plays a crucial role in the Earth’s atmosphere. In contrast to the well-established photochemistry of free SO 2 , the electronic properties and reactivity of SO 2 complexes with other atmospherically relevant gas molecules are barely known. Herein, we demonstrate that the photochemistry of SO 2 can be dramatically influenced by the first formation of charge-transfer (CT) prereaction complexes through intermolecular chalcogen bonds. Specifically, the prototype sulfur–sulfur bonded complex between SO 2 and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) displays a strong CT absorption at 290 nm, and photoexcitation of the complex at this CT band furnishes the elusive thiosulfurous acid (HSS(O)OH), which is a missing intermediate in the Claus sulfur recovery process. Similar charge-transfer mediated photochemistry is also applicable to the chalcogen-bonded complexes of SO 2 with the atmospherically important volatile organic sulfur compounds dimethylsulfide and methanethiol, from which sulfinic acids form efficiently through photolytic SO 2 -insertion along with concerted hydrogen atom transfer. This work highlights the pivotal role of intermolecular chalcogen bonds influencing the photochemistry of SO 2 due to the formation of photolabile charge-transfer complexes as prereaction intermediates.},

The resulting Ag 2 Se-CdSe nanocomposites exhibit a reproducible, stable figure of merit ( zT ) of 1.04 between 300 and 390 K.

  abstract     = {Quantifying whether the charges created by molecular doping of organic semiconductors reside in localized versus mobile states is important to understanding doping mechanisms of organic semiconductors. Nevertheless, such quantification remains challenging, as it typically requires Hall effect measurements or specialized equipment. Here, we quantify the mobile and localized charge concentrations in molecularly doped conjugated polymers using spectroelectrochemical calibration, which we cross-validate by applying X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and Hall effect measurements and by fitting to established transport models. As a test case, we study doping with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) in two different polymers: poly[2,5-bis(3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2- b ]thiophene] (PBTTT) and (poly(bithiophene-thienothiophene) derivative modified with a triethylene glycol side chain (Pg2T-TT). In PBTTT, we find that at most ∼10% of the carriers become mobile once carrier concentrations reach ∼3 × 10 20 cm –3 (∼0.4 molar ratio of F4TCNQ:thiophene). In contrast, when using Pg2T-TT, we find that the mobile fraction exceeds 50% at carrier concentrations of ∼3 × 10 20 cm –3 (∼0.1 of the F4TCNQ molar ratio). Not only are these results consistent with Hall effect measurements, but they agree with an analysis of the semilocalized transport (SLoT) model. We fit the SLoT model and extract the depth of potential well in combination with Fermi-level measurements via scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. These fits further indicate that Pg2T-TT reaches delocalized transport conditions while transport in PBTTT remains localized. This work provides a straightforward platform for quantifying charge localization in molecularly doped conjugated polymers by providing explicit parameters governing the charge transport, including carrier concentration, mobility, and the fraction of mobile carriers.},

  abstract     = {Tropolones are the core of numerous remarkable bioactive natural products, such as stipitatic acid and eupenifeldin. The key step of the biosynthetic pathways of tropolones is the ring expansion of a six-membered ring. TropC is the first identified enzyme capable of catalyzing the tropolone ring expansion process, which belongs to the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (α-KGD) family. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this enzymatic process remains elusive. Here, we present biochemical evidence indicating that SpoC, an enzyme closely related to TropC, also catalyzes ring expansion to construct the tropolone core with stringent catalytic specificity. Molecular insight into the oxidative rearrangement mechanism of SpoC has been demonstrated through stable isotope labeling, protein mass spectrometry, crystallographic analyses, mutagenesis studies, and quantum mechanical calculations. These findings support an intriguing radical ring expansion mechanism facilitated by imine-assisted monodentate coordination of the substrate to an oxo-iron center, enabling an efficient radical ring expansion reaction. This understanding is essential for the synthesis of various tropolone-containing natural products, pharmaceuticals, and functional materials with unique properties.},

  abstract     = {Electronic responses of glasses under extreme pressures differ from those of crystalline analogs. Their distinct electronic environments are found in network formers with well-defined, covalent-bonded coordination environments (e.g., [4] Si and [4] Al) and in network modifiers with more disordered, ionic-bonded configurations (e.g., [5,6,7] Ca). Deciphering the evolution of the bonding environment of network modifier cations upon compression provides atomic insights into the pressure-driven hardening and transport properties of glasses. Despite the importance, in contrast to extensive efforts to uncover how network formers behave under pressure, considerable structural disorder around network modifiers makes it challenging to probe their electronic bonding environments under compression. Our understanding of the evolution of network modifiers above megabars is currently absent. Here, we report a discovery of highly densified electronic configurations of network modifier Ca in aluminate glass under extreme compression via the first inelastic X-ray scattering at the Ca L -edge up to 140 GPa. As evidenced by the prominent pressure-driven increases in electronic dispersion and delocalization, densified calcium environments are characterized by a decreased average Ca–O distance, the formation of highly coordinated calcium, a broader distribution of topological variables, and a greater distortion of Ca polyhedra above megabars. The spectral features for the Ca environments reveal significant electronic and bonding modifications, including pressure-driven increases in the ligand field interaction, the covalence characteristic of the Ca–O bond, and the electron–hole Coulomb interaction. These densification paths identify the electronic adaptation of network modifiers above megabars, shedding light on the origins of enhanced electron transport and the electron-storing capacity of glasses under pressure.},

Furthermore, Moiré patterns were observed in the superstacking of exfoliated COF films with the twisted angle varying from 6.4 to 69.7°. Individual sets of 2D COF single crystals in the Moiré superstructures were clearly identified by TEM with a resolution of 1.6 Å.

  abstract     = {Singlet fission (SF) is a spin-allowed photophysical process that generates two triplet excited states for one absorbed photon. It therefore has the potential to boost solar cell efficiencies beyond the 33% detailed balance limit. A better understanding of through-space and through-bond electronic coupling in SF, and their interplay, is essential for practical applications of SF materials. We have therefore designed three structurally complex pentacene dimers, two of which contain additional subphthalocyanines (SubPcs). These dimers, on the one hand, provide a continuum of electronic coupling and, on the other hand, mimic the complex situation present in the solid state, where a myriad of different packing interactions exist. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations helped to shed light on the structure-property relationships of these dimers. We employed both steady-state absorption and emission spectroscopy and transient absorption pump-probe experiments to unravel the excited-state dynamics. The SubPcs complement the characteristics of pentacenes and act as light-harvesting antennae that funnel quantitatively the excitation energy via intramolecular Förster resonance energy transfer to the pentacene dimers to realize panchromatic absorption. The latter are subsequently subject to intramolecular SF ( i -SF). The formation of the correlated triplet-pair 1 (T 1 T 1 ) intermediate occurs with rates and yields that are directly proportional to the interpentacene electronic coupling. In contrast, the yield of uncorrelated triplet excited states (T 1 + T 1 ) is indirectly proportional to the interpentacene electronic coupling. Thus, the three dimers demonstrate the decisive role of electronic coupling in i -SF and how to control it. They serve as textbook examples for the opposing dependencies of formation and decoherence of 1 (T 1 T 1 ) on the electronic coupling.},

While the function of AbmM has been demonstrated, the underlying mechanism regarding the formation of the radical intermediates during the reaction pathway remains to be fully established. To gain additional insight into this vital step in the biosynthesis of albomycin δ 2 , 2′-deoxy-2′-methylidene CDP was synthesized as a mechanistic probe. Upon incubation with AbmM and dithionite, a C1′ radical intermediate is generated from this mechanistic probe in the form of an allylic radical that can be trapped via oxidation to a sulfinate or a sulfenate versus reduction. Moreover, incubation of 2′-deoxy-2′-spirocyclopropryl CDP with AbmM also leads to a C1′ radical intermediate that triggers opening of the cyclopropane ring. In this case, however, the resulting C7′ terminal radical is not directly quenched but instead adds to the C5═C6 double bond of the cytosine base to form a new C7′–C6 bond. Taken together, these studies establish the intermediacy of a C1′ radical species and thus suggest radical propagation from the C4′ radical to the C1′ radical through cleavage of the C1′–O bond prior to the sulfur insertion step during the AbmM-catalyzed reaction.},

The proper choice of a chiral thiourea catalyst in combination with N -hydroxyl phthalimides proved to be crucial to success. Mechanistic studies indicate that the reaction is likely initiated by activation of sulfonium ylides by hydrogen bonding, thus distinct from previous related cases using chiral phosphoric acid catalysis that involves initial protonation of the basic sulfonium ylide functionality.

However, oxygen inhibition remains a key challenge, requiring either complex deoxygenation methods or in situ oxygen-scavenging strategies. Here, we report a red light-driven, fully oxygen-tolerant reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization mediated by methylene blue (MB + ) as a photosensitizer and triethanolamine (TEOA) as an electron donor. This operationally simple method enables polymerization in fully open-to-air vials without stirring, even under direct sunlight, underscoring the robustness and accessibility of the system. Using MB + in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, the polymerization proceeds to high monomer conversions (>90%), with excellent temporal control, predictable molecular weights, and low dispersities ( Đ < 1.3) across a wide range of conditions. The system is compatible with a broad scope of hydrophilic (meth)acrylamide and (meth)acrylate monomers, including those bearing charged and zwitterionic side groups. Notably, this methodology enables access to ultrahigh molecular weight (UHMW, >1,000,000) polymers under ambient conditions, an outcome rarely achieved in oxygen-tolerant RDRP. This metal-free, red light-driven photoRAFT platform offers a scalable, efficient, and biocompatible strategy for controlled polymer synthesis, with potential applications in bioconjugation, functional coatings, and high-throughput screening.},

  abstract     = {Further advancement in the research area of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is in urgent need of structural information with high accuracy. The bottleneck in characterization is the lack of effective strategies to resolve the complex features (e.g., the stacking sequence) of hierarchical structures. Herein, we establish an NMR crystallographic protocol to systematically and precisely measure multinuclear distances through advanced dipolar recoupling techniques, such as rotational echo double resonance (REDOR), double quantum–single quantum (DQ–SQ), and rotational echo adiabatic passage double resonance (REAPDOR) experiments. For the first time, we obtained the atomic distances of 1 H– 1 H, 1 H– 19 F, and 13 C– 19 F within the monolayer, two adjacent layers, and three consecutive layers of a two-dimensional (2D) COF, TPPA-F 4 . Based on these key parameters with an accuracy of 0.10 Å, the structural features of TPPA-F 4 COF, including the covalent connection, intralayer conformation, interlayer distance, the direction and distances of the layer offsets, and stacking mode, have been de novo determined in detail. Moreover, the generality of this NMR crystallographic approach was verified by solving the crystal structure of a selective deuterium-labeled TPPA- d 4 COF via 1 H– 2 H distance measurements. We expect that the NMR crystallographic protocol paves new ways not only for the structural determination of complex 3D COFs but also for the investigation of the crystallization process and dynamic behaviors of COFs with high spatiotemporal resolution. In addition, the selective deuteration strategy developed herein enabled the first NMR measurement of 1 H– 2 H distances in materials research, which may find broad applications for the characterization of weak interactions in solids.},

While traditional approaches rely on ring assembly strategies, direct functionalization of simpler cyclic precursors offers an attractive alternative to substituted building blocks. We report a photocatalytic transannular ketone migration strategy that converts 1,1-disubstituted acylcycloheptanes into 1,4-disubstituted products under mild conditions, promoted by sodium decatungstate and thiol cocatalysts under light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation. The process operates via reversible hydrogen atom abstraction and donation at multiple sites within the ring, followed by site-selective migration via radical addition and β-scission at the exocyclic carbonyl group. This dynamic kinetic approach to site-selective C–H functionalization provides regioselective access to densely substituted seven-membered rings, addressing a longstanding gap in synthetic methodology.},

As a result of its importance, there have been numerous studies of the ultrafast photochemical dynamics of tryptophan. Nonetheless, these studies have not identified the pathway to the triplet state, which competes with fluorescence emission. Here, we combine femtosecond-to-microsecond time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to explore the photochemical pathway from the UV excitation of tryptophan in aqueous solution to the population of the triplet state and its subsequent relaxation. We observe prompt formation of cations and solvated electrons consistent with autoionization to form a cation-electron ion pair. We find that the cation-electron ion pair subsequently decays with time scales that match the fluorescence lifetime of tryptophan in aqueous solution, indicative of a dynamic equilibrium between the fluorescent state and the cation-electron ion pair. We also find that population of the triplet state occurs on the same time scale as the decay of the cation-electron ion pair and fluorescence, indicating that the triplet state is populated either by recombination of a separated cation and electron after a spin flip or by intersystem crossing from the fluorescent state. Regardless of which mechanism dominates, population of the triplet state of tryptophan is governed by the dynamic equilibrium between the fluorescent state and the cation-electron ion pair.},

A series of stiff-stilbene lactones with varying linker lengths were synthesized and systematically evaluated for their polymerization behavior. The resulting polymers exhibit tunable thermal and optical properties, with select derivatives displaying liquid crystalline behavior, and can be depolymerized to recover the original monomers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations offer insights into the crucial role of Z / E photoisomerization in governing the polymerization and depolymerization process. This photoswitchable ROP system provides a new paradigm for designing sustainable polymers materials with adaptable and responsive properties.},

  abstract     = {Achieving high performance and long-term stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) typically requires the use of surface passivation layers to suppress the interfacial defects. However, these additional passivation agents often introduce chemical and structural instabilities, limiting the device lifetime. Here, we present a molecular engineering strategy utilizing a chiral series of C 60 -Furan-Sugar (CFS) fullerene derivatives blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to modify the electron transport layer (ETL). The incorporation of CFSs significantly enhances the electron mobility and dielectric constant of the ETL, while their intrinsic passivation functionality effectively passivates perovskite surface defects. As a result, PSCs employing PCBM:CFS- RS blends achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.81% without the use of additional passivation layers and retain 95% of their initial performance after 1000 h of aging. Notably, CFS- RS is a chiral molecule bearing a side chain with R/S configurational isomers, which facilitates interfacial compatibility and contributes to the enhanced device performance. This work demonstrates that tuning the orientation of polar substituents in fullerene side chains can effectively influence the optoelectronic properties of the blended films, thereby simultaneously enhancing both efficiency and stability in PSCs.},

Here, we develop a mechanochemical NH 3 –silicon (Si) reaction that enables high-purity H 2 production under mild conditions (50.0 °C) without further separation. Utilizing dynamic mechanical actions, the mechanochemical NH 3 –Si (MAS) reaction realized 100.0% NH 3 conversion, 100.0% H 2 purity, and a fast H 2 production rate of 102.5 mmol h –1 . The process simultaneously produced high-value silicon nitride (Si 3 N 4 ) from end-of-life Si solar panels, demonstrating the strong economic competitiveness of the MAS reaction. Combining experimental and theoretical analyses, the dynamic evolution of Si nanoparticles was determined to be the key to efficiently extracting H 2 from NH 3 during ball milling.},

PAN-based CFs are fabricated through a series of high-temperature curing steps on wet-spun fiber precursors that lead to cyclization of the nitrile groups and oxidation, followed by the formation of graphitic crystallites during the final carbonization step. The extent of graphitization is expected to be highly dependent on the stereochemistry of the precursor polymer. Here, we introduce a new approach to synthesize isotactic PAN (iPAN) using a two-step chemical process that starts with a Lewis acid–based stereocontrolled polymerization to make low dispersity ( D̵ < 1.25) isotactic poly( tert -butylacrylamide) (iPTBAM; M w ∼ 150 kDa; ∼77% mm triads), followed by a post-polymerization modification step to convert the majority of acrylamide groups to nitriles (up to ∼78%). Atactic PTBAM was also prepared without using a Lewis acid. Conversion to iPAN-TB and aPAN-TB was confirmed using IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Each copolymer, along with a control PAN ( M w ∼ 130 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich), was wet spun into precursor fibers and processed in muffle (250 °C) and tube (1500 °C) furnaces. The results from tensile experiments (pre- and post-muffle furnace) showed iPAN-TB had the highest tensile strength and modulus after heating, nearly six- and four-fold higher, respectively, than the fibers derived from Sigma PAN, while not sacrificing extensibility after heating.},

However, the inherently low redox potentials of certain oxysalts, exemplified by perrhenate (ReO 4 – ), pose a persistent challenge for conventional reduction strategies. Herein, we report a rationally designed π-conjugated olefin-linked covalent organic framework (COF) catalyst, which incorporates isolated transition metal centers (M = Ni or Cu) to facilitate the γ-ray-powered catalytic reduction of ReO 4 – . Through synergistic spatial confinement and electronic modulation, the catalyst enables near-quantitative selectivity toward ReO 2 production via a unique three-electron (3e – ) transfer pathway, overcoming the bottleneck of multielectron reduction. The energy efficiency of the reduction reaches up to 42.1 mmol MJ –1 . Synergistic experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that radiation-generated hydrated electrons (e aq – ) participate in a coordination-electron relay process, involving a critical μ-oxo double-bridged [M–O(O)–Re] intermediate. Remarkably, the conjugated COF demonstrates superior radiation resistance, retaining crystallinity and porosity after prolonged irradiation. This work establishes a new paradigm for harnessing COFs as robust platforms for heterogeneous radiation catalysis, with potential applications in the treatment of redox-recalcitrant pollutants.},

  abstract     = {Triethylamine (TEA) and triethanolamine (TEOA) are renowned, in part, for their ability to reductively quench excited states by outer-sphere electron transfer with vast and still growing applications as sacrificial electron donors for photocatalytic systems. Upon amine oxidation, the resulting TEA •+ and TEOA •+ radical cations undergo proton transfer (or hydrogen atom transfer), resulting in the formation of a chemical reductant that has an α-carbon centered radical adjacent to the nitrogen center (TEA • and TEOA • ). In this contribution, we have electrochemically and spectroscopically characterized a set of electron acceptors which, upon accepting an electron, are a series of photocatalysts, [ReCl(R 1 R 2 -bpy)(CO) 3 ] •– , where R 1 and R 2 are electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the 4,4′- and 5,5′-positions on the bipyridyl ligand. We substantiated the formation of the electron donors, TE(O)A • , by spin trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, where TE(O)A • reacts with 2,4,6-tri- tert -butylnitrosobenzene to generate N-centered and O-centered radical adducts. Having established the chemical behaviors of the electron acceptors and donors individually, the electron transfer rate constants were determined across a 1.43 V range in driving force. The redox potential of TEA • was benchmarked to within ±80 mV on an absolute scale in V vs Fc + /Fc in CH 3 CN by using an empirical rate vs free-energy correlation, electron transfer theory, and density functional theory calculations. The equilibrium potentials for TEA • and TEOA • were determined to be −1.98 V and −1.76 V, respectively. Based on the kinetic and thermochemical analysis presented for TEA • and TEOA • , these transient radicals can be broadly considered strong homogeneous chemical reductants within the wider context of photoredox potentials. Thus, this work clarifies a frequently unnoticed secondary function for these sacrificial electron donors during photocatalysis and rationalizes the possibility of a one-photon/two-electron conversion process that is dependent on the free-energy exchange between TE(O)A • and photocatalysts.},

  abstract     = {Dopant size is known to influence oxygen vacancy-mediated conduction pathways and ionic conductivity in doped ceria, yet the underlying atomic-scale mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we combine neutron total scattering and large-scale atomistic simulations to analyze the local defect structures of two representative doped ceria systems: Ce 0.8 Gd 0.2 O 1.9 (GDC) and Ce 0.8 Nd 0.2 O 1.9 (NDC). The local structure of GDC, a commercially used ion conductor, is investigated for the first time using neutron total scattering on 160 Gd-enriched samples. GDC exhibits fewer defect clusters, with vacancy pairs preferentially aligned along ⟨111⟩ and ⟨110⟩ directions while disfavoring ⟨100⟩ direction within the cubic fluorite structure. The Gd–Gd interactions in GDC help destabilize ⟨100⟩ ordering, promoting a more open defect network that supports efficient oxygen-ion transport. Unlike Gd 3+ (1.053 Å in 8-fold coordination with oxygen), the slightly larger dopant Nd 3+ (1.109 Å) in NDC promotes a more compact defect configuration, characterized by increased defect clustering and stabilized ⟨100⟩ vacancy alignment due to dominant Nd–vacancy interactions, substantially reducing ionic conductivity. Gd 3+ provides an optimal balance of lattice expansion and preserving favorable defect structure for ion transport. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of dopant-size controlled conduction pathways in lanthanide-doped ceria and fundamentally contribute to the understanding of charge transport by ions, electrons, and protons in next-generation conducting materials.},

  abstract     = {The simplest sulfur imide (HNS) and isomeric thiazyl hydride (HSN) are prototype sulfur–nitrogen compounds that have been studied by numerous theoretical calculations; however, their existence remains hitherto elusive. Herein, we report the generation of HNS as a hydrogen-bonded water complex through 254 nm photolysis of the novel aminosulfenic acid (NH 2 SOH → HNS···H 2 O) in an Ar-matrix at 10 K, and the latter was synthesized in the gas phase by high-vacuum flash pyrolysis of tert -butyl(amino)sulfoxide at ca. 700 K. Upon photoexcitation at 193 nm, HNS···H 2 O rearranges to yield the less stable HSN···H 2 O with concomitant dehydrogenation to form water complex of nitrogen monosulfide ( • NS···H 2 O). The characterization of these water complexes with matrix-isolation IR spectroscopy is supported by D- and 15 N-isotope labeling experiments and theoretical calculations at the B3LYP-D3/6–311++G(3df,3pd) level of theory.},

  abstract     = {Manipulating the electron spin state through the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect provides a novel strategy for enhancing the activity and selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, developing a quantitative relationship between the CISS effect and the chirality-enhanced OER performance is difficult due to complex influencing factors. Herein, using a ligand exchange strategy, we developed a monolayer chiral covalent organic framework (mc-COF) model catalytic system with adjustable spin polarization (P = ∼49–72%), which allows the decoupling of the CISS effect from other influencing factors on the OER performance. A supralinear dependence between the spin polarization and chirality-enhanced OER performance is established. This confirms that the chirality-enhanced electrocatalytic performance is significantly amplified by spin polarization due to the CISS effect. Moreover, in situ measurements reveal that the CISS effect of mc-COFs optimizes the reaction pathway by aligning *OH spins parallel, suppressing H 2 O 2 formation, facilitating spin-oriented intermediates (*OOH and *OO) at lower potentials, and accelerating *OOH-to-*O–O conversion.},

  abstract     = {Low-dimensional (LD)/three-dimensional (3D) heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) greater than 26%. However, the use of some ionic interfacial passivation materials in the construction of LD perovskites compromises device stability, as they can induce ion diffusion, particularly under high temperatures and light stress. In this study, we substitute the ammonium terminus (R-NH 3 + ) of conventional passivators with a carbamate terminus (R-NH-(CO)OR) and synthesized carbamate molecules featuring phenyl (PEA-Boc) and naphthalimide (ND-Boc) scaffolds. Through modulating the ionic terminus and enlarging the conjugated backbone of the passivation materials, the interlayer diffusion across PSCs was effectively inhibited. Moreover, the ND-Boc with electron-accepting moieties optimizes the band energy alignment, reduces defect density, and facilitates interfacial electron transfer of PSCs. As a result, the small-area target PSCs (0.04 cm 2 ) and mini-modules (aperture area of 15.45 cm 2 ) achieved a PCE of 26.04% and 21.83%, respectively. Notably, the encapsulated ND-Boc-based PSC maintained 96.7% of its initial PCE after being tracked at a maximum power point for 1500 h at 85 °C under argon (ISOS-L-2I protocol). Our strategy offers a simple and generally applicable passivation method for fabricating efficient and robust PSCs to facilitate their practical applications.},

However, it remains a grand challenge to efficiently utilize H 2 O 2 for the exclusive production of methanol. Herein, we report a tandem catalyst by encapsulating Pd nanoparticles in an amino-functionalized Fe-based metal–organic framework, delivering a CH 3 OH productivity of 14.8 mmol·g cat –1 ·h –1 with a selectivity of 98.6%. The spectroscopy characterizations suggest that the modification of the ligand by amino groups not only increases the electron density of the triiron motif through ligand-to-metal charge transfer but also induces the Jahn–Teller distortion of Fe 2+ coordination, giving rise to the unpaired electrons at a high occupancy state, evidenced by theoretical calculations as well. Mechanism studies reveal that this unique electron configuration of Fe 2+ facilitates H 2 O 2 decomposition, resulting in an asymmetrical Fe–O octahedron with further enhanced Jahn–Teller distortion and more unpaired electrons in the σ* antibonding orbitals. This structural evolution promotes CH 4 activation with a reduced barrier of 0.35 eV for the amino-functionalized catalyst, compared to 0.47 eV for the nonfunctionalized counterpart, enabling selective formation of CH 3 OH.},

  abstract     = {Electrically conductive two-dimensional metal–organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) represent a new frontier in porous crystalline materials, where both charge-carrier transport and mass diffusion are critical to function. However, reconciling high porosity with electrical conductivity remains a major challenge in developing this class of compounds. To address this challenge, we investigate two new 2D c-MOFs featuring hexaamino derivatives of dehydrobenzoannulenes (DBAs)─hexaaminodehydrobenzo[12]annulene (HA12) and hexaamino-dehydrobenzo[18]annulene (HA18) with a C 3 -symmetry axis─as organic ligands. These shape-persistent, fully π-conjugated macrocycles can be viewed as core-expanded analogues of hexaaminotriphenylene (HATP), a prototypical ligand for 2D c-MOFs. Their reactions with nickel ions yield highly porous Ni 3 (HI12) 2 and Ni 3 (HI18) 2 . Notably, Ni 3 (HI18) 2 exhibits a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of 1520 m 2 g –1 , among the highest reported for 2D c-MOFs. Furthermore, both MOFs show electrical conductivities comparable to that of the HATP-based counterpart, Ni 3 (HITP) 2 , as supported by density functional theory calculations. On the other hand, they differ significantly in electronic properties such as band gap and ionization energy, reflecting variations in their ligand structures. The DBA-based MOFs also demonstrate enhanced chemiresistive sensitivity compared to Ni 3 (HITP) 2 . Overall, this work presents a ligand design strategy that achieves high porosity while preserving electrical conductivity and at the same time enables diversification of electronic and sensing characteristics of 2D c-MOFs.},

Their integration into engineered solid-state matrices can enhance performance toward ambient quantum information technologies. Herein, we demonstrate covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as programmable matrices for stable organic radical qubits, allowing strategic optimization of spin-phonon and spin–spin interactions. Using two classic boronate-ester frameworks, COF-5 and COF-108, to host semiquinone-like radical qubits, we achieve an ultralong spin relaxation time ( T 1 > 300 μs) at 298 K, which outperforms most molecular qubits and rivals inorganic spin defects. The suppression of spin relaxation is attributed to rigid and neutral structures as well as carbon-centered spin distributions that effectively weaken spin-phonon coupling. Employing dynamical decoupling methods to both COFs improves their quantum coherence and enables room-temperature detection of nuclear spins, including 1 H, 11 B, and 13 C. Our work establishes COFs as designer quantum materials, opening new avenues for quantum sensing of nuclear spins at room temperature.},

These materials exhibit enhanced hydrophobicity and maintain good solubility in alcohol-based solvents. Among them, NDIP3F-M showed optimized energy level alignment and reduced trap activation energy, leading to an improved fill factor and a PCE of 20.1%.

A set of related hypotheses center on the Mo ion facilitating electron delocalization, which could aid in substrate activation and/or provide enhanced stability during turnover, among other possibilities. To understand how the incorporation of Mo or other ‘heterometals’ influences the electronic structures of Fe-S clusters, we prepared and characterized an isostructural and isoelectronic series of [MFe 3 S 4 ] clusters (M = V, Cr, Mo, W) that includes the first example of a [CrFe 3 S 4 ] cluster. Comparison of the clusters’ structural, spectroscopic, and computed properties reveals that the Mo- and W-containing clusters have greater M–Fe delocalization than those containing only 3d metals. Although the [CrFe 3 S 4 ] cluster adopts the same ground spin state as the other clusters ( S = 3/2), the smaller Cr atom engages in substantially attenuated─though not fully obliterated─M–Fe delocalization. Moreover, electrochemical and Mössbauer spectroscopic studies reveal that the clusters with more substantial M–Fe delocalization have more electron-rich Fe sites. Such trends, if they apply to the nitrogenase cofactors, could account for the greater efficiency of the Mo nitrogenase in biological nitrogen fixation.},

Despite recent advancements in shifting irradiation wavelengths to visible and near-infrared light, improving photolysis quantum yield and the corresponding uncaging cross section, key parameters for efficient photocages, remains highly challenging. Here, we address this challenge by introducing light-controlled COO-B bond cleavage from tetracoordinate boron linked to dipyrrin, aryl, and carboxylic acid groups. We developed a multicomponent diversity-oriented one-pot method to streamline the synthesis of BODIPY-cages, enabling the creation of a diverse library of photocages for systematic investigation of their photorelease structure–activity relationships and mechanisms. Thanks to efficient COO-B bond photolysis and the impressive extinction coefficients of BODIPYs, the developed photocages possess uncaging cross sections up to 1488 M –1 cm –1 , enabling rapid lysosome photoactivation fluorescence imaging at low light and dye doses (0.2 mW, 50 nM) and sequential two-photon (λ ex = 950 nm) photoactivation in zebrafish. When loaded with the drug valproic acid ( VPA ), these photocages optimize drug uptake and achieve precise photoactivation release in the endoplasmic reticulum or lysosomes, boosting drug efficacy ∼18,540-fold. Our one-pot accessed photocages, with impressive uncaging cross sections, two-photon activation capability, and photoactivatable fluorescence imaging and drug release abilities, provide a valuable paradigm for developing multifunctional photoactivation platform. We expect our study to break new ground in the construction of tetracoordinate boron photocages with diverse structures and functions.},

Performing H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis in concentrated acid offers advantages in functionality and energy efficiency over alkaline media yet is currently limited by short longevity. Here, we first investigate the origins of performance loss of oxidized carbon, a proven catalyst for H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis, and observe its gradual reduction to pristine carbon during acidic electrolysis. This inspires us to design a catalyst that can stabilize the oxidized carbon sites via strong Y–O–C coordination─a strategy we instantiate via carbon-caged-yttria (C@Y 2 O x ) catalysts. In acids, the C@Y 2 O x catalyst sustains a H 2 O 2 selectivity of 97% after 10,000 cycles. Integrated into a gas diffusion electrode and operated in concentrated acids of pH < 0, the C@Y 2 O x catalyst delivers a partial current density of ∼100 mA cm – 2 at −0.4 V versus RHE over 100 h in a flow cell. Using quasi in situ NAP-XPS, operando FT-IR, and theoretical calculations, we elucidate that coordination with yttrium energetically suppresses the breakage of the O–C bond and accordingly preserves the oxidized carbon sites for selective and long-term electrosynthesis of H 2 O 2 .},

We validated our approach using the well-characterized α-glycine crystal, achieving structural precision comparable to that of single-crystal X-ray diffraction (RMSD = 0.367 ± 0.003 Å). Extending our method to structurally complex peptides, we resolve biomaterial diphenylalanine structure (RMSD = 0.743 ± 0.009 Å) and determine Alzheimer’s-associated peptide (r-acAβ) assemblies at angstrom precision. Furthermore, our approach uniquely identified specific vibrational signatures associated with hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, linking the reversible switching of peptide self-assembly through environmental stimuli. This method provides a transformative structural characterization platform, offering critical insights into molecular assembly mechanisms and enabling the rational design of next-generation functional biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Coacervate-based artificial cells have gained significant attraction in synthetic biology for their ability to mimic life-like functions such as compartmentalization, selective molecular uptake, and the hosting of biochemical reactions. However, the incorporation of motility, a key feature of natural cells, remains underexplored. This is mainly caused by the dynamic character of coacervates, which hampers their stability and limits control over functional motile components within the structure. In this contribution, we have been able to address this gap by physically anchoring gold nanoparticles (AuNPs)-coated nanomotors at the coacervate interface in combination with a terpolymer membrane. The positively charged coacervates promoted the assembly of negatively charged nanomotors on their surfaces via electrostatic interactions. By costabilizing the coacervates with a terpolymer membrane, patches of nanomotors were firmly immobilized on the coacervates’ surface and the stability of coacervates was preserved during motion performance. The distribution of nanomotors shifted from spotted distribution, patchy distribution, to almost full coverage upon increasing nanomotors concentration. Optimal motile behavior was found when achieving a patchy coverage of nanomotors at the interface, which enabled the system to become a light-driven micromotor platform through the surface plasmon thermal effect of the AuNPs. Remarkably, the motion dynamics of these coacervate droplets could be modulated by tuning nanomotors’ density on the surface, coacervates’ size, and laser light intensity. This study provides a first example of a coacervate system, which is stabilized by a combination of nanoparticles and a terpolymer membrane, of which their motility is effectively transferred to the artificial cell structure.},

  abstract     = {Isomerization of C–C double bonds is an efficient tool for converting bulk olefins into high-value compounds. Herein we describe a newly developed homogeneous cobalt-based system which enables the isomerization of allylamines to enamines with similar activity and selectivity to noble metal catalysts. The catalyst activity was bound to the presence of furan-2-yl substituents of the phosphine ligand, while the selectivity was increased with the number of benzofuran-2-yl groups. The resulting cobalt(0) catalysts allowed the isomerization of various aliphatic and aromatic allylamines, including the synthesis of industry-relevant products with high catalytic activity. Potential industrial application of our system was substantiated by the scale-up experiment, which provided 311 g of citronellal in 96% yield. We proposed a plausible mechanism based on EPR and NMR analysis combined with deuterium labeling, radical trapping experiments, and kinetic studies.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic epoxidation of alkenes in H 2 O offers an appealing yet promising approach for selective electrosynthesis of industrially important epoxides; unfortunately, the performance remains less than expected. Here, we report a physical electrocatalyst design strategy that promotes robust styrene epoxide electrosynthesis via the enrichment of key intermediates within a confined porous umbrella-like nanostructure. Gold porous nanoumbrellas (Au PNUs) are prepared by the electrostatic repulsion interactions between positively charged H + ions and the quaternary ammonium group of assembled lamellar micelles, with different apical angles depending heavily on their strengths. Different from flat counterparts, Au PNUs structurally feature active metal sites along surface pores and nanoconfined microenvironments within a half-open umbrella-like cavity. With styrene as the substrate, Au PNUs deliver a nanostructure-driven enhancement in both activity and selectivity for styrene epoxide electrosynthesis to reach a remarkable selectivity of 99.6% and a superior yield rate of 10.6 mmol h –1 g –1 . Detailed mechanism studies reveal that active Br radicals as the key intermediate are formed around metal pores and further enriched within the confined umbrella-like cavity, which thus facilitate subsequent bromination and further cyclization reactions for robust styrene epoxide electrosynthesis. This work provides a physical engineering route to enhance chemical selectivity for efficient electrosynthesis of renewable chemicals and feedstocks.},

  abstract     = {DNA–protein cross-links (DPCs) are cytotoxic lesions whose study in cells is complicated by the lack of exogenous agents that produce them selectively over DNA–DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). The synthesis and reactivity of a chimeric bis-electrophile (MEBAC) that is comprised of a highly reactive alkylating agent and a lysine selective o -ethynyl benzaldehyde is described. DPC formation in nucleosome core particles (NCPs) by MEBAC is >40-times greater than that of ICLs. Cell viability experiments and the single cell Comet assay are consistent with NCP reactivity. Compared to a nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine, MCE) MEBAC produces higher DPC yields and lower ICL yields in NCPs and in cells at comparable cytotoxicity. Cell viability experiments show that while DPCs from MEBAC are repaired by the metalloprotease SPRTN and the proteasome, only the former repairs such lesions produced by MCE. The inability of the proteasome to repair DPCs in MCE-treated cells likely contributes to the cytotoxicity of the nitrogen mustard. Proteomic analysis identifies several cysteine-rich E3 ligases involved in ubiquitination that are cross-linked to DNA in MCE-treated but not MEBAC-treated cells and suggests a chemical basis for why DPCs produced by the nitrogen mustard are not repaired by the proteasome. This investigation reveals a previously unknown source of nitrogen mustard cytotoxicity and indicates that MEBAC and molecules like it will be useful tools for studying DPCs in cells.},

  abstract     = {The unique architecture of naturally occurring ladderane phospholipids has inspired innovation in strategies for their chemical synthesis and biosynthetic hypotheses. Despite the emergence of a few independent synthetic routes to both their known components, i.e., (+)-[3]-ladderanol and (−)-[5]-ladderanoic acid, a unified strategy for their enantioselective syntheses is yet to be documented. In 2022, we reported an enantioselective total synthesis of [3]-ladderanol using an alkylative desymmetrization reaction, developed in our lab. We have now adapted this desymmetrization strategy for the enantioselective total synthesis of [5]-ladderanoic acid by leveraging the symmetry of its pentacyclododecane skeleton. Our synthetic strategy relies on the installation of a five-carbon linear alkyl chain to the hexacyclic meso -cyclohexenedione through organocatalytic alkylative desymmetrization, followed by a ring-deconstructive formal one-carbon deletion, which transformed cyclobutane-fused α-alkyl cyclohexenediones to alkylated cyclobutanes. This is not only the first time an organocatalytic reaction is applied to the enantioselective synthesis of [5]-ladderanoic acid but also the first example of the application of a symmetry-inspired unified enantioinduction strategy for accessing both these targets. The versatility and modularity of this strategy facilitated the synthesis of inverse -[3]-ladderanol, an unnatural structural isomer of [3]-ladderanol, and paved avenues to its other such isomers. In this context, we proposed a hypothesis for the biosynthetic conversion of (−)-[5]-ladderanoic acid to (+)-[3]-ladderanol through reductive ring rupture. Preliminary biophysical studies hinted at a plausible evolutionary exclusion of inverse -[3]-ladderanol by nature.},

CoFe/La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Cr 0.9 Co 0.1 O 3−δ (LSCC) interfaces are architecturally tailored by modulating the concentration of guest Fe cations, enabling precise control over the coverage of exsolved CoFe nanoparticles through a topotactic ion exchange strategy. The promotional role of Fe in facilitating Co cation exsolution is quantitatively investigated via X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy. A quantitative correlation between the interfacial parameters of CoFe/LSCC and their intrinsic catalytic performance is well disclosed. CO 2 electrolysis performance is linearly positively correlated with the perimeter of the CoFe/LSCC interface, reaching a peak performance of 1.73 A cm –2 at an optimal interfacial perimeter of 29.3 μm μm –2 .

In this method, a series of commercial electron-rich arenes, including natural products and drug molecules, are conjugated to cysteine/selenocysteine-containing peptides and proteins. Furthermore, we show that this new bioconjugation method allows the efficient stapling of peptides, as well as the cross-linking of different peptides to a single arene, all in high yields. The tunable electron density of small molecules enables the selective modification of selenocysteine in the presence of cysteine residues. Finally, mechanistic studies suggest that the conjugation proceeds via a proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process and substrate radical binding to the copper for C–Se/S bond formation.

Recent studies have pinpointed a bacterial endosymbiont of the green alga, Candidatus Endobryopsis kahalalidefaciens, as the true producer of kahalalide F. In the present work, we characterize a closely related kahalalide F analog, kahalalide Z 5 , from the marine cyanobacterium Limnoraphis sp. collected in the Las Perlas Islands, Panama, and propose the structures of several related compounds by detailed MS analysis. To uncover novel metabolites and prioritize them for targeted isolation from this organism, we employed a robust metabolomics strategy combining LC-MS/MS with SMART NMR and DeepSAT, artificial intelligence platforms trained to infer chemical structures from 1 H– 13 C HSQC NMR data. This integrated approach annotated a compound with structural similarities to kahalalide F, which we subsequently characterized using a suite of spectroscopic techniques and chemical degradation studies. Whole-genome sequencing of the producing strain further revealed a NRPS biosynthetic gene cluster that aligns with the structural features of kahalalide Z 5 . This study identifies the marine cyanobacterium Limnoraphis sp. as an independent source of kahalalide F-like molecules. This work broadens the phylogenetic spectrum of organisms capable of producing these bioactive compounds, reveals marine cyanobacteria as producers of an increased repertoire of unique natural products, and illustrates the potential of AI-enhanced metabolomic and genomic analyses to streamline the discovery and characterization of complex biomedically relevant natural products.},

At the same time, they are gaining more attention in emerging fields, such as spintronics and quantum technologies. However, precise manipulation of the electron behavior within C 60 , particularly the capture of varying numbers of electrons by an individual C 60 molecule, remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we realize the accurate monitoring of the sequential single-electron capture process of a single C 60 molecule bound between graphene electrodes. Real-time current measurements reveal four distinct charge states with specific Frontier orbitals under cryogenic conditions (2 K), corresponding to the capture of 0, 1, 2, and 3 electrons. Theoretical calculations suggest that the ability of C 60 to accept multiple electrons originates from the coupling between molecular vibrations and transported electrons. Furthermore, the effect of the electric field on the local density of states highlights its crucial role in the precise control of electron capture on a single C 60 . These findings provide useful insights into the dynamic evolution of stepwise electron capture in fullerene and demonstrate the potential of fullerene-based materials in molecular electronics and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {The shape of supported metal particles regulates their catalytic reactivity and is determined by the degree of wetting between the metal particle and the support surface. Flattened particles that wet support surfaces were reported in various catalytic systems, particularly in the subnanometer size regime. Such consequential metal–support wetting phenomena are poorly understood, and methods to study them on powder catalysts under realistic conditions are lacking. Here, we investigate the size-dependent wetting behaviors of Ru particles on two reducible-oxide supports, anatase TiO 2 (TiO 2 -A) and CeO 2 , under reducing catalytic conditions. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), and density functional theory (DFT) are combined to determine the shape of Ru particles. Ru particles remain three-dimensional without wetting the TiO 2 -A support within the coverage range studied (0.06–0.98 Ru nm –2 ). In contrast, at low coverages (<0.25 Ru nm –2 ), Ru wets the CeO 2 support to form flat, disordered structures. The higher wettability of CeO 2 than TiO 2 -A is attributed to oxygen vacancies in the near-surface region. The shape difference between small Ru particles or clusters on the two supports leads to drastically contrasting catalytic reactivities in polyolefin hydrogenolysis, despite similar diameters. This work highlights the implications of metal–support wetting, or cluster shape, on catalytic behaviors of small metal clusters, while establishing the foundation for future systematic studies of such a phenomenon in realistic systems, by delivering a multitechnique methodology and revealing governing fundamental principles.},

  abstract     = {Magnesium(II) oxide (MgO) is a versatile material that is appealing for a wide range of applications including electronics and biocompatible coatings, as pharmaceutics, and gas barrier layers (GBLs). The growth of MgO films at low temperatures is required for these applications which can be enabled by atomic layer deposition (ALD). However, the chemistry of ALD precursors reported to date for MgO is limited and there are no suitable chemistries for low temperature deposition on sensitive substrates. In this work, we describe the ALD of MgO thin films close to room temperature which was triggered by the use of a new nonpyrophoric Mg precursor that possesses all the prerequisites needed for low temperature ALD. The highly volatile bis-3-( N , N -dimethylamino)propyl magnesium(II) [Mg(DMP) 2 ] precursor is reactive toward water. The unique chemistry of the DMP ligand facilitates the ALD process in a broad temperature range (30–260 °C) with high growth per cycle (GPC) values (2.40 Å at 40 °C and 1.91 Å at 120 °C) on Si substrates and is supported by computational studies. The as deposited films were characterized using complementary tools to investigate the composition, structure and surface topology. Furthermore, we demonstrate the growth of MgO on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) foils that can be exploited for implementation in temperature sensitive flexible devices by low temperature ALD. This work highlights the key role of the DMP ligand in developing a new Mg precursor promoting low temperature ALD of MgO thin films, opening the field of flexible electronics and new applications beyond semiconductor devices.},

  abstract     = {The facile synthesis of ultranarrow-bandgap (<1 eV) small-molecule semiconductors remains a persistent challenge for advancing shortwave infrared (SWIR) organic optoelectronic technologies. Donor–acceptor (D-A)-type molecules featuring quinoidal 2-(5-methylenethiazol-2(5 H )-ylidene)malononitrile (TM) end-groups are promising for achieving this goal. However, despite extensive studies of TM-based asymmetric merocyanine dyes, their optoelectronic performances remain far from satisfactory, and the synthetic methodologies for symmetric TM-end-capped molecules remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a Lewis acid (LA)-catalyzed condensation strategy for synthesizing symmetrical TM-based molecules, overcoming the high activation energy and side reactions plaguing the conventional method. This strategy enables room-temperature construction of ADA and ADA′DA structures with high isolated yields up to 82%. Multiple SWIR absorbing materials with tunable energy levels, bandgaps, and fluorescence characteristics are constructed through systematic TM’s substituent engineering. By leveraging noncovalent O–H or N–H conformational locks provided by heteroaryl substituents on TM, ultranarrow-bandgap TM-based materials down to 0.83 eV in the film state are obtained. Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photodetectors are fabricated using an ADA′DA-type molecule as an electron acceptor. The devices exhibit broadband response (400–1100 nm), high external quantum efficiency (EQE) (>40%), and noise-limited detectivity ( D *) exceeding 1 × 10 13 Jones at 1020 nm, alongside a large linear dynamic range (LDR) (118 dB) and fast response (26 kHz at −3 dB). This work establishes TM-based materials as competitive candidates for silicon-rivaled photodetection and highlights the untapped potential of quinoidal TM moieties in designing next-generation organic materials for SWIR-based technologies.},

  abstract     = {Reactions at aqueous interfaces are significant in many disciplines and have recently been implicated in explaining the unique chemistry occurring in aqueous microdroplets. However, understanding the mechanisms behind these phenomena remains debated, emphasizing the need for establishing benchmark reactions and examining them under controlled conditions. Toward this goal, we report hydrolysis of a triflate group via nucleophilic substitution at the air–water interface. Triflate is an excellent leaving group and dissociates upon nucleophilic attack by either OH– or water. In addition, possible protonation of the triflate group in acidic solutions further enhances the leaving group ability, providing an acid-catalyzed reaction pathway. Using infrared reflection–absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS), we find that the surface-bound triflate hydrolyzes on a relatively long time scale in the order of several minutes. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hydrolysis does not change significantly at the extremely basic pH = 13 or acidic pH = 1 conditions, suggesting that the reaction is not rate-limited by pH. The measurements over mixtures of water and ethylene glycol, however, distinctly slow the reaction. Such direct measurement of a textbook organic reaction at the air–water interface and its insensitivity to pH can help promote an understanding of the role of interfacial proton activity and solvation within the broader context of surface and microdroplet reactions.},

  abstract     = {Electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation holds great promise for enabling fuel cell-powered transportation since hydrazine hydrate (N 2 H 4 ·H 2 O) has the highest energy density of all liquid, CO 2 -free fuels (3.45 kWh/L), and the highest fuel cell voltage (1.56 V vs O 2 ). Inspired by the ruffling of catalytic centers in oxidative enzymes, we designed a twisted single-atom nanozyme comprising twisted FeN 2+2 C 4+4 sites, enabling high accessibility of N 2 H 4 and OH – reactants. Experimental evidence shows that this nanozyme catalyst achieves the lowest oxidation overpotential of all Fe–N–C materials, both in the lab and in direct hydrazine fuel cells, with an open-circuit voltage of 0.95 V, unprecedented for an Fe-based anode. The structure of the catalytic site is elucidated through a combination of electrochemistry, 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy with crystal field multiplet simulations and fits of the pre-edge features, as well as density functional theory calculations and theoretical simulations of X-ray absorption near edge structure. The experimental and theoretical methods reveal that twisting the active site also shifts its oxidation potential positively and improves N 2 bubble removal while limiting ammonia production to less than 10 ppm. This work demonstrates the potential of active site twisting to enhance the oxidation of energy-rich and liquid substrates, representing a crucial step toward building a sustainable society.},

  abstract     = {Deciphering the spatiotemporal evolution of catalytic active sites under operational conditions is pivotal for establishing precise design principles in electrocatalysis. However, conventional electrochemical characterization techniques, which are limited in correlating physical topographical features with chemical activity, fundamentally obstruct the linkage between nanoscale structural and macroscopic activity descriptors. To address this challenge, an integrated operando electrochemical atomic force microscopy–scanning electrochemical microscopy platform was implemented, enabling simultaneous nanoscale tracking of the topographic reorganization and local activity distribution during the nitrate reduction reaction. Morphological analysis revealed that the amorphous SnO 2 catalyst undergoes dynamic surface restructuring with an increase in roughness of up to 59.0% during catalysis, while operando current mapping confirmed that these roughened regions exhibited ∼100-fold enhancement in NH 3 production activity compared to basal planes. Height profiling demonstrated that amorphous catalysts undergo ∼60% greater thickness reduction than crystalline counterparts during activation, constructing a dual-functional architecture with surface-exposed highly active Sn(II) sites and subsurface Sn(0) enabling rapid electron transport. These findings provided direct experimental evidence of electrochemically driven defect proliferation in amorphous catalysts, which synergistically contributes to NH 3 yield several times higher than those of crystalline benchmarks, pointing to one of the best Sn-based catalysts. The developed correlative operando imaging strategy established a generalized paradigm for resolving transient catalytic dynamics across material systems with direct applicability to NO 3 RR optimization and emergent electrocatalytic processes.},

One example is silver phenylselenide (AgSePh) – or “mithrene” – a blue-emitting 2D organic–inorganic semiconductor exhibiting strong optical and electronic anisotropy. Here, we show that the bandgap of mithrene can be systematically tuned by introducing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups to the phenyl ligands. We synthesized nine mithrene variants, eight of which formed 2D van der Waals crystals analogous to those of AgSePh. Density functional theory calculations reveal that these 2D mithrene variants are direct-gap or nearly direct gap semiconductors. Furthermore, we identify correlations between the optical gap and three experimental observables – the Hammett constant, 77 Se chemical shift, and selenium partial charge – offering predictive power for bandgap tuning. These findings highlight new opportunities for applying the tools of chemical synthesis to semiconductor materials design.},

Here, we unravel the nature of a Lewis pair polymerization (LPP) system that has demonstrated itself to be an exception to this general rule. To understand the unique, apparently concentration-independent, topological selectivity observed within this LPP system, we have paired specifically designed experimental studies with computational calculations to develop a mechanistic framework centered on an entropically driven dynamic equilibrium between intermolecular and intramolecular forms of electrostatic preorganization of polymer termini. This nuanced perspective provides a conceptual platform for the future design of topologically selective polymer synthesis. Notably, the polycatenane formation within this system under high concentrations provides strong support for the proposed mechanism. Overall, this work not only provides fundamental insights into the role of chemical dynamics in the precision synthesis of cyclic polymers but also establishes the convenient route toward topologically complex polymers.},

  abstract     = {The formation of the C–N bond plays a pivotal role in the ecofriendly synthesis of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, and chemical products. Photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) upgrading of biomass derivatives powered by renewable energy offers a green and sustainable catalytic strategy to generate formamide, which has scarcely been explored. Herein, we developed a promising PEC approach for constructing a C–N bond to synthesize formamide through the coupling of the oxidation of biomass derivatives. Taking glucose as a representative, we achieved a high formamide yield of 976.6 mmol m –2 h –1 at 1.2 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE) and Faraday efficiency (FE), >81% at 0.8–1.2 V vs RHE by integrated photoanode, representing excellent performance in comparison to previous reports for electrosynthesis (FE < 43.2%). Moreover, a large-area (5 × 5 cm 2 ) photoanode was also applied for formamide synthesis, representing an industrial current of 100 mA with FE > 78.1%. To ascertain the mechanism, in situ photoelectrochemical spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the formaldehyde radical (*CHO) intermediate was formed by the direct oxidation of photogenerated holes instead of the hydroxyl radical (*OH) attack to break the C–C bond, and then the C–N bond was established by coupling with *CHO and the nitrogen radical (*NH 2 ) formed by NH 3 to form formamide. The substrate could be converted from glucose to biomass-derived aldoses (or polyols), demonstrating its superior reaction suitability. This work deepened the understanding of the C–N coupling mechanism and provided an effective PEC approach for the conversion of biomass derivatives into valuable chemicals.},

Comprehensive characterization using UV–vis absorption spectroscopy and diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy confirmed the exclusive formation of a ternary supramolecular complex. X-ray crystallographic analysis further revealed that the introduction of an additional bridging ligand effectively linked the two ternary complexes to produce an unprecedented septenary supramolecular assembly with alternating guest sequences. In contrast to conventional methods, which require structural differentiation or positive cooperativity, our strategy relies exclusively on negative cooperativity to achieve highly precise molecular ordering. This study presents a novel approach toward constructing sophisticated multicomponent molecular assemblies, emphasizing the significant but underutilized role of negative cooperativity in achieving molecular precision in artificial supramolecular chemistry.},

Notably, complete photoactivation of PA-Broccoli results in a 6000-fold fluorescence enhancement with a rapid activation ( t 1/2 = ∼3 s), outperforming PA-GFP in sensitivity and speed by 1–2 orders of magnitude. Using PA-Broccoli, we first uncovered that cytoplasmic RNAs display restricted mobility compared to proteins. In addition, we revealed that circular RNAs undergo Ran-GTP-dependent nuclear export and slower cytoplasmic accumulation than linear mRNAs. Third, real-time imaging of mRNA within stress granules indicates that mRNA exchange throughout these granules is energy-dependent.

Significantly, the absolute configuration of chiral β-substituted γ-lactones can be precisely controlled by strategically selecting Z - or E -allylic alcohol substrates, thereby providing an alternative access to both enantiomers of chiral γ-lactones. Capitalizing on this catalytic asymmetric transformation as a key step, we have achieved a concise and stereodivergent total synthesis of the natural aryltetralin lignan drug (−)-podophyllotoxin and its 11 structural congeners in only 6–8 steps from commercial materials through the combination of chemical and chemoenzymatic strategies. The present protocol, featuring the development of a catalytic asymmetric Oshima–Utimoto reaction, not only offers a concise route to the synthetically valuable β-substituted γ-lactones, but also establishes a potential platform for preparing structurally diverse natural drug (−)-podophyllotoxin derivatives through minor modifications of synthetic precursors.},

  abstract     = {Chemical dimerizers are synthetic molecules that bring into proximity two or more proteins that do not normally interact with one another. A major application of this technology is to recruit an enzyme to a target protein, resulting in its post-translational modification (PTM). In particular, chemical dimerizer-mediated polyubiquitylation of proteins has garnered an enormous amount of interest as a new drug modality. A fundamental requirement for the construction of new PTM-driving dimerizers is an enzyme ligand that does not inhibit its activity. Traditional activity-based high-throughput screening platforms are not suited for this purpose. Here we describe a novel platform for screening libraries of bead-displayed compounds that links a requirement for small-molecule binding to the enzyme with enzyme-mediated modification of a nearby substrate. This system ensures that the enzyme-recruiting small molecules do not interfere with the catalytic function of the enzyme. We demonstrate the utility of this system in the context of E3 ubiquitin ligase-recruiting molecules and report the discovery of a novel low-molecular-mass ligand for the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) protein.},

  abstract     = {Supramolecular synthesis, driven by reversible noncovalent interactions, offers significant potential for creating functional materials with precise architectures. However, traditional batch synthesis often leads to kinetic trapping, producing polydisperse mixtures of intermediates and products. To address this, we utilize microdroplet reactors─femtoliter-scale confined environments with high surface-to-volume ratios and controlled flow dynamics─to enable precise control over self-assembly. By incorporating the principles of Maxwellian billiards, which describe the behavior of particles in confined spaces, we show how spatial constraints and internal flows within microdroplets enhance entropy, guiding molecular interactions toward thermodynamically stable products. Comparative experiments and simulations reveal that microdroplets favor the formation of a well-defined tetrahedral metallacage with near-perfect selectivity, unlike the heterogeneous mixtures observed in batch reactors. The confined environment accelerates reactant mixing and aligns molecular trajectories, effectively suppressing kinetic traps. Additionally, the metallacages selectively encapsulate hexane isomers, reducing the extraction time by a factor of 15 and improving the efficiency of n -hexane extraction compared to traditional methods. This work highlights the connection between hydrodynamic confinement, molecular entropy, and thermodynamic selectivity, demonstrating the potential of microdroplet reactors for precise material synthesis and efficient separation processes.},

Herein, we unveil a switchable chemoselectivity mechanism in an electrochemical nickel-catalyzed system that couples aryl and alkenyl halides with phenols and aliphatic alcohols under mild conditions. The addition of catalytic sodium acetate (NaOAc) promotes selective arylation of phenols potentially through modulating electron transfer kinetics and stabilizing a six-membered nickel–phenoxide metallacycle, which may facilitate ligand exchange and accelerate reductive elimination. Strikingly, the introduction of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) inverts the chemoselectivity, favoring arylation of aliphatic alcohols. This tunable protocol enables access to a broad spectrum of aryl and alkenyl ethers with high functional-group tolerance, offering a powerful platform for the construction of complex ethers and shedding mechanistic light on ligand- and additive-controlled selectivity in nickel-catalyzed C(sp 2 )–O bond formation.},

  abstract     = {An electrolytic Zn–MnO 2 battery is highly valued due to its cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and abundant resource availability. However, the battery’s performance is hindered by the slow kinetics at the poorly conductive MnO 2 cathode and hydrogen evolution at the Zn anode. Here, a strategy of P–O–M (M = Mn, Zn) d-pπ backbonding design is proposed for phosphorus–oxygen electrolyte additives, which can be realized by tuning the atomic dipole moment-corrected Hirshfeld (ADCH) population charge of the P/O atom. The reversibility of d-pπ backbonding not only leads to the fast kinetics of Mn 2+ /Zn 2+ at electrodes during both charge and discharge processes to suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction but also enhances the electronic conductivity at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces to sustain the high areal capacity of batteries. Hydroxymethyl dimethyl phosphite (HPD) with d-pπ backbonding is a preferred additive with a suitable ADCH charge. The assembled electrolytic Zn–MnO 2 (HPD) battery exhibits a high discharge capacity of 14.05 mAh cm –2 at an areal capacity of 15 mAh cm –2 and superior cycling stability over 1500 cycles. The Zn–MnO 2 (HPD) soft-pack battery exhibits a discharge capacity of over 1.60 Ah at a discharge rate of 0.5 C and maintains a Coulombic efficiency of ∼80% over 100 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled 50 V 40 Ah commercial Zn–MnO 2 (HPD) battery can drive an electric vehicle for 10 km. The ADCH charge regulation provides a feasible and effective method for developing high-performance aqueous batteries by achieving d-pπ backbonding.},

  abstract     = {Mixed tin–lead (Sn–Pb) halide perovskites, with their tunable bandgaps (1.2–1.4 eV), show great promise for the development of highly efficient all-perovskite tandem solar cells. However, achieving commercial viability and stabilized high efficiency for Sn–Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) presents numerous challenges. Among various optimization strategies, the incorporation of additives has proven critical in modulating the crystallization of Sn–Pb perovskites. Despite the widespread use of additives to improve performance, detailed photophysical mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we elucidate the mechanistic role of guanidinium thiocyanate, a chaotropic agent, in the crystallization of Sn–Pb perovskites. We combine hyperspectral imaging with real-time in situ photoluminescence spectroscopy to study the crystallization process of Sn–Pb perovskites. Our findings reveal that the chaotropic agent modulates the crystal growth rate during perovskite crystallization, resulting in more homogeneous films with reduced nonradiative recombination. We challenge the common assumption that crystallization stops once the solvent evaporates by identifying photoluminescence variations during the cooldown process. The resulting films exhibit a photoluminescence quantum yield of 7.28% and a charge carrier lifetime exceeding 11 μs, leading to a device efficiency of 22.34% and a fill factor of over 80%. This work provides a fundamental understanding of additive-mediated crystal growth and transient cooldown dynamics, advancing the design of high-quality Sn–Pb perovskites for efficient and stable optoelectronics.},

In addition, the ligandless Pd(II)-catalyzed C–H halogenation is incompatible with heterocyclic substrates, thus limiting its use in medicinal chemistry substantially. By the discovery and development of three bifunctional bidentate pyridone ligands, we categorically removed these four detrimental drawbacks, rendering C–H halogenation technology substantially more practical: the reaction conditions require only a ligand-supported Pd(II) catalyst, inexpensive industrial halogenating reagents (NXS), and a commonly used acetonitrile solvent.

Using an integrative toolkit─X-ray crystallography, solution NMR, AlphaFold modeling, and pulsed EPR/DEER─we solved the full-length homodimeric structure of ScdA and identified a robust di-iron center that forms stable iron-nitrosyl intermediates. Targeted mutagenesis reveals that redox-active cysteines and dimerization state tune catalytic output, whereas steady-state kinetics confirm efficient nitrite-to-NO turnover. In vivo, ScdA overexpression in Escherichia coli suppresses growth under nitrite-rich conditions, highlighting the cytotoxic potency of the NO it generates.

  abstract     = {In recent years, significant progress has been made in improving the stability, photocurrent efficiency and charge transport properties of 2D hybrid perovskites, making them increasingly relevant for optoelectronic devices. Although these layered systems are typically considered quantum wells due to carrier confinement, an emerging strategy is to generate new perovskite functionalities with π-conjugated electroactive cores as spacer molecules, which introduce electronic coupling between the inorganic metal-halide and organic sublattices. Realizing these functionalities requires an understanding of how this coupling is achieved and how it affects exciton behavior. Using first-principles modeling and single-crystal optical spectroscopy, we find that the linker length (C x , where x = 2 or 4) controls the inorganic–organic electronic coupling and, therefore, the exciton properties of pyrene-alkylammonium (Pyr-C x )-based electroactive 2D perovskites. Whereas both (Pyr-C 2 ) 2 PbI 4 and (Pyr-C 4 ) 2 PbI 4 incorporate the π-conjugated core, only the latter has electroactive characteristics, as the longer linker length ( x = 4) allows favorable π–π stacking that, together with energy alignment of organic and inorganic orbitals, results in interlayer organic–inorganic hybridization. This tailored hybrid coupling induces substantial exciton “leakage” through multiple PbI 4 2– layers, enabling efficient interlayer exciton transport. By contrast, due to a type-I band alignment and orthogonal orientation of the π-systems with respect to the PbI 4 2– layers in (Pyr-C 2 ) 2 PbI 4 , the interlayer hybridization is lost, resulting in traditional quantum well properties. This study reveals new molecular engineering design principles to control excitons in 2D perovskites, emphasizing the importance of active π-core orientation and energetic band alignment─marking a critical step toward harnessing active organic cations in perovskite optoelectronics.},

Herein, we report the rational chemical design and synthesis of a dithiolane-incorporated lipidoid (S-DOPE) to construct an innovative LNP formulation, termed SLNP, for enhanced intracellular mRNA delivery. These chemically engineered SLNPs exploit an inherent thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, whereby the unique dithiolane moiety triggers a dynamic covalent disulfide-thiol exchange reaction with cell surface thiols. This chemically driven reaction facilitates direct cytosolic mRNA delivery, effectively bypassing endosomal entrapment, a major bottleneck for conventional LNPs. In vitro studies demonstrate that SLNP formulations achieve an 11-fold increase in mRNA transfection and translation efficiency compared to standard LNPs. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations reveal a 4.5-fold enhancement in mRNA expression and robust immune responses. SLNP-mediated vaccination at low doses elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response. Notably, SLNPs induce neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are comparable to those achieved with significantly higher doses of conventional LNPs, highlighting their substantial dose-sparing potential. These findings establish that SLNP, by leveraging the chemically innovative thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, offers a promising and chemically distinct strategy to enhance both the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines, which is particularly valuable in scenarios of limited vaccine supply and for minimizing potential adverse effects associated with high vaccine dosages.},

  abstract     = {Solvent cage-escape dynamics of bimolecular photoredox products in solution has been investigated computationally through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical calculations. The present work focuses on the photoinduced oxidation of the organic electron donor dimethylaniline (DMA) by a Fe(III) N-heterocyclic carbene photosensitizer (Fe(III)NHC + ) in two different solvents, serving as an example of current interest due to their relevance for the development of earth-abundant photocatalytic systems. Calculated solvent cage-escape yields of radical-cation and neutral photoproducts (DMA •+ and Fe(II)NHC, respectively) by molecular dynamics simulations reveal more favorable solvation in acetonitrile than in dichloromethane following the initial photoinduced charge-separation. These results agree with basic expectations from solvent polarity considerations but give an opposite trend compared to experimentally reported cage-escape yields. Alternative cage-escape mechanisms were therefore considered computationally to account for the anomalous experimental cage-escape yields. Both quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations support the formation of radical-cation dimers ( [ ( D M A ) 2 ] • + ), allowing for more efficient charge migration involving the radical-cations as the polarity of the solvent is decreased. The results further demonstrate the ability of the counterion (PF 6 – ) to stabilize the photoproducts through radical-cation–anion pairing, suggesting that these bimolecular interactions can also play an important role to preferentially promote photoproduct formation in less polar solvents. Both radical-cation dimer formation and radical-cation–counterion interactions are therefore proposed to provide additional pathways that help to explain the experimental observations of anomalous solvation dependence of the cage-escape dynamics in the investigated system. The broader implications of the bimolecular cage-escape processes on photocatalytic reaction dynamics are also considered based on our findings about light-induced intermolecular interactions.},

  abstract     = {This study demonstrates a unifying understanding of spontaneous Cu reconstruction during electrochemical CO 2 and CO reduction reactions (CO (2) RR) and its influence on the surface-adsorbed CO (*CO), the most important reaction intermediate of CO (2) RR. Specifically, by employing various in situ/operando Raman and infrared spectroscopy techniques, we reveal a universal gradual formation of bridge-type adsorbed CO (*CO bridge ) accompanying the reconstruction in addition to CO adsorbed on the atop site (*CO atop ). This phenomenon is observed across diverse Cu catalysts and electrolyzer configurations. Especially, it also occurs during CV measurements of Cu, causing interference for spectroscopic characterization of *CO for mechanistic studies. The formation of *CO bridge on reconstructed Cu is revealed to involve two steps: first, CO adsorption to form *CO atop followed by its surface conversion to *CO bridge , while kinetic studies show that *CO bridge is inactive and detrimental to catalytic conversion. Finally, to provide reference results valuable for future studies, we benchmark the line shape and potential-dependent population of *CO for widely utilized Cu catalysts, proposing protocols necessary for accurate measurements. Collectively, these results explain why spontaneous Cu reconstruction would result in lower activities of CO (2) RR, the surface dynamics and activities of *CO bridge , as well as how to accurately characterize *CO for future mechanistic studies. These insights not only advance the fundamental understanding of Cu-based electrocatalysts but also provide a framework for studying the dynamic reconstruction of electrocatalysts for other reactions.},

Specifically, the ABC transporter MsbA plays a crucial role in translocating an LPS precursor from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic facing leaflet of the inner membrane, and small molecules that inhibit its function exhibit bactericidal activity. Here, we use native mass spectrometry (MS) to determine lipid binding affinities of MsbA from P. aeruginosa (PaMsbA), a Gram-negative bacteria associated with hospital-acquired infections, in different conformations. Unlike the transporter from E. coli , we show that the ATPase activity of PaMsbA is stimulated by Zn 2+ , Ni 2+ , and Mn 2+ and successfully trapping the protein with vanadate requires one of these metal ions. We also present cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of PaMsbA in occluded and open outward-facing conformations determined to resolutions of 2.58 and 2.44 Å, respectively. The structures reveal a triad of histidine residues, and mutation of these residues abolishes Zn 2+ binding and stimulation of PaMsbA activity by metal ions. Together, our studies provide insight into the structure of PaMsbA and its lipid binding preferences and reveal that a subset of divalent metals stimulates its ATPase activity.},

This catalytic system displays high yields and enantioselectivity and broad substrate scope, efficiently accommodating both alkyl- and aryl-substituted allylic carbonates.

Here we report a highly enantioselective Brønsted acid-catalyzed ionic hydrogenation of α-alkyl styrenes using a hydrosilane in combination with a protic additive. Mechanistic and computational investigations support a pathway proceeding through a carbocation intermediate and a transient silylated catalyst species, with catalyst turnover dependent on the presence of a protic additive.

A unique approach to the ortholactone–acetal was required as it is not peripheral but embedded within the complex carbocyclic framework. This key challenge was addressed by orchestration of a condensation cascade triggered by the selective generation of an oxocarbenium ion. Tempering reactivity in the face of the densely functionalized skeleton proved key and culminated in the total synthesis of novofumigatonin.

Our studies reveal that when the dark states dominate the emission, the 0D material exhibits an anomalous giant magneto-blueshift of approximately 9 meV at 7 T. Spectroscopic analysis indicates that the magnetic field modulates the dark state decay pathways, thereby inducing a crossover from the first-order Herzberg–Teller (HT) vibrational coupling mode to the zero-order Franck–Condon (FC) emission mechanism. This field-dependent modulation of dark exciton dynamics underscores the strong interplay between electron–phonon coupling and spin–orbit interactions in these 0D hybrid systems.
