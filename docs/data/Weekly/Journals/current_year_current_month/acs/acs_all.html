  abstract     = {Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy and microscopy are constantly expanding sensing techniques for analyzing biomolecular interactions. In addition to the biological recognition molecules and biological or chemical analytes, the most important components for designing FRET biosensing systems are the materials that constitute the FRET donor–acceptor pair. These FRET materials consist of small molecules, biological or chemical nanoscaffolds, or nanomaterials that function in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared spectral range. They can absorb light, fluoresce or phosphoresce with lifetimes ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds, and can be applied for sensing in situ , in vitro , and in vivo . Organic dyes and quenchers, fluorescent or light harvesting proteins, or quantum dots are only some examples from the ever growing FRET material toolbox. A particular example are gold nanoparticles, whose strong localized surface plasmon resonance makes them frequently used as nanosurface energy transfer (NSET) acceptors. After a short recapitulation of FRET and NSET theory, we review a wide variety of FRET and NSET materials, provide representative examples of FRET/NSET systems and applications for each material, and critically discuss the benefits and drawbacks of their properties.},

  abstract     = {It has been more than 160 years since chemists first performed fluorination reactions on organic molecules. Scores of fluorination reagents and hundreds of worthwhile methods have been developed over the intervening years. Meanwhile, workers in the field are increasingly aware of the benefits of incorporating fluorine atoms into bioactive molecules. Therefore, the emergence of “late-stage fluorination” in the first decade of the 21st century is both natural and well-justified─an extant compound, off the shelf, can be converted more efficiently to a fluorinated product than through a de novo approach. It is worth noting that chemists’ attempts to fluorinate complex molecules began sporadically decades ago before the concept of “late-stage” was first proposed. In this Perspective, we aim to present a comprehensive series of late-stage fluorination strategies, with the spotlight primarily focused on single-atom modifications of complex molecules (although incidental examples of polyfluorination are addressed), including natural products, analogues, and pharmaceuticals. Both the nucleophilic and electrophilic sources of fluorine are examined.},

Their continuous, defect-free atomic arrangement contributes to improved interfacial stability, mechanical integrity, and charge transfer properties, ultimately leading to superior electrochemical performance compared to those of the polycrystalline counterparts. Despite their growing importance, a comprehensive review of single-crystalline anode materials has been lacking. In this review, we provide an overview of single-crystalline anode materials on their growth, applications, fabrications, and recycling for both metal and ion batteries. Starting from a theoretical understanding of electro-crystallization of metals, we discuss recent strategies for the growth and application of single-crystalline metals and substrates in various chemistries including lithium, zinc, sodium, aluminum, and magnesium, as well as single-crystalline host materials such as silicon, graphite, and transition metal oxides, alongside their failure mechanisms and associated challenges. Lastly, we discuss the fabrication and recycling of single-crystalline anode materials for a closed-loop life cycle of batteries.

These systems offer promising avenues for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders by emulating the brain’s computational strategies. Neural devices, including sensors and stimulators, monitor or modulate neural activity, playing a pivotal role in deciphering brain function and neuropathologies. Yet, clinical translation remains limited due to persistent challenges such as foreign body responses, low signal-to-noise ratios, and constraints in real-time data processing.

This review highlights the emerging class of neurohybrid interfaces, where neuromorphic systems might be integrated to enhance bidirectional neural communication. It emphasizes novel material strategies engineered for seamless neural interfacing and their incorporation into advanced neuromorphic chip architectures capable of real-time signal processing and closed-loop feedback. Furthermore, this review explores cutting-edge neuromorphic biointerfaces and evaluates the technological, biological, and ethical challenges involved in their clinical deployment.

However, conventional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy lacks the sensitivity to probe solvent-exposed regions in large, phase-separated peptide systems, where surface moieties are sparse relative to bulk residues. Here, we introduce hyperpolarized liquid-state surface-specific NMR spectroscopy, a technique that visualizes solvent-accessible residues in large biomolecular condensates. In combination with unconventional sample handling instrumentation and hyperpolarization-specific data processing, we report high-resolution hyperpolarized surface NMR spectra with spectral qualities that do not fall short of cutting-edge high-field methods yet have substantially boosted sensitivity. Targeting the biotechnologically widely used elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) nanoscale complexes, we demonstrate residue-resolved detection of the water interface of mega Dalton-sized peptide condensates with sensitivity enhancements reaching 2 orders of magnitude. Our method reveals glycine residues at the coacervate surface while hydrophobic core residues remain suppressed, providing direct evidence for glycine-rich surface segregation in these biomaterials. These findings resolve long-standing questions about ELP surface architecture and open an avenue for a solution-state analog to surface-enhanced solid-state NMR. The presented advance might thus foster detailed investigations of soft-matter interfaces in protein condensates, synthetic coacervates, and bioengineered materials.},

  abstract     = {Vitamin D 3 (VD 3 ) is an important natural product with functions in the human body related to bone growth and homeostasis. In the body, vitamin D 3 is converted into the hormone calcitriol by successive activation of the C 25 –H and C 1 –H groups by two cytochrome P450 isozymes that each catalyze a regioselective C–H hydroxylation step. By contrast, in bacteria, both reactions happen in the same P450 isozyme, but the product after the first hydroxylation step does not escape into solution. To understand the differences between human and bacterial VD 3 activation, we performed molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics studies of these enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations on the four P450 structures for human and bacterial isozymes with VD 3 and 25-hydroxy-VD 3 bound show that the human P450 enzyme for the first hydroxylation step has a small and narrow cavity around the heme, which only fits an aliphatic chain, and hence can only perform C 25 -hydroxylation. On the other hand, the bacterial P450 has a more open and spherical substrate binding pocket where the substrate fits in both orientations. Consequently, 25-hydroxy-VD 3 will bind for a long period of time in the bacterial P450 isozyme that can trigger a second reaction cycle with molecular oxygen. Subsequently, QM calculations on cluster models show that all reaction steps happen through a rate-determining hydrogen atom abstraction. However, the human P450 isozyme reacts with faster kinetics than the bacterial isozyme through better and tighter positioning of the substrate, which highlights the role of the second coordination sphere for enzyme-catalyzed reactions.},

  abstract     = {The propensity for photoexcited aryl ketones to undergo 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions is a fundamental process in organic synthesis and polymer degradation. Since its discovery in 1958, Norrish–Yang photocyclization has become a prominent method to access cyclobutanols under mild photoirradiative conditions. Despite its successful extension to larger ring systems, access to medicinally relevant 3-membered rings remains limited due to the strong kinetic preference for 1,5-HAT over 1,4-HAT. In this work, we demonstrate the first photocyclization of β-boryl aryl ketones to cyclopropanols. Our strategy relies on solvent-controlled selective population of the π,π* triplet state over the n,π* triplet state, with the former preferentially undergoing 1,4-boryl group transfer over 1,5-HAT. This protocol proceeds under mild irradiative conditions with excellent functional group tolerance, providing access to a broad range of highly valuable cyclopropanol scaffolds.},

C–H methylation is particularly attractive, yet a broadly applicable method for meta -C–H methylation of pyridines─the most common N -heterocyclic pharmacophore─remains elusive. Herein, we report a method for meta -methylation of pyridines that utilizes dihydropyridines, generated in situ, in conjunction with benzotriazolylmethanol or paraformaldehyde as the methylating agent, enabling the construction of a diverse array of meta -methyl-substituted pyridines with excellent selectivity for monomethylation. Moreover, the method can be readily extended to meta -alkylation using aldehydes as alkyl sources. Density functional theory calculations, control experiments, and kinetic studies were performed to elucidate the reaction mechanisms, in which the cooperation of the borane catalyst with the base was crucial for the deoxygenation step. Given the impact of methyl groups on molecular potency and the prevalence of pyridine pharmacophores, we anticipate that this method may offer a powerful handle for accessing new drug candidates.},

  abstract     = {The low nucleophilicity of phenols represents a major obstacle to the Pd-catalyzed synthesis of diaryl ethers. This inherent challenge is typically exacerbated by the reliance of C–O couplings on an insoluble, inorganic base: the resulting reaction heterogeneity leads to irreproducibility across scales and between laboratories, and incompatibility with common enabling technologies. In this Article , we report the development and mechanistic interrogation of an homogeneous, Pd-catalyzed C–O coupling between phenols and aryl triflates that uses a weak, soluble tertiary amine as base. We show that the choice of ligand, aryl electrophile, and base is crucial if side reactions and catalyst poisoning are to be avoided, and productive catalysis achieved. Investigation of reaction kinetics and linear free energy relationships has revealed the identity of both the catalyst resting state and the turnover-limiting step. The combined mechanistic insight allows qualitative a priori prediction of reaction outcome as a function of substrate electronics, and provides an intuitive guide as to how diaryl ether targets should be disconnected. The resulting methodology exhibits broad substrate scope, with yields reproducible across both preparative ‘singleton’ scales and high throughput formats. The homogeneous nature of the couplings allows their safe execution under microwave heating, with elevated temperatures allowing for short reaction times even in the presence of air, and their facile translation to scale-up in continuous flow.},

A σ-bond metathesis reaction of Me 3 Si(H)CN 2 with a europium(II) hydrido or alkyl complex yields a europium(II) nitrilimine, which reacts with CO to provide a europium(II) ynolate complex. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT calculations confirm the dominance of the ynolate resonance form, showing two orthogonal π orbitals between the C–C unit and a significant negative charge (−0.83) on the oxygen atom. Reactivity studies demonstrate C-centered trapping products with trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate, benzophenone, isothiocyanate, and carbodiimide.

Functionalization of readily available bicyclic alkenes provides a potential pathway to synthesizing molecules with complex cyclic structures. However, strained bicyclic alkenes exhibit thermodynamic reactivity driven by strain energy release, which predominantly favors ring-opening pathways. In contrast, ring-retentive hydroalkylation─a direct method for synthesizing complex bridged bicyclic architectures─remains underdeveloped. Here, we present a cobalt-catalyzed enantioselective hydroalkylation strategy for bicyclo[2.2.1]alkenes that enables ring-retentive addition while constructing tertiary carbon stereocenters within oxa- or azabicyclic frameworks. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the hydrometalation of alkenes serves as the selectivity-determining step, where noncovalent interactions between the catalyst and substrate govern stereoisomeric differentiation. The protocol demonstrates broad compatibility with diverse alkyl iodides and bicyclo[2.2.1]alkenes, facilitating late-stage functionalization of bioactive molecules and enabling the efficient synthesis of antifungal agents with potent activity.},

  abstract     = {Developing efficient approaches to synthesize robust large-sized macrocycles with a guest recognition ability represents one of the major focuses in the field of host–guest chemistry. Here, we obtained a series of macrocycles each containing no less than 100 nonhydrogen atoms in high or close to quantitative yield by leveraging catenation as the ligation reaction in the ring closure step. Each of these macrocycles, in the form of pretzelanes, consists of a catenane core whose two interlocked macrocycles are interconnected by a bridging unit. Their pseudoquantitative yields arise from the marriage of dynamic nature of the hydrazone bonds that allows error correction and a hydrophobic effect that drives catenation. Within each pretzelane, the bridging unit breaks planar symmetry, imparting intrinsic planar chirality. When the bridge is sufficiently rigid, it restricts the intramolecular pirouetting of one macrocycle relative to the other, preventing racemization of the enantiomers. Moreover, the rigid bridging and catenane components create a preorganized cavity capable of accommodating various hydrophobic guests. When an anthracene derivative is encapsulated within the pretzelane cavity featuring a viologen bridge, the latter can quench the excited state of the guest, protecting it from UV-stimulated oxidation to 9,10-anthraquinone.},

  abstract     = {The ABC model has been widely used to describe the carrier recombination rate, in which the rate of defect-assisted recombination is assumed to depend linearly on excess carrier density Δ n , leading to a constant recombination coefficient A . However, for multilevel defects that are prevalent in semiconductors, when Δ n varies, we find that the carrier capture and emission of defects can change the defect density distribution in different charge states, which makes the A coefficient depend on Δ n and become a function A ( n ). Therefore, the recombination rate should depend nonlinearly on Δ n . However, in many recent computational studies on multilevel defects, only carrier capture was considered, while carrier emission from defect levels was neglected, causing incorrect charge-state distribution and misleading linear dependence of the rate on Δ n , especially for multilevel defects with shallow levels. Taking V Ga -O N in wurtzite GaN and Pb I in perovskite CsPbI 3 as examples, our calculations showed that neglecting carrier emission can cause the recombination rate to be underestimated by more than 8 orders of magnitude when Δ n is 10 15 cm –3 . Our findings suggest that recent studies on carrier recombination assisted by multilevel defects should be revisited with carrier emission considered, and the widely used ABC model should be reformulated into the A ( n ) BC model.},

Understanding the formation mechanisms of such chiral assemblies is essential for the rational design and precise control of their morphologies and functions. However, the complex noncovalent interactions and multiscale assembly pathways pose significant challenges to unveiling the underlying mechanisms. Herein, we introduce a generic patchy-ellipsoid-chain model that enables efficient coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the assembly kinetics of supramolecular chiral helical microtoroids. Our simulations reveal that the formation of chiral helical microtoroids arises from the synergistic interplay of molecular chirality, directional noncovalent interactions, and solvophobic effects, proceeding through two distinct kinetic pathways: perforation and cyclization. Notably, the perforation pathway predominates due to energetically favorable π–π stacking interactions. This work provides both a robust modeling framework and mechanistic insights into supramolecular chiral self-assembly, offering rational strategies for the design of tailored supramolecular chiral structures.},

This protocol features mild conditions, broad substrate scope (>88 examples), and good functional group tolerance, demonstrating its applicability in diverse cyclopropanation and σ-bond insertion reactions.

This study complements the previous limited exploration of the counterparts of well-established 1,1′-spirobiindane-7,7′-diol (SPINOL) and its modified analogs. The convenient enantioselective synthesis of 2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-1,1′-spirobi-[phenalene]-9,9′-diamine (SPHENAM) and 9′-amino-2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-1,1′-spirobi[phenalen]-9-ol (NOSPHEN) represents a notable advantage over the limited spirocyclic precedents of this type, which were uniformly derived from their spiro parents. Two synthetic routes, both featuring catalyst-controlled enantioselective induction, have been designed, leading to the convenient construction of a large library of both C 2 -symmetric and non- C 2 -symmetric derivatives of 2,2′,3,3′-tetrahydro-1,1′-spirobi[phenalene]-9,9′-diol (SPHENOL), all with high efficiency and enantiomeric excess. Preliminary studies have demonstrated their superior performance as backbones of diverse effective chiral catalysts and ligands, illustrating their potential in asymmetric synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Undercoordinated metal centers serve as key catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. However, their inherent instability under oxidative conditions leads to rapid deactivation, limiting practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that reductive potential pulsing (RPP) is an effective strategy for generating and sustaining highly active undercoordinated Fe species in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NiFeOOH) during prolonged OER operation. Implementing this approach in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer enables a remarkable 40% enhancement in current density, achieving stable operation at 0.7 A/cm 2 for 180 h. A key insight from operando X-ray absorption characterization reveals that the OER activity of NiFeOOH is directly correlated with dynamically modulated Fe coordination, while the chemical state of Ni remains largely unchanged during OER and RPP processes. Beyond providing new insights into the long-standing debate over NiFeOOH active sites, this study introduces a practical approach to enhancing both activity and stability, with potential applicability to other electrochemical systems.},

In this study, we present the synthesis of a carbodiphosphoranyl germanium(II) compound and investigate its redox catalytic application. This organogermanium(II) species exhibits excellent catalytic performance in promoting the transfer hydrogenation of azoarenes and imines under mild conditions. Mechanistic studies revealed two distinct catalytic platforms based on Ge II /Ge III /Ge IV and Ge II /Ge IV redox cycles at a single germanium center. These results enable us to achieve the catalytic hydrogenation of azoarenes mediated by frustrated radical pairs (FRPs), as well as the catalytic chemoselective dearomatization of N -heteroarenes undergoing a Ge II /Ge IV redox process.

Recombinant resilin and resilin-derived proteins share resilin’s capacity for liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and formation of materials with high elasticity and biocompatibility, making it a promising candidate for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering applications. While prior research has focused on domain 1 of resilin, the role of domain 3 (D3) in resilin self-assembly and material properties is not well understood. Here, we used nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and small-angle X-ray scattering to study the conformation, dynamics, and intermolecular interactions of D3 as a monomer, in the phase-separated state, and as a cross-linked gel. We show that D3 remains unusually dynamic and is primarily disordered in all three states. In elucidating the mechanism of D3 LLPS, we find a complex set of electrostatic and π-based interactions complemented by the hydrophobic effect that finely tune the solution sensitivity of D3 and its capacity for LLPS. Overall, these results highlight the complex mechanisms governing resilin LLPS with implications for utilizing resilin-derived sequence features in the rational design of self-assembling biomaterials.},

  abstract     = {Ganglio-series glycosphingolipids (ganglio-GSLs) are biologically important glycolipids comprising a glycan of a ganglio-series nature and a lipid called ceramide. The glycan component often contains one or more sialic acid residues. Accesses to structurally defined ganglio-GSLs remain limited due to their structural complexity and synthetic challenges, hindering both functional studies and therapeutic applications. To overcome the challenges, we report herein a scalable chemoenzymatic total synthesis strategy for the construction of the most comprehensive library of ganglio-GSLs to date. A chiral pool approach was developed for synthesizing simple glycosylsphingosines with desired sphingosine lengths (d18:1 or d20:1) from inexpensive d -xylose. Complex glycosylsphingosines were prepared using enzyme assembly synthetic map (EASyMap)-guided streamlined one-pot multienzyme (OPME) and stepwise OPME (StOPMe) glycosylation strategies facilitated by designing mutants with improved catalytic efficiencies for two key glycosyltransferases (CjCgtA and human ST6GALNAC5). Ganglio-GSLs containing a terminal primary amino group were then prepared by chemical acylation, enabling their covalent immobilization on magnetic beads to form a novel comprehensive ganglio-GSL-bead library encompassing 0-, a-, b-, and c-series ganglio-GSLs including structures containing up to five sialic acid residues with different (α2–3/6/8) sialyl linkages. Multiplex binding assays revealed that ganglio-GSLs exhibit distinctive interactions with glycan-binding proteins including plant lectins, antiganglioside antibodies, bacterial toxins, galectins, and human and mouse siglecs. The integration of streamlined chemoenzymatic total synthesis strategies, glycosyltransferase engineering, covalent immobilization of GSL analogs, and a multiplex assay platform enables synthesis and high-throughput studies of previously difficult-to-obtain ganglio-GSLs. It is broadly applicable to help advance glycobiology and develop GSL-based diagnostics and therapeutics.},

LH1-RC has a highly conserved surrounding lipid composition known to favor anionic lipids for an unknown function. In this work, we compared experimentally the rate of LH1-to-RC energy transfer in detergent, membrane nanodiscs with varying lipid compositions, purified membrane fragments, and live cells. The energy transfer rate indicated that RC turnover decreased in neutral lipids, yet was partially restored in anionic lipids, revealing an unexpected lipid dependence. In complementary molecular dynamics simulations, the anionic lipid cardiolipin showed electrostatic interactions with LH1-RC that may mediate quinone exchange, providing a mechanism for the observed lipid dependence. Overall, these results revealed that anionic lipids facilitate LH1-RC redox cycling, identifying a functional role for membrane composition in photosynthetic solar energy conversion.},

Reaction studies reveal the influence of the metal coordinated in the inner pocket of the ligand upon the activity of the metal coordinated in the outer pocket, with different heterobimetallic catalysts being found to be optimal for the depolymerization of PET and PLA respectively.

  abstract     = {Highly crystalline ternary copper–molybdenum sulfide (Cu 2 MoS 4 ) has been demonstrated to promote the electro/photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Theoretical calculations have suggested that Cu 2 MoS 4 outperforms molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) because of its more moderate free energy of hydrogen adsorption, Δ G H* . However, the elucidation of intermediates involved in this process remains challenging, rendering the mechanistic details and specific role of Cu in improving activity uncertain. Herein, we describe the isolation and characterization of [NEt 4 ][Tp*MoS 3 (CuSPh) 2 ] (Tp* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate), a molecular model of Cu 2 MoS 4 capable of promoting electrocatalytic HER. Mechanistic investigations by DFT and multireference variational 2-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM)-CASSCF implicate a sulfur-based hydrogen evolution pathway in which the bridging μ 2 -sulfides are rendered more basic by one-electron reduction, which populates a Mo-4d/S-3p based orbital with significant electron delocalization on the two μ 2 -sulfides. Reduction and protonation of two adjacent Mo(μ 2 -S) moieties leads to H 2 elimination with an accessible energy barrier of +20.2 kcal/mol. This pathway contrasts recent studies of stilbene hydrogenation by [Mo 3 S 4 Cl 3 (ImNH 2 ) 3 ] + , in which formation of the corresponding one-electron reduced μ 2 -SH species via H 2 splitting leads to spin density being shared across the Mo III centers. These results provide an atomistic perspective into the role of Cu in modulating the μ 2 -S p K a and facilitating HER via a formal Mo VI/IV cycle with significant electron delocalization between Mo, Cu, and μ 2 -S.},

Algorithms to relocate short π-systems, often against a thermochemical bias, with simultaneous regio- and stereocontrol, are a feat of precision that remains challenging to translate to a laboratory setting. The divergent biosynthesis of vitamin D and tachysterol from previtamin D, leveraging positional or geometric isomerization, is a powerful exemplar. Inspired by this venerable blueprint, a deconjugative isomerization of borylated dienoates has been developed under the auspices of photochemical activation. Alleviating ground-state thermochemical restrictions through light-induced reactivity enables facile bifurcation of the diene and carbonyl chromophores: this occurs by a geometric isomerization/[1,5]-hydrogen shift sequence that emulates previtamin D photobiology. Broad functional group tolerance is observed, allowing the process to be leveraged in complex settings that would otherwise require multistep approaches. It is envisaged that the operationally simple, enabling nature of this strategy, coupled with the traceless nature of the boron handle, will stimulate interest in poly(ene) relocation strategies and begin to reconcile the paucity of synthetic methods with their ubiquity in biosynthesis.},

  abstract     = {Chemical imaging holds great promise for chemical, materials, and biological applications. However, its contrast often relies on subtle spectral differences arising from molecular-level changes. Here, we introduce label-free chemical imaging based on bond-specific coherent interference, which is highly sensitive to nanoscopic structural variations in collagen fibers. We demonstrated this idea using vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG) microscopy to identify lung tumors by detecting collagen I structural remodeling. Hyperspectral VSFG images reveal dramatic differences in the NH and CH x stretch regions between metastatic and tumor-free lung tissues. Based on these differences, key spectral signatures, such as the intensity ratio of NH S /CH 2,Ss and CH S /CH 2,Ss modes, were established to reliably distinguish metastatic tumor and tumor-free tissues with high fidelity. Theoretical modeling based on structural knowledge from Electron Microscopy indicates that distinctive interferences between VSFG vibrational modes make the intensity ratio directly related to interfibrillar distances at the 20–50 nm level. These findings suggest that collagen fibrils are more densely packed in tumors, corroborating the enhanced stiffness observed in tumor tissues. This result establishes an interference-based imaging mechanism that enhances chemical contrast and enables nanoscale structural readouts without labels. This method not only preserves sample integrity but also provides a powerful platform for fundamental biophysical studies and holds strong potential for future applications in oncology and pathology.},

The SD-ACL achieves anisotropic mass transport through structurally decoupled pathways: promoting rapid through-plane gas transport with a hydrophobic porous network while driving spontaneous in-plane water drainage via capillary action. As a result, the SD-ACL-fabricated membrane electrode assemble (MEA) achieved a high peak power density of 1150.3 mW cm –2 at high humidity with excellent durability, which was 2.3 times higher than that of the traditional one. Moreover, the SD-ACL could enhance nonprecious metal-anode-based AEMFCs by 57.5%, offering a promising strategy to achieve high-performance platinum-group metal-free (PGM-free) AEMFC technology.},

  abstract     = {The ability to induce and modulate chirality in metal halide perovskite semiconductors (MHPs) using chiral additives expands the compositional design space and offers a means of tuning chiroptical properties. Motivated by the ability of phosphonic acids to interact with metal ions, we designed three chiral phosphonic acids (CPAs) to impose chirality in otherwise achiral 2D MHP, phenylammonium tin iodide (PA 2 SnI 4 ). We found that both the position of the phosphonic acid relative to the bond between the two naphthalene rings (i.e., the chiral axis) and the distance between the phosphonic acid and the binaphthyl chiral units significantly impact the transfer of structural chirality into the MHP lattice. The compound with a phosphonic acid directly bound to one of the naphthalene rings at the carbon adjacent to the chiral axis resulted in the largest circular dichroism dissymmetry factor of the three phosphonic acids. Furthermore, optical pump-terahertz probe measurements reveal an increase in the charge carrier mobility in the MHPs following the addition of CPAs. This dual functionality of CPAs in inducing chirality and improving charge transport properties in MHPs is promising for chiral-optoelectronic applications.},

Herein, we design a defective fluorinated covalent organic framework (FCOF) with localized high polarity based on a truncated monomer strategy. Controllable defect design in the FCOF framework produces polar amino groups with enhanced Zn 2+ trapping ability. Meanwhile, an additional transport pathway was formed at the well-designed defect sites, which reduced the migration energy barriers. The Zn 2+ diffusion coefficient of the optimal defective FCOF separators (FCOF-30, with 30% defect content) was calculated to be 9.83 × 10 –10 cm s –1 (2 times higher than FCOF). At 10 mA cm –2 (5 mAh cm –2 ), the symmetric cell using FCOF-30 exhibited excellent Zn 2+ deposition/stripping behavior with 1200 h cycling stability.

This study presents a systematic investigation of the synthesis, properties, and reactivity of diazoboranes. In this work, the diazoborane library is expanded to eight species by varying the carbene ligands coordinated to boron, allowing the identification of key correlations between ligand electronic properties and diazoborane behavior. The results demonstrate that increasing carbene π-acidity weakens the B–N bond while strengthening the N–N bond, significantly decreasing thermal stability. Kinetic studies reveal that less π-acidic carbenes promote a second-order decay mechanism, leading to dibora-azine formation, whereas more π-acidic carbenes favor first-order dinitrogen dissociation, facilitating borylene generation. Electrochemical studies indicate that redox potentials also correlate with carbene π-acidity. Three representative reactivity studies are presented in which the same substrate reacts with different diazoboranes to yield either different products or the same product via different reaction mechanisms. These insights provide a generalizable framework for tuning diazoborane properties, facilitating their use in cycloaddition chemistry and small-molecule activation.},

A new member in the ternary RE 10 MCd 3 series, Gd 10 RuCd 3 , was predicted and synthesized as an experimental validation. The recommendation engine is based on partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) crystallographic site processing to classify the site preference of elements in compounds crystallizing in the Y 10 RuCd 3 -type structure and upon projecting other elements onto Principal Component map, the titled compound emerged as the top candidate. The distinguishing feature of the developed recommendation engine is in the three explainable methods utilized in the predictive framework: unrestricted, conservative, and cluster methods. Predictions are visualized with convenient property projection tools. The prediction was validated by high-temperature synthesis. The structure was confirmed with single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction. The cold-water-quenched samples quenched at 800 °C have a smaller unit cell volume than the samples quenched at 600 °C annealing temperature. Transport property measurements show an unusually low thermal conductivity (5–7 W·m –1 K –1 ) and a trend change indicates a possible structure transition between 600 and 800 °C. The unusual low thermal conductivity was predicted with a machine-learning model that focuses on thermoelectric property prediction. DFT analysis reveals the presence of a 0D electride phenomenon. The neutron cross section and absorption based on the constituent elements put our material within the top 0.4% of neutron absorbers. The negative thermal expansion and high mass absorption suggest Gd 10 RuCd 3 as an attractive neutron absorption material.},

  abstract     = {Quantities that break both mirror symmetry and time-reversal symmetry, such as the orbital angular momentum, are known to connect molecular chirality with an applied magnetic field. This concept has led to observations such as magneto-chiral dichroism and chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). However, being small, these effects often require additional amplification procedures such as flow chemistry to achieve bulk enantioseparation. In this work, we demonstrate how the magnetic field effect on photogenerated radical pairs, which also breaks time-reversal symmetry, can be harnessed for enantiopurification. Fundamental to this process is the collective decay of the singlet and triplet radical-pair states made possible by an applied magnetic field. Because opposite enantiomers exhibit spin–orbit coupling matrix elements of opposite signs, the singlet and triplet decay channels interfere constructively in one enantiomer. Meanwhile, molecules of the other enantiomer are funnelled into the first enantiomer through excited-state chirality inversion, achieving (dynamic kinetic) chiral resolution. Using an axially chiral binaphthyl derivative and a borane photosensitizer as prototype, we predict an appreciable enantiomeric excess (e.e.) of 90% to be possible at steady state, attained within hundreds of milliseconds when irradiated by a laser. Importantly, our analytical results showcase regimes of perfect enantioselectivity (100% e.e.), accessible by further chemical optimization of the photosensitizer for which general strategies are discussed. Overall, this work illustrates a so-far untapped but powerful control knob for photoredox catalysis based on spin chemistry principles.},

Targeting the introduction of a hydride ligand to the bimetallic core, our reactivity studies have revealed a preference for the hydride ligand to be bound to the Rh center, instead of the Sn center.

While most research focuses on close-packed crystal structures, nonclose-packed frameworks─exemplified by UCl 3 -type structures─offer unique advantages in enhancing lithium-ion transport via reduced diffusion barriers. Here, we report a new family of UCl 3 -type crystalline oxychloride electrolytes, Li 0.388+ x La 0.475 Ta 0.238 Cl 3– x O x (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.388, LLTCO), synthesized via rapid high-energy shake milling. The material with an optimized composition ( x = 0.15) exhibits high ionic conductivity above 2 mS cm –1 at 30 °C, oxidative stability exceeding 5 V vs Li/Li + , and excellent mechanical compressibility. Moreover, the LLTCO-based Li–Li symmetric cells show a long cycle life, indicating their strong capacity to suppress lithium dendrite formation. Spectroscopy analyses reveal the successful incorporation of oxygen, which preferentially substitutes Cl – around Ta 5+ sites without compromising crystallinity, even at a high oxygen content. The oxygen incorporation further promotes the formation of Li environments with fast dynamics, accounting for the enhanced conductivity. All-solid-state batteries utilizing the optimized oxychloride electrolyte in conjunction with Ni-rich cathodes demonstrate enhanced reversible capacities compared to their undoped counterparts. This work highlights the benefits of nonclose-packed UCl 3 -type oxychloride electrolytes, offering new design strategies for high-performance all-solid-state batteries.},

The flux synthesis method facilitates the gram-scale production of COFs, enabling their successful assembly into functional pouch cells. As a result, the assembled pouch cell delivers a reversible maximum capacity of 92 mAh g –1 at 0.1 A g –1 , corresponding to a total capacity of 0.92 Ah, approaching the theoretical design capacity.

  abstract     = {Crown ether compounds have garnered significant research interest for decades due to their unique host–guest supramolecular structure and various properties, such as ferroelectricity. However, although many crown ether derivatives have been developed, only the classical crown ether represented by 18-crown-6 was used as the host for crown ether host–guest-type ferroelectrics, and the heterocrown ether-based ferroelectrics have never been reported. Here, for the first time, we propose the strategy of asymmetric coordination through heterocrown ether as a host molecule to unlock ferroelectricity in metal-crown host–guest assemblies. Compared to the symmetrical coordination of the parent M(NO 3 ) 2 (18-crown-6) (M = Pb 2+ or Cd 2+ ), an asymmetric coordination environment for the M 2+ ion was created in M(NO 3 ) 2 (1-aza-18-crown-6), enabling precise symmetry breaking and inducing ferroelectricity. Remarkably, Pb(NO 3 ) 2 (1-aza-18-crown-6) exhibits an ultrahigh T c of 470 K, which represents the maximum value reported to date for crown ether-based ferroelectrics. Such high T c originates from the synergistic effect of disordered rotation commonly observed in the host–guest compounds and the unique out-of-plane flipping motion of the −NH– group in aza-crown ether. To the best of our knowledge, M(NO 3 ) 2 (1-aza-18-crown-6) represents the birth of the first heterocrown ether ferroelectric family. Our findings provide a new way to design crown ether host–guest ferroelectrics with high performance and greatly stimulate the further exploration of heterocrown ether ferroelectrics.},

However, synthetic limitations have hitherto restricted their accessibility to group 8 transition metals. Herein, we present a facile and versatile approach to access such 16e–18e complexes of early transition metals, [CpV(η 5 -E 5 )] 1–/2– , [CpCr(η 5 -E 5 )] − , and [Cp*Mn(η 5 -P 5 )] − (E = P, As; Cp = η 5 -C 5 H 5 ). By utilizing the Zintl phase precursor K 3 E 7 as a reductant, these new complexes can be rapidly synthesized via one-pot reactions at ambient temperature within 1 h. This method enables the preparation of diverse derivatives from [CpV(η 5 -E 5 )] 2– , including the oxidative coupling product [(CpV) 2 (μ,η 4:4:1:1 -P 10 )] 2– as well as its niobium congener [(CpNb) 2 (μ,η 4:4:1:1 -P 10 )] 2– , and the addition rearrangement products [(CpV) 6 P 10 ] 2– and [(CpV)(μ,η 4:5 -As 5 )Mn(η 3 -As 3 )] 2– .

  abstract     = {One-dimensional (1D) carbon nanomaterials have attracted significant attention due to their unique directional confinement effect and electronic structure. Conventional synthesis strategies have struggled to achieve vertically aligned architectures with large aspect ratios, scalable yields, and tunable electronic structures. Herein, we propose a sodium chloride (NaCl) salt-assisted template approach to enable the vertical growth of amorphous carbon ribbons (CRs), which have long-range disordered and short-range ordered skeleton structures, with the attributes of a new type of carbon allotrope. The significance of lattice stability, lattice matching, and molecular structure of precursors is investigated to elucidate the trifunctional roles of NaCl microcrystals as induction, catalysis, and growth templates. Furthermore, an advanced vapor-surface-solid (VSS) growth mechanism, stemming from π–π stacking and polymerization of perylene-based skeletons, is validated to afford the vertical growth of CRs. Strikingly, tunable sp 2 /sp 3 carbon ratios allow for modulating the electronic structure. Correspondingly, the representative CRs are p-type semiconductors with a wide band gap of 3.32 eV, exhibiting rapid responsiveness to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. The free-standing CR films deliver an out-of-plane conductive network, a large permittivity in the X-wave frequency range, and outstanding stability. Our contribution opens a novel roadmap in terms of innovative synthesis and fascinating applications of the 1D carbon family.},

Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that both band-edge and trap-state electrons can transfer to the RAFT agent. The relatively sluggish hole transfer, due to hole localization to copper states, can be accelerated by introducing amines as hole scavengers. The reaction exhibits well-defined characteristics of living polymerization and proceeds efficiently in the presence of a 3 mm biological tissue barrier under 1050 nm irradiation.},

  abstract     = {Electrochemical nitrate (NO 3 – ) reduction to ammonia (NH 3 ) offers a sustainable approach for NH 3 synthesis while concurrently addressing NO 3 – pollution. However, achieving efficient NO 3 – -to-NH 3 conversion remains challenging due to sluggish multistep proton-coupled electron transfer processes and poor intermediate converison. Here, we present a nanocatalyst featuring a hollow nanocavity encased within a shell rich in Cu/Ru heterointerfaces, which synergistically leverages both interfacial and structural advantages to effectively lower energy barriers and accelerate intermediate conversion kinetics, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic performance for NH 3 production. Density functional theory (DFT) computations, supported by operando and control experiments, reveal that CuRu heterointerfaces with their optimized electronic structure act as the primary active sites, establishing a favorable NO 3 – -to-NH 3 reaction pathway. Simultaneously, the catalytic synergy between Cu and CuRu sites enables tandem catalysis, which is further amplified by nanocavity-induced spatial confinement of the key intermediate NO 2 – . This nanocatalyst is realized via a Kirkendall effect–driven strategy, with its structural features systematically optimized. The resulting catalyst demonstrates outstanding NH 3 production performance in a 0.1 M KNO 3 + 0.1 M KOH electrolyte, delivering a Faradaic efficiency of 97.4%, a yield of 152.6 mg h –1 mg metal –1 , and an energy efficiency of 40% at a low potential of −0.1 V RHE ─positioning it as a top contender among state-of-the-art NO 3 – -to-NH 3 electrocatalysts. By elucidating mechanistic insights into interfacial effects, tandem catalysis, and nanoconfinement, this work highlights the synergistic impact of compositional and structural engineering and offers a generalizable design strategy for advancing NO 3 – -to-NH 3 electroconversion and broader sustainable catalytic transformations.},

  abstract     = {Distinct from traditional halide perovskites, which are based on main-group elements (e.g., Pb 2+ , Sn 2+ , Ge 2+ ) and are typically semiconducting, transition metals like Cu 2+ ─characterized by partially filled d-orbitals─offer unique advantages in modulating the electronic behavior of perovskite materials. However, the strong Jahn–Teller effect of Cu 2+ makes it a significant challenge for stabilizing a robust three-dimensional perovskite framework. Herein, we report the first synthesis of a metallic cubic perovskite phase of CsCuBr 3 via a tailored structural design under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction reveals that the orthorhombic nonperovskite CsCuBr 3 precursor (space group C 222 1 ) transforms into a cubic perovskite structure (space group Pm -3 m ) featuring an undistorted corner-sharing octahedral framework at ∼22 GPa and ∼603 K. The perovskite structure remains stable at pressure down to 4.3 GPa at room temperature, while at low temperatures below 50 K, it may be recovered to ambient pressure. Notably, the structure lacks both the expected luminescence and a distinct absorption edge, instead exhibiting a metallic behavior, as confirmed by temperature-dependent resistance measurements. Electronic structure calculations at 22.4 GPa and 0 K further reveal pronounced hybridization between the Cu-3d and Br-4p orbitals near the Fermi level, leading to an enhanced orbital degeneracy and electron delocalization. These findings demonstrate that the lattice contraction effectively suppresses the strong Jahn–Teller distortion intrinsic to Cu 2+ , offering a promising strategy for the design of high-performance novel materials.},

  abstract     = {Enzymatic halogenation of C–H bonds is a promising approach to synthesize chlorine-containing compounds. However, few halogenases chlorinate C(sp 3 )–H bonds of molecules lacking a carrier protein, and only a small subset readily accommodate non-native substrates. Competitive oxygenation of non-native substrates makes their halogenation a challenge to achieve. Herein, we report a strategy for the halogenation of unnatural substrates by which an anchoring group leads them to masquerade as the native substrate. By this approach, a series of terpenoids connected to an indole moiety, undergo enzymatic halogenation catalyzed by WelO5*, a non-heme, α-ketoglutarate-dependent halogenase. By in silico substrate evaluation and mutagenesis, we generated WelO5* variants that catalyze the chlorination of C(sp 3 )–H bonds in a series of non-native substrates with high selectivity for chlorination over oxygenation and with excellent stereoselectivity, as well as variants that catalyze bromination and azidation. Studies that vary the anchoring group showed that a series of heteroaromatic and aromatic groups can enhance reactivity and can influence the degree of chlorination of the anchored menthol substrate. Cleavage of the ester tethering the indole anchoring group to the terpenoid gives the free halogenated compound.},

  abstract     = {Alpha-synuclein (αS) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that can self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, undergoing a transition from disordered monomers to ordered β-sheet-rich fibrils. The amyloid state of αS is implicated in various synucleinopathies, most notably Parkinson’s disease (PD), in which αS fibrils accumulate as insoluble Lewy body deposits. Colocalized with αS in Lewy bodies are elevated levels of metal ions including Zn 2+ . We find in vitro that Zn 2+ accelerates aggregation of N-terminally acetylated αS, decreasing the t 50 ca. 5-fold, as measured by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Strikingly, the extent of Zn 2+ binding (native mass spectrometry; MS) and shifts of the monomeric αS conformational ensemble toward compaction, measured using ion mobility MS (IM-MS) at different αS:Zn 2+ ratios, mirror precisely the accelerated aggregation kinetics. Chemical shift perturbations in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were investigated together with molecular dynamics (MD) to map the Zn 2+ binding sites and subsequent effects on conformation under identical solution conditions to those used in IM-MS. Zn 2+ is found to predominantly interact with negative residues in the C-terminal region of αS but also His50 in the N-terminal region. This promiscuity in interactions potentially guides compaction of the protein chain by bridging residues between the N- and C-terminal regions through Zn 2+ ion co-ordination. This study provides insights into the early stages of amyloid assembly, correlating aggregation kinetics with structural compaction in monomeric αS and highlighting the capability of native IM-MS to resolve complex structural ensembles of a disordered protein.},

  abstract     = {We report on a remarkable phenomenon of interfacial electric dipole inversion coupled to changes in atomic spin densities that translates into the enantiomeric inversion of electron spin-dependent conductance in a 2-terminal single-molecule junction, consisting of a 22 amino acid chiral α-helical peptide sequence connecting two metal electrodes. This phenomenon is conventionally associated with the Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect and how it induces spin polarization and spin filtering of the electron transport along the main peptide axis. Here, the inversion of the spin-dependent charge transport behavior is achieved by keeping constant the chiral symmetry of the junction while inverting the direction of the internal electrical dipole moment running along the main helical peptide axis. Using a spinterface model, in which the electrode-molecule injection barriers are dependent both on the electric dipole and magnetic spin moment, we have been able to rationalize the current pattern as arising from a surface dipole inversion and changes in the atomic spin densities in atoms located within the peptide backbone. Both experimental and computational results show that the observed electric dipole-induced spin-dependent transport inversion in the chiral peptide junction links to an inversion in the spin-dependent resistance due to the combined effect of the helical-based CISS effect and the electrode/molecule spinterface.},

  abstract     = {Organic molecular crystals are stereotypically considered brittle, fragile, and prone to disintegration, especially when under anisotropic shear forces. However, robust intermolecular interactions and subtle molecular packing motifs may enable a crystal lattice with extraordinary mechanical properties. Here, we present an organic molecular crystal composed of a chiral dithiolane derivative ( R - TAE ) that can be cropped and cut into arbitrary shapes by external shear forces. Macroscopic R - TAE crystals prepared through a three-solvent diffusion method can be mechanically torn apart by tweezers or precisely cut into desirable shapes, such as semicircles, triangles, triangular waves, pentagons, and stars, by using ordinary scissors, while retaining high crystallinity and structural integrity. Compared with the racemic crystals ( RS - TAE ), an R - TAE crystal possesses a more flexible and adaptive lattice, enabling the crystal to bend and curl under mechanical stress reversibly. The unconventional yet simple crystal shape programming peculiarity emanates from a specific molecular design and organization that inherently incorporate chiral symmetry-breaking effects in the R - TAE crystal lattice. Moreover, it is revealed that the high asymmetry facilitates effective energy dissipation during the shear force-driven reconstruction of the adaptable hydrogen-bonding network and crystal lattice slippage when the crystal is subjected to shear forces. Instead of cracking or shattering, R - TAE crystals retain their overall morphology intact and exhibit a significant elastic modulus enhancement after ultraviolet-induced disulfide bond reorganization, suggesting robust resistance to photoinduced internal stress. Our research highlights the strategic integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches, resulting in dynamic crystals with desirable anisotropic properties and enabling their precise and straightforward processability.},

However, the currently reported CHOIPs predominantly rely on the molecular chirality arising from the interaction between chiral organic cations and inorganic backbones, leading to suboptimal chiral expression. Herein, we report the synthesis of a CHOIP superstructure film ( R -MBA) x ( S -MBA) (1– x ) BiI 4 , which exhibited significantly enhanced chirality through a subtle enantiomeric excess ( ee ) approach. The implementation of a 20% ee in a mixture of two CHOIP enantiomers resulted in a substantial enhancement of the genuine circular dichroism (CD) asymmetry factor ( g CD > 0.03), exhibiting an increase of more than 50-fold compared to that of the enantiopure film. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the superstructure adopted an identical crystalline phase to that of the pure enantiomeric ones, suggesting that the observed enhancement does not originate from intracrystalline chirality. Integrating theoretical simulations, we posit that the observed chiral enhancement is predominantly attributed to crystal transfer from the nanoscale, defined as the superstructure chirality formed by mixed enantiomers. These findings establish a novel framework for exploring superstructure chirality in CHOIPs, offering new perspectives for future research in this field.},

  abstract     = {Earth-abundant, visible light absorbing zirconium photosensitizers are of great interest for their long-lived excited states. These photosensitizers consist of two electron rich tridentate ligands ligated to an electron deficient d 0 Zr(IV) metal center, coordination chemistry that gives rise to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited states. The vectoral nature of an LMCT transition was expected to give rise to an excited state dipole moment that electroabsorption data reported herein show is in fact absent for these photosensitizers. Electroabsorption spectra of three Zr(IV) photosensitizers bearing two tridentate pyridinedipyrrolide ligands, abbreviated Zr(PDP) 2 , were measured in a 2-MeTHF glass. Analysis of both traditional and higher-order electroabsorption spectra revealed significant changes in the polarizability between the ground and excited state without a dipole moment change. The spectral data indicates that upon the absorption of a single photon a quadrupolar excited state is formed via a simultaneous and equal charge transfer from both tridentate ligands to the Zr metal center. The data presented herein provides the first direct experimental evidence for such behavior in transition metal complexes with charge transfer excited states. The implications for the design of LMCT photosensitizers and our fundamental understanding of symmetry breaking in transition metal complexes are discussed.},

Recently, molecular qubits came forward as precisely tunable entities that present a compelling alternative to well-established yet hard-to-tune point defects in solid-state systems. In this work, we disclose ground-state triplet carbenes as purely organic qubits comprising two unpaired electrons in close proximity that can be generated in a crystalline matrix with high spatial accuracy via in situ photoactivation. We further demonstrate how state-of-the-art multireference quantum chemical calculations provide insight into their fundamental spin characteristics. As a result, several key assets were realized in a single solid-state qubit material under cryogenic conditions: The exclusive use of light elements (C, H, N, O), photolithographic patterning, optical spin-selective transitions, and a large zero-field splitting in the GHz regime, which, taken together, lays the ground for optically detected magnetic resonance with remarkable fluorescence contrast of >40% and record-high spin coherence times of T 2 = 157(4) μs at 5 K.},

Here, we demonstrate that persistent MPs in the environment profoundly enhance ice nucleation and alter precipitation patterns, which may disrupt air quality, atmospheric chemistry, and climate. Degradation of MPs leads to micronization, nanoporosification, and surface functionalization, significantly boosting their ice-nucleating activity. By integrating global airborne MP data with ice-nucleation assessments, we find that micronization alone can increase cloud-ice-crystal concentrations by up to an order of magnitude. This effect is further amplified when coupled with nanoporosification or surface functionalization with the potential to trigger extreme precipitation events and contribute to climate anomalies. Our research highlights the far more severe consequences of MPs for the future climate than previously imagined, with profound implications for atmospheric science, environmental chemistry, and climate dynamics.},

However, degradation of a full protein in a physiological setting might lead to dose-limiting toxicities, giving rise to the need for PROTACs that are activated in a context-dependent nature. Here, we report the development of hypoxia-activated PROTACs (HAP-TACs) which are selectively activated in conditions of low oxygen (hypoxia) such as those found in solid tumors. To develop HAP-TACs, we have attached an indolequinone bioreductive group to an essential functional group of either the VHL- or cereblon-recruiting component of the PROTAC, reducing affinity for its cognate E3 ligase and preventing degradation of the protein of interest. Using BRD4, we have conducted proof-of-concept studies which demonstrate that the indolequinone group is bioreduced under hypoxic conditions, releasing the active PROTAC, resulting in selective degradation of BRD4 in hypoxia. As the bioreductive group is attached to the VHL or cereblon ligand, this approach is potentially applicable to all PROTACs that recruit these commonly employed E3 ligases.},

Through lipid screening, we identified a promising lipid scaffold capable of disrupting the membrane system of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

  abstract     = {Nanofluidics-based reverse electrodialysis offers a promising approach for harnessing the osmotic energy that exists between saline and fresh water, thereby providing a sustainable source of power. Nevertheless, the key obstacle to realizing a commercially viable power output stems from inadequate ion permselectivity in nanofluidics. Here, we engineer dual asymmetric MXene-based composite nanofluidics (DA-MXCNs) composed of a negatively charged, porous MXene layer and a positively charged, confined MXene layer, which strategically incorporates asymmetric channel dimensions and opposing charge distributions. This design simultaneously reduces ion diffusion paths and amplifies ion potential differences, thereby optimizing the ion permeability and selectivity. The DA-MXCNs exhibit a 3.4-fold increase in ion flux (7.71 mmol m –2 h –1 ) over the unmodified nanofluidics, and thus a high Na + selectivity coefficient of 0.985 and a Na + /Cl – selectivity ratio of approximately 65.7, indicative of superior preferential cation transport. Experimental and theoretical evidence supports that the dual asymmetric manipulations not only enable unidirectional and rapid cation transport but also create a high energy barrier for anions and a low one for cations, thereby achieving ultrahigh ion selectivity. Utilizing the DA-MXCNs, the osmotic energy conversion system achieves an impressive power density of up to 126.0 W m –2 , which surpasses the performance of existing MXene-based nanofluidics and shows the capacity for powering a variety of electrical devices. This strategy, grounded in optimized permselective nanofluidics, lays the foundation for advancements in ion batteries and ion separation technologies.},

The orientation of the imine linker controls the donor–acceptor interactions in these π-conjugated COFs, resulting in a large modulation of the valence band maximum (−4.2 to −5.4 eV) and the band gap ( E g ≈ 1.2–1.6 eV). p -Doping of COFs in iodine vapor results in the formation of highly delocalized polarons with an absorption band extending into the far-infrared (THz band) region. Reducing the TANG–TANG internodal distance increases the 2D bandwidth dispersion and leads to the highest (in the series) electrical conductivity (10 –1 S/cm), the lowest conductance activation energy (50 meV near room temperature), and the most red-shifted polaron absorption (λ edge ∼ 160 μm, 8 meV) in the series.},

The oversolubility effect occurs regardless of the activated carbon’s functional groups and level of disorder and is enhanced for smaller pore sizes. Oversolubility is quantified using solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), enabling differentiation between in-pore and ex-pore CO 2 and HCO 3 – . Atomistic modeling of the system, based on a machine-learning model delivering first-principles accuracy, suggests that the effect is driven by an adsorption-like mechanism underpinned by favorable interactions between CO 2 and the pore walls. Our findings demonstrate the unexpected importance of oversolubility for gas uptake in microporous, solvent-saturated carbon electrodes, an effect with direct relevance for improving electrochemical CO 2 capture and conversion technologies.},

We show that SelecTAC B can effectively degrade indicated proteins such as CD40 and ICOSL on B cells from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) without affecting protein expression in other immune cell types. The degradation of key proteins involved in T cell stimulation pathways led to sustained inhibition of B cell functions.

Herein, we exploit facile H 2 activation and reversible hydride transfer from a metal surface to a molecular reagent, the net hydrogen reduction reaction (HRR), to develop a potentiometric method for quantifying Δ G H– of main group reagents recalcitrant to conventional methods. HRR potentiometry is first validated with a benzimidazole-based hydride donor and then applied to uncover the impact of the reaction environment on hydricity. For a benzimidazole-based hydride donor, HRR equilibrium potentials are roughly invariant across solvents, indicating that the solvent dependence of its hydricity largely reflects the differential solvation of H – across media. For formate, HRR potentials and corresponding hydricities depend strongly on water content. For borohydrides, HRR potentiometry reveals that effective hydricity values are strongly influenced by Lewis acid–base adduct formation with the hydride acceptor but are minimally influenced by the countercation. Together with these studies, the advantages, limitations, and practical considerations of the HRR potentiometry method are discussed, highlighting the power of this methodology as a complementary tool to measure molecular hydricity.},

  abstract     = {Atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) embedded within carbon substrates are gaining considerable attention for their high metal atom utilization and exceptional catalytic activity. The coordination structure of the active catalytic center is crucial to catalytic performance; however, accurately characterizing these structures remains challenging due to the inherent structural diversity in real-world ADCs and the difficulty of identifying the light elements (e.g., C and N) surrounding central metal atoms. Herein, we propose a protocol to interpret the X-ray absorption spectroscopy, thereby identifying the most probable representative structures of ADCs. Our method integrates average coordination numbers, oxidation states of central metal atoms, and the specific light elements bonded to these metal atoms. This protocol is applicable to single-, dual-, and trimetal atom catalysts, offering a more rational method for structural assignment. By addressing key methodological limitations in current structural assignments for ADCs, our approach improves the reliability of active site identification and provides a foundation for more accurate structure–activity relationship studies in catalytic systems.},

Here, we report on-demand nonalternating copolymerization of ethylene with carbon monoxide (CO) via a facile tandem gas compensation strategy, which achieves a precision control over carbonyl incorporation with uniform distribution across a broad range (0–50%). Such a synthetic advance offers a unique multiblock structure having short polar segments ((CH 2 –CH 2 ) n –CO−) ( n < 4) and extended nonpolar methylene sequences ( n > 4). Remarkably, the resulting quasi-multiblock copolymer (q-MBCP) delivers a robust compatibilization for polyethylene and nylon blends, thus transforming brittle materials into mechanically tough composites. This work elucidates the mechanistic evolution between nonpolar polyethylene and polar alternating polyketone phases, while offering a practical and sustainable solution to advance closed-loop recycling of mixed plastic waste.},

  abstract     = {High-nickel LiNi 0.83 Co 0.12 Mn 0.05 O 2 (NCM83) cathodes suffer from interfacial instability resulting from cathode–electrolyte reactions and anisotropic mechanical strain within secondary particles. Herein, we present a mechanically adaptive cathode–electrolyte interphase (CEI) engineered via a dynamic covalent network that features a supramolecular ion-conducting polyurethane ureido-pyrimidinone (SPU-UPy) elastomer. The dynamic network integrates cooperative hydrogen bonds and disulfide bonds and imparts exceptional mechanical resilience and autonomous self-healing capabilities that allow it to accommodate volume fluctuations without compromising structural integrity. The SPU-UPy layer is also designed with strong transition metal ion–O/N coordination bonds that greatly enhance adhesion to the NCM83 surface and mitigate transition metal dissolution in the electrolyte. The polyether backbone facilitates efficient Li-ion transport across the interface and ensures a homogeneous interfacial Li concentration during intercalation/deintercalation. Consequently, the dynamic CEI-coated NCM83 cathodes achieve exceptional long-term cycling stability with a high-capacity retention of 82.2% after 400 cycles at 1 C. This work elucidates the critical role of dynamic covalent chemistry in stabilizing Ni-rich cathode interfaces and establishes a new paradigm for the design of high-energy-density batteries through mechano-adaptive interfacial engineering.},

  abstract     = {The development of efficient and air-stable n-type organic semiconductors suitable for molecular n-doping is critical for advancing high-performance, durable organic electronic devices, including transistors, thermoelectrics, and photovoltaics. Machine learning offers a powerful approach to uncovering hidden relationships between molecular structures and their electronic properties, thereby accelerating the discovery and design of promising materials. To support this effort, we constructed a curated database comprising 84 n-type conductive polymers, each characterized by experimental measurements under n-doping conditions with 4-(1,3-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1 H -benzoimidazol-2-yl)phenyl dimethylamine (N-DMBI-H), and augmented with density functional theory calculations to provide complementary molecular descriptors. After constructing the database, we developed a fusion deep learning model that integrates convolutional neural networks with fully connected artificial neural networks to capture both structural and property-based features of the polymers. The model was trained on the data set and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. The model was further applied to a test set of n-type polymers bearing oligoethylene glycol (OEG) side chains, enabling the identification of key physical factors that influence their conductivity when doped with N-DMBI-H. Finally, a double-blind experiment was conducted to validate the model’s practical utility by predicting the conductivity of four BDPPV-type polymers and one N2200-type polymer doped with N-DMBI-H. For the N2200-type polymer and two of the BDPPV-type polymers, the predicted conductivities agreed with experimental values within the same order of magnitude. These results demonstrate the fusion model’s reliability and establish a strong foundation for data-driven property prediction and the design of high-conductivity n-type polymers.},

  abstract     = {Nucleic acid mutation profiling is crucial for early screening, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer patients. However, detecting rare mutations at low variant allele frequencies (VAFs) in clinical samples is often hindered by interference of abundant wild-type (WT) backgrounds as well as incorrect signal readout. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Hybrid Ultrasensitive Nucleic acid Targeted Enrichment and Readout (HUNTER) platform for highly sensitive, accurate and multiplexed detection of low-frequence single nucleotide variants (SNVs). HUNTER leverages pyrophosphorolysis-activated polymerization (PAP) based selective variant amplification to enhance the abundance of rare mutations for improved detection sensitivity. The matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) readout with single-nucleotide resolution further enables precise genotyping across multiple loci. Consequently, HUNTER can accurately detect SNVs as low as 3 copies, with a detection limit of 0.01% in a high-WT background. Additionally, HUNTER enables simultaneous detection of up to 10 target SNVs in a single pot. In clinical lung cancer samples, the HUNTER assay demonstrates 1.6- to 5-fold higher sensitivity compared to the conventional amplification refractory mutation system quantitative PCR (ARMS-qPCR), and maintains 100% specificity across diverse SNV types. With its high sensitivity, accuracy and multiplex capability, HUNTER is well-positioned to emerge as a groundbreaking tool for the detection of rare mutations in precision medicine.},

To address this limitation, we developed the ligand-induced self-complementing tag (LiSC-tag) as a novel epitope tag for live-cell super-resolution imaging and the functional manipulation of cellular proteins. The LiSC-tag utilizes a split FKBP mutant that self-complements upon the addition of small-molecule fluorescent probes. It integrates the compact size of epitope tags with the high brightness and photostability of small-molecule dyes, enabling multicolor nanoscopy imaging using STED, STORM, and SIM. The LiSC-tag exhibits improved brightness and photostability relative to split fluorescent proteins. It is compatible with endogenous protein imaging and can be engineered in tandem arrays to enhance fluorescence signals. Beyond imaging, the LiSC-tag also enables the manipulation of protein localization and targeted protein degradation.},

  abstract     = {Poor water stability of many metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) is a persistent bottleneck toward their practical applications. Hemilabile STAMs (St. Andrews Materials) demonstrate greater water stability, as well as improved adsorption performance under humid conditions, compared to compositionally similar HKUST-1. Yet, the fundamental properties of STAMs remain largely unexplored. Herein, we leverage machine-learned potentials (MLPs) to simulate physical and hydrolytic properties, water stability and adsorption in STAMs functionalized with various hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups. Encouragingly, STAMs are predicted to exhibit high mechanical strength and low heat capacity, which are desirable attributes in adsorption processes. Moreover, defective STAMs are shown to possess greater mechanical robustness than defective HKUST-1. From MLP-based molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that Cu-paddlewheels of STAMs are relatively stable even at high water loadings. The hydrolysis mechanism of Cu-paddlewheels is examined meticulously, and for the first time, we quantitatively reveal a higher energy barrier is required to hydrolyze Cu–O bonds in STAMs than in HKUST-1, unambiguously elucidating the crucial role of Cu···OH 2 interactions in water stability of hemilabile STAMs. From MLP-based Monte Carlo simulations, water adsorption isotherms predicted in STAMs match well with experimental data. Importantly, it is concretely demonstrated that water adsorption in the hexagonal pore can be tailored by modifying the hydrophobicity of functional groups, while adsorption in the triangular pore is affected marginally. Beyond showing that STAMs are promising adsorbents, we provide new microscopic insights into physical and hydrolytic properties in Cu paddlewheel-based MOFs. More generally, our findings suggest that incorporating hemilability is a promising but underexplored strategy for the development of new water-stable MOFs.},

A substantial fraction of GSTP1 tethered interactions represent neo-PPIs that were enriched for splicing factors and nuclear proteins as determined by immunopurification mass spectrometry. LIPT colocalized GSTP1 with serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 1 (SRRM1), resulting in its redistribution from nuclear speckles to cytoplasmic foci. Cancer cells with enhanced sensitivity to LIPT showed downregulation of metabolic proteins that led to altered lipid metabolism and reduced cell proliferation from GSTP1 molecular glue treatment. Collectively, we show covalent molecular glues of GSTP1 can alter localization of disulfide tethered binding partners and disrupt metabolism in cancer cells.},

In this study, we successfully constructed chiral water superstructures templated by a chiral biomolecular assembly under ambient conditions and performed the first investigation of its ultrafast vibrational dynamics by utilizing femtosecond time-resolved chiral sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS). Chiral biomolecular templates were prepared by assembling achiral amphiphilic molecules into chiral superstructures with C 1 point group symmetry at the lipid membrane surface. The formation of chiral water superstructure is dictated by the amide moieties of the chiral biomolecular assembly, particularly by the N−H group with the C 1 point group. The vibrational relaxation time of chiral water (0.8 ± 0.1 ps) is identical to that of the N−H group but significantly longer than that of both bulk water and typical interfacial achiral water (≤ 0.3 ps). This indicates that chiral water strongly couples with the N−H vibrational mode but decouples from nearby achiral interfacial water and bulk water. Chiral water exhibits distinctly different behavior from achiral water. Our findings highlight the significant role of chiral water in vibrational energy redistribution and propagation within biomolecules and contribute to understanding the mechanism of chirality generation and transfer.},

Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are used to elucidate RNA dynamics within RNP condensates. At high salt, where peptide-RNA association is weak, RNA structural changes are discerned at subsaturated conditions. At lower salt concentrations, where association is enhanced, positional order of only poly-A RNA is detected within phase separated RNP mixtures. This method is also applied to study trinucleotide CAG and CUG repeats, alone and in complex with peptides.

Though H 2 O 2 production via photocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction (2e – -ORR) offers a sustainable alternative to the energy-intensive anthraquinone process, competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) severely limits both efficiency and selectivity. Here, we reveal that the strong electric fields on water microdroplet surfaces serve as powerful selectivity switches, directing photogenerated electrons exclusively toward H 2 O 2 synthesis while completely suppressing hydrogen evolution. This interfacial electric field control mechanism transforms ZnIn 2 S 4 -based photocatalysts─commonly dominated by HER─into H 2 O 2 producers with near-unity selectivity and production rates 2 orders of magnitude higher than bulk reactions. Through spatially resolved spectroscopy characterizations and theoretical calculations, we elucidate that the high electric fields on water microdroplets simultaneously enhance charge carrier separation, lower energy barriers for 2e – -ORR, and erect kinetic barriers against HER. Beyond providing an energy-efficient route to selective H 2 O 2 photosynthesis, this study offers valuable insights into selectivity control in other solar-to-chemical transformations without the need for catalyst modification or system engineering.},

  abstract     = {We report a novel electrocatalytic approach that couples water oxidation with toluene oxidation in wet DMF or DMSO electrolyte. Electrocatalytic oxidation of water, a sustainable oxygen atom source, favored hydroxyl ( ·̇ OH) radical formation over hydrogen peroxide and oxygen evolution because the organic solvent molecules suppressed O–O bond formation via hydrogen bonding. Water oxidation was catalyzed by laser-synthesized [NiFe]-(OH) 2 nanosheets supported on hydrophilic carbon fiber paper anodes, enhancing water oxidation activity and toluene oxygenation efficiency. Under optimized conditions in wet DMF electrolyte, toluene oxidation achieved 100% selectivity for benzyl alcohol at an unprecedented conversion yield of 87%. In wet DMSO electrolyte, 100% selectivity for benzyl alcohol was obtained, albeit with significantly lower conversion yield. Combined experimental and computational results reveal a new mechanistic pathway, based on electrocatalytic water oxidation to · OH radicals and protons. Protonation of DMF enabled the formation of H + -DMF– · OH radical complexes stabilized by hydrogen bonding among the radical, protonated and unprotonated DMF molecules, and water. This radical stabilization played a crucial role in promoting benzyl alcohol production. In contrast, DMSO consumed · OH radicals to form methanesulfinic acid, limiting benzyl alcohol generation. The wet organic solvent environment additionally prevented overoxidation beyond the alcohol by stabilizing radical intermediates through hydrogen bonding networks, effectively arresting the reaction after the first oxygenation. Likewise, benzyl alcohol oxidation yielded benzaldehyde, with no overoxidation to benzoic acid. Our findings establish fundamental design principles for selective hydrocarbon oxidations by leveraging solvent-mediated interactions, with broad implications for sustainable chemical synthesis.},

  abstract     = {Membrane proteins (MPs) challenge biophysical and structural biology methods. Native mass spectrometry (MS) has emerged as a powerful tool to study MP structures and their modulation by lipids. We examine the pathways by which three MPs, tetrameric Aquaporin Z (AqpZ), trimeric ammonium transporter (AmtB), and pentameric mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) decompose following collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) or electron capture dissociation (ECD) in native top-down MS. MPs subjected to CAD typically decompose along well-characterized pathways releasing highly charged monomers and low-charge state complementary subunits, but a lesser pathway accessed by low pressure collisions cleaves the backbone into fragments covering much of the sequence. Collisions also rearrange structures, e.g., AmtB subunits rearrange to form novel interactions and/or salt bridges that surprisingly retain a formerly surface-exposed segment despite ejecting the binding interface. MscL dissociation pathways depend on precursor charge-state, a behavior observed in a few soluble complexes, yet unaddressed mechanistically. Salt bridges in low charge state complexes stabilize subunits from ejection while facilitating only smaller, local rearrangements that release covalently cleaved products from transmembrane regions. With fewer opposite charges, on average, higher charge state molecules can rearrange intersubunit salt bridges on the experimental time scale to partition charge asymmetrically and free a subunit. ECD with supplemental activation can retain higher order structures of proteins and inform about the strongly interacting regions that preclude product ion release. With extensive regions lacking ionizable residues, MPs enable key interactions that guide the structure and dynamics of gas phase protein assemblies to be probed.},

  abstract     = {A major challenge in the field of mechanobiology relates to the lack of methods that enable the identification of mechanically active receptors, associated proteins, and the individual cells that display enhanced force generation. For example, potent T cell activation requires the transmission of biophysical forces between the T cell receptor (TCR) and its peptide-loaded major histocompatibility (pMHC) complex antigens. Interestingly, TCR-antigen interactions are highly dynamic, displaying a broad range of force magnitudes between different cells and even within the same cell. Therefore, methods that can chemically tag mechanically active T cells, TCRs, and their associated proteomes, or mechanomes are highly desirable. Such techniques may enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing immune responses and may also have broad applications in immunotherapy. Herein, we report a technique dubbed mechano-ID, which allows for mechanically selective proximity tagging by leveraging DNA-based molecular force probes that recruit proximity tagging enzymes. We demonstrate mechano-ID tagging of T cells using microscopy and flow cytometry, with further confirmation by proteomics and Western blotting of mechanically active T cell receptors.},

We report a nanocapsule with an inner cavity height (14.1 Å) capable of selectively encapsulating fullertubes with a diameter of 7 Å. Results show an increased affinity for encapsulation in proportion to increasing tubular length following a trend of [5,5]C 90 < [5,5]C 100 < [5,5]C 120 < [5,5]C 130 , as deduced from K a values, inferred from competition experiments and corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations.

  abstract     = {The development of efficient covalent organic framework (COF)-based photocatalysts has been hindered by topological constraints on photosensitizer incorporation and inefficient charge transfer resulting from electron localization across the linkages. To overcome these limitations, we report a hyperporphyrinization strategy in a novel COF (HP-COF), constructed by linking porphyrinic photosensitizers to bipyridine N-oxide moieties via imine bonds. The unprecedented hyperporphyrin effect in HP-COF originates from linker-to-linker charge transfer (LLCT) across the imine linkage, as demonstrated by comparison with an amide-linked analogue (NP-COF), where the nonconjugated linkage disrupts this delocalization pathway. Upon photoexcitation, the porphyrinic unit oxidizes the bipyridine N-oxide to generate a pyridine N-oxyl radical, which acts as a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst for C–H bond activation. In HP-COF, the LLCT process enhances photooxidative potential, electron delocalization, and charge transport, resulting in superior photocatalytic performance in metal-free C–H functionalization compared to both NP-COF and homogeneous analogues. HP-COF is readily recyclable and retains its photocatalytic activity over five consecutive cycles.},

  abstract     = {Histidine is among the most versatile amino acids by virtue of its imidazole ring, which is capable of shuttling protons and binding metals at each of its two nitrogen atoms, N π (N δ ) and N τ (N ε ). Despite having a tautomeric relationship and similar basicities, the nitrogen atoms used in copper enzymes are differentiated functionally, with near exclusive N τ -ligation associated with substrate activation sites and exclusive N π -ligation with electron-transfer sites. The results herein show that the innate thermodynamic preference is N τ -ligation to Cu(II) centers, a conclusion drawn from ligand competition experiments at −145 °C between histidine imidazoles within synthetic μ-η 2 :η 2 -peroxodicopper(II) cores. The findings from these faithful models of oxygenated binuclear copper sites in tyrosinase enzymes are informed by spectroscopic data from a series of related complexes with monodentate methylated imidazoles. This preference of histidine N τ -ligation is ascribed enthalpically to greater basicity and entropically to the greater molecular volume of the resulting metal complex compared to its N π -ligated isomer. These results support that the N τ -ligation observed in copper enzymatic sites is the innate thermodynamic form, independent of the protein matrix, while the N π -ligation observed in electron transfer sites is presumably entatic in origin─requiring evolved protein structural influences. This structural distinction provides a powerful indicator of function among the biological copper sites.},

This protocol is validated against experimental data for a range of molecules in acetonitrile, including protonated nitrogen bases, nitrophenols, anilines, and diamines, as well as cobalt electrocatalysts. For simple acids, the NEO approach offers only a slight improvement over conventional density functional theory with the standard harmonic vibrational treatment, whereas for hydrogen-bonded acids, the NEO approach offers more significantly improved performance at a comparable computational cost.

Although it offers great potential for accessing functional polyolefins with novel properties, progress toward this goal has been limited. Here we report a catalytic alternating copolymerization protocol between ethylene and bicyclic cyclobutenes, affording cyclic olefin copolymers densely functionalized with bicyclic cyclobutane mechanophores. The spatial distribution of these bicyclic mechanophores along the polymer backbone plays a critical role in determining the copolymer’s properties, including strength, toughness, and crystallinity. Notably, transitioning from a random to an alternating copolymer structure leads to marked changes in both stress and strain responses. Meanwhile, near-alternating ethylene/bicyclic cyclobutene copolymers exhibit both high optical performance and desirable toughness. Furthermore, the alternating copolymer can be transformed into an unsaturated polymer via force-induced mechanophore cycloreversion upon bulk ball-milling, enabling upcycling into chemically recyclable polymers.},

  abstract     = {To overcome iron starvation, microorganisms often produce siderophores─chelators with high affinity and selectivity for Fe(III). The recent discovery of the siderophore gramibactin garnered significant interest, as it added the C -diazeniumdiolate as a new Fe(III)-binding group in siderophores. Gramibactin is a mixed ligand siderophore, comprised of two graminine residues harboring the diazeniumdiolate donors and a β-hydroxy-aspartate donor. Diazeniumdiolate siderophores have so far evaded crystallographic characterization and few structures of synthetic diazeniumdiolate complexes are reported. To address the gap in structural information, the complexes K[M(III)-gramibactin] (M = Fe and Ga) were prepared, crystallized and their structures solved by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The four Fe–O bond lengths in the two diazeniumdiolates are quite similar, ranging from 1.978 Å to 2.059 Å, indicating an equal contribution in bonding. In contrast, the differing Fe–O bond lengths in β-hydroxy-aspartate reflect the relative donor strengths of the carboxylate (1.997 Å) and alkoxide (1.902 Å) groups. Gramibactin coordinates Fe(III) in a Δ-configured distorted octahedral geometry. The diamagnetic nature of Ga(III) is often leveraged in NMR studies to infer the solution structure of the corresponding Fe(III)-siderophores, which are assumed to be identical. The structural similarity of Ga(III)- and Fe(III)-gramibactin is striking and represents the first crystallographic verification of the assumed isostructural relationship between a Ga(III)- and an Fe(III)-siderophore. By providing concrete evidence, this study promotes Ga(III) as a reliable proxy for Fe(III) in siderophore complexes, with implications for solution structure determination of siderophores and design of Ga(III)-siderophore-based theranostics.},

This method overcomes limitations of previous N -substitution approaches by accommodating diverse alkyl sources, including alcohols, alkyl bromides, and carboxylic acids, under visible-light irradiation. The strategy features high functional group tolerance and offers efficient access to both primary and secondary N -alkyl sulfoximines. Its utility is showcased through the late-stage functionalization of pharmacologically active compounds, natural product derivatives, and short peptides, enabling rapid access to novel analogues with enhanced structural diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the strategic coupling of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl moieties with sulfoximines to achieve a synergistic bioisosteric design.

  abstract     = {For electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR), high-precision manipulation of the single-atomic catalytic centers is significant and remains an issue. Here, we report a support crystal phase engineering (SCPE) strategy by regulating the crystal phase of the ZrO 2 support to modulate its interaction with Cu atomic centers, synergizing the coordination environment of Cu atoms and the local microenvironment for ECR. Specifically, tetragonal ZrO 2 (tZrO 2 ) supports a Cu 1 O 3 structure, and the rich bridging O atoms at the tZrO 2 surface could serve as basic sites. In contrast, the monoclinic ZrO 2 (mZrO 2 ) forming a Cu 1 O 4 structure has weak basicity. The Cu 1 O 3 –tZrO 2 site displays a high activity for ECR to methane, with 3.16 (FE CH 4 ) and 2.54 ( j CH 4 ) times higher than those of the Cu 1 O 4 –mZrO 2 counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR–SEIRAS) reveal that the dynamic *OH on Cu 1 O 3 –tZrO 2 helps to significantly lower the Gibbs free-energy change (Δ G ) for the rate-determining step (RDS). The rich basic sites on tZrO 2 could also facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO 2 and create an H 2 O-expelling local microenvironment to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work demonstrates a facile strategy to simultaneously manipulate the coordination environment of the active centers and the local microenvironment for the catalytic reaction.},

In this work, we demonstrated zeolites as photoactive scaffolds for perovskite nanocrystals that triggered a hydroxyl radical ( • OH)-mediated reaction pathway for selective C(sp 3 )-H bond activation. The as-prepared Cs 2 AgBiBr 6 @ZSM-5 (CABB@ZSM-5) photocatalyst afforded efficient toluene oxidation to benzaldehyde at ambient conditions under visible light irradiation, with >98% selectivity and an exceptional reaction rate of 40.9 mmol g –1 h –1 , surpassing those of previously reported photocatalytic systems under comparable conditions. The host–guest design of CABB@ZSM-5 favored the adsorption of toluene and oxygen molecules and preactivated the adsorbed toluene molecules by Lewis acidic sites within ZSM-5 to reinforce the oxidation process. Significantly, we discovered that the adsorbed water in zeolite channels promoted the • OH-mediated oxidation reaction pathway, offering thermodynamic advantages over the conventional superoxide radical ( • O 2 – )-dominated reaction pathway. The incorporation of Zn 2+ into CABB@ZSM-5 further boosted benzaldehyde production by 2-fold.

  abstract     = {In reactive carbon capture (RCC) approaches, sorbents capture CO 2 from a dilute source as opposed to pure CO 2 and electrochemical conversion proceeds through the bound-CO 2 form, bypassing the energy losses and expense of sequential CO 2 capture, purification, and compression. N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have shown promise as capture agents, with reports of RCC conversion of CO 2 to CO or CH 4 via homogeneous electrocatalysis. However, RCC using NHCs is underexplored with heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, the electroreduction of 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium-2-carboxylate (IPrCO 2 ) was investigated as the CO 2 -adduct form of the corresponding imidazole carbene on Ag and other cathodes. In acetonitrile with dilute water, IPrCO 2 reduction led to formate product at up to 88% faradaic efficiency (FE). Carboxylation of the NHC with 13 CO 2 and subsequent electroreduction led to 13 C-labeled formate, supporting the interpretation of RCC conversion of the carboxylate. Compared to reduction of IPrCO 2 , reduction of the smaller -R group 1,3-dimethylimidazolium-2-carboxylate (IMeCO 2 ) led to much lower formate selectivity (∼8% FE), in part due to rapid degradation of the IMeCO 2 molecule. Ab initio calculations further supported favorable energetics of IPrCO 2 conversion compared to IMeCO 2 , while indicating that a mechanism through carboxylate adsorption is unfavorable and more likely to proceed through a surface hydride. In situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) supported a weak surface adsorption of IPrCO 2 during the reaction. Despite relatively high selectivity conversion of IPrCO 2 to formate, CO 2 sorption and reduction cycling studies showed limited durability of the system due to decomposition of the IPrCO 2 , indicating a need for more reductively stable NHCs.},

This stability is often attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) or reduced water activity. However, by studying the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on platinum in NaClO 4 electrolytes (1–17 molal) using electrochemical measurements, MD simulations, and DFT calculations, we show that alternative mechanisms strongly influence the stability window. Specifically, we disentangle the effects from water activity, the local pH increase, and kinetic and transport limitations arising from disrupted hydrogen bonding and sluggish water transport. We observe a nearly linear relationship between the decrease in the surface water coverage and HER exchange current density. As a result, the HER kinetics is slower: with a 7 times decrease in the exchange current density and a 1.5 times increase in the Tafel slope in 17 m solution compared to 1 m. Our MD simulations further reveal that sluggish water transport within the double layer significantly limits the HER, extending the experimental stability window. Ultimately, in this non-SEI-forming electrolyte, reduced bulk water activity plays only a relatively minor role in enhancing the stability of water-in-salt systems.},

Here we address this problem by reporting an in vitro tau aggregation assay in which AD brain homogenates are used to seed the generation of first-generation tau fibrils in a polymorph-specific manner under quiescent conditions. These fibrils are then used to create amyloid seed libraries from which second-generation kinetic assays can be readily performed. Using this strategy, we illustrate an iterative machine learning method for the identification of small molecules for the polymorph-specific inhibition of the in vitro formation of tau fibrils. We further show that the small molecules selected by this procedure are potent inhibitors in a Drosophila tauopathy model.},

Herein, we demonstrate an engineered vacancy-rich nickel hydroxide catalyst (Ni(OH) 2 –V) that achieves exceptional performance in both C α –C β bond cleavage of β- O -4 lignin linkages and suppression of phenol overoxidation. Through integrated experimental and computational analyses, this study elucidates how the synergistic introduction of cations and oxygen dual-vacancy in Ni(OH) 2 –V contributes to its enhanced catalytic activity. Specifically, these dual-vacancies (1) significantly enhance the interfacial adsorption of hydroxide ions on the 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol (2-PPE) substrate, (2) effectively lower the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (C α –OH → C α ═O), and (3) promote the timely desorption of phenol, thereby preventing overoxidation. The optimized catalyst achieved complete conversion of 2-PPE, yielding exceptional yields of 85.7% for phenol and 96.5% for benzoic acid at 1.40 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (V RHE ). These results represent 2.4-fold and 2.3-fold improvements over pristine Ni(OH) 2 . Furthermore, the practical utility of Ni(OH) 2 –V was validated through the depolymerization of poplar lignin and corn stover lignin, successfully yielding 14.24 and 19.54 wt % aromatic monomers. This research establishes a dual-vacancy engineering framework for precise lignin bond cleavage and offers crucial insights into the structure–activity relationship of vacancy-rich electrocatalysts for biomass valorization.},

  abstract     = {Photoinduced hot carriers generated from the decay of surface plasmons in noble metals play a decisive role in producing green hydrogen gas through the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting reaction, a process driven by visible light absorption. To optimize the utilization of these hot carriers, we employed a plasmonic antenna-reactor model based on core–shell structured Au@Pd nanoparticles (NPs) with an ultrathin Pd shell. In this study, we demonstrate that TiO 2 nanotube arrays (TNAs) decorated with Au@Pd NPs exhibit superior performance with the Pd shell serving as a catalytic reactor that efficiently extracts hot carriers from the plasmonic Au antenna. The photocatalytic performance in PEC measurements increased with higher Pd coverage, and Au 70 @Pd 30 /TNAs exhibited a 2.2-fold higher photocurrent compared with bare Au/TNAs. The enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity observed for Au 70 @Pd 30 /TNAs is attributed to the higher population of hot holes on the surface of Au@Pd NPs, which enhances the oxidation capability for interactions with electrolytes. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectra of Au@Pd NPs revealed a shorter lifetime of hot electrons through electron–phonon (e–p) scattering in Au 70 @Pd 30 NPs compared to Au NPs, indicating suppressed charge recombination and increased hot hole population on the surface. Therefore, this study suggests that the plasmonic antenna-reactor model, critically influenced by hot carrier dynamics, provides a promising framework for efficient photoelectrocatalytic systems.},

  abstract     = {Photoclick chemistry has emerged as a powerful methodology for achieving precise spatial and temporal control in photochemical transformations, enabling various applications ranging from surface functionalization, polymer conjugation, and photo-cross-linking to bioimaging and protein labeling. Despite significant advances, the absence of an unambiguous structure–property–mechanism relationship limits the design and application of photoclick systems in biological and material contexts. Herein, we report a novel strategy for tuning the reactivity and reaction mechanism of photoclick reactions of 9,10-phenanthrenequinone ( PQ ) with electron-rich alkenes ( ERA s) through the design of 2,2’-substituted PQ derivatives incorporating electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs). Our experimental studies reveal that the reaction rate via a direct pathway involving the direct coupling between PQ and ERA gradually declines, while that of the triplet–triplet energy transfer-mediated pathway increases with the stepwise change of substitutions from EWGs to EDGs. Theoretical calculations and transient absorption spectroscopy measurements show that these observations can be traced back to the excited-state energy-level inversion between 1 n π* and 1 ππ* states, which directly affects intersystem crossing yields. Furthermore, the reaction pathways can be modulated by changing the polarity of the solvent. These remarkable findings provide valuable mechanistic insights and establish a robust platform for the rational tuning of the reactivity and selectivity of PQ–ERA photoclick reactions using visible light while offering a unique strategy for the control of photochemical applications in complex environments.},

We monitored the relaxation dynamics of [ 1 M ], following their ultrafast excitation at 266 nm, with femtosecond-to-microsecond mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy in the antisymmetric N 3 -stretching region. Regardless of M, the metallonitrene, [M II (dppe)(N 3 )(N)] ([ 2 M ]), could be identified as the predominant photoproduct through the N 3 -stretching absorption of its remaining intact azido ligand. Accompanying quantum-chemical calculations demonstrate that the N α –N β bond cleavage required for metallonitrene formation is facilitated by an intriguing triplet azide-ππ* state, which is electronically preconfigured for the adiabatic release of a neutral N 2 fragment. This state extrapolates smoothly via a small barrier to the electronic ground state of [ 2 M ], which is the N-centered triplet diradical. No evidence was found for a closed-shell singlet nitrene intermediate, which was previously invoked in the photoinduced formation of organic nitrenes. The photochemical conversion yield was found to increase systematically in the order Ni > Pd > Pt, which was found to reflect an energetic reversal of the lowest metal-centered triplet d-d states and the productive, purely ligand-centered, azide-ππ* state. Our findings thus advocate a simple design guideline for efficient CH-amination catalysts: use strong-field ancillary ligands in combination with 4d- and 5d-transition metals to shift the lowest metal-centered state above the azide-ππ* state, thus eliminating detrimental deactivation pathways.},

These MIPs, characterized by their mechanical bonds and movable component parts, have been extensively utilized across various contemporary fields of chemistry, presenting opportunities for the design of functional materials with enhanced mechanical properties. However, the precision synthesis of MIPs, specifically PRs, with controlled molecular weights and narrow dispersity remains a significant challenge, hindering the progression of well-defined mechanically interlocked materials that exhibit a clear structure–property relationship. Herein, we disclose the controlled chain-growth synthesis of main-chain PRs through cascade metathesis polymerization by employing a catenane-based monomer. A series of PRs with targeted molecular weights, narrow dispersities, and tunable mechanical properties was successfully prepared by adjusting the monomer-to-catalyst feed ratio. The “livingness” of this polymerization was validated through kinetic studies, and the detailed structural characteristics of the synthesized PRs were supported by 1 H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Both block and statistical copolymers were produced in a controlled manner through the copolymerization of the catenane-based monomer with other monomers that can undergo ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), allowing for easy access to PRs featuring different architectures and, most importantly, tunable ring densities. This work significantly advances beyond the majority of previously reported studies concerning the controlled synthesis of PRs, paving the way for the rational design and synthesis of mechanically interlocked materials with desired functionalities.},

  abstract     = {Mass transfer limitations pose considerable challenges in electrochemical synthesis, particularly in high-viscosity environments that are inherent to electrochemically mediated polymerizations. In such scenarios, inadequate transport of redox-active species to and from the electrode surface results in electrode fouling and premature termination of the polymerization. Herein, we have thoroughly investigated electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization ( e ATRP) as a model platform to address the challenges arising from mass transfer limitations associated with electrochemical polymerizations by employing rapid alternating polarity (rAP). In detail, we propose a straightforward strategy for e ATRP employing readily available graphite electrodes within an undivided cell, and we implement a single constant alternating current on a millisecond time scale throughout the entire polymerization process. This method effectively prevents over-reduction of copper catalysts and electrode fouling, thereby facilitating the polymerizations of methyl acrylate with near-quantitative monomer conversions and exceptionally narrow dispersities ( Đ < 1.1). Polymerization kinetics can be further regulated by tuning the applied current ( I app ) and pulse duration. Most importantly, our approach allows e ATRP to be performed with significantly reduced copper catalyst loading (2.5 ppm), while maintaining excellent control over polymerization, resulting in an ultrahigh molecular weight PMA ( M n = 1,598,000, Đ = 1.26). The monomer scope is extended to include methyl methacrylate and styrene. The high “livingness” and chain-end fidelity, as confirmed by the mass spectrometric analysis, enable the one-pot synthesis of a block copolymer PMMA- b -PMA and star-shaped polymer 4- star -PMA. This work could underpin future research on rAP in various controlled electrochemical polymerizations.},

  abstract     = {Type I photosensitizers (PSs), due to reduced dependence on O 2 , have outstanding prospects for cancer treatment. However, it is difficult to manipulate electron transfer of molecules during excited state transitions (T 1 –S 0 ), which makes it a challenging task to systematically create type I PSs, especially with a deficiency of an instructive molecular construction strategy. Herein, for the first time, we proposed the “electron reservoir-pump-integrated” molecular design strategy, that is, “electron reservoir” and “electron pump” were dexterously fused in one appropriate dye, which greatly facilitated the creation of type I PS molecules through the manipulation of spatial electron flow (verified by the density functional theory and spectral experiments). On this basis, we constructed a series of organic small-molecule type I PSs; especially, the prominent type I PS Cy5-NF could specifically produce a large amount of O 2 •– under 660 nm laser irradiation. Notably, without the sulfonic acid groups (electron reservoir) or the electron-withdrawing group (electron pump), both derivatives of Cy5-NF are unable to generate O 2 •– , which fully validated the above strategy. More encouragingly, Cy5-NF could effectively destroy cytomembranes under irradiation and further lead to pyroptosis of tumor cells, which not only ablated the primary/distant tumors but also halted tumor metastasis to the different organs via enhancing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell infiltration-mediated long-term immunological memory. Notably, the “electron reservoir-pump-integrated” strategy represents a kind of modular approach for constructing organic small-molecule type I PSs, potentially offering valuable guidance for future type I PS development.},

Here, we describe a three-step synthesis and MO characterization of a fused octapyrrolyl cyclooctatetraene ( FOPCOT ) which exhibits a record high Verdet constant of a small molecule in the NIR-II region. Notably, the cyclooctatetraene core is constructed in a three-step one-pot reaction whereby a N , N ′-dipyrrolyl acetylene is generated and immediately reacted with Rosenthal’s complex to produce the corresponding zirconacycle intermediate in situ. The cascade is completed with a copper-mediated transmetalation that reductively eliminates to yield the octapyrrolyl cyclooctatetraene. This transformation offers a distinct alternative to conventional methods for pyrrole incorporation into polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

  abstract     = {The crystal structures of intermetallic phases encompass a fundamental mystery about the chemistry of metals: what drives atoms that prefer simple sphere packings as pure elements to adopt complex structures, sometimes with unit cells containing thousands of atoms? We recently developed the interface nucleus concept to interpret their most complicated arrangements in terms of chemical pressure (CP)-driven assemblies of modules of simple parent structures. The predictions of this approach earlier led us to the Pr–Mg–Zn system and the discovery of the modular structure of PrMg 4 Zn 10 built from MgZn 2 - and EuMg 5 -type units. Herein, we present the structure of a second intergrowth compound in this system that exhibits far greater complexity: PrMg 1.6 Zn 5.4 , whose 34.50 Å cubic unit cell contains 2,240 atoms. Its structure can be simply decoded in terms of a 5 × 5 × 5 supercell of the Heusler structure (or alternatively a 10 × 10 × 10 supercell of the body-centered cubic (BCC), structure) embedded with Laves phase fragments. The nearly seamless transition between the Heusler and Laves domains observed here reflects a simple relationship between these structures, in which they can be interconverted by the exchange of a tetrahedron of atoms for a single larger atom (MgCu 2 type to BCC), or vice versa (BCC to MgCu 2 type). Driving forces underlying PrMg 1.6 Zn 5.4 ’s structure are inferred from the CP analysis of the parent structures, which highlight the overcompression of the Pr atoms in a model Heusler phase and the opportunities for relief by expanded environments available at the boundaries between the Laves and Heusler domains in PrMg 1.6 Zn 5.4 .},

  abstract     = {Understanding superconductivity requires a deep comprehension of the chemical structure. The discovery of a new unconventional superconductor UTe 2 a few years ago prompted many detailed investigations of its physical properties. Despite its unconventional ground state being rather well-studied, a strong sample-to-sample variation of superconducting behavior as a result of different preparation conditions has remained largely unexplained until now. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the UTe 2 crystal structure and resultant physical properties by implementing several types of synthetic routes was carried out. The difference between superconducting and non-superconducting UTe 2 lies in the presence of uranium vacancies, on the order of 4%. As a result, the b and c lattice parameters vary, yielding a volume difference of about 0.51%. A subtler difference between samples exhibiting one and two superconducting transitions is driven by local deviations from the translational symmetry in the main atomic arrangement. Several well-pronounced maxima have been observed in the difference density map, predominantly located in the bc plane due to a local appearance of the similar atomic arrangements in different orientations. The extreme sensitivity of UTe 2 to such a small number of defects re-emphasizes the unconventional nature of superconductivity in this compound. Furthermore, this work underscores the importance of a thorough, combined chemical and physical analysis of intriguing strongly correlated materials─in particular for compounds that are known to exhibit nontrivial ground states and exotic accompanying phenomena.},

Layered van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors offer a unique platform, providing new degrees of freedom at the two-dimensional (2D) limit through exfoliation and external controls. Here, we demonstrate tunability of symmetry and electronic structure via halogen substitution in a family of layered vdW tungsten oxyhalides. Substituting the halogens in WO 2 X 2 (X = I, Br, Cl) tunes the bandgap across a broad energy range and modifies the structural symmetry from centrosymmetric to noncentrosymmetric. By alloying WO 2 I 2– y Br y , we continuously tune the polar distortion and optical gap across the visible range. These insights into halogen substitution effects on symmetry and electronic structure lay the foundation for new tunable vdW semiconductors for optoelectronics and nonlinear optics.},

Understanding how this property emerges is crucial to the design of efficient catalysts. Here, for a two-electron reaction, we compare the voltammetric responses of the catalysts for two distinct general mechanisms: the unimolecular pathway includes two successive electron transfers with the electrode and pseudo-first-order chemical steps and was described before (Fourmond et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 141, 11269 (2019)); the bimolecular mechanism includes a single interfacial electron transfer and one intermolecular electron transfer in solution. The general theory of the latter is derived here. The predictions of the kinetic models are compared to data available in the literature, and diagnosis criteria are discussed with emphasis on the shapes of the sigmoidal steady-state catalytic voltammograms. We describe the kinetic and thermodynamic requirements for redox molecular catalysts to work reversibly.},

  abstract     = {Photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) employs light to precisely control the activity of prodrugs, enabling spatial and temporal regulation of therapeutic effects while minimizing systemic toxicity. Transition-metal complexes, particularly Ru(II) polypyridyl compounds, have emerged as promising PACT agents due to their ability to undergo photodissociation via triplet excited states. However, rationalizing and predicting photosubstitution quantum yields remain challenging due to complex excited-state dynamics, solvent effects, and limitations of traditional modeling approaches. In this study, we synthesized nine Ru(II) complexes incorporating a monodentate thioether ligand, a terpyridine ligand, and various bidentate polypyridyl ligands. Upon red-light irradiation in aqueous solution, these complexes showed selective photosubstitution of the thioether by an aqua ligand. Despite similar absorption properties, these compounds exhibited markedly different photosubstitution quantum yields that static DFT calculations failed to explain. These modeling difficulties prompted us to develop a novel triplet-state molecular dynamics protocol using the GFN-xTB method, explicit solvation, and enhanced sampling techniques. Our approach enabled full simulations of the ligand exchange process on the triplet hypersurface and comparison to experimental data. It revealed that both cis and trans substitution of the thioether by a water molecule is possible; it was also able to distinguish between photoactive and photoinactive compounds. Unexpectedly, we found that the deviation from planarity of the bidentate ligand, rather than the energy levels of the different triplet excited states ( 3 MLCT, 3 MC) involved in the photosubstitution reaction, was the primary determinant of photosubstitution efficiency, as it promoted access to the trans photosubstitution pathway. Furthermore, our simulations uniquely identified whether dissociative, interchange, or associative mechanisms governed the reactivity of each complex. These results provide for the first time mechanistic insights into Ru(II)-based photosubstitution reactions in a solvent and offer a practical, scalable computational tool for designing next-generation PACT agents with optimized light-responsive properties.},

Nevertheless, the catalytic asymmetric version of such transformations with quinolines remains a challenging task because of regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective control. Especially the presence of substituents with divergent electronic effects on the aromatic ring presents a regioselectivity control dilemma. Herein, we report highly regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselective dearomative [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of quinolines with bicyclo[1.1.0]butanes (BCBs) by utilizing a chiral Lewis acid-mediated strain-release approach. The regioselectivity and stereocontrol challenges were addressed by strategically designing catalysts with tailored steric bulk that modulated the chiral pocket in response to the electronic and steric characteristics of diverse substrate substituents. This strategy was compatible with isoquinoline, indole derivatives, naphthalene, and benzo[ b ]thiophene, providing highly decorated chiral heterocycle-fused bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanes (BCHs) in moderate to good yields with high regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities (52 examples, up to 99% yield, >19:1 rr, >19:1 dr, 99% ee).

  abstract     = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed from appropriate building units can exhibit both porosity and long-range magnetic order, enabling the modulation of magnetic states via mass transport. In most guest-responsive MOF magnets, the guest inclusions perturb the framework electronically or structurally and trigger abrupt phase transitions. In contrast, spin-active guests can directly mediate exchange pathways, enabling the continuous and controllable evolution of the magnetic order; however, the kinetic pathways of guest adsorption and spin mediation remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the entrapment of O 2 dimers in bottlenecked isolated pores between ferrimagnetic layers triggered a gradual evolution from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism in an isostructurally layered MOF. Systematic O 2 sorption studies revealed a time-resolved shift in the Néel temperature ( T N ) from 17 to 28 K, correlating with the extent of O 2 loading and indicating a cooperative growth of antiferromagnetic (AFM) domains. In contrast, the insertion of diamagnetic CO 2 dimers preserved the original ferromagnetic (FM) ground state. Density functional theory calculations showed that the antiferromagnetically coupled O 2 dimer acted as an efficient superexchange bridge between adjacent ferrimagnetic layers, stabilizing the AFM ground state. These findings provide direct evidence of the guest-induced, spin-mediated evolution of the magnetic phase in porous magnets and establish the entrapment of molecular oxygen as a versatile strategy for finely tuning the magnetic order in MOF magnets.},

However, their operational stability remains a critical challenge. In this study, we unravel the distinct degradation mechanisms and active-site behaviors of FeNC catalysts under acidic and alkaline ORR conditions. Intriguingly, catalysts subjected to electrochemical cycling in acidic media but tested in alkaline conditions exhibit nearly preserved ORR activity, revealing that degradation pathways differ fundamentally between the two environments. With the help of density functional theory calculations, we identify Fe-centered sites as the primary active centers in acidic media, whereas under alkaline conditions─where hydroxyl adsorption passivates Fe sites─neighboring carbon atoms adjacent to nitrogen become the dominant active sites. The Mössbauer spectroscopy results show that under acidic cycling, pyrrolic nitrogen-coordinated Fe (S1) sites suffer a significant loss while the pyridinic nitrogen-coordinated Fe (S2) sites retain high stability. In contrast, during alkaline cycling, Fe site losses are minimal, while the carbon support undergoes more severe corrosion. By selectively engineering the Fe sites and carbon support, we experimentally validated the conclusions on the active sites. This work provides critical insights into the site-dependent durability of FeNC catalysts and underscores the necessity of tailored catalyst design for stable and efficient ORR across diverse operating conditions.},

The Lpt system generates membrane asymmetry by transporting LPS from the inner to the outer membrane. Transport begins with the LptB 2 FGC complex, where the ABC transporter LptB 2 FG associates with LptC to extract LPS. LPS is then passed via LptA to the LptDE translocon. While LptB 2 FGC structures suggest an extrusion mechanism, the role of LptC remains unclear. Here, we reconstituted the complex in vitro from purified LptB 2 FG and LptC, and demonstrate that LptC stabilizes the complex and modulates ATPase activity. Using differential isotope labeling and solid-state NMR including dynamic nuclear polarization, we observed that the LptC transmembrane helix LptC TMH is tightly associated with the transporter in the apo state. Upon LPS or ATP binding, LptC TMH becomes more flexible and samples a distinct conformational space which favors cavity collapse and substrate-coupled ATPase activity. Our data support a model in which LptC acts as a mechanical transducer linking transport and energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {Achieving selective electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in strong acid holds potential to resolve the “carbonate formation” problem yet is hindered by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The interplay between different hydrogen sources (i.e., H + vs H 2 O) and its impact on CO 2 RR selectivity in acidic electrolytes remains poorly understood. Herein, we introduce an immobilized N-containing azole layer (phTA) onto Bi catalysts to dynamically regulate the interfacial hydrogen source in strong acid (pH 0.4). Combining experimental and modeling approaches, we reveal a dual mechanism dependent on local interfacial conditions. At lower potentials with high local [H + ], the protonated phTA layer (NH + sites) serves as a proton relay while electrostatically shielding bulk H + diffusion. Conversely, at higher potentials with low local [H + ], less protonated phTA disrupts the interfacial hydrogen-bond network, impeding Grotthuss-type proton transport, thus suppressing HER through hydrogen source shifts toward H 2 O. As a result, the faradaic efficiency for formic acid (FE HCOOH ) on Bi-phTA significantly increases to 36% at −300 mA cm –2 (pH 0.4) compared to <10% for bare Bi. This work demonstrates the controlled manipulation of the hydrogen source via a dynamically responsive organic layer, highlighting the importance of managing interfacial hydrogen species for enhancing the CO 2 RR in acid.},

  abstract     = {We previously reported that peptides can drive diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into complex, fractal assemblies, but the mechanism behind this behavior remained unclear. In this study, we dissect how surface ligand chemistry governs this process: not merely by mediating interparticle interactions but by enabling structural transformation of the nanoparticle cores themselves. Using a panel of nine ligands spanning phosphine, thiolate, and polyphenol classes, we systematically examine how ligand identity dictates aggregation dynamics, redox behavior, and structural outcomes. Our findings reveal that aromatic phosphine ligands, especially bis( p -sulfonatophenyl)phenylphosphine (BSPP), uniquely promote DLA by facilitating partial ligand desorption and silver surface oxidation, which together enable nanoparticle coalescence and recrystallization into micron-scale fractal architectures. In contrast, thiol- and polyphenol-based ligands either bind too strongly to permit coalescence or lack the electronic features necessary to support oxidation-driven restructuring. We support this mechanism with multiple lines of evidence: zeta potential data demonstrate charge neutralization, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of oxidized silver species in BSPP-AgNP fractals, and enhanced light scattering suggests increased surface heterogeneity. Electron microscopy and elemental analyses validate the resulting architecture and ligand distribution. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for chemically directed DLA and introduce a tunable strategy for building structurally fused, hierarchical nanomaterials for biosensing, catalysis, and soft matter engineering.},

This method features highly efficient, atom-economical construction of chiral allylic amines with excellent regio- and enantioselectivities under mild conditions, and exhibits broad functional group tolerance.},

  abstract     = {Macrocyclic hosts are pivotal in supramolecular chemistry, yet the discovery of synthetically scalable platforms that combine rich host–guest behavior, facile crystallizability, and solid-state functionality remains a challenge. Here, we present the synthesis of a new cyclic BODIPY array, trimer 1 , composed of three BODIPY units linked by m -phenylene spacers. Two dynamic conformers of 1 , namely, cone-shaped c - 1 and partial-cone-shaped pc - 1 , exist in solution and have been characterized by their X-ray crystal structures. These two conformers undergo interconversion in response to changes in external environments, including solvents and guests. Conformer c - 1 is capable of hosting neutral guests bearing electron-deficient methyl groups in solution, driven by collective C–H···F interactions, while cationic guests with ammonium groups are preferentially hosted by conformer pc - 1 . Crystallization conditions were optimized, enabling the preparation of gram-scale crystals of c - 1 with different packing arrangements, designated as c - 1a and c - 1b . Activation of these two samples led to transformations from single-crystal to single-crystal or to amorphous, yielding crystalline c - 1a′ and amorphous c - 1b′ , respectively. Importantly, crystalline c - 1a′ exhibits excellent adsorption capacity and separation selectivity for hydrogen isotopes, benefiting from its permanent ultramicroporosity. In contrast, amorphous c - 1b′ is an effective adsorbent for molecular iodine, with binding interactions fully elucidated through X-ray crystallographic analysis. This work establishes cyclic BODIPY arrays as a highly tunable platform for creating adaptive molecular solids with applications in separation science, moving beyond their inherent optical properties.},

  abstract     = {Reprocessing thermoset polyurethane (PU) using carbamate exchange reactions is a novel approach to recycling PU foam waste. Previous works on PU reprocessing have required carbamate exchange catalysts to be added during the recycling process. However, adding new exchange catalysts increases processing costs, raises concerns about health or environmental damage from catalyst leaching, and would require the reformulation of established commercial products. However, PU foams contain residual synthesis catalysts that might also catalyze carbamate exchange such that existing commercial products might be reprocessable without further modification. We selected 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO), the most widely used PU gelling catalyst, as a representative tertiary amine catalyst and evaluated its catalytic activity using model compound studies. Crossover experiments showed that the dominant mechanism of carbamate exchange varies, depending on the concentration of the free alcohols in the system: DABCO catalyzes both dissociative and associative carbamate exchange, but excess alcohol groups inhibit catalysis of DABCO. The catalytic activity of DABCO in the reprocessing environment was examined through crossover between linear polymers in a twin-screw extruder. Microcompounding accelerated bond exchange compared to the small molecule study due to the high shear force. Model thermoset PU films synthesized with DABCO displayed faster stress relaxation compared to a catalyst-free film. Three commercial thermosetting PU foams were successfully reprocessed into PU films at elevated temperatures using the remaining DABCO or other tertiary amine catalysts incorporated in the PU foams during synthesis. The resulting films maintained the glass transition temperature of the original foam, and the tensile properties of PU films resemble those of the feedstock PU foams (rigid or soft). Appliance PU foams were reprocessed while adding glass fibers to produce composites with a tunable elastic modulus. This study shows the promise of recycling thermosetting PU waste using residual catalysts in PU products without altering their commercial formulations.},

  abstract     = {Radiotheranostics holds transformative potential for precision oncology by integrating diagnostic imaging with targeted radionuclide therapy. However, advancements in this field are significantly hindered by the limited availability of high-affinity ligands that are capable of engaging challenging cell-surface antigens, particularly flat, low-druggability targets such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here, we overcome this barrier through de novo discovery and rational engineering of a disulfide-directed multicyclic peptide (DDMP), dmp10, which achieves a picomolar affinity for PD-L1 by leveraging conformationally constrained structural scaffolds. By combining disulfide-directed library design with iterative directed evolution, we successfully generated dmp10, a ∼3 kDa multicyclic peptide that establishes unprecedented shape complementarity to the expansive binding interface of PD-L1. Preclinical evaluations demonstrated that 68 Ga-labeled dmp10 enables high-contrast PET imaging of PD-L1 + tumors in murine models, achieving a tumor uptake of 13.27 %ID/g at 4 h post-injection. The therapeutic counterpart, 177 Lu-labeled dmp10, effectively eradicated 92.47% of established tumors in tumor models while sparing healthy tissues, thereby validating its dual radiotheranostic utility. The translational relevance of our findings was further confirmed in a first-in-human pilot study, where 68 Ga-labeled dmp10 was well tolerated and allowed visualization of PD-L1 + lesions in patients with solid tumors. This work not only establishes DDMPs as a versatile platform for targeting geometrically complex antigens but also delivers a promising radiotheranostic agent that bridges molecular imaging and precision radionuclide therapy for PD-L1-driven malignancies. Our findings advance current strategies for designing ultrahigh-affinity peptide binders and underscore the untapped potential of multicyclic architectures in overcoming longstanding challenges in cancer theranostics.},

  abstract     = {Hybrid glasses made from hybrid metal halides (HMHs) have shown intriguing properties such as environmental durability, optical transparency, and excellent processability, which have fueled an ever-expanding set of applications. However, due to the melt instability, HMH glasses, particularly with one-dimensional or two-dimensional structures, are still rare. Herein, we report the uncommon one-dimensional chain structure comprising corner-sharing lead-bromide trimers in (4-EAMP) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 (4-EAMP = 4-(ethylaminomethyl)pyridine), whose polymer-like flexible chains enable soft, elastic, and meltable characteristics. By systematically scrutinizing HMHs constructed from face-, edge-, and corner-sharing chains, we find that the chain configurations substantially define the mechanical and thermal properties when organic ligands possess relatively analogous structures. The corner-sharing structure of (4-EAMP) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 crystals offers conformational freedom for melting, which allows stable melt over a wide temperature range of 70 K. The amorphization of (4-EAMP) 2 Pb 3 Br 10 does not significantly reduce the coordination degree of the inorganic framework and has realized high-performance X-ray detection and imaging functions with an elevated sensitivity of 8581.7 μC Gy air –1 cm –2 . Our results present a material platform toward understanding the origin and structural manifestation of melting and vitrification in hybrid organic–inorganic solids.},

  abstract     = {Transthyretin (TTR) is a 56 kDa tetrameric protein complex that plays a key role in transporting thyroxine and retinol. Despite its important biological role, TTR exhibits adverse effects, including disassembly into monomers, dimers, and trimers that then aggregate into disease-causing oligomers and fibrils. Hydration (referring to H 2 O or D 2 O) has been shown to have strong effects on TTR tetramer stabilities; however, probing how perturbation of hydration alters tetramer dynamics and stabilities is challenging. Here, we use variable-temperature (5–50 °C) electrospray ionization and ion mobility-mass spectrometry to better understand the influence of D 2 O and H 2 O hydration on the structures, stabilities, and dynamics of both wild-type TTR and several mutants (TTR L55P , TTR V30M , TTR T119M , and TTR V122I ). Our findings include the following: (i) TTR tetramers in D 2 O have lower average charge states compared to those in H 2 O at temperatures between 5 and 50 °C; (ii) there are fewer disassembly products (monomers and dimers) in D 2 O compared to H 2 O at different temperatures; and (iii) the relative abundances of compact versus extended tetrameric forms are shifted in D 2 O compared to H 2 O. Results from hydrogen–deuterium exchange (HDX) combined with bottom-up proteomics of different TTR mutants are consistent with hydration in β-sheet and interface-forming regions providing tetramer stability. Additionally, HDX combined with bottom-up proteomics indicates that shifts in hydration at the interface are responsible for the observed differences between mutants. Overall, our results show that D 2 O significantly alters the TTR stabilities and conformational entropy, highlighting the important role that hydration plays in protein dynamics.},

Guided by this principle, we designed a flexible porous crystal, NTU-99-NO 2 , incorporating electronegative nitro group receptors into a dynamic framework. This material exhibits unprecedented inverse selectivity: a 2-fold higher uptake of C 3 H 8 over C 3 H 6 at 298 K, 1 bar.

For example, carbene insertion chemistry forms versatile products but relies on two-step protocols that first introduce a photoreactive group and then generate a reactive intermediate via UV light irradiation. Alternatively, direct cross-linking with bifunctional electrophilic reagents enables modification of natural amino acids in a single transformation but proceeds via intermediates with a sufficiently long half-life in solution to capture unfavorable protein conformations. Herein, we report the use of commercially available vinyl thianthrenium tetrafluoroborate ( VTT ) for a single-step cross-linking strategy based on the umpolung of native cysteinyl thiols to electrophilic episulfonium ions in cells. We demonstrate that the umpolung reaction proceeds within minutes in various cell types. Even when competing with cysteine-reactive maleimide or iodoacetamide reagents, the fast cellular uptake of VTT enables efficient intracellular labeling and ensures the formation of products with a short and stable ethylene linker between cysteine and nucleophilic natural amino acids. We anticipate that the fast generation of episulfonium ions, which enable cross-linking without exogenous activation, will assist researchers in predicting protein structures based on quantitative proteome-wide information generated in cellulo .},

We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to comprehend the origins of the counterintuitive kinetic isotope effects (KIEs), which are exhibited by these two enzyme families. Thus, P450s exhibit low KIE values, which indicate the absence of quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) contributions, whereas TauD exhibits high KIEs, which apparently include QMT. Furthermore, the calculations show that the P450 protein-folds compensate for the lack of QMT, by reactivity enhancement due to the favorable interactions of the substrate(s) with the corresponding local electric field (LEF) of these enzymes. By contrast, TauD exhibits higher hydrogen abstraction barriers as well as a significant QMT. Thus, the relative reactivities of the two enzyme-types, toward a given substrate, are determined by the larger LEF in P450s vis-à-vis the higher QMT in TauD. The present manuscript provides a comprehensive understanding of the root-causes of the LEF effects of the protein-folds vs the QMT factors, in modulating hydrogen-atom abstraction reactivity, in two distinct mechanistic strategies, for the functionally analogous P450 and TauD enzymes.},

Dysprosium bis(amide) cations, [Dy(NR 2 )] + (R = bulky silyl, aryl), can potentially show superior SMM properties as more charge-dense N-donor atoms can enforce stronger axial CFs to increase U eff , but these more flexible ligands can also promote under-barrier magnetic relaxation processes that diminish T H . Here, we combine the favorable SMM properties of each ligand in a single complex, [Dy{N(Si i Pr 3 ) 2 }(Cp*)][Al{OC(CF 3 ) 3 } 4 ] ( 1-Dy ; Cp* = C 5 Me 5 ). We find that 1-Dy has large magnetic anisotropy, with U eff = 2191(33) K; this is comparable with the best-performing dysprosium Cp R -based SMMs, but lower than the dysprosium bis(amide)-alkene complex [Dy{N(Si i Pr 3 )[Si( i Pr) 2 C(CH 3 )=CHCH 3 ]}{N(Si i Pr 3 )(Si i Pr 2 Et)}][Al{OC(CF 3 ) 3 } 4 ] ( U eff = 2652(16) K). A combination of the bent N–Dy–Cp* cent angle ( ca . 152.5(2)°) and flexible amide substituents of 1-Dy limits T H to 73 K, which is below the record T H value of 100 K for the bis(amide)-alkene. Together, this work shows that dysprosium SMMs containing one π-aromatic and one monodentate ligand can have comparable U eff values to bis-π-aromatic complexes, but in common with dysprosium bis(amide) complexes, they show a greater sensitivity of interligand angle toward under-barrier relaxation processes. This new class of dysprosium complexes are promising candidates for high-temperature SMMs, and it is likely that large improvements on this first example can be made with exquisite control of molecular geometry.},

  abstract     = {Rechargeable zinc-based batteries are promising candidates for electrochemical energy storage, but their deliverable capacity, rate capability, and cycle performance are limited by conventional aqueous electrolytes at low temperatures. Here, we report an aqueous electrolyte formulation by increasing the chloride salt diversity to maximize both mixing and excess entropies. In a ternary-chloride-salt electrolyte, we reveal that the increased mixing entropy can tune the coordination environments, which disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network and reduces the aggregation of [ ZnCl m ] n 2 n ‐ m n clusters to increase tetrahedral entropies and total pair-correlation excess entropies. The high-entropy electrolyte exhibits a lower freezing temperature, higher ionic conductivity, and diverse and small solvated clusters at low temperatures. Furthermore, the entropy-mediated solvation structures desolvate and access the Zn anode in a parallel process with a high Zn 2+ flux for uniform plating and stripping, which breaks through the traditional sequential isolated desolvation/deposition pathway of large aggregated clusters that induce dendritic anode morphology. The formulated electrolyte endows Zn||Zn cells with stable cycling over 13320 h at 1 mA cm –2 with 99.97% average Coulombic efficiency for Zn plating/stripping and matches cathodes of tetrachlorobenzoquinone, VOPO 4 · x H 2 O or Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 to enable full cells working at −60 °C.},

  abstract     = {Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a promising and selective strategy for treating aggressive and refractory tumors, but its clinical success depends on the development of effective boron delivery agents. These agents must offer high tumor selectivity, structural stability, and sufficient boron content─criteria that current clinical options fail to fully satisfy. Herein, we report a visible-light-driven decarboxylative B–C cross-coupling between boron-functionalized carborane carboxylic acids and dehydroalanine (Dha)-containing peptides, enabling the first synthesis of boron-vertex-substituted carboranyl peptides under mild conditions. This photocatalyzed site-selective Giese involves the reaction of photogenerated boron vertex-centered carboranyl radicals to Dha residues, affording carborane-peptide conjugates in good to high yields and with excellent functional group tolerance. Enantiopure boron-vertex-substituted carboranylalanines were successfully synthesized using chiral Karady–Beckwith Dha derivatives, enabling their incorporation into well-defined complex peptides (comprising 5 and 15 residues) via solid-phase peptide synthesis. The synthetic utility of this platform was further demonstrated through a DNA-compatible click reaction, which enabled the attachment of carborane-bearing motifs to DNA tags. Moreover, B–C coupled carboranylalanines were conjugated to biologically relevant molecules such as nucleic acid aptamers to enhance tumor-targeting properties. Preliminary cellular studies confirmed that aptamer–carborane–amino acid conjugates exhibit efficient tumor cell recognition and uptake. Collectively, this work establishes a versatile and late-stage strategy for the site-selective installation of carborane units onto biomolecules via B–C bond formation, significantly expanding the chemical space of boron-rich peptide architectures and advancing the development of next-generation BNCT agents.},

Copper-based systems dominate C(sp 3 )–N cross-coupling, likely owing to their strong propensity for reductive elimination, whereas other first-row transition metal catalysts have been reported only in rare cases. However, the intrinsically lower reducing capability of copper catalysts greatly limits their application to unactivated alkyl halides─particularly alkyl chlorides─in C(sp 3 )–N cross-coupling reactions. Here, we demonstrate a general copper-catalyzed C(sp 3 )–C/N cross-coupling of unactivated alkyl halides with diverse nucleophiles under mild thermal conditions. The success of this reaction relies on the use of anionic N,N,N -ligands to enhance the reducing capability of Cu(I) catalysts for the reduction of alkyl halides. This protocol accommodates a wide range of coupling partners, including primary to tertiary alkyl bromides and bench-stable chlorides, as well as primary and secondary alkyl iodides, and an array of nucleophiles (such as (hetero)aromatic amines, indoles, carbazoles, amides, azoles, and alkynes) with good functional-group compatibility. Furthermore, the present system provides a highly versatile platform for the late-stage functionalization of complex molecules.},

  abstract     = {A precise understanding of heterogeneous catalyst structure and activity is required to design more efficient, greener, industrial chemical processes. While it is possible to resolve both the structure and activity of a catalyst, their innate complexity means it is nontrivial to unambiguously assign one to the other. Herein, we demonstrate how transient measurements, coupled with kinetic modeling, can be used to resolve kinetics with sufficient precision such that it is possible to resolve the identity of an “active site” over technical catalysts. We find that under CO rich conditions the transient activity and coverage dependencies measured over a Pd/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst during pulsed flow and transient spectroscopy CO oxidation experiments can be quantitatively predicted using a kinetic model derived from ultrahigh vacuum surface science experiments over Pd(111) single crystals. Thus, we conclude that the state (i.e., structure and composition of the active site) of the Pd/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst under reaction conditions is equivalent to that of a Pd(111) surface. Instead of determining a catalyst’s structure and assigning it to activity, we instead propose a new approach: using precise kinetic measurements to infer the catalyst’s state. This approach enables the identification of active sites that have been challenging to resolve using traditional spectroscopic or microscopic methods, offering a powerful and complementary tool for designing new catalysts.},

Depending mostly on the coreactant oxidation, the ‘remote’ pathway is hindered by the slow coreactant oxidation rate and the short half-lives of electrogenerated radicals. In this work, we synthesized a [Ru(bpy) 3 ] 2+ derivative featuring a stimuli-responsive disulfide bond in its linker to the bead. Electrogenerated tri- n -propylamine (TPrA) neutral radicals reduce disulfide moieties, electrochemically inducing the release of Ru(II) labels in solution and thereby leading to an unprecedented mechanism shift toward the more efficient “homogeneous” ECL pathway. Leveraging ICP-MS, ECL microscopy, and finite element simulations, we demonstrate rapid bond cleavage and an impressive signal enhancement of up to 613%. Using an experimental configuration designed to emulate commercial clinical analysis, we developed an ECL-based immunoassay for the rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein in whole virus samples from swab formulations. The immunosensor incorporating the cleavable luminophore demonstrated a 40% lower detection limit and a 2-fold increase in sensitivity, while reducing TPrA consumption by 72%. These findings establish stimuli-responsive luminophores as a groundbreaking class of ECL labels, promising substantial improvements in the sensitivity of commercial biosensors.},

  abstract     = {Photoswitching molecules like the azoarenes have myriad potential applications, ranging from energy storage to targeted drug delivery. Upon irradiation, azoarenes convert from an E -form to a Z -form. The Z -form can thermally revert to the E -form through a classical-adiabatic or a triplet-assisted rotational mechanism. We show that strategic placements of heteroatoms and substituents can modulate spin delocalization in the triplet state, thereby tuning the S 0 –T 1 –S 0 crossing points. Increased spin delocalization lowers the crossing point and shortens the thermal half-life of the Z -form. Computed spin densities at the diazo N atoms, along with computed S 0 –T 1 –S 0 crossing points, activation entropies, and rate constants for 15 azoarenes are compared with available experimental data. There is evidence that some of the studied Z – E isomerizations proceed simultaneously via a classical-adiabatic and a triplet-assisted mechanism. The ratio of the two reaction pathways is temperature-dependent. Triplet spin density at the diazo N atoms is recognized as a useful indicator for predicting the thermal half-lives of these species.},

MGDs offer a promising therapeutic approach by selectively eliminating disease-associated proteins; however, their rational design and discovery have historically remained a significant challenge. The field remains constrained by a lack of strategies to effectively utilize ubiquitin ligases (E3s) for TPD, thus missing the therapeutic potential offered by tissue-specific E3 expression. In this study, we developed ZZ7, a molecular glue degrader that selectively degrades BRD9, a critical component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, specifically in synovial sarcoma cells, while sparing cardiomyocytes. The discovery of ZZ7 was driven by a “chemocentric” approach, incorporating a cysteine-reactive, reversible covalent warhead into a BRD9 inhibitor to transform its function from inhibition to degradation. ZZ7 covalently engages DCAF16 at Cys178, an E3 ligase that is highly expressed in synovial sarcoma cells but relatively underexpressed in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, leveraging a cysteine residue that has not been previously exploited. These findings pave the way for new strategies in tissue- and disease-specific precision therapies, particularly for malignancies characterized by an elevated level of DCAF16 expression.},

However, electrocatalysts capable of achieving both high Faradaic efficiency for CO reduction to n -propanol and long-term durability remain scarce. While monometallic and bimetallic dilute Cu-based alloys have been studied extensively for electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) and CORR, multimetallic (≥5 elements) electrocatalysts are less explored. Here we screen and investigate the electrocatalytic CORR performance of multimetallic electrocatalysts. Notably, the ZnSnAuBiCuO catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiencies (FE) of 47 ± 1% for n -propanol production, while demonstrating stable performance for 60 h at 100 mA cm –2 . The enhanced CORR performance is attributed to the higher grain boundary density and the higher Cu valence state compared to CuO. Calculation is consistent with the possibility that grain boundaries are, in the context of n -propanol production, energetically favorable, compared to within-grain sites. The stable electrosynthesis of n -propanol with high FE by ZnSnAuBiCuO may motivate the exploration of other multimetallic systems, which have vast compositional space.},

Under humid air and dissolved CO 2 , aluminum current collectors undergo sustained oxidative dissolution, releasing electrons that selectively reduce transition metals (TM) in the layered oxide to TM(II). This redox reaction triggers H + insertion, Li + /H + exchange, and lattice destabilization, forming Li x H y TMO 2 intermediates that spontaneously coordinate with CO 3 2– to yield TMCO 3 or Ni 2 (OH) 2 CO 3 , while Li + precipitates as Li 2 CO 3 .

Their appeal is countered by the stability challenges arising from inherent lattice softness and labile surface ligand bonding. Recent ligand design efforts have drastically improved the structural integrity of LHP NCs by pursuing strongly and statically bound ligands, as found with zwitterionic headgroups. Here, we venture into a new class of cationic ligands featuring guanidinium headgroups, which combine the compactness of primary ammoniums with the deprotonation resistance of quaternary ammoniums. We reasoned that strong yet dynamic ligand binding offers distinct benefits. A library of aliphatic guanidinium molecules was synthesized and surveyed as capping ligands for CsPbBr 3 , FAPbBr 3 , and CsPbI 3 NCs, enabling up to 95% photoluminescence quantum yields for bromide compositions. We then compare binding behavior of guanidinium ligands with those of other widely used ligands. Zwitterionic ligands phosphocholines and phosphoethanolamines bind more strongly than sulfobetaines and quaternary ammonium ligands, yet all these headgroups impart relatively static binding with exchange rates below 5 s –1 . Primary ammonium ligands are champions in dynamicity but lag behind in ligand-coverage retention and, hence, long-term stability. Guanidinium ligands strike a favorable balance: they match the binding dynamics of primary ammonium ligands while significantly enhancing binding strength, enabling rigorous purification and compatibility with relatively polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. We then showcase the benefits of dynamically bound ligands in photocatalytic C–C coupling reactions.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) to ammonia (NH 3 ) is a promising route for sustainable NH 3 synthesis. Cu-based materials are the most used and promising catalysts for this reaction. However, Cu undergoes uncontrollable compositional and structural changes under NO 3 RR conditions, necessitating a deeper understanding of the relationship between precatalyst features, structural evolution, and catalytic performance for the advancement of current catalyst design rules. Here, we exploit well-defined Cu and Cu oxide nanocrystals (NCs) as precatalysts to elucidate these correlations. We find that the size, shape, and oxide content of the Cu precatalysts all play a role in driving structural evolution and, thus, the catalytic behavior during NO 3 RR. In particular, a higher oxide content, an optimized {111}/{100} facet ratio, and the spatial proximity of these facets forming grain boundaries within the active catalysts emerge as key factors to enhance NH 3 selectivity. Among the studied Cu precatalysts, 10 nm Cu spheres integrate these key features, achieving a competitive NH 3 production rate compared to the state of the art. This work links pre- and in situ-formed catalyst features to catalytic performance, offering insights into the morphological dynamics of Cu catalysts under NO 3 RR conditions.},

However, light scattering limits the applications of photo-uncaging in opaque specimens or tissues. Here, we introduce sono-uncaging , a process in which a chemical functional group becomes exposed upon the application of ultrasound, which can be applied and focused in optically opaque materials. We engineered gas vesicles (GVs), air-filled protein nanostructures sensitive to ultrasound, to contain cysteines on their concealed inner surface, hypothesizing that the application of ultrasound would collapse the GV shell and reveal the cysteines. The resulting SonoCage construct reacted with monobromobimane (mBBr), a fluorogenic, thiol-reactive molecule, only after treatment with ultrasound, establishing the sono-uncaging proof of concept. We then demonstrated the spatial patterning capability of sono-uncaging by embedding the SonoCages in an mBBr-containing hydrogel and creating fluorescent patterns with phased array ultrasound. This patterning could be accomplished using a diagnostic imaging transducer with mild ultrasound conditions. This work establishes sono-uncaging as a method for spatiotemporal control over chemical reactivity using widely available ultrasound technology.},

Here, we report a high-valent chromium(V)-mediated strategy for synthesizing multisubstituted hydrazine derivatives via ligand migration, representing ligand migration to N α in a Cr-hydrazido complex. Our approach begins with the oxidation of chromium(IV) hydrazido precursor 1 by benzyl bromide, which replaces the 1,2-bis(diethylphosphino)ethane (depe) ligand with two bromide ions to generate the high-valent chromium(V) dibromide hydrazido complex 2 . Sequential ligand metathesis of 2 with aryl Grignard reagents (ArMgBr, Ar = biphenyl, p -methylphenyl, o -methoxyphenyl), alkenyl or alkyl Grignard reagents (1-phenylvinylmagnesium bromide and isopropylmagnesium bromide), followed by ligand migration from the Cr center to the N α atom and electrophilic trapping (MeOH, PhCH 2 Br), affords structurally diverse hydrazines ( 4a–c , 5a–c , and 6 ). Single-crystal X-ray crystallography, in situ UV–vis spectroscopy, and DFT calculations collectively reveal a ligand migration mechanism in chromium chemistry, directly forging N–C bonds from N 2 without ammonia intermediates. This migration not only constructs new N–C bonds but also enables the direct construction of complex hydrazine structures directly from N 2 .},

  abstract     = {The role of the equatorial ligands and their influence on the electronic structures and bonding properties of uranyl and other actinyls are not well understood and are thus at the forefront of actinide research. In the study presented here, we found that the good energy match of uranyl(VI) with F – valence orbitals leads to substantial changes in the uranyl electronic structure, compared to uranyl–Cl – and uranyl–Br – . The good energy match between uranyl(VI) and F – likely enhances the stability of the uranyl–F – bond, contributing to the higher U–F – affinity in aqueous solution compared to uranyl–Cl – /Br – , which is also demonstrated for plutonyl(VI). These findings are based on studies of equatorial and axial ligand covalency in three uranyl halides: NaRb 8 (UO 2 ) 5 F 19 ·2H 2 O, Rb 2 UO 2 Cl 4 ·2H 2 O, and Rb 2 UO 2 Br 4 ·2H 2 O. We describe covalent uranium–halide interactions, following the trend Br – ≈ Cl – > F – . Ligand K-edge XANES and DFT (including TDDFT and LFDFT) reveal significant electronic structure differences, with the F-based compound having a uranyl-based HOMO, while Cl- and Br-based compounds show predominant ligand p character in the HOMO. A newly introduced theoretical index evaluates bond covalency.

  abstract     = {Despite mounting evidence that the air–water interface or microdroplet geometry has no bearing on the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) down to a 50 nM limit of detection, the debate persists. Recent studies have demonstrated connections between the spontaneous formation of hydroxyl (HO • ) radicals and H 2 O 2 in sprayed microdroplets and the solution pH, dissolved salts, nebulizing gas, and gaseous environment. Among the halides, chloride (Cl – ), bromide (Br – ), and iodide (I – ), the studies found that Br – dominated H 2 O 2 formation because of its enhanced fractionation at the air–water interface and ability to donate electrons. The studies also suggested that H 2 O 2 production at the air–water interface scales with the alkalinity of water. In response, this report employs a comprehensive set of techniques, encompassing nuclear magnetic resonance, potentiodynamic polarization, electron microscopy, and H 2 O 2 assay kit fluorometry, to examine these claims. The experiments reveal that the air–water interface or microdroplet geometry does not drive H 2 O 2 formation, regardless of the presence of halide in water. The reduction of oxygen gas (O 2 ) at the solid–water interface produces H 2 O 2 (i.e., in the absence of O 2 , no H 2 O 2 is formed regardless of the halide). This work explains the relative dependence of H 2 O 2 concentrations on halides based on their propensity to drive pitting corrosion (Cl – > Br – > I – ). As pits appear in the passivating layer, exposing the metal, H 2 O 2 is consumed during further oxidation. This work also disproves the claim that alkalinity drives H 2 O 2 formation, as it demonstrates that aluminum and titanium surfaces generate higher H 2 O 2 concentrations in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Taken together, this report provides alternate explanations for the observations that should help draw the debate toward its closure.},

  abstract     = {Overcoming the challenges of precise localization, prolonged retention, and targeted release remains a fundamental barrier in the development of effective oral drug delivery systems. These limitations are particularly critical in diseases requiring site-specific action within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Inspired by the trotline fishing technique, where multiple hooks are suspended along a main line to increase capture efficiency, we present a smart oral drug delivery platform featuring trotline-inspired mesoporous carriers with dynamic anchoring capability. This delivery system integrates three key components: (1) a trotline-inspired bioadhesive carrier, consisting of carbon nanotube (CNT) decorated with multiple submicrometer-scale periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO) “hooks” (denoted as CNT@PMOs or CNTP); (2) therapeutic drugs loaded within the PMO mesopores (such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) for IBD); (3) a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive camouflage polymer coating, designed to modulate site-specific adhesion and on-demand drug release. Following oral administration, the outer polymer coating effectively shields the PMO hooks, facilitating safe passage through the stomach and healthy intestinal regions. Upon reaching inflamed sites in the intestine, the elevated ROS levels trigger the degradation of the polymer coating, exposing the PMO hooks. This controlled unmasking enables selective adhesion to inflamed tissues and prolongs local drug retention. Simultaneously, degradation of the polymer also triggers controlled release of 5-ASA at the lesion site. The one-dimensional, multihooked design further enhances mechanical interlocking with the intestinal mucosa, anchoring the carrier at the desired site. Importantly, the system shows minimal systemic exposure, with nearly 100% fecal excretion of unabsorbed carriers within 72 h. By integrating stimuli-responsive activation, dynamic anchoring, and spatiotemporal drug release, this platform addresses long-standing barriers in oral drug delivery. It offers a broadly applicable strategy for enhancing therapeutic precision and efficacy in GI-targeted treatments and beyond.},

However, their practical application is still hindered by inhomogeneous aluminum deposition, hydrogen evolution reaction, and corrosion during cycling, especially under extreme temperatures and high load conditions. In this study, a hydrated eutectic electrolyte composed of Al(ClO 4 ) 3 ·9H 2 O and methyl carbamate in a 1:4 molar ratio was designed to improve the stability of aqueous aluminum ion batteries across a wide temperature range. The optimized electrolyte forms a water-deficient, weakly solvated structure, [Al 3+ (MC) 2 (H 2 O) 2 (ClO 4 – ) 2 ] + , which kinetically promotes a homogeneous aluminum deposition/stripping behavior. In addition, this electrolyte facilitates the formation of a dense, anion-rich solid electrolyte interface layer on the aluminum anode surface, maintaining long-term anode stability. The Al//Al symmetric cell demonstrated stable cycling for 600 h at a current density of 0.2 mA cm –2 , while the Al//polyaniline (PANI) full battery maintained a specific capacity of 117.7 mAh g –1 (based on the mass of PANI) after 1100 cycles at 1 A g –1 .

  abstract     = {Ni-rich layered oxides (LiNi x Co y Mn z O 2 , x > 0.6) have garnered significant attention in electric transportation due to the high energy density (>700 Wh/kg). Traditional synthesis of Ni-rich cathodes typically involves high-temperature (>700 °C) long-duration (∼10 h) sintering procedures, which not only increase energy consumption but also present challenges in precisely controlling the synthesis conditions. Here we designed a two-step tandem topotactic phase-transition route that allows low-temperature synthesis of Ni-rich cathodes. Temperature-resolved X-ray scattering techniques combined with ex situ spectroscopy experiments substantiated that the layered hydroxide precursor first transformed to a layered oxyhydroxide intermediate through a topotactic deprotonation reaction, which was then converted to Ni-rich layered oxide cathode by a rapid topotactic lithiation. Radically distinguished from the destruction-reconstruction process of layered structures in the conventional synthesis route, the layered framework was maintained throughout the whole topotactic route, lowering the energy barrier of synthetic kinetics and thus enabling the successful preparation of Ni-rich cathodes at low temperature (150 °C), which brings an unprecedented reduction of energy consumption (by 57%) and considerable cost-savings. Furthermore, Ni-rich cathodes synthesized through the topotactic route exhibited comparable electrochemical activity and even better cycling stability (∼80% after 500 cycles) than those synthesized through conventional routes. This work presents an enlightening methodology of Ni-rich layered cathode synthesis, laying a substantial foundation for cost-effective and eco-friendly production of high-performance cathode materials on an industrial scale.},

  abstract     = {The interaction and steric stability of colloidal nanocrystals are determined by the interplay of various contributions, including van der Waals, dipole–dipole, and solvation forces. Recent simulations have unveiled that the solvation force dictates the colloidal stability of two-dimensional nanomaterials with no experimental validation. Here, we introduce optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy (OPTP) as a novel approach to track the colloidal aggregation of two-dimensional nanoplatelets. We show that far below the saturation concentration previously determined by scattering methods, OPTP can already report nanoscale aggregations by sensitively probing the short-range free carrier photoconductivity arising from internanoplatelet electronic coupling. Combining the OPTP and molecular dynamics simulations allows us to (1) confirm that increasing the nanoplatelet base facet area results in enhanced solvation force and thus aggregation tendency, and (2) demonstrate that the attraction between the nanoplatelets increases with their chain length for n -alkane solvents. Finally, we extend our simulations to study the shape of the interaction that can be tuned via the isomer of the solvent molecules. Our results provide not only a new sensitive tool to probe the aggregation effects of semiconducting colloidal particles but also fundamental insights into the critical parameters to engineer colloidal stability.},

  abstract     = {Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) represent an intriguing class of quantum materials that bridge the gap between half-metallic ferromagnets and conventional semiconductors, offering promising avenues for spintronic applications. The discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetism in ultrathin two-dimensional van der Waals crystals has further fueled interest in exploring magnetism at the ultimate two-dimensional limit. Here, we demonstrate the growth of environmentally stable, atomically thin Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 nanosheets via a simple hydrothermal method. These nanosheets exhibit robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature of ∼100 K and remarkably, host a spin-gapless semiconducting (SGS) state, distinct from the well-known half-metallic Weyl ferromagnetism observed in the bulk counterpart. Structural analysis reveals that enhanced lattice distortion and strain effects in the nanosheets, induced by reduced dimensionality and surface defects, play a critical role in stabilizing this phase. Williamson-Hall analysis confirms the presence of strain, while DFT calculations reveal that strain-induced lattice distortions annihilate the Weyl points and the emergence of SGS semiconductivity. Charge transport measurements indicate a Mott variable-range hopping mechanism, while temperature-dependent conductivity suggests a coexistence of semiconducting and weakly gapless features. These findings not only establish atomically thin Co 3 Sn 2 S 2 nanosheets as a novel platform for SGS physics but also open up exciting possibilities for strain-engineered topological phases and next-generation spintronic and quantum technologies.},

  abstract     = {Natural oligosaccharides and aminoglycosides are important sources of new drug candidates, especially in the development of antibiotics. In the past, discovering novel saccharides has been time-consuming and costly. However, the rapid expansion of high-throughput data, including genomic and mass spectrometry data sets, has greatly increased opportunities for natural saccharide discovery. Yet, due to the complex biosynthesis pathways of saccharides, no existing method can predict their structures with high precision. To address this, we introduce Seq2Saccharide, a tool designed to automate saccharide natural product discovery by integrating both genomic and mass spectrometry data. To enhance accuracy, Seq2Saccharide predicts hundreds or thousands of putative structures for each gene cluster. The correct structure is then identified from these predictions using a mass spectral search. Benchmarks against saccharides in the MiBIG database show that Seq2Saccharide outperforms existing methods in predicting the structure of saccharides. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis indicates that the variable search module can correct mispredictions from genome mining. By searching genomic and mass spectrometry data of microbial strains, Seq2Saccharide correctly identified the biosynthetic gene cluster for the polysaccharide oligosaccharide trestatin B.},

  abstract     = {Chromophore radicals (CR) are emerging as important components for molecular quantum information science (QIS), especially in the context of quantum sensing. Here, we demonstrate that the optically hyperpolarized electrons in a 1,6,7,12-tetrakis(4- tert -butylphenoxy)-perylene-3,4,9,10-bis(dicarboximide) (tpPDI) covalently linked to a partially deuterated 1,3-bis(diphenylene)- d 16 -2-phenylallyl radical (BDPA- d 16 ) can be coherently manipulated via pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) methods to transfer polarization to nuclear spins and back. Under light illumination at 85 K, electron hyperpolarization in BDPA is enhanced 2.1- to 2.4-fold over thermal polarization and lasts for more than 100 ms. By applying nuclear orientation via electron spin-locking (NOVEL) DNP, this optically amplified electron hyperpolarization was successfully transferred to a 1 H nuclear spin within the CR system and efficiently returned to the electron spin for readout via reverse-NOVEL. The NOVEL transfer efficiency of 65% amounts to a 688-fold nuclear spin hyperpolarization of the target nuclear spin, considering the 2.1-fold electron spin hyperpolarization. This reversible coherent manipulation of hyperpolarization transfer highlights the utility of CR systems to initialize and read out nuclear spin states in a disordered matrix at moderate cryogenic temperatures. Coupled with CRs’ environmental compatibility, tunability, and precise state initialization, these results highlight the promising role of nuclear spins in CRs for QIS applications, including quantum sensing and memory.},

However, conventional synthetic methods have faced substantial challenges in achieving regulatable crystal phases and lack precise control over catalyst composition at the atomic level, which is detrimental, especially for reactions involving multiple intermediates. Here, we report a facile strategy for simultaneously regulating the crystal phase and composition (Pt single-atom alloying) of ultrathin Ru nanocages (<2 nm in thickness), enabling efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that both the metastable face-centered cubic (fcc) Ru phase and isolated Pt atoms contribute to stabilizing metallic Ru, facilitating Pt–Ru synergy for optimized adsorption of H* and *OH intermediates and accelerated HER kinetics. Consequently, the Pt–Ru fcc single-atom alloy nanocages exhibit impressive alkaline HER performance, with an overpotential as low as 8.5 mV at 10 mA cm –2 , an 18.0-fold enhancement in mass activity relative to commercial Pt/C and commendable stability over 400 h of operation at ampere-level current densities.

However, 3.5 V oxide-type cathodes (e.g., NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 ) may suffer from interfacial contact loss with solid electrolytes due to their intrinsic rigidity, resulting in irreversible capacity degradation during cycling. Herein, we report a highly deformable chloride cathode, NaFeCl 4 , displaying Young’s modulus of only 1.33 GPa and excellent structural reversibility. Benefiting from the soft lattice, the NaFeCl 4 cathode maintains a crack-free morphology despite significant changes in structural units between tetrahedra [Fe 3+ Cl 4 ] and octahedra [Fe 2+ Cl 6 ] upon repeated Na + insertion/extraction, achieving a high capacity retention of 84.4% over 500 cycles. Moreover, with only 5.2% of the cost of the NaNi 1/3 Fe 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 and 3.7% of the cost of Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 cathode, NaFeCl 4 can deliver a working voltage of ∼3.45 V vs Na + /Na and energy density of ∼405 Wh kg –1 .

While parent methylene possesses a triplet ground state (σ 1 π 1 ), substituents are capable of stabilizing the singlet as the ground state (σ 2 π 0 or σ 0 π 2 ) by altering the frontier orbital energies. Here, we reveal that the 1,2[I]-shift isomer of 2-iodopyridine, the N -iodo Hammick intermediate, features a resonance between its carbene σ and N–I bond σ* orbitals, rendering them frontier orbitals. This singlet carbene is efficiently generated via UV photolysis of 2-iodopyridine in solid neon at 4.4 K and reacts with molecular hydrogen – but not deuterium – via N–I bond cleavage enabled by quantum tunneling. Instanton theory computations demonstrate the preference for a concerted hydrogen addition mechanism at elevated temperatures, while hydrogen atom abstraction dominates below 100 K despite a higher kinetic barrier for this process. Our findings introduce an unprecedented carbene class, unlocking new opportunities for reactivity and electronic structure explorations.},

Herein we report a unique light-responsive proton/water transport system using self-assembled acylhydrazone-imidazole channels with tunable activity via E – Z isomerization. Three channel-forming molecules with varying alkyl chains were synthesized, namely, 1a (C4), 1b (C8), and 1c (C12). The photoswitching behavior of the molecule was confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy within the liposome. The crystallographic analysis revealed that the E -isomer forms an H-bonded proton transport pathway mediated by water molecules. Patch clamp assays confirmed proton channel formation for 1a with a transport rate of 2.18 × 10 7 H + /s/channel and high proton selectivity over other ions. Ion transport assays with EYPC-LUVs entrapped with HPTS and NaCl revealed the complete rejection of external cations and anions. The compounds demonstrated significant proton transport when combined with valinomycin, indicating transmembrane proton transport for 1a – c . Upon irradiation at 310 nm, all derivatives showed increased proton transport rates, which subsequently decreased after exposure to 365 nm, confirming the photoresponsive behavior of the system. A similar trend was observed in water transport, where the single-channel permeability of 1a increased from 6.5 × 10 6 to 3.5 × 10 7 water molecules/s/channel upon switching from the E to Z isomers, then decreased to 1.8 × 10 7 after reverting to the E conformer. Molecular simulation confirmed that stable supramolecular porous water crystal patches may form, featuring multivalent water H-bonding to acylhydrazone and imidazole units that serve as water-cluster relays within the channel.},

Powering molecular motors with visible light, especially in the low-energy green, yellow, and red regions, has been a significant challenge, limiting their further application. Herein, we report a general and versatile strategy to overcome this challenge and drive molecular motors using low-energy, low-intensity, noncoherent light across the visible spectrum. Our approach is achieved by simply mixing molecular motors with semiconductor colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and a triplet mediator (9-anthracenecarboxylic acid). The size-tunable absorption of QDs can precisely match the desired color for activating the motor. The mechanism of our design relies on the unique property of QDs, which can efficiently sensitize molecular triplets. Through two-step triplet energy transfers, the rotation of the motor can be efficiently activated using low-energy photons. For the first time, we accomplished driving molecular motors at wavelengths beyond 530 nm under low-intensity and noncoherent light. This breakthrough not only expands the capabilities of visible-light-activated molecular systems to operate in a broad wavelength range but also opens numerous opportunities toward controlling dynamic functions while circumventing competing photochemical processes (i.e., photodegradation).},

Herein, we discover that electrolyte degradation is strongly associated with bulk decomposition, unlike conventional insight into only the interface-catalyzed decomposition. The highly acidic HTFSI produced by the triggering event can induce subsequent Ni dissolution and bulk decomposition of solid electrolytes through cascade reaction of bulk decomposition behavior, leading to a continuous decline in the electrochemical performance of solid-state batteries. By introducing a dissolution-retardant active structure onto the Ni-rich electrode, it mitigates the bulk cascade reaction and maintains the energy density.

Despite its importance, nano- and surface science communities still lack an efficient, robust, precise, and automated detection approach for on-surface isomers and highly similar molecules. Here, we present ReSTOLO, a convolution neural network (CNN)-based framework for precise detection and identification of multiple types of sparsely distributed molecules on surfaces, particularly designed for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images containing numerous molecules with analogous features. To address challenges arising from molecular shape and size similarities, we implemented a two-stage framework comprising two CNN models: YOLO v5.m was used for molecular localization, and ResNet-101 for classification. The framework optimally harnesses the advantages of both models by applying a box normalization connection. We demonstrated the framework’s effectiveness by applying it to analyze a surface reaction process involving six molecules with nearly identical STM signatures. The training process employed an STM image database of single molecules augmented with physical and experimental tools constructed using standardized image boxes. This two-stage approach achieved approximately ∼20% improvements in performance metrics, including precision, recall, and accuracy, compared to conventional frameworks. The framework exhibits robust capabilities in automatically and efficiently pinpointing and discriminating between molecular species with similar configurations in complex surface reactions. This automated molecular discriminator represents a significant advance in facilitating STM tip-manipulated chemical reactions on surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Aiming to interrogate the possibility of heteronuclear B–C one-electron σ-bonding, we have prepared a naphthalene-based platform ([ 5 ] + ) decorated at its peri-positions by a carbenium and a boryl unit separated by a B–C distance of 2.994(4) Å. Reduction of this cationic platform by one electron affords a radical ( 5 • ) with a shortened B–C distance of 2.874(3) Å, suggesting the onset of B–C one-electron bonding. This radical, which was also characterized by EPR spectroscopy, undergoes a second reduction, affording a borate ([ 5 ] − ) with a long, polar covalent B–C bond of 1.793(8) Å. These compounds have been structurally, spectroscopically, and computationally investigated, shedding light on the polarization and weakness of the B–C bond of 5 • , which is best described as a noncovalent one-electron B···C triel bond rather than a covalent one-electron σ-bond.},

  abstract     = {Light alkenes are central building blocks in the chemical industry, yet their production from alkanes requires energy-intensive processes that generate substantial CO 2 emissions and suffer from catalyst deactivation and overoxidation. In this work, we demonstrate that alkane dehydrogenation can be accomplished at ambient temperature and pressure by modulating the voltage applied to an electrocatalyst surface. Voltage manipulation provides real-time control over the adsorption and dehydrogenation of alkanes, as well as the potential-driven desorption of dehydrogenated adsorbates. By using a newly developed sensitive gas chromatographic (GC) analysis method, we were able to quantify the formation of 1-butene from n -butane, as well as the formation of a distribution of shorter chain alkanes and alkenes. We show that the product distribution depends on the potential applied during adsorption and is sensitive to both catalyst identity and electrolyte composition. Palladium suppresses C–C bond cleavage relative to platinum, and replacing protons with sodium cations increases 1-butene selectivity by promoting desorption over hydrogenation. To rationalize the observed product distribution, we propose a reaction mechanism supported by grand canonical density functional theory calculations. Together, these results reveal a new pathway for alkane dehydrogenation under ambient conditions and establish time-programmed electrochemical control as a promising tool for manipulating surface-catalyzed transformations of n -alkanes.},

The concept of skeletal editing emerging recently is attractive for developing a new generation of late-stage peptide modification methods. In this work, we developed a facile tryptophan-specific late-stage peptide modification based on photocatalytic indole-to-quinazoline editing. The method showed a broad scope regarding both linear and cyclic peptide substrates and was applied to the modification of commercially available peptide drugs. A mechanism based on singlet oxygen oxidation of tryptophan and the interruption of oxidative indole cleavage by ammonia addition was proposed.},

  abstract     = {We report the first example of using photoinduced ligand release from a Ru(II) complex for light-triggered cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction. CYPs are pivotal enzymes in biosynthesis and drug metabolism, and their induction can be leveraged for therapeutics and biochemical research. We show the activation of a CYP1A1 with visible light through the efficient photorelease of an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR; 1 ) agonist with a quantum yield, Φ 500 , of 0.16(1) with λ irr = 500 nm in [Ru(tpy)(Me 2 bpy)( 1 )] 2+ (tpy = 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine, Me 2 bpy = 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine). This value is consistent with that previously reported for pyridine (py) exchange in the analogous [Ru(tpy)(Me 2 bpy)(py)] 2+ complex, Φ 500 = 0.16(1), which is driven by steric effects. In contrast to [Ru(tpy)(bpy)(py)] 2+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine), with Φ 500 < 10 –4 , the ligand photodissociation in [Ru(tpy)(bpy)( 1 )] 2+ proceeds with Φ 500 = 0.015(1), at least 2 orders of magnitude more efficiently. Similarly, [Ru(tpy)(biq)( 1 )] 2+ ( 4 ; biq = 2,2′-biquinoline) undergoes photoinduced exchange of 1 with CH 3 CN solvent with Φ 500 = 0.064(3), more efficiently than [Ru(tpy)(biq)(py)] 2+ with Φ 500 = 0.03. Through experiments and calculations, we show the involvement of intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) within the leaving ligand in an unprecedented mechanism for ligand photodissociation from Ru(II). Chemical tools based on these findings hold the promise of advancing research on tissue-specific CYP activity by enabling precise spatiotemporal control. Moreover, these compounds may pave the way for the development of highly specific and light-activated pharmaceuticals that enhance the synergy with existing drugs.},

  abstract     = {Incorporating stable isotopes into bioactive molecules is crucial in pharmaceutical development, particularly for metabolic studies where higher mass isotopologs of candidate compounds are required. Here we present an isotope exchange method for synthesizing isotopically enriched pyrimidines. By deconstructing pyrimidines into vinamidinium salts and reconstructing them with deuterium, 13 C, and 15 N-enriched amidines, we achieve high isotopic enrichment across various substitution patterns, including complex drug-like pyrimidine derivatives. The process involves a Tf 2 O-mediated ring-opening and ring-closing sequence to form a pyrimidinium ion, followed by cleavage to the vinamidinium salt with pyrrolidine. Cyclization with labeled amidines under basic conditions then forms the labeled pyrimidine. Additionally, we deuterated the 5-position of pyrimidines using this approach to offer further versatility in generating higher mass isotopologs.},
