  abstract     = {Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) spectroscopy and microscopy are constantly expanding sensing techniques for analyzing biomolecular interactions. In addition to the biological recognition molecules and biological or chemical analytes, the most important components for designing FRET biosensing systems are the materials that constitute the FRET donor–acceptor pair. These FRET materials consist of small molecules, biological or chemical nanoscaffolds, or nanomaterials that function in the ultraviolet, visible, or infrared spectral range. They can absorb light, fluoresce or phosphoresce with lifetimes ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds, and can be applied for sensing in situ , in vitro , and in vivo . Organic dyes and quenchers, fluorescent or light harvesting proteins, or quantum dots are only some examples from the ever growing FRET material toolbox. A particular example are gold nanoparticles, whose strong localized surface plasmon resonance makes them frequently used as nanosurface energy transfer (NSET) acceptors. After a short recapitulation of FRET and NSET theory, we review a wide variety of FRET and NSET materials, provide representative examples of FRET/NSET systems and applications for each material, and critically discuss the benefits and drawbacks of their properties.},

  abstract     = {It has been more than 160 years since chemists first performed fluorination reactions on organic molecules. Scores of fluorination reagents and hundreds of worthwhile methods have been developed over the intervening years. Meanwhile, workers in the field are increasingly aware of the benefits of incorporating fluorine atoms into bioactive molecules. Therefore, the emergence of “late-stage fluorination” in the first decade of the 21st century is both natural and well-justified─an extant compound, off the shelf, can be converted more efficiently to a fluorinated product than through a de novo approach. It is worth noting that chemists’ attempts to fluorinate complex molecules began sporadically decades ago before the concept of “late-stage” was first proposed. In this Perspective, we aim to present a comprehensive series of late-stage fluorination strategies, with the spotlight primarily focused on single-atom modifications of complex molecules (although incidental examples of polyfluorination are addressed), including natural products, analogues, and pharmaceuticals. Both the nucleophilic and electrophilic sources of fluorine are examined.},

  abstract     = {Single-crystalline materials have attracted broad interest in advanced battery applications due to their inherent crystallographic characteristics. Their continuous, defect-free atomic arrangement contributes to improved interfacial stability, mechanical integrity, and charge transfer properties, ultimately leading to superior electrochemical performance compared to those of the polycrystalline counterparts. Despite their growing importance, a comprehensive review of single-crystalline anode materials has been lacking. In this review, we provide an overview of single-crystalline anode materials on their growth, applications, fabrications, and recycling for both metal and ion batteries. Starting from a theoretical understanding of electro-crystallization of metals, we discuss recent strategies for the growth and application of single-crystalline metals and substrates in various chemistries including lithium, zinc, sodium, aluminum, and magnesium, as well as single-crystalline host materials such as silicon, graphite, and transition metal oxides, alongside their failure mechanisms and associated challenges. Lastly, we discuss the fabrication and recycling of single-crystalline anode materials for a closed-loop life cycle of batteries. This review aims to provide insight into the crystallographic understanding and design of single-crystalline anodes for advanced and sustainable next-generation batteries.},

  abstract     = {The past two decades have witnessed an explosion of the use of dynamic bonds in polymer science. The β-dicarbonyl skeleton has emerged as a most versatile platform motif that has been utilized to synthesize a plethora of dynamic polymers that leverage either reversible metal–ligand coordination or exchangeable dynamic covalent bonds. The high modularity and intrinsic dynamic nature of the structures based on the β-dicarbonyl motif have received considerable interest across diverse fields, in applications that include drug delivery, the development of sustainable polymers, 3D printing, actuators, and many others. This review summarizes the progress on dynamic polymers derived from β-dicarbonyl synthons and focuses on three main topics. The first section provides a comprehensive overview of the prevalent methodologies employed for the preparation of polymers containing β-dicarbonyl moieties. The second part highlights the key features, development, and applications of dynamic polymers based on the β-dicarbonyl chemistry, including metallo-supramolecular polymers and dynamic covalent polymer networks. In the concluding section, we offer our views on the future challenges and prospects pertaining to this class of dynamic polymer systems.},

  abstract     = {Neuromorphic interfaces represent a transformative frontier in neural engineering, enabling seamless communication between the nervous system and external devices through biologically inspired computing architectures. These systems offer promising avenues for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders by emulating the brain’s computational strategies. Neural devices, including sensors and stimulators, monitor or modulate neural activity, playing a pivotal role in deciphering brain function and neuropathologies. Yet, clinical translation remains limited due to persistent challenges such as foreign body responses, low signal-to-noise ratios, and constraints in real-time data processing. Recent breakthroughs in neuromorphic hardware, neural recording, and stimulation technologies are addressing these challenges, paving the way for more adaptive and efficient brain-machine interfaces and neuroprosthetics. This review highlights the emerging class of neurohybrid interfaces, where neuromorphic systems might be integrated to enhance bidirectional neural communication. It emphasizes novel material strategies engineered for seamless neural interfacing and their incorporation into advanced neuromorphic chip architectures capable of real-time signal processing and closed-loop feedback. Furthermore, this review explores cutting-edge neuromorphic biointerfaces and evaluates the technological, biological, and ethical challenges involved in their clinical deployment.
