  abstract     = {Self-regulating hydrogels represent the next generation in the development of soft materials with active, adaptive, autonomous, and intelligent behavior inspired by sophisticated biological systems. Nature provides exemplary demonstrations of such self-regulating behaviors, including muscle tissue’s precise biochemical and mechanical feedback mechanisms, and coordinated cellular chemotaxis driven by dynamic biochemical signaling. Building upon these natural examples, self-regulating hydrogels are capable of spontaneously modulating their structural and functional states through integrated negative feedback loops. In this review, the key design principles and implementation strategies for self-regulating hydrogel actuators are comprehensively summarized. We first systematically classify self-regulating hydrogels into sustained regulation, involving continuous modulation cycles under constant stimuli and one-cycle regulation, characterized by transient transitions driven by specific chemical fuels. Thereafter, the underlying mechanisms, types of hydrogels used, fuels, oscillation periods, amplitudes, and potential applications are highlighted. Finally, current scientific challenges and future opportunities for enhancing the robustness, modularity, and practical applicability of self-regulating hydrogel actuators are discussed. This review aims to provide structured guidelines and inspire interdisciplinary research to further develop advanced hydrogel-based regulatory systems for applications such as soft robotics, autonomous sensors, responsive biomedical devices, and adaptive functional materials.},

  abstract     = {Tumor heterogeneity and complex morphologies pose significant challenges to achieving efficient therapeutic outcomes. However, the recent advent of remote-controlled transformable nanostructures has introduced a novel approach to cancer therapy, enabling precise size, shape, and phase changes in nanoparticles in response to external stimuli, such as light, ultrasound, and magnetic fields. These materials offer noninvasive strategies to effectively navigate the dynamic and complex morphologies of tumors, providing unprecedented control over therapeutic targeting and precision in patient-tailored treatments. The real-time modulation of nanomaterial structures optimizes interactions with the tumor microenvironment, improving circulation, endothelial permeation, deep tumor penetration, and subcellular targeting. This review discusses cutting-edge strategies to remotely control the morphology of nanomaterials, emphasizing their integration into modular cancer theranostic platforms. These systems are engineered to target cancer cell membrane receptors and cytoplasm, subcellular organelles, immune cells, and difficult-to-reach areas including the blood–brain barrier and deep-seated tumors. We also explore the potential of multimodal theranostics including dual-triggered, combinatorial, and synergistic therapies that combine therapeutic action with real-time imaging guidance.

  abstract     = {Fluorine, due to its unique ability to modify the physicochemical and biological properties of parent molecules, has found wide applications as pharmacological modulators in drug development research. Consequently, the portion of fluorine-containing drugs has increased to about 20% in recent years. Among these, fluorine-containing drugs with aromatic fluoro-substitutions are more common than those with fluoro-substitutions at stereogenic centers. In fact, in the past decade, out of 116 fluorine-containing drugs approved by the FDA only 16 drugs are enantiomerically pure, featuring fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon centers. Asymmetric induction during building these drug molecules is largely achieved through either the “chiral pool” or “chiral resolution” approach, while the “asymmetric catalysis” approach remains underexplored. In order to draw the attention of the scientific community to this disparity, this review highlights the innovations (2015–2024) in asymmetric methodologies for creating molecules bearing a fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon center in the presence of organo- or organometallic catalysts. The synthetic strategies are divided into two sections based on fluorine-containing building blocks and fluorine-containing reagents, which are further classified by the reaction types. Special attention has been paid to synthetic challenges, types of substrates, products and catalysts, functional group compatibility, transition states, mechanistic insights, as well as synthetic applications.},

The function is normally performed by transmembrane transport proteins, but several diseases have been linked to malfunctioning or malregulation of these proteins (so-called “channelopathies”). As a consequence, supramolecular chemists have tried to develop synthetic molecules that can transport anions across biological membranes. While the original goal of this endeavor was the development of potential therapeutics for channelopathies, it is now clear that there are several other potential medical and nonmedical applications for synthetic transmembrane anion transporters. The medical applications of synthetic anion transporters have been widely explored, especially their potential as anticancer agents. However, there are many other applications of synthetic anion transporters that are often overlooked. These range from antibacterial activity and drug delivery, to nonmedical applications such as biomimicry, the development of optical sensors, catalysis, organic synthesis and others. In this review, we aim to highlight the versatility of synthetic transmembrane anion transporters and to convince chemists to look beyond channelopathies and anticancer activity as applications of artificial anion transporters.},

The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product.

  abstract     = {Soft robots, with their exceptional compliance, adaptability, and ability to safely interact with delicate objects, are redefining human–machine interfaces and expanding robotic capabilities into environments inaccessible to rigid systems. However, creating intelligent, multifunctional soft robots demands navigating a complex, multiscale design landscape, ranging from molecular-level building blocks through multifunctional soft robotic materials to fully integrated systems. In this review, we present a structured roadmap that addresses key challenges at three critical scales. At the molecular level and nanoscale, we examine an extensive library of soft matter and functional nanomaterials that impart tunable mechanical, electrical, optical, and stimuli-responsive properties to soft robotic materials. At the microscale, we highlight effective assembly strategies, such as heterogeneous blending, bilayer integration, and additive manufacturing, enabling reconfigurable, multifunctional materials that combine rapid response, robust functionality, large deformation tolerance, and fatigue resistance. Finally, at the system level, we explore how integrating actuation mechanisms, sensing technologies, and computational tools with these advanced materials can yield intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient soft robotic systems. By bridging these multiscale gaps and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, this review provides near-, mid-, and long-term perspectives to guide future research, ultimately driving the development of transformative soft robots that elevate human–machine interactions.},

  abstract     = {Recent conceptual and technological advances have underlined the importance of the human immune system in responding to dangerous threats, restoring tissue homeostasis, and mounting immunological memory. Our in-depth understanding of the immune system has also been driving the blossoming development of biocompatible macroscale biomaterials designed to prevent and treat various immune-related disorders. Hydrogels, a class of water-swollen networks with extracellular matrix-mimic characteristics, have served as promising biomaterials for guiding the immune system in biological milieus. The convergence of hydrogels and immunotherapy represents an interdisciplinary field that has driven significant advancements in both materials science and immunology. In this review, we first introduce the immune system to establish a fundamental understanding of its structure and function and then elaborate on the rational principles of hydrogel design, with a focus on passive and active mechanisms. Next, we explore a range of “hitchhiking” strategies employed to develop immunomodulatory hydrogels. State-of-the-art strategies regarding recent progress in immunomodulatory hydrogels for defense against pathological abnormalities are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the key scientific issues encountered and the hurdles faced in the development of immunomodulatory hydrogels are highlighted, aiming to show a full picture of immunomodulatory hydrogels for optimized therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of radiofrequency (RF) communication has increased the exposure of organisms to electromagnetic fields, sparking a debate over the potential health effects of weak RF electromagnetic fields. While some experimental studies suggest that low-amplitude RF radiation may influence cellular metabolism or sleep patterns or even promote cancer, these claims remain controversial due to limited theoretical plausibility. Central to this debate is the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a quantum-mechanical framework proposed to mediate RF effects. Despite its role in magnetoreception and various magnetic field effects on chemical reactions, the RPM often fails to align with observations at low, nonthermal RF field strengths. This review examines these contrasting perspectives by discussing experimental findings and theoretical models that aim to explain putative biological effects of RF magnetic fields. Emphasis is placed on the challenges of reconciling theoretical predictions with empirical data, particularly in the context of weak RF exposure. Additionally, an overview of the theoretical framework used in current modeling efforts highlights the complexity of applying the RPM to biological systems and underscores the importance of critical interpretation. The goal is to clarify the state of understanding and inform future research on RPM-mediated biological effects under weak RF exposure.},
