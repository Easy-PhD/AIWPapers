  abstract     = {Fluorine, due to its unique ability to modify the physicochemical and biological properties of parent molecules, has found wide applications as pharmacological modulators in drug development research. Consequently, the portion of fluorine-containing drugs has increased to about 20% in recent years. Among these, fluorine-containing drugs with aromatic fluoro-substitutions are more common than those with fluoro-substitutions at stereogenic centers. In fact, in the past decade, out of 116 fluorine-containing drugs approved by the FDA only 16 drugs are enantiomerically pure, featuring fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon centers. Asymmetric induction during building these drug molecules is largely achieved through either the “chiral pool” or “chiral resolution” approach, while the “asymmetric catalysis” approach remains underexplored. In order to draw the attention of the scientific community to this disparity, this review highlights the innovations (2015–2024) in asymmetric methodologies for creating molecules bearing a fluorine-containing stereogenic carbon center in the presence of organo- or organometallic catalysts. The synthetic strategies are divided into two sections based on fluorine-containing building blocks and fluorine-containing reagents, which are further classified by the reaction types. Special attention has been paid to synthetic challenges, types of substrates, products and catalysts, functional group compatibility, transition states, mechanistic insights, as well as synthetic applications.},

  abstract     = {The transport of anionic species across phospholipid bilayers is an important biological function that plays a vital role in cellular and organismal homeostasis. The function is normally performed by transmembrane transport proteins, but several diseases have been linked to malfunctioning or malregulation of these proteins (so-called “channelopathies”). As a consequence, supramolecular chemists have tried to develop synthetic molecules that can transport anions across biological membranes. While the original goal of this endeavor was the development of potential therapeutics for channelopathies, it is now clear that there are several other potential medical and nonmedical applications for synthetic transmembrane anion transporters. The medical applications of synthetic anion transporters have been widely explored, especially their potential as anticancer agents. However, there are many other applications of synthetic anion transporters that are often overlooked. These range from antibacterial activity and drug delivery, to nonmedical applications such as biomimicry, the development of optical sensors, catalysis, organic synthesis and others. In this review, we aim to highlight the versatility of synthetic transmembrane anion transporters and to convince chemists to look beyond channelopathies and anticancer activity as applications of artificial anion transporters.},

  abstract     = {In catalysis, selectivity reflects the energetic preference for the formation of a single product out of multiple possible reaction outcomes. The classic steric biasing approach in small-molecule catalysis employs steric destabilization of the undesired competing transition states to achieve energetic differentiation. In contrast, enzymes achieve high levels of rate acceleration and selectivity by accelerating the pathway leading to the major product, often through networks of attractive, stabilizing noncovalent interactions. This Review showcases selective noncovalent catalysis (NCC) with small organic molecules and transition-metal complexes. We collect and highlight examples whereby selectivity was documented experimentally to arise from selective stabilization of the transition state leading to the major product. We also showcase how synergistic experimental and computational investigations have enabled the elucidation of specific noncovalent interactions responsible for selective stabilization.},

However, fully unlocking their potential hinges on establishing a nondisruptive, intimate, and nonrestrictive interface with the tissue surface, facilitating efficient integration between the microinterventional sensor and the target tissue. In this comprehensive review, we highlight the critical tissue characteristics in both physiologically and pathologically relevant contexts that are pivotal for the design of microinterventional sensors. We also summarize recent advancements in flexible substrate materials and conductive materials, which are tailored to facilitate effective information interaction between bioelectronic components and biological tissues. Furthermore, we classify various electrode architectures─spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D─designed to accommodate the mechanics of soft tissues and enable nonrestrictive interfaces in diverse sensing scenarios. Additionally, we outline critical challenges for next-generation microinterventional sensors and propose integrating advanced materials, innovative fabrication, and embedded intelligence to drive breakthroughs in biosignal sensing. Ultimately, we aim to both provide foundational understanding and highlight emerging strategies in biosignal capture, leveraging recent advancements in these critical components.},

However, creating intelligent, multifunctional soft robots demands navigating a complex, multiscale design landscape, ranging from molecular-level building blocks through multifunctional soft robotic materials to fully integrated systems. In this review, we present a structured roadmap that addresses key challenges at three critical scales. At the molecular level and nanoscale, we examine an extensive library of soft matter and functional nanomaterials that impart tunable mechanical, electrical, optical, and stimuli-responsive properties to soft robotic materials. At the microscale, we highlight effective assembly strategies, such as heterogeneous blending, bilayer integration, and additive manufacturing, enabling reconfigurable, multifunctional materials that combine rapid response, robust functionality, large deformation tolerance, and fatigue resistance. Finally, at the system level, we explore how integrating actuation mechanisms, sensing technologies, and computational tools with these advanced materials can yield intelligent, adaptive, and energy-efficient soft robotic systems. By bridging these multiscale gaps and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, this review provides near-, mid-, and long-term perspectives to guide future research, ultimately driving the development of transformative soft robots that elevate human–machine interactions.},

Hydrogels, a class of water-swollen networks with extracellular matrix-mimic characteristics, have served as promising biomaterials for guiding the immune system in biological milieus. The convergence of hydrogels and immunotherapy represents an interdisciplinary field that has driven significant advancements in both materials science and immunology. In this review, we first introduce the immune system to establish a fundamental understanding of its structure and function and then elaborate on the rational principles of hydrogel design, with a focus on passive and active mechanisms. Next, we explore a range of “hitchhiking” strategies employed to develop immunomodulatory hydrogels. State-of-the-art strategies regarding recent progress in immunomodulatory hydrogels for defense against pathological abnormalities are systematically summarized. Furthermore, the key scientific issues encountered and the hurdles faced in the development of immunomodulatory hydrogels are highlighted, aiming to show a full picture of immunomodulatory hydrogels for optimized therapeutic efficacy.},

  abstract     = {The widespread use of radiofrequency (RF) communication has increased the exposure of organisms to electromagnetic fields, sparking a debate over the potential health effects of weak RF electromagnetic fields. While some experimental studies suggest that low-amplitude RF radiation may influence cellular metabolism or sleep patterns or even promote cancer, these claims remain controversial due to limited theoretical plausibility. Central to this debate is the radical pair mechanism (RPM), a quantum-mechanical framework proposed to mediate RF effects. Despite its role in magnetoreception and various magnetic field effects on chemical reactions, the RPM often fails to align with observations at low, nonthermal RF field strengths. This review examines these contrasting perspectives by discussing experimental findings and theoretical models that aim to explain putative biological effects of RF magnetic fields. Emphasis is placed on the challenges of reconciling theoretical predictions with empirical data, particularly in the context of weak RF exposure. Additionally, an overview of the theoretical framework used in current modeling efforts highlights the complexity of applying the RPM to biological systems and underscores the importance of critical interpretation. The goal is to clarify the state of understanding and inform future research on RPM-mediated biological effects under weak RF exposure.},
