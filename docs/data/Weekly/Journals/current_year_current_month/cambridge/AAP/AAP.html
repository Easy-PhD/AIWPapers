We first consider a general bounded self-adjoint perturbation operator, and then study a particular unbounded perturbation corresponding to truncation of the killing rate. In both scenarios, we quantify the difference between eigenfunctions of the smallest eigenvalue of the perturbed and unperturbed generators in a Hilbert space norm. As a consequence, $\mathcal{L}^1$ -norm estimates of the difference of the resulting quasi-stationary distributions in terms of the perturbation are provided.},

To facilitate finding this minimal representation, we transform this condition equivalently into a non-convex optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed using an alternating minimization algorithm. The algorithm convergence is also proved. Moreover, the method we develop for the continuous-time PH distributions can be used directly for the discrete-time PH distributions after establishing an equivalence between the minimal representation problems for continuous-time and discrete-time PH distributions.},

To this end, we follow a directed linear preferential attachment model for a random, heavy-tailed number of steps in time and treat the incoming edge count of all existing nodes as a random vector of random length. By combining martingale properties, moment bounds and a Breiman type theorem we show that the resulting quantity is multivariate regularly varying, both as a vector of fixed length formed by the edge counts of a finite number of oldest nodes, and also as a vector of random length viewed in sequence space. A Pólya urn representation allows us to explicitly describe the extremal dependence between the degrees with the help of Dirichlet distributions. As a by-product of our analysis we establish new results for almost sure convergence of the edge counts in sequence space as the number of nodes goes to infinity.},

  abstract     = {We study continuous-time Markov chains on the nonnegative integers under mild regularity conditions (in particular, the set of jump vectors is finite and both forward and backward jumps are possible). Based on the so-called flux balance equation, we derive an iterative formula for calculating stationary measures. Specifically, a stationary measure $\pi(x)$ evaluated at $x\in\mathbb{N}_0$ is represented as a linear combination of a few generating terms, similarly to the characterization of a stationary measure of a birth–death process, where there is only one generating term, $\pi(0)$ . The coefficients of the linear combination are recursively determined in terms of the transition rates of the Markov chain. For the class of Markov chains we consider, there is always at least one stationary measure (up to a scaling constant). We give various results pertaining to uniqueness and nonuniqueness of stationary measures, and show that the dimension of the linear space of signed invariant measures is at most the number of generating terms. A minimization problem is constructed in order to compute stationary measures numerically. Moreover, a heuristic linear approximation scheme is suggested for the same purpose by first approximating the generating terms. The correctness of the linear approximation scheme is justified in some special cases. Furthermore, a decomposition of the state space into different types of states (open and closed irreducible classes, and trapping, escaping and neutral states) is presented. Applications to stochastic reaction networks are well illustrated.},

We use two Euler–Maruyama schemes with decreasing step sizes $\Gamma = (\gamma_n)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ to approximate the invariant measure of $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ : one uses independent and identically distributed $\alpha$ -stable random variables as innovations, and the other employs independent and identically distributed Pareto random variables. We study the convergence rates of these two approximation schemes in the Wasserstein-1 distance. For the first scheme, under the assumption that the function b is Lipschitz and satisfies a certain dissipation condition, we demonstrate a convergence rate of $\gamma^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}_n$ . This convergence rate can be improved to $\gamma^{1+\frac {1}{\alpha}-\frac{1}{\kappa}}_n$ for any $\kappa \in [1,\alpha)$ , provided b has the additional regularity of bounded second-order directional derivatives. For the second scheme, where the function b is assumed to be twice continuously differentiable, we establish a convergence rate of $\gamma^{\frac{2-\alpha}{\alpha}}_n$ ; moreover, we show that this rate is optimal for the one-dimensional stable Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Our theorems indicate that the recent significant result of [ 34 ] concerning the unadjusted Langevin algorithm with additive innovations can be extended to stochastic differential equations driven by an $\alpha$ -stable Lévy process and that the corresponding convergence rate exhibits similar behaviour. Compared with the result in [ 6 ], our assumptions have relaxed the second-order differentiability condition, requiring only a Lipschitz condition for the first scheme, which broadens the applicability of our approach.},

We consider the results in relation to time-reversal of phase-type distributions, PH-simplicity, and the algebraic degree of a phase-type distribution, and we give applications of the results. In particular we give the conditions under which a Coxian distribution becomes exponential, and we construct bivariate exponential distributions.

We concentrate on the Betti numbers, a sequence of topological invariants of the complex related to the numbers of holes (equivalently, repeated connections) of different dimensions. We prove that the expected Betti numbers grow sublinearly fast, with the trivial exceptions of those at dimensions 0 and 1. Our result also shows that preferential attachment graphs undergo infinitely many phase transitions within the parameter regime where the limiting degree distribution has an infinite variance. Regarding higher-order connectivity, our result shows that preferential attachment favors higher-order connectivity. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations.},

For example, in an epidemic outbreak we might know when individuals show symptoms to a disease and are removed, but not when individuals are infected. Motivated by the above example and the long-established approximation of epidemic processes by branching processes, we explore the number of individuals alive in a time-inhomogeneous branching process with a general phase-type lifetime distribution given only (partial) information on the times of deaths of individuals. Deaths are detected independently with a detection probability that can vary with time and type. We show that the number of individuals alive immediately after the k th detected death can be expressed as the mixture of random variables each of which consists of the sum of k independent zero-modified geometric distributions. Furthermore, in the case of an Erlang lifetime distribution, we derive an easy-to-compute mixture of negative binomial distributions as an approximation of the number of individuals alive immediately after the k th detected death.},
