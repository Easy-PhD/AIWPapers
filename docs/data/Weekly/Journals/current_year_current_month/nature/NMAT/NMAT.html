  abstract     = {Extracellular matrix remodelling of cardiac tissue is a key contributor to age-related cardiovascular disease and dysfunction. Such remodelling is multifaceted including changes to the biochemical composition, architecture and mechanics, clouding our understanding of how and which extracellular matrix properties contribute to a dysfunctional state. Here we describe a decellularized extracellular matrix–synthetic hydrogel hybrid scaffold that independently confers two distinct matrix properties—ligand presentation and stiffness—to cultured cells in vitro, allowing for the identification of their specific roles in cardiac ageing. The hybrid scaffold maintains native matrix composition and organization of young or aged murine cardiac tissue, whereas its mechanical properties can be independently tuned to mimic young or aged tissue stiffness. Seeding these scaffolds with murine primary cardiac fibroblasts, we identify distinct age- and matrix-dependent mechanisms of cardiac fibroblast activation, matrix remodelling and senescence. Importantly, we show that the ligand presentation of a young extracellular matrix can outweigh the profibrotic stiffness cues typically present in an aged extracellular matrix in maintaining or driving cardiac fibroblast quiescence. Ultimately, these tunable scaffolds can enable the discovery of specific extracellular targets to prevent ageing dysfunction and promote rejuvenation. A hybrid extracellular matrix–hydrogel with tunable mechanical stiffness and biochemical composition of young or aged cardiac tissue is used to identify the specific contributions of extracellular matrix ligands and mechanics for fibroblast aging.},

  abstract     = {Cell migration in mechanically confined environments is a crucial step of metastatic cancer progression. Nonetheless, the molecular components and processes mediating such behaviour are still not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that a pool of the scaffolding protein anillin and its cofactor Ect2, which are both predominantly nuclear proteins and critical mediators of cytokinesis, is present in the cytoplasm of multiple interphase cell types that promote confined cell migration. Confined migration in biomimetic microfluidic models triggers the actomyosin-binding-dependent recruitment of anillin to the plasma membrane at the poles of migrating cells in a manner that scales with microenvironmental stiffness and confinement. The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Ect2 is required for its RhoA-GTPase-mediated activation of myosin II at the cell poles, enhancing invasion, bleb-based migration and extravasation. Confinement-induced nuclear envelope rupture further amplifies this process due to the release of further anillin and Ect2 into the cytoplasm. Overall, these results show how Ect2 and anillin cooperate to mediate RhoA/ROCK/myosin II-dependent mechanoadaptation and invasive cancer progression. Cell migration in confined environments is initiated by a cytoplasmic pool of anillin and Ect2 that promotes RhoA/myosin II-mediated activation at the poles of migrating cells, in a process dependent on the extracellular environment stiffness.},

These materials are stabilized by directional hydrogen-bonding patterns, giving rise to one-dimensional or two-dimensional assembly. It remains a challenge to mimic biology’s context-adaptive and flexible structures. Here we introduce minimalistic tripeptide sequences that form highly soluble dynamic ensembles through multivalent side-chain interactions. We observe these supramolecular dispersions undergo drying-induced sequential liquid–liquid phase separation followed by solidification, resulting in the formation of films of stiff, densely packed and porous peptide microparticles that can be instantaneously redispersed upon the re-introduction of water. Air-drying of peptide dispersions in the presence of proteins or small-molecule payloads results in efficient encapsulation and the retention of protein stability after redispersion, showing promise for the emulsification, encapsulation, protection and storage of biomacromolecules. The mechanism resembles the protective strategies in natural systems during desiccation, which rely on liquid–liquid phase separation to survive extreme conditions. Here the authors design tripeptides that form dynamic soluble dispersions and undergo phase separation upon drying to assemble into porous particles. This evaporation-driven emulsification can be harnessed to encapsulate and stabilize biomolecules.},

  abstract     = {Hot carriers, inheriting excess kinetic energy from high-energy photons, drive numerous optoelectronic applications reliant on non-equilibrium transport processes. Although extensively studied in inorganic materials, their potential in organic-based systems remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate highly mobile hot carriers in crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer Cu3BHT (BHT, benzenehexathiol) films. Leveraging a suite of ultrafast spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we map the microscopic charge transport landscape in Cu3BHT films following non-equilibrium photoexcitation across temporal, spatial and frequency domains, revealing two distinct high-mobility transport regimes. In the non-equilibrium regime, hot carriers achieve an ultrahigh mobility of ~2,000 cm2 V–1 s–1, traversing grain boundaries up to ~300 nm within a picosecond. In the quasi-equilibrium regime, free carriers exhibit Drude-type, band-like transport with a remarkable mobility of ~400 cm2 V–1 s–1 and an intrinsic diffusion length exceeding 1 μm. These findings position two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymers as versatile platforms for advancing organic-based hot carrier applications. Hot carrier transport in organic systems has remained elusive due to rapid energy relaxation and limited transport properties. Here highly mobile hot carriers and their relaxation dynamics are reported in a crystalline two-dimensional conjugated coordination polymer, revealing two distinct transport regimes.},

Here a reactivity-regulated sequent cross-coupling carbon–nitrogen polycondensation method is developed to enable the precise synthesis of functional polyarylamines with excellent batch-to-batch uniformity. It is revealed that the stepwise regulation of intermediate reactivities is key to accomplish controllable polycondensation via two sequent palladium-promoted carbon–nitrogen coupling cycles, which is distinct to the unicyclic carbon–carbon coupling. A variety of polyarylamines are prepared to improve the material functionalities, where a ternary polymer consisting of polar substituents is shown to optimize the interfacial and bulk properties of perovskite layers fabricated on top. The corresponding inverted perovskite solar cells achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies of 25.2% (active area, 5.97 mm2) and 23.2% (active area, 128 mm2), along with decent operational stabilities. Overall, this work provides an effective polymerization method for advanced conjugated polymers to enable high-performance optoelectronics.

  abstract     = {Solvent co-intercalation, that is, the combined intercalation of ions and solvent molecules into electrode materials, is an additional but much less explored lever for modifying the properties of metal-ion battery electrodes (metal = Li, Na, Mg, etc.). Knowledge on solvent co-intercalation is relatively scarce and largely limited to graphite anodes, for which in sodium-ion batteries, the co-intercalation of glyme molecules is fast and highly reversible. The use of co-intercalation for cathode active materials (CAMs) remains much less explored. Here we investigate for a series of sodium-layered sulfide CAMs (NaxMS2, M = Ti, V, Cr and mixtures) under which conditions solvent co-intercalation occurs and how this process impacts the phase behaviour, electrode breathing, redox potential and cycle life compared to ‘Na+-only’ intercalation. Co-intercalation is a complex process that can, for example, cause opposing fluxes, meaning that solvents intercalate into the CAMs while sodium ions simultaneously deintercalate. Co-intercalation leads to layered structures that can include different amounts of confined solvated ions, ions and unbound solvent molecules. It is an approach to designing structurally diverse, layered materials with potential applications for batteries and beyond. Solvent co-intercalation into graphite anodes for sodium-ion batteries is common; however, intercalation into cathodes is much less explored. Here, using operando experiments as well as theory, solvent co-intercalation in a range of layered sulfides is investigated.},

  abstract     = {Sodium niobate, a lead-free ferroic material, hosts delicately balanced, competing order parameters, including ferroelectric states that can be stabilized by epitaxial strain. Here we show that the resulting macroscopic ferroelectricity exhibits an unconventional microscopic structure using multislice electron ptychography. This technique overcomes multiple scattering artefacts limiting conventional electron microscopy, enabling both lateral spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit and recovery of three-dimensional structural information. These imaging capabilities allow us to separate the ferroelectric interior of the sample from the relaxed surface structure and identify the soft phonon mode and related structural distortions with picometre precision. Unlike conventional ferroelectric perovskites, we find that the polar distortion in this material involves minimal distortions of the cation sublattices and is instead dominated by anion displacements relative to the niobium sublattice. We establish limits on film thickness for interfacial octahedral rotation engineering and directly visualize a random octahedral rotation pattern, arising from the flat dispersion of the associated phonon mode. Limited by challenges in light-atom imaging, microscopic investigations of ferroelectricity have used cation–cation displacements as a proxy for the true cation–anion distortions. Using electron ptychography, oxygen anions can be tracked to observe an otherwise-hidden ferroelectric mechanism in thin-film NaNbO3, which would have appeared antiferroelectric from cations alone.},

These heterostructures are fabricated with elaborately designed boundary conditions to meet the delicate energy balance for stabilizing topological phases. This requirement limits the broad applications of skyrmions in electronic devices. Here we show widespread skyrmion nanodomains in ferroelectric–antiferroelectric solid solutions, composed of ferroelectric PbTiO3 and one antiferroelectric PbSnO3 (Pb(Ti1–xSnx)O3), PbHfO3 (Pb(Ti1–xHfx)O3) or PbZrO3 (Pb(Ti1–xZrx)O3). The skyrmionic textures are formed by engineering dipole–dipole and antiferrodistortive–dipole couplings in competition between ferroelectric and antiferroelectric polar orderings, allowing the stabilization of topological phases. A phase diagram is built for the three solid solution series, revealing the stabilization regions of skyrmion nanodomains. In addition, the non-trivial domains also exhibit improved switching character, reversible writing/erasure and long-term retention for the electrical manipulation of polar configurations. These findings open an avenue for the investigation and exploitation of polar skyrmions in ferroelectric-based materials, providing opportunities in topological electronics. Polar skyrmions are of interest for nanoelectronics due to their exotic properties. However, so far, these are metastable states requiring a delicate balance of boundary conditions to form in heterostructures.

Two-dimensional magnets unlock opportunities to combine AFM and FM materials; however, the buried AFM–FM interfaces obtained by stacking remains challenging to understand. Here we demonstrate interfacial control via intralayer exchange coupling in the layered AFM CrPS4, where connected even and odd layers realize pristine lateral interfaces between AFM-like and FM-like regions. We distinguish antiphase even-layer states by scanning nitrogen-vacancy centre magnetometry due to a weak surface magnetization. This surface magnetization enables control over the even-layer state, with different regions switching at distinct fields due to their own lateral couplings. We toggle three AFM domains adjacent to a FM-like region and demonstrate a tunable multilevel exchange bias. Our nanoscale visualization unveils the microscopic origins of exchange bias and advances single two-dimensional crystals for hybrid AFM–FM technologies.

  abstract     = {Antiferromagnets as active components in devices have been attracting attention due to their negligible stray field and ultrafast magnetic dynamics, which are promising for high-density and fast memory devices. Although the switching of antiferromagnetic (AFM) order by current-induced spin–orbit torque (SOT) has already been realized, field-free SOT-induced bidirectional switching of AFM order in perpendicular geometry has been elusive. Here we experimentally demonstrate field-free perpendicular switching of the magnetic octupole moct in chiral AFM Mn3Sn by combining in-plane and out-of-plane SOTs generated by two-dimensional van der Vaals WTe2. The out-of-plane SOT breaks the in-plane inversion symmetry and leads to deterministic bidirectional switching of moct in polycrystalline Mn3Sn even without a fixed perpendicular moct easy axis. The switching ratio reaches up to 80% compared to 20–30% in polycrystalline Mn3Sn and the critical current density is reduced by an order of magnitude to around 1 MA cm−2. Our work promotes the development of chiral AFM devices toward practical application.

  abstract     = {The microscopic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene is poorly understood. We show direct evidence for an in-plane magnetic order competing with the superconducting state motivated by theoretical proposals. We use two complementary electrical transport measurements. First, in statistically significant switching events in the superconducting state of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene, we observe non-monotonic and hysteretic responses in the switching distributions as a function of temperature and in-plane magnetic field. Additionally, the system behaves like a network of Josephson junctions due to lattice-relaxation-induced moiré inhomogeneity. Second, in normal regions doped slightly away from the superconducting regime, hysteretic and linear positive magnetoresistance with the in-plane magnetic field shows evidence for an in-plane magnetic order. Furthermore, we estimate superfluid stiffness Js ≈ 0.15 K with strong temperature dependence and show a broadened Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless transition. Our observations may constrain possible intervalley-coherent magnetic orders and the superconductivity arising from its fluctuations. Electrical transport measurements of magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene are presented.},

  abstract     = {Understanding the interplay of non-Hermiticity and topology is crucial given the intrinsic openness of most natural and engineered systems, and has important ramifications in topological lasers and sensors. Recently, it has been theoretically proposed that topological features could originate solely from a system’s non-Hermiticity in photonic platforms. Here we experimentally demonstrate the appearance of non-Hermitian topology exclusively from loss modulation in a photonic system that is topologically trivial in the absence of loss. We do this by implementing a non-Hermitian generalization of an Aubry–André–Harper model with purely imaginary potential in a programmable integrated photonics platform, which allows us to investigate different periodic and quasiperiodic configurations of the model. In both cases, we show the emergence of topological edge modes and explore their resilience to different kinds of disorder. Our work highlights loss engineering as a mechanism to generate topological properties. Using a reconfigurable integrated photonic platform, the authors reveal the appearance of non-Hermitian topology and the existence of edge modes emerging exclusively from optical loss modulation.},

  abstract     = {An elusive conductor with perfect optical transparency holds revolutionary potential for fields such as optoelectronics and nanophotonics. Such a hypothetical metal would possess a spectral gap1,2—a ‘hyper-gap’—in its absorption spectrum, separating the intraband and interband absorptions, in which optical losses could vanish. Currently, this property is achievable only within the bandgap of insulators. However, realizing such a hyper-gap metal demands an exotic electronic structure in which the conducting bands have a bandwidth narrower than their energy separations from the remaining electronic states. Here we present such a hyper-gap in a family of organic metals—the Fabre charge-transfer salts3—through first-principles predictions coupled with both electrical and optical measurements. A transparent window, spanning from red to near-infrared wavelengths, is identified in bulk single crystals that remain transmissive over a thickness of 30 µm. The corresponding absorption coefficient is the lowest among known stoichiometric metals, rivalling thin films of transparent conductive oxides. This finding introduces a path, beyond traditional doping strategies in insulators, to combine electronic conduction and optical transparency. A family of organic metals that behave as hyper-gap transparent conductors is discussed. Such an elusive combination of electronic conduction and optical transparency is highly attractive for plasmonics and photonics applications.},

  abstract     = {Black phosphorus nanoribbons (BPNRs) with a tunable bandgap and intriguing electronic and optical properties hold strong potential for logic applications. However, efficiently producing high-quality BPNRs with precise control over their size and structure remains a great challenge. Here we achieved high-quality, narrow and clean BPNRs with nearly atomically smooth edges and well-defined edge orientation at high yield (up to ~95%) through the sonochemical exfoliation of the synthesized bulk BP crystals with a slightly enlarged lattice parameter along the armchair direction. The resulting BPNRs have widths centred at 32 nm and can be as narrow as 1.5 nm, with edges consistently aligned along the zigzag direction in measured BPNRs with widths ≤340 nm. The formation of one-dimensional BPNRs with zigzag edges is attributed to the introduction of pre-stress along the armchair direction of the grown bulk BP and the application of suitable sonication conditions. The BPNR bandgap increases as the BPNR width decreases from 83 nm to 13 nm, with a large bandgap of 0.64 eV for a 13-nm-wide BPNR. A typical graphene-contacted field-effect transistor fabricated with a 13-nm-wide and 10-nm-thick BPNR can achieve an on/off ratio of 1.7 × 106, mobility of 1,506 cm2 V−1 s−1 and on-state channel conductivity of 1,845 µS. The devices also exhibit excellent photodetection performance. Our method opens up a route to produce BPNRs with high material quality and defined edge chirality for fundamental studies and practical applications in electronic and optoelectronic fields. Through the sonochemical exfoliation of grown black phosphorus crystals, high-quality, narrow and clean black phosphorus nanoribbons with smooth edges and defined edge chirality are achieved, enabling the realization of high-performance transistors and photodetectors.},

The bioconstruct is composed of a decellularized extracellular matrix containing polymeric nanocapsules sequentially releasing basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor 1, which promote the proliferation and differentiation of muscle stem cells, respectively. When applied to a volumetric muscle loss defect in an animal model, the bioconstruct enhances myofibre formation, angiogenesis, innervation and functional restoration. Further, it promotes functional muscle formation with human or aged murine muscle stem cells, highlighting the translational potential of this bioconstruct. Overall, these results highlight the potential of bioconstructs with orchestrated growth factor release for stem cell therapies in traumatic injury.

The driving force for the appearance of vortices in ferroelectrics is the need to minimize the depolarizing fields at interfaces3–5,14; by making the polarization rotate, depolarization fields vanish4,5,8,9. Antiferroelectrics, by contrast, are defined by an antiparallel arrangement of electric dipoles15. A priori, therefore, they lack the depolarization fields that drive the appearance of non-trivial topologies in ferroelectrics. At the atomic scale of the dipoles, however, we find that polar discontinuities can still happen, driving the appearance of topological singularities at ferroelastic domain walls. Topological phenomena in ferroelectrics such as vortices are of interest as they may be useful for high-density storage applications, but similar phenomena have not been seen in antiferroelectrics, which possess antipolar dipole arrangements. Here, using electron microscopy, topological antivortices and faint vortices are seen in the prototypical antiferroelectric PbZrO3.},

  abstract     = {The power and energy consumption of resistive switching devices can be lowered by reducing the dimensions of their active layers. Efforts to push this low-energy switching property to its limits have led to the investigation of active regions made with two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. Despite their small dimensions, 2D layered materials exhibit a rich variety of switching mechanisms, each involving different types of atomic structure reconfiguration. In this Review, we highlight and classify the mechanisms of resistive switching in monolayer and bulk 2D layered materials, with a subsequent focus on those occurring in a monolayer and/or localized to point defects in the crystalline sheet. We discuss the complex energetics involved in these fundamentally defect-assisted processes, including the coexistence of multiple mechanisms and the effects of the contacts used. Examining the highly localized ‘atomristor’-type switching, we provide insights into atomic motions and electronic transport across the metal–2D interfaces underlying their operation. Finally, we discuss progress and our perspective on the challenges associated with the development of 2D resistive switching devices. Promising application areas and material systems are identified and suggested for further research. The authors review the mechanisms of resistive switching in monolayer and bulk forms of two-dimensional layered materials, providing insights into atomic motions and electronic transport across interfaces.},
