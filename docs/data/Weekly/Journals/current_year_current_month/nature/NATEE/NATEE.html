Methods have been proposed to infer ancestral gene order, but they lack scalability, limiting the depth to which gene neighbourhood evolution can be traced back. Here we introduce edgeHOG, a tool designed for accurate ancestral gene order inference with linear time complexity. We validated edgeHOG on various benchmarks and applied it to the entire OMA orthology database, encompassing 2,845 extant genomes across all domains of life. We reconstructed ancestral gene order for 1,133 ancestral genomes, including ancestral contigs for the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, dating back around 1.8 billion years, and observed significant functional association among neighbouring genes. EdgeHOG also dates gene adjacencies, allowing the detection of both conserved gene clusters and chromosomal rearrangements. A new method to reconstruct ancestral genomes is used to estimate contigs of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and to infer features such as the age of gene adjacencies and chromosome rearrangements.},

  abstract     = {The partitioning of ecological niches is a fundamental component of species diversification in adaptive radiations. However, it is currently unknown if and how such bursts of organismal diversity are influenced by temporal niche partitioning, wherein species avoid competition by being active or sleeping during different time windows. Here we address this question through profiling temporal activity patterns in the exceptionally diverse fauna of cichlid fishes from the African Lake Tanganyika. By integrating week-long longitudinal behavioural recordings of over 500 individuals from 60 species with eco-morphological and genomic information, we provide two lines of evidence that temporal niche partitioning occurs in this massive adaptive radiation. First, Tanganyikan cichlids exhibit all known circadian temporal activity patterns (diurnal, nocturnal, crepuscular and cathemeral) and display substantial interspecific variation in daily amounts of locomotion. Second, many species with similar habitat and diet niches occupy distinct temporal niches. Moreover, our results suggest that shifts between diurnal and nocturnal activity patterns are facilitated by a crepuscular intermediate state. Genome-wide association studies indicate that the genetics underlying activity patterns is complex, with different clades associated with different combinations of variants. The identified variants were not associated with core circadian clock genes but with genes implicated in synapse function. These observations indicate that temporal niche partitioning may have contributed to adaptive radiation in cichlids and that many genes are associated with the diversity and evolution of temporal activity patterns. An analysis of behavioural, eco-morphological and genomic data in 60 species of Lake Tanganyika cichlids reveals a remarkable diversity of temporal activity patterns across species, suggesting that temporal niche partitioning may have played a role in the adaptive diversification of this group.},

  abstract     = {Deleterious mutations are ubiquitous in natural populations and, when expressed, reduce fitness. However, the specific nature of these mutations and the ways in which they impact fitness remain poorly understood. We exploited recent advances in genomics to predict deleterious mutations in the black grouse (Lyrurus tetrix), an iconic lekking species. Analysis of 190 whole genomes alongside comprehensive life-history data including repeated measures of behavioural, ornamental and fitness traits revealed that deleterious mutations identified through evolutionary conservation and functional prediction are associated with reduced male lifetime mating success. Both homozygous and heterozygous deleterious mutations reduce fitness, indicating that fully and partially recessive mutations contribute towards an individual’s realized mutation load. Notably, deleterious mutations in promotors have disproportionally negative fitness effects, suggesting that they impair an individual’s ability to dynamically adjust gene expression to meet context-dependent functional demands. Finally, deleterious mutations impact male mating success by reducing lek attendance rather than by altering the expression of ornamental traits, suggesting that behaviour serves as an honest indicator of genetic quality. These findings offer insights into the genetic architecture of male fitness and illuminate the complex interplay between genetic variation and phenotypic expression. Analysis of whole genomes and life-history data of male black grouse shows that deleterious mutations, especially those in promotors, reduce lifetime reproductive success.},

Here we present a spatial description of the global, bathymetric and taxonomic extent of the benthic marine class Asteroidea using a compiled dataset of ~200,000 species-level occurrence records. We used these data to produce comparisons of sea-floor richness between hemispheres and oceans. We show that species richness is significantly correlated with temperature and nutrient flux despite markedly different distributional patterns across oceans and latitudes that suggest further influence from a combination of additional geographic, taxonomic and environmental factors. The relative importance of temperature and nutrient levels also varies greatly with depth. Species richness peaks in the shallow-water tropics, closely matching sea-floor temperature variation, but at bathyal and abyssal depths it is higher at temperate latitudes, where nutrient flux levels are of greater importance. We show that richness in the deep benthos is restricted below ~1.5 °C, with this strong thermal threshold consistent among oceans irrespective of other factors. Global trends in species richness in the deep sea are poorly explored. This study uses occurrence records of Asteroidea to show that species richness in the deep benthos is restricted below ~1.5 °C but correlated with temperature and nutrient flux, despite different patterns across oceans and latitudes.},

Here we quantify the impact of climate change on bird populations from across the world by combining models of their response to environmental conditions with a climate attribution framework. We identify a dominant role of intensified heat extremes compared to changes in average temperature and precipitation. Increased interannual exposure to hot extremes reduces annual abundance growth rates most strongly in lower-latitude tropical regions, with effects robust when controlling for changing human industrial pressure and other long-term drivers. Compared to a counterfactual without human-driven climate change, the historical intensification of heat extremes has caused a 25–38% reduction in the level of abundance of tropical birds, which has accumulated from 1950 to 2020. Across observed tropical bird populations, impacts of climate change have typically been larger than direct human pressure, the opposite across sub-tropical regions. Overall, these results showcase how human-driven climate change is already reshaping biodiversity globally and may explain reported declines of birds in undisturbed tropical habitats. Climate change poses a growing threat to biodiversity, but disentangling its overall impact from other anthropogenic stressors is challenging. Here the authors use a data-driven climate attribution framework to identify a key role of heat extremes in causing changes in bird populations globally.},

The vast size and remote location of the continent introduce substantial uncertainty in understanding and predicting these threats.

We identified ten emerging conservation challenges across six thematic categories. Key issues included extreme precipitation, emerging animal pathogens, human pandemics, security threats, reduced cooperation among Antarctic Treaty parties and potential agricultural expansion. Several of these challenges stem from persistent underlying drivers, revealing how longstanding processes are giving rise to new and increasingly acute conservation concerns. Others, driven by global disruptions, have no historical precedent in the region but increasingly constrain decision-making and international coordination. This horizon scan reveals substantial limitations in the ability of the Antarctic Treaty system to address these challenges, underscoring the need to reassess existing governance mechanisms to protect the unique ecosystems of Antarctica and its vital role in the global climate system. A horizon scan of international respondents identifies and discusses ten developing challenges in Antarctic conservation, revealing an increased emphasis on challenges related to governance, geopolitics and economics compared to a similar scan from 2012.},

  abstract     = {Detecting the imprints of global environmental change on biological communities is a paramount task for ecological research. But a lack of standardized long-term biomonitoring data prevents a deeper understanding of biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. Novel sources of data for analysing biodiversity change across time and space are urgently needed. By metabarcoding highly standardized biota samples from a long-term pollution monitoring archive in Germany, we here analyse four decades of community diversity for tens of thousands of species across the tree of life. The archived samples—tree leaves, marine macroalgae, and marine and limnic mussels—represent natural community DNA samplers, preserving a taxonomically diverse imprint of their associated biodiversity at the time of collection. We find no evidence for universal diversity declines at the local scale. Instead, a gradual compositional turnover emerges as a universal pattern of temporal biodiversity change in Germany’s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This turnover results in biotic homogenization in most terrestrial and marine communities. Limnic communities, in contrast, rather differentiate across space, probably due to the immigration of different invasive species into different sites. Our study highlights the immense promise of alternative sample sources to provide standardized time series data of biodiversity change in the Anthropocene. This study explores four decades of biodiversity change across the tree of life in Germany’s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems by sequencing standardized biota samples from a long-term pollution monitoring archive.},

  abstract     = {Terrestrial carbon (C) sink has long been recognized as trending upwards, yet its recent slowdown raises concerns about accelerating climate change. Variations in wetland C sequestration are hypothesized to play a key role in this shift. Here we mapped annual water levels in global wetlands from 2000 to 2020 using 2,295 field-based measurements and predicted the spatiotemporal pattern of wetland net ecosystem production (NEP) in conjunction with other environmental factors. By compiling 934 in situ observations, we estimated a global mean wetland NEP of 56.4 (44.0‒68.8) gC m−2 yr−1. Integrating the NEP dataset with environmental datasets and machine-learning models, we estimated the mean annual global wetland C sequestration between 2000 and 2020 to be 1,004 (961‒1,047) TgC, 70% of which originated from tropical wetlands. We observed a decline in global wetland C sinks until 2005, followed by an increase thereafter. Overall, wetland C sequestration was roughly stable during 2000‒2020, as gains in northern mid-to-high latitudes were fully overwhelmed by declines in the tropics and southern mid-to-high latitudes. Our findings highlight hydrological change as a dominant driver of increasing regional variability in wetland C sinks, while intensifying hydrological extremes under climate change may undermine the resilience of wetland C sinks and the ecosystem services they support. Here the authors identify hotspots for wetland carbon uptake and regions where wetland carbon sinks are most susceptible to hydrological shifts. They show that two decades of improved carbon sinks in northern mid- to high-latitude wetlands are offset by declining efficiencies elsewhere.},

Here we analyse global forest age dynamics from 2010 to 2020 using the Global Age Mapping Integration v2.0 dataset, alongside satellite-derived aboveground carbon (AGC) and atmospheric inversion-derived net CO2 flux data. We reveal widespread declines in forest age across the Amazon, Congo Basin, Southeast Asia and parts of Siberia, primarily driven by stand-replacing disturbances such as fire and harvest, leading to the replacement of older forests by younger stands. Meanwhile, forests in China, Europe and North America experienced net ageing. Globally, stand replacement resulted in substantial AGC losses, with old forests (&gt;200 years, ~98.0 MgC ha−1) transitioning to younger, carbon-poor stands (&lt;20 years, ~43.5 MgC ha−1), leading to a net AGC loss of ~0.14 PgC per year. Despite this, regions with high rates of young stands replacing old forests exhibited a temporary strengthening of the carbon sink, driven by the rapid regrowth of these young stands. Crucially, these young forests do not compensate for the long-term carbon storage of old forests. Our findings underscore the importance of protecting old forests while optimizing forest management strategies to maximize carbon gains and enhance climate mitigation. A global analysis reveals regional trends of net forest ageing but also that widespread stand-replacing disturbances, such as fire and harvest, are driving declining forest age in many areas, often accompanied by substantial losses in aboveground carbon stocks and shifts in carbon sink dynamics.},

  abstract     = {Although numerous studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem stability, that is low temporal variability in ecosystem functions, the role of interspecific interactions in driving this relationship remains elusive. Here we develop a partitioning framework to disentangle the effects of interspecific interactions on ecosystem variability from those of interaction-independent processes. Applying this framework to competition models and biodiversity experiments in European and North American grasslands, we find that species-specific dynamics observable in monocultures (for example, environmental responses or demographic stochasticity), rather than interspecific interactions observable only in mixtures, explain much of the stabilizing effects of biodiversity on ecosystems. The weak net effect of interspecific interactions results from two counter-balancing effects: an interaction-driven increase in average species variability and an interaction-driven decrease in average species synchrony. We also find that interspecific interactions contributing to higher ecosystem functioning tend to reduce ecosystem variability. Our study provides a systematic empirical assessment of the role of interspecific interactions in shaping grassland ecosystem stability, challenging traditional assumptions about their importance and highlighting species-specific dynamics as the primary mechanism underlying the pervasive biodiversity–stability relationship. The role of interspecific interactions in biodiversity–ecosystem stability relationships is unclear.

  abstract     = {Understanding how plants adjust their hydraulic system to the environment is essential to predict how these organisms will respond to global change. Here we compiled a dataset and performed meta-analysis on 223 studies on plastic and evolutionary adjustments of hydraulic traits to air temperature, CO2 concentration, irradiance, soil nutrient and water availability. On average, species plastically increased embolism resistance and sapwood area per leaf area under drier conditions, with a decrease in stem-specific hydraulic conductivity and water potential at the turgor loss point, which are consistent with adaptive responses. However, the average increased embolism resistance was not sufficient to compensate the reduction in the minimum water potential, implying a lower safety margin from lethal hydraulic failure under drought. These results point towards a general critical increase in the risk of hydraulic failure in future drier environments. Plastic responses to increased soil nutrient content and irradiance did not always align with those to drought, highlighting the potential for changes in light and nutrient conditions to modify plant hydraulic responses to climate-change-driven droughts. Plants across many ecosystems are increasingly exposed to dryness stress. Using meta-analysis, the authors show that plants can adjust their hydraulic traits in response to drought and other global change factors, but not equally across traits and not enough to prevent lethal hydraulic failure.},

  abstract     = {Tree diversity often increases stand-level growth, but whether neighbourhood diversity effects on individual tree growth change with climatic conditions remains unclear. Here, using 852,170 records of 113,701 individuals from 129 species in 15 tree diversity experiments across four biomes, we address this knowledge gap with a synthesis of tree growth data spanning a broad climate gradient. We examine how neighbourhood-scale (defined as a focal tree and the adjacent trees) taxonomic and functional diversity effects on tree growth vary with climate, both spatially (across sites) and temporally (within sites). Increasing species richness and trait dissimilarity from monospecific to high-diversity neighbourhoods enhanced individual tree growth by 7–13% on average. The positive diversity effect increased from dry to wet climates, contrasting with most prior studies, but was unaffected by interannual climatic variation within sites. Given that tree–tree interactions are ubiquitous and likely to interact with climate in both young and old forests, our findings suggest incorporating neighbourhood diversity as a management tool to enhance forest productivity, while considering underlying mechanisms and interactions with climate, thereby facilitating targeted and site-specific climate and biodiversity benefits. How tree diversity effects on ecosystem functioning vary along climatic gradients is unclear. Here, analysing data from 15 experimental forest sites, the authors show that tree growth responses to neighbourhood species diversity are stronger in wetter climates but are unaffected by interannual climatic variation within sites.},

  abstract     = {Precipitation effects on plant carbon uptake extend beyond immediate timeframes, reflecting temporal lags between rainfall and plant growth. Mechanisms and relative importance of such lagged effects are expected to vary across ecosystems. Here we draw on an extensive collections of productivity proxies from long-term ground measurements, satellite observations and model simulations to show that preceding-year precipitation exerts a comparable influence on plant productivity to current-year precipitation. Statistically supported lagged precipitation effects are detected in 13.4%–19.7% of the grids depending on the data source. In these sites, preceding-year precipitation positively controls current-year plant productivity in water-limited areas, while negative effects occur in some wet regions, such as tropical forests. While aridity emerges as the main driver of this spatial variability, machine learning-based spatial attribution also indicates interactions among plant traits, climatic conditions and soil properties. We also show that soil water dynamics, plant phenology and foliar structure might mediate lagged precipitation effects across time. Our findings highlight the role of preceding-year precipitation in global plant productivity. Precipitation is a key driver of plant growth. Here the authors integrate ground-based observations, remote sensing and process-based models to disentangle the relative contribution of preceding-year and current-year precipitation on plant productivity and identify its predictors across biomes.},

  abstract     = {Vegetation responses to soil moisture limitation play a key role in land–atmosphere interactions and are a major source of uncertainty in future projections of the global water and carbon cycles. Vegetation water-use strategies—that is, how plants regulate transpiration rates as the soil dries—are highly dynamic across space and time, presenting a major challenge to inferring ecosystem responses to water limitation. Here we show that, when aggregated globally, water-use strategies derived from point-based soil moisture observations exhibit emergent patterns across and within climates and vegetation types along a spectrum of aggressive to conservative responses to water limitation. Water use becomes more conservative, declining more rapidly as the soil dries, as mean annual precipitation increases and as woody cover increases from grasslands to savannahs to forests. We embed this empirical synthesis within an ecohydrological framework to show that key ecological (leaf area) and hydroclimatic (aridity) factors driving demand for water explain up to 77% of the variance in water-use strategies within ecosystem types. All biomes respond to ecological and hydroclimatic demand by shifting towards more aggressive water-use strategies. However, woodlands reach a threshold beyond which water use becomes increasingly conservative, probably reflecting the greater hydraulic risk and cost of tissue damage associated with sustaining high transpiration rates under water limitation for trees than grasses. These findings highlight the importance of characterizing the dynamic nature of vegetation water-use strategies to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change. Vegetation responses to water limitation are difficult to predict due to large variation across space and time. A new analysis of global soil moisture dynamics reveals that water-use strategies vary systematically by vegetation type in response to ecological and climatic conditions.},

  abstract     = {Few high-latitude archaeological contexts are older than marine isotope stage (MIS) 15 and even fewer provide evidence of early human occupation during a glacial period. New discoveries at Old Park, Canterbury (UK), provide evidence of both the oldest accessible artefact-bearing sediment in northern Europe and cold-stage adaptation. Radiometric and palaeomagnetic dating places the earliest suggested occupation of this site between 773 thousand years ago (ka) and 607 ka, with hominin presence inferred during MIS 17–16. Two additional artefact-bearing stratigraphic units, dated to around 542 ka and 437 ka, strongly align with the MIS 14 and 12 cold stages, respectively. The latter unit contains convincing evidence of glacial-stage occupation by Acheulean hominins; fresh, unabraded flakes (including biface-thinning) between clearly defined glacial-aged sediments displaying mixed grassland palaeoenvironmental evidence. An historically collected assemblage of more than 330 handaxes is argued to be derived from both the MIS 17–16 and MIS 12 sediments, providing evidence of the earliest known Acheulean bifaces in northern Europe, and re-occupation by Acheulean populations 200,000 years later. Together, Old Park provides evidence for Lower Palaeolithic hominins reoccupying a location over several mid-Pleistocene MIS cycles, early human presence above 51° latitude during a glacial stage and handaxe production in northern Europe from MIS 17 to 16. The authors report Acheulean hominin occupation of eastern Britain during glacial marine isotope stages 17–16 and again in glacial marine isotope stage 12 via stone tools in sediments dated to 712,000 to 424,000 years ago.},

  abstract     = {All plants and animals are host to a community of microorganisms, their microbiotas, which have crucial influences on the life history and performance of their hosts. Despite the importance of such host–microbiota relationships, relatively little is known about the role microbiotas have in mediating evolution of the host and entire host–microbe assemblages. This knowledge gap is partly due to the lack of theoretical frameworks that generate testable predictions on the evolutionary dynamics of host–microbiota systems. In this Perspective, we argue that the foundation for such frameworks exists in evolutionary theory. We highlight four examples of theoretical models—niche construction, indirect genetic effects, maternal effects and multilevel selection—that capture important aspects of host–microbiome evolution. We outline how each of these frameworks can provide key insights into the evolution of host–microbiota systems while also suggesting expansions of current theory to incorporate processes unique to host–microbe assemblages; for instance, focusing on nuances in microbiota transmission and ecological microbial community dynamics. Expanding evolutionary theory to accommodate host–microbiota associations is key for a more integrative understanding of evolution, and the approach outlined here can guide future empirical research on the function and evolution of these ubiquitous interactions. This Perspective discusses how well-established theoretical models of evolution can be adapted to study and generate testable predictions about the evolutionary dynamics of host–microbiota associations.},
