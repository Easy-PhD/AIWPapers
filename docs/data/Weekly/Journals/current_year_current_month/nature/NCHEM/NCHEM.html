  abstract     = {The well-defined catalytic conversion of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) by molecular complexes is of fundamental interest and important for providing an atomic-level understanding of reactivity that can be related to industrial and biological nitrogen-fixation processes. Molecular catalytic N2 to NH3 conversion currently involves the reduction and protonation of terminal or bridging end-on bound metal–N2 complexes. However, catalytic N2 to NH3 conversion by side-on bound metal–N2 molecular complexes is relevant to both the industrial and biological nitrogen-fixation processes. Here, using a uranium triamidoamine complex, we report catalytic N2 to NH3 conversion involving side-on bound N2 binding. Stoichiometric reactions reveal stepwise reduction of N2 from free N2 to bridging side-on bound forms and subsequently to bridging nitrides, uniquely accessing four different states of side-on bound N2 for the same molecular system. This reveals the roles of N2, N22−, N23−, N24− and N3− in the catalytic conversion of N2 to NH3 when involving side-on bridging N2. The catalytic conversion of nitrogen to ammonia by molecular complexes typically involves the reduction and protonation of end-on metal–N2 compounds. Now, a uranium complex has been shown to catalyse the conversion of N2 to ammonia through the formation of a side-on bound dinitrogen complex. Four different states of side-on bound dinitrogen and the cleavage to nitride have been observed.},

  abstract     = {Organoboron compounds are important intermediates in organic synthesis, commonly used in metal-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. Their unique reactivity also allows modifications of their carbon framework with preservation of the valuable boryl group. Traditionally, these homologation reactions have been confined to the formation of alkyl boron compounds via C(sp3) insertion into a C–B bond. However, recent advancements in C(sp2)-insertive homologation highlight the potential of these reactions in synthesizing complex alkenes, despite current limitations in scope and control of the alkene geometry. Here we demonstrate a catalytic C(sp2)-insertive homologation for the regio- and diastereoselective synthesis of complex trisubstituted diborylalkenes from simple alkylboranes and alkynyl boronic esters. Our work demonstrates a broad reaction scope and application of the resulting products in modular and stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted alkenes. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting a unique mechanism responsible for the excellent stereoselectivity observed in the reaction. Homologation reactions of organoboron compounds, while common, have rarely been used in stereoselective synthesis of highly substituted alkenes. Now a catalytic diastereoselective homologation of alkylboranes into trisubstituted alkenes has been developed, with key catalytic intermediates elucidated in a detailed mechanistic study.},

This requires electronic excitations, excitons, with net spin. Here we report a molecular diradical where two trityl radical groups are coupled via a meta-linked fluorene bridge. The singlet exciton is at lower energy than the triplet because electron transfer from one of the radical non-bonding orbitals to the other is spin allowed, set by the charging energy for the double occupancy of the non-bonding level, the Hubbard U. Both excitons give efficient photoluminescence at 640 and 700 nm with near unity efficiency. The ground state exchange energy is low, 60 µeV, allowing control of ground state spin populations. We demonstrate spin-selective intersystem crossing and show coherent microwave control. We report up to 8% photoluminescence contrast at microwave resonance. This tuning of the singlet Mott–Hubbard exciton against the ‘bandgap’ exciton provides a new design platform for spin–optical materials. Controlling electron spin states with light is vital for quantum technologies but requires electronic excitations with net spin. Now a molecular diradical with two trityl radical groups coupled via a meta-linked fluorene bridge has been developed that features luminescent singlet and triplet excitons. The spins in the ground state can be written and read using photons, giving rise to broad magnetic and microwave modulation of the photoluminescence.},

The optical properties of these materials make them promising candidates in light-emitting devices. However, developing their general design principles remains challenging. Here we report an antisolvent incorporation approach that transforms a broad range of two-dimensional tin iodide perovskites into 0D structures. This approach accommodates diverse organic cations and antisolvent molecules and is extendable to germanium and lead analogues. We show that enhancing the structural rigidity in Sn-based octahedra—modulated by organic packing—increases the radiative recombination rate while decreasing the non-radiative recombination rate, achieving near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Ge- and Sn-based structures exhibit large Stokes shifts and microsecond-scale triplet lifetimes due to localized excited states, while their Pb-based counterpart shows faster recombination via triplet–singlet mixing, supported by theoretical calculations. This work offers a versatile synthetic platform for 0D metal halides and deepens our current understanding of excited-state dynamics in halide perovskites. Zero-dimensional metal halides exhibit intriguing photophysical properties; however, developing their general design principles remains challenging. Now it has been shown that two-dimensional perovskites can be converted into zero-dimensional octahedral metal halides through solvent incorporation. The resulting materials feature near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields. Structural rigidity and the choice of metal cation are key parameters to tune the exciton recombination dynamics.},

Lipidomic analysis has identified a growing number of lipid species, including PUFAs with diverse structural variations and biofunctions, yet their structure–function relationships are still largely unknown. In this context, an efficient synthesis of PUFAs would be highly desirable. However, no practical methodology exists for their preparation, in contrast to peptides and nucleic acids, for which diverse molecules are accessible through a well-established solid-phase synthesis. To address this, we have developed an efficient and expedited method to access a wide array of PUFAs by full solid-phase synthesis. The method allows the synthesis of various PUFAs and analogues through rapid and facile operations. Moreover, within our PUFA library, we have discovered an artificial fatty acid, antiefin, that has a high anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. Therefore, our practical synthetic pathway to PUFAs, a crucial class of lipids, is expected to make an important contribution to lipid science. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are attracting considerable interest because of their diverse structures and properties. Now a method to access a wide array of PUFAs by full solid-phase synthesis has been developed and used to discover an anti-inflammatory fatty acid.},

  abstract     = {Chiral catalysts that can engage multiple substrates, via distinct ground-state activation modes, to deliver enantioenriched products with high levels of fidelity are often described as ‘privileged’. Achieving generality in excited-state processes remains challenging, and efforts to identify privileged chiral photocatalysts are being intensively pursued. Aluminium–salen complexes are emergent contenders on account of their well-defined photophysical properties. Here we report the development of an enantioselective energy transfer (EnT) catalysis-enabled photocyclization of acrylanilides to expand the activation repertoire of Al–salen photocatalysts. This approach allows reactivity and enantioselectivity to be simultaneously regulated by an inexpensive, commercial chiral Al–salen complex upon irradiation at λ = 400 nm. Diverse cyclic products can be forged with high levels of enantioselectivity (up to 96:4 e.r.). Establishing this dichotomy in excited-state activation modes serves to consolidate the privileged status of chiral Al–salen complexes in enantioselective photocatalysis and to complement their ubiquity in ground-state regimes. Photocatalysts that can engage a range of substrates and regulate reactivity and enantioselectivity are highly desirable. Now, an enantioselective energy transfer catalysis-enabled photocyclization of acrylanilides has been developed. Reactivity and enantioselectivity are simultaneously regulated by a commercial chiral Al–salen complex upon irradiation, enabling the formation of diverse cyclic products with high levels of enantioselectivity.},

  abstract     = {In biological systems, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) provides an energetic driving force for peptide bond formation, but protein chemists lack tools that emulate this strategy. Here we develop an ATP-driven platform for C-terminal activation and peptide ligation based on MccB, a bacterial ancestor of ubiquitin-activating (E1) enzymes. We show that MccB can act on non-native substrates to generate an O-AMPylated electrophile that reacts with exogenous nucleophiles to form diverse C-terminal functional groups including thioesters, a versatile class of biological intermediates that have been exploited for protein C-terminal bioconjugation. By mining the natural diversity of the MccB family, we identify both epitope-specific and more promiscuous MccBs. We show that epitope-specific MccB activity can be directed toward specific proteins of interest to enable high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation, and promiscuous MccB activity can be deployed for the synthesis of peptide thioester substrates for bioconjugation. Our method mimics the chemical logic of biological peptide bond synthesis for high-yield in vitro manipulation of protein structure with molecular precision. In living systems, ATP provides an energetic driving force for protein synthesis and modification. Now, an engineered enzymatic tool has been developed for high-yield, ATP-driven protein bioconjugation through versatile thioester intermediates.

Here we present the synthesis of a lanthanide–carbon triple bond contained inside an endohedral fullerene cage. More specifically, we report a cerium–carbide [Ce≡CSc2] cluster encapsulated inside a C80 fullerene cage.

Our data reveal a very short Ce≡C distance of 1.969(7) Å. Chemical bonding analysis suggests that the formation of the Ce≡C bond primarily arises from the stronger bonding affinity between carbon and cerium compared with scandium inside the encapsulated cluster. The fullerene cage plays a crucial role in stabilizing and protecting this trimetallic carbide cluster featuring a Ce≡C triple bond. The synthesis and isolation of compounds featuring lanthanide–carbon triple bonds remain challenging.

Here we combine these features in a hybrid system by means of the on-surface synthesis of zigzag-edge GNRs embedded with porphyrins laterally fused along the ribbon backbone. Using scanning probe methods, we show that this design achieves strong electronic coupling between the porphyrin and the GNR. For transition metal porphyrins, pronounced exchange coupling between distant metal centres is mediated by the π-electron system. Such a hybrid d and π electron ribbon system introduces spin–orbit coupling and magnetic anisotropy to carbon nanomaterials, and holds great promise for coherent electrical control of electron spins. Graphene nanoribbons with zigzag edges are key candidates for spintronic applications due to their tunable bandgaps and spin-polarized edge states.

  abstract     = {Efficient sunlight-to-energy conversion requires materials that can generate long-lived charge carriers upon illumination. However, the targeted design of semiconductors possessing intrinsically long lifetimes remains a key challenge. Here using a series of transition metal oxides, we establish a link between carrier lifetime and electronic configuration in transition metal-based semiconductors. We identify a subpicosecond relaxation mechanism via metal-centred ligand field states that compromise quantum yields in open d-shell transition metal oxides (for example, Fe2O3, Co3O4, Cr2O3 and NiO), which is more reminiscent of molecular complexes than crystalline semiconductors. We found that materials with spin-forbidden ligand field transitions could partially mitigate this relaxation pathway, explaining why Fe2O3 achieves higher photoelectrochemical activity than other visible light-absorbing transition metal oxides. However, achieving high yields of long-lived charges requires transition metal oxides with d0 or d10 electronic configurations (for example, TiO2 and BiVO4), where ligand field states are absent. These trends translate to transition metal-containing semiconductors beyond oxides, enabling the design of photoabsorbers with better-controlled recombination channels in photovoltaics, photocatalysis and communication devices. Efficient sunlight-to-fuel conversion requires materials that produce long-lived charges, but increasing carrier lifetimes in visible-light-active photocatalysts has proven difficult. Now it has been shown that rapid charge deactivation via metal-centred states prevents long lifetimes and limits photocatalytic performance. These insights bridge solid-state and molecular photochemistry, informing strategies for improved photocatalyst design.},

  abstract     = {DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) are useful for hit discovery in the pharmaceutical industry. Although a large number of individually coded molecules are accessible through DELs, their structural diversity is limited because few transformations are benign and chemoselective enough to be applied in the presence of DNA in aqueous environments. In particular, C–H functionalization chemistry that could be ideally suited to increase structural diversity through late-stage functionalization is currently absent from DEL synthesis. Here we present a general C–H functionalization of electron-rich arenes on DNA. The development of a selenoxide reagent is key to achieving the regio- and chemoselective formation of arylselenonium salts in aqueous media. The introduction of arylselenonium salts offers a versatile linchpin on DNA conjugates, which gives access to a multitude of analogues through diverse subsequent reactions, including transition-metal-mediated and photochemical transformations for the formation of C–C, C–I and C–S bonds. C–H functionalization is a key reaction in organic synthesis. Now a selenoxide reagent has been developed for the formation of arylselenonium salts via C–H functionalization of DNA conjugates with high selectivity. The arylselenonium salts participate in various transformations to forge new C–C and C–X bonds.},

  abstract     = {Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation are often minor structural modifications that can have profound effects on protein structure and thus broaden protein functions. Nevertheless, studying these effects directly is often out of reach because no general chemistry exists to introduce small modifications selectively; either a large, stable linker structure is selectively installed on protein residues, or a small substituent is introduced at the risk of low selectivity due to the use of reactive, indiscriminate molecules. Here we report a C–H functionalization reaction of tyrosine residues to access peptides and proteins modified by small structural changes including single-atom substitutions. A rationally designed selenoxide introduces a versatile selenonium linchpin featuring a Ctyr–Se bond that can be used for further transformations at specific tyrosine residues. Key to the advance is the interplay of water-resistant, intramolecular chalcogen and hydrogen bonding of the selenoxide reagent, which allows chemo- and site-selective electrophilic aromatic substitution of tyrosine residues in aqueous solutions. Proteins with small structural modifications at specific sites are valuable, yet challenging to access by chemical methods. Now, tyrosine-selective single-atom modifications on proteins have been achieved by C–H functionalization using a rationally designed selenoxide to introduce a versatile selenonium linchpin for further transformations.},

  abstract     = {The site-specific modification of amines has been a highly sought-after objective in organic synthesis. Despite the rapid advancement of carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bond functionalization methods, effective strategies for carbon–carbon (C–C) bond functionalization of amines remain elusive. Here we report a borane-catalysed method for the selective insertion of alkynes into alkyl C–C bonds of amines, resulting in the ring expansion of cyclic amines and chain elongation of acyclic amines. This approach begins with the cleavage of C–H bonds in amines, then transitioning to C–C bond functionalization upon reaction with alkynes. This method is effective with amines lacking an activating or leaving group and is suitable for late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals through C–C bond modification. Furthermore, by coupling this reaction with hydrolysis and hydrogenation steps, successive alkyne insertions are achieved, enabling modular and iterative alkyl growth of amines. The functionalization of carbon–carbon bonds in amines remains an important challenge in organic synthesis. Now a borane-catalysed method has been developed that enables the insertion of alkynes into the alkyl C–C bonds of amines, providing a versatile approach for the ring expansion of cyclic amines and chain elongation of acyclic amines.},

  abstract     = {Organic electrode materials offer a versatile, sustainable approach for next-generation lithium-ion batteries but are limited by low working voltages and poor cycling stability. Here we report a solid-solvation-structure design strategy to improve both the voltage and stability of organic electrode materials in all-solid-state batteries. As a proof of concept, we incorporate halide electrolytes as solid solutes and tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone as a solid solvent to form homogeneous solid cathode solutions. Systematic optimization of the inner solvation configuration enables tetrachloro-o-benzoquinone to achieve a high working voltage (3.6 V vs. Li+/Li) at room temperature within an asymmetric solid solvation sheath. Moreover, the equilibrium redox pathway and electrostatically driven self-healing interfaces revealed rapid redox kinetics and stable performance over 7,500 cycles in all-solid-state batteries under low stack pressures. This work demonstrates that organic electrode materials can serve as viable, durable and cost-effective alternatives to transition metal oxides in all-solid-state batteries. Organic electrode materials offer a versatile and sustainable route for lithium-ion batteries, but their application is hindered by low working voltages and poor cycling stability. Now, it has been shown that dissolving halide electrolytes into organic electrodes effectively tunes the working voltage and enhances the electrochemical performance of all-solid-state batteries.},
