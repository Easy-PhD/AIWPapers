  abstract     = {Sweet taste perception influences dietary choices and metabolic health. The human sweet taste receptor, a class C G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterodimer composed of TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 (refs. 1,2), senses a wide range of sweet compounds—including natural sugars, artificial sweeteners and sweet proteins—and affects metabolic regulation beyond taste. However, the lack of three-dimensional structures hinders our understanding of its precise working mechanism. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the full-length human sweet taste receptor in apo and sucralose-bound states. These structures reveal a distinct asymmetric heterodimer architecture, with sucralose binding exclusively to the Venus flytrap domain of TAS1R2. Combining mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations, this work delineates the sweetener-recognition modes in TAS1R2. Structural comparisons further uncover conformational changes upon ligand binding and a unique activation mechanism. These findings illuminate the signal transduction mechanisms of chemosensory receptors in the class C GPCR family and provide the molecular basis for the design of a new generation of sweeteners. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human sweet taste receptor in the apo and sucralose-bound states reveal its heterodimeric architecture and mechanisms of ligand binding and signal activation.},

  abstract     = {The surface landscapes of cells differ as a function of cell type and are frequently altered in disease contexts1–3. Exploiting such differences is key to many therapeutic strategies and is the basis for developing diagnostic and basic-science tools. State-of-the-art strategies typically target single surface antigens, but each individual receptor rarely defines the specific cell type4,5. The development of programmable molecular systems that integrate multiple cell-surface features to convert on-target inputs to user-defined outputs is therefore highly desirable. Here we describe an autonomous decision-making device driven by proximity-gated protein trans-splicing that allows local generation of an active protein from two otherwise inactive polypeptide fragments. We show that this protein-actuator platform can perform convergent protein ligation on designated cell surfaces, allowing highly selective generation of active proteins, which can either remain physically associated with the cell surface on which they were manufactured or be released into the surrounding milieu. Because of its intrinsic modularity and tunability, we demonstrate that the technology is compatible with different types of input, targeting modality and functional output, allowing for the localized interrogation or manipulation of cellular systems. A synthetic biology system called SMART has been developed that uses conditional protein splicing for the programmable ligation of functional proteins from previously defined molecular combinations on cell surfaces.},

  abstract     = {Glycosylation is central to the localization and function of biomolecules1. We recently discovered that small RNAs undergo N-glycosylation2 at the modified RNA base 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine (acp3U)3. However, the functional significance of N-glycosylation of RNAs is unknown. Here we show that the N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs. We found that de-N-glycosylation of cell-culture-derived and circulating human and mouse glycoRNA elicited potent inflammatory responses including the production of type I interferons in a Toll-like receptor 3- and Toll-like receptor 7-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that N-glycans on cell surface RNAs prevent apoptotic cells from triggering endosomal RNA sensors in efferocytes, thus facilitating the non-inflammatory clearance of dead cells. Mechanistically, N-glycans conceal the hypermodified uracil base acp3U, which we identified as immunostimulatory when exposed in RNA. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of an enzyme (DTWD2) that synthesizes acp3U abrogated innate immune activation by de-N-glycosylated small RNAs and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, synthetic acp3U-containing RNAs are sufficient to trigger innate immune responses. Thus, our study has uncovered a natural mechanism by which N-glycans block RNAs from inducing acp3U-dependent innate immune activation, demonstrating how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses. N-glycans on glycoRNAs prevent innate immune sensing of endogenous small RNAs, and the natural mechanism they use demonstrates how glycoRNAs exist on the cell surface and in the endosomal network without inducing autoinflammatory responses.},

  abstract     = {Extrachromosomal DNA amplification is associated with poor cancer prognoses1. Large numbers of excised signal circles (ESCs) are produced as by-products of antigen receptor rearrangement during&nbsp;V(D)J recombination2,3. However, current dogma states that ESCs are progressively lost through cell division4. Here we show that ESCs replicate and persist through many cell generations and share many properties in common&nbsp;with circular extrachromosomal DNAs. Increased ESC copy numbers at diagnosis of B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were highly correlated with subsequent relapse. By taking advantage of the matching recombination footprint that is formed upon the generation of each ESC, we measured ESC persistence and replication and found increased ESC replication in patients who later relapsed. This increased replication is controlled by cell-intrinsic factors and corresponds to increased expression of DNA replication- and repair-associated genes. Consistent with high ESC levels having a role in disease progression, the number of mutations typical of those caused by the V(D)J recombinase–ESC complex was significantly increased at diagnosis in patients who later relapsed. The number of such&nbsp;mutations in genes associated with relapse increased between diagnosis and relapse, and corresponded to clonal expansion of cells with high ESC copy numbers. These data demonstrate that the by-product of V(D)J recombination, when increased in abundance, potently associates with the&nbsp;V(D)J recombinase to cause adverse disease outcomes. Excised signal circles are circular DNA by-products of V(D)J recombination that form a complex with the V(D)J recombinase, and when increased in abundance, result in increased mutagenesis, causing adverse outcomes in cancer.},

  abstract     = {Cancer development and response to treatment are evolutionary processes1,2, but characterizing evolutionary dynamics at a clinically meaningful scale has remained challenging3. Here we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based on natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time4, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that initial tumour growth rate, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe faster initial tumour growth in more aggressive disease subtypes, and that evolutionary histories are strong independent prognostic factors in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Using EVOFLUx for phylogenetic analyses of aggressive Richter-transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples detected that the seed of the transformed clone existed decades before presentation. Orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences is provided using additional genetic data, including long-read nanopore sequencing, and clinical variables. Collectively, we show how widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measure cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour. Cancer evolutionary dynamics are quantitatively inferred using a method, EVOFLUx, applied to fluctuating DNA methylation.},

  abstract     = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) remains the world’s deadliest bacterial pathogen1. There is an urgent medical need to develop new drugs that shorten the treatment duration to combat widespread multi-drug-resistant and extensive-drug-resistant Mtb. Here, we present a preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, that contains an aryl fluorosulfate (SuFEx)2 warhead and uniquely targets the acyltransferase domain of Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis. CMX410 is equipotent against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of Mtb and efficacious in multiple mouse models of infection. Inhibition by CMX410 is irreversible through a previously undescribed mechanism: CMX410 reacts with the catalytic serine of the AT domain of Pks13, rapidly and irreversibly disabling the active site by forming a β-lactam. CMX410 is highly selective for its target and thus demonstrates excellent pharmacological and safety profiles, including no adverse effects in a 14-day rat toxicity study up to 1,000 mg kg−1 per day. The distinctive mode of action from current drugs, high potency across all tested clinical isolates, oral bioavailability, favourable performance in drug combination testing and superior pharmacological and safety characteristics make CMX410 a promising first-in-class candidate to replace outdated cell-wall biosynthesis inhibitors, such as isoniazid and ethambutol, in tuberculosis regimens. A preclinical covalent compound, CMX410, contains a aryl fluorosulfate warhead that targets the acyltransferase domain of Mtb&nbsp;Pks13, an essential enzyme in cell-wall biosynthesis, making it a promising candidate for tuberculosis treatment regimens.},

  abstract     = {Malaria remains a substantial global health challenge, causing approximately half a million deaths each year1. The mosquito fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) is required for malaria parasites to infect the midgut epithelium2. The naturally occurring FREP1Q allele has been reported to prevent parasite infection, while supporting essential physiological functions in the mosquito3. Here we generate congenic strains of Anopheles stephensi, edited to carry either the parasite-susceptible FREP1L224 or the putative-refractory FREP1Q224 alleles. The FREP1Q224 allele confers robust resistance to infection by both human and rodent malaria parasites, with negligible fitness costs. The protective FREP1Q224 allele can be efficiently driven into FREP1L224 mosquito populations using a novel linked allelic-drive system that selectively replaces the L224 codon with the parasite-refractory Q224 allele, thereby rendering populations refractory to parasite infection. This antimalaria drive system provides a novel genetic approach to aid in malaria elimination efforts. Coupling of a FREP1 variant to a gene-drive system allows the spread of a host malaria resistance allele through the mosquito population.},

  abstract     = {Remodelling plant immune receptors has become a vital strategy for creating new disease resistance traits to combat the growing threat of plant pathogens to global food security and environmental sustainability1–17. However, current methods are constrained by the rapid evolution of plant pathogens and often lack broad-spectrum and durable protection. Here we report an innovative strategy to engineer broad-spectrum, durable and complete disease resistance in plants through expression of a chimeric protein containing a flexible polypeptide coupled with a single or dual conserved pathogen-originated protease cleavage site fused in frame to the N terminus of an autoactive nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat immune receptor (NLR) containing a coiled-coil or RESISTANCE TO POWDERY MILDEW 8-like coiled-coil domain. Following invasion, pathogen-originated specific proteases cleave the inactive chimeric protein to form free autoactive NLR, triggering broad-spectrum plant disease resistance. We demonstrate that a single engineered NLR can confer broad-spectrum and complete resistance against multiple potyviruses. Given that many pathogenic organisms across kingdoms encode proteases, this strategy has the potential to be exploited to control viruses, bacteria, oomycetes, fungi, nematodes and pests in plants. Cleavage by pathogen-derived proteases of an engineered chimeric protein activates its plant immune receptor component, enabling broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens in plants.},

  abstract     = {To coexist with its resident microorganisms, the host must have a sense to adjust its behaviour in response to them. In the intestine, a sense for nutrients transduced to the brain through neuroepithelial circuits guides appetitive choices1–5. However, a sense that allows the host to respond in real time to stimuli arising from resident gut microorganisms remains to be uncovered. Here we show that in the mouse colon, the ubiquitous microbial pattern flagellin—a unifying feature across phyla6—stimulates Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) in peptide YY (PYY)-labelled colonic neuropod cells. This stimulation leads to PYY release onto NPY2R vagal nodose neurons to regulate feeding. Mice lacking TLR5 in these cells eat more and gain more weight than controls. We found that flagellin does not act on the nerve directly. Instead, flagellin stimulates neuropod cells from the colonic lumen to reduce feeding through a gut–brain sensory neural circuit. Moreover, flagellin reduces feeding independent of immune responses, metabolic changes or the presence of gut microbiota. This sense enables the host to adjust its behaviour in response to a molecular pattern from its resident microorganisms. We call this sense at the interface of the biota and the brain the neurobiotic sense7. A study reveals a gut–brain sensory pathway through which the microbial component flagellin activates neuropod&nbsp;cells in the colon to signal the brain and reduce feeding in mice.},

  abstract     = {To gain a comprehensive, unbiased perspective on molecular changes in the brain that may underlie the need for sleep, we have characterized the transcriptomes of single cells isolated from rested and sleep-deprived flies. Here we report that transcripts upregulated after sleep deprivation, in sleep-control neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body1,2 (dFBNs) but not ubiquitously in the brain, encode almost exclusively proteins with roles in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. These gene expression changes are accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation, enhanced mitophagy and an increase in the number of contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, creating conduits3,4 for the replenishment of peroxidized lipids5. The morphological changes are reversible after recovery sleep and blunted by the installation of an electron overflow6,7 in the respiratory chain. Inducing or preventing mitochondrial fission or fusion8–13 in dFBNs alters sleep and the electrical properties of sleep-control cells in opposite directions: hyperfused mitochondria increase, whereas fragmented mitochondria decrease, neuronal excitability and sleep. ATP concentrations in dFBNs rise after enforced waking because of diminished ATP consumption during the arousal-mediated inhibition of these neurons14, which augments their mitochondrial electron leak7. Consistent with this view, uncoupling electron flux from ATP synthesis15 relieves the pressure to sleep, while exacerbating mismatches between electron supply and ATP demand (by powering ATP synthesis with a light-driven proton pump16) precipitates sleep. Sleep, like ageing17,18, may be an inescapable consequence of aerobic metabolism. Research on Drosophila neurons&nbsp;shows links between the need to sleep and aerobic metabolism, indicating that the pressure to sleep may have a mitochondrial origin.},

  abstract     = {The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are poorly understood1–5. Here we show that endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Of the metals we analysed, Li was the only one that was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li bioavailability was further reduced in AD by amyloid sequestration. We explored the role of endogenous Li in the brain by depleting it from the diet of wild-type and AD mouse models. Reducing endogenous cortical Li by approximately 50% markedly increased the deposition of amyloid-β and the accumulation of phospho-tau, and led to pro-inflammatory microglial activation, the loss of synapses, axons and myelin, and accelerated cognitive decline. These effects were mediated, at least in part, through activation of the kinase GSK3β. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Replacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD. Lithium has an essential role in the brain and is deficient early in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be recapitulated in mice and treated with a novel lithium salt that restores the physiological level.},

While diverse modalities have been developed, including keyboards, mice and touchscreens, they require interaction with a device that can be limiting, especially in on-the-go scenarios. Gesture-based systems use cameras or inertial sensors to avoid an intermediary device, but tend to perform well only for unobscured movements. By contrast, brain–computer or neuromotor interfaces that directly interface with the body’s electrical signalling have been imagined to solve the interface problem1, but high-bandwidth communication has been demonstrated only using invasive interfaces with bespoke decoders designed for single individuals2–4. Here, we describe the development of a generic non-invasive neuromotor interface that enables computer input decoded from surface electromyography (sEMG). We developed a highly sensitive, easily donned sEMG wristband and a scalable infrastructure for collecting training data from thousands of consenting participants. Together, these data enabled us to develop generic sEMG decoding models that generalize across people. Test users demonstrate a closed-loop median performance of gesture decoding of 0.66 target acquisitions per second in a continuous navigation task, 0.88 gesture detections per second in a discrete-gesture task and handwriting at 20.9 words per minute. We demonstrate that the decoding performance of handwriting models can be further improved by 16% by personalizing sEMG decoding models. To our knowledge, this is the first high-bandwidth neuromotor interface with performant out-of-the-box generalization across people. A high-bandwidth neuromotor interface offers performant out-of-the-box generalization across people.},

However, the lamprey-like internal anatomy8–13 reconstructed for osteostracans, the sister group of jawed vertebrates, seem to lack these gnathostome traits, implying a morphological gap despite phylogenetic proximity. Here, using synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography on the model osteostracan Norselaspis glacialis, we reveal derived gnathostome traits straddling a uniquely ossified head–trunk interface in this jawless fish. The inner ear of Norselaspis shows sensory elaborations (enlarged pars inferior and sinus superior) acquired well before the origin of jaws. As in crown gnathostomes, paired venous drainage channels blood into a high-volume cardiac tract. We also confirm a feature not yet demonstrated in any other vertebrate, to our knowledge: the most anterior trunk nerve&nbsp;extends its single trunk to the pectoral fin. In this respect, our reconstruction challenges the hypotheses14–16 that the gnathostome shoulder evolved from the gill apparatus. Our observations highlight Norselaspis as a prelude to the intercalation of the muscular neck and throat that would power the early jaw apparatus. Therefore, the vertebrate jaw—often considered the functional driver for ‘gnathostome’ innovations1–3—evolved instead as a follower to the sensory enhancement, increased cardiac output and greater locomotory control now inferred in the jawless sister group. Imaging of a Devonian jawless fish reveals advanced features previously thought to be&nbsp;exclusive to jawed vertebrates, challenging the idea that jaws were the primary driver for the evolution of derived traits in the&nbsp;vertebrate body plan.},

Here we report the discovery of the deepest and the most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities known to exist on Earth during an expedition to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench and the western Aleutian Trench using the manned submersible Fendouzhe. The communities dominated by siboglinid Polychaeta and Bivalvia span a distance of 2,500 km at depths from 5,800 m to 9,533 m. These communities are sustained by hydrogen sulfide-rich and methane-rich fluids that are transported along faults traversing deep sediment layers in trenches, where methane is produced microbially from deposited organic matter, as indicated by isotopic analysis. Given geological similarities with other hadal trenches, such chemosynthesis-based communities might be more widespread than previously anticipated. These findings challenge current models of life at extreme limits and carbon cycling in the deep ocean. The discovery of chemosynthesis-based benthic communities at depths of 5,800 m to 9,533 m in the Kuril–Kamchatka and western Aleutian trenches challenges traditional perspectives on the energy sources sustaining hadal fauna.},

Here we use satellite observations, machine learning and a chemical transport model to quantify global and regional PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter) exposure and human health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. We find that the fires increased annual PM2.5 exposure worldwide by 0.17 μg m–3 (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.26 μg m–3). North America had the largest increase in annual mean exposure (1.08 μg m–3; 0.82–1.34 μg m–3), but there were also increases in Europe (0.41 μg m–3; 0.32–0.50 μg m–3) owing to long-range transport. Annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada increased by 3.82 μg m–3 (3.00–4.64 μg m–3). In the USA, the contribution of the Canadian fires to increased PM2.5 was 1.49 μg m–3 (1.22–1.77 μg m–3), four times as large as the contribution from the 2023 wildfires originating in the USA. We find that 354 million (277–421 million) people in North America and Europe were exposed to daily PM2.5 air pollution caused by Canadian wildfires in 2023. We estimate that 5,400 (3,400–7,400) acute deaths in North America and 64,300 (37,800–90,900) chronic deaths in North America and Europe were attributable to PM2.5 exposure to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Our results highlight the far-reaching PM2.5 pollution and health burden that large wildfires can have in a single year. A modelling study based on satellite observations, machine learning&nbsp;and a&nbsp;chemical transport model quantifies the global and regional exposure to particulate-matter pollution and the human health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires.},

  abstract     = {Earth’s surface underwent stepwise oxygenation before persistently reaching modern levels late in its history1–5, but the details of this transition remain unclear5–16. Here we present a high-resolution 2.5-Gyr record of mass-independent oxygen isotopes in sedimentary sulfate (Δ′17Osulfate), a proxy linked to the atmospheric partial pressure of O2 ( $${p}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{2}}$$ )17–19. This record, together with existing sedimentary Δ33S data20–22, demonstrates a 2-Gyr transition characterized by generally low, fluctuating $${p}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{2}}$$ between an O2-free state before 2.4 billion years ago (Ga) and a modern $${p}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{2}}$$ state after 0.41 Ga, with relatively elevated levels after 1.0 Ga. Our data also show coupled declines in Δ′17Osulfate and sulfate-δ34S during major negative carbonate-δ13C excursions in the Neoproterozoic. Quantitative biogeochemical modelling indicates that these isotopic couplings reflect the increasing $${p}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{2}}$$ , which may have driven episodic ocean oxygenation through an increased atmospheric O2 influx. This process intensified the oxidation of marine organics and reduced-sulfur species, while triggering temporary $${p}_{{{\rm{O}}}_{2}}$$ drawdowns as negative feedback15. These findings support a dynamic, lengthy co-oxygenation history for the atmosphere and oceans—marked by long-term positive coupling and short-term negative feedbacks—offering a coherent explanation for the anomalous Neoproterozoic carbon cycles23,24 and the protracted, episodic rise of complex life25–27. A 2.5-billion-year record of oxygen isotopes in sedimentary sulfate reveals the transitional oxygenation of the Earth’s surface and provides constraints on the dynamic, lengthy co-oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere and oceans.},

  abstract     = {There is an increasing demand for multimodal sensing and stimulation bioelectronic fibres for both research and clinical applications1,2. However, existing fibres suffer from high rigidity, low component layout precision, limited functionality and low density of active components. These limitations arise from the challenge of integrating many components into one-dimensional fibre devices, especially owing to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (for example, photolithography) with curved, thin and long fibre structures2. As a result, limited applications have been demonstrated so far. Here we use ‘spiral transformation’ to convert two-dimensional thin films containing microfabricated devices into one-dimensional soft fibres. This approach allows for the fabrication of high-density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibres, termed Spiral-NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control on the longitudinal, angular and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. Taking advantage of the biocompatibility of our soft fibres with the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal system, we proceed to show the feasibility of our S-NeuroString for post-operative multimodal continuous motility mapping and tissue stimulation in awake pigs. We further demonstrate multi-channel single-unit electrical recording in mouse brain for up to 4 months, and a fabrication capability to produce 1,280 channels within a 230-μm-diameter soft fibre. Our soft bioelectronic fibres offer a powerful platform for minimally invasive implantable electronics, where diverse sensing and stimulation functionalities can be effectively integrated. High-density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibres provide a platform for minimally invasive implantable electronics, where diverse sensing and stimulation functionalities can be effectively integrated.},

Here, inspired by earthworms, we introduce NeuroWorm—a soft, stretchable and movable fibre sensor designed for bioelectronic interface. Our approach involves rolling to transform 2D bioelectronic devices into 1D NeuroWorm, creating a multifunctional microfibre that houses longitudinally distributed electrode arrays for both bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring. NeuroWorm effectively records high-quality spatio-temporal signals in situ while steerably advancing within the brain or on the muscle as needed. This allows for the dynamic targeting and shifting of desired monitoring sites. Implanted in muscle through a tiny incision, NeuroWorm provides stable bioelectrical monitoring in rats for more than 43 weeks. Even after 54 weeks of implantation in muscle, fibroblast encapsulation around the fibre remains negligible. Our NeuroWorm represents a platform that promotes a substantial advance in bioelectronics—from an immobile probe fixed in place to active, intelligent and living devices for long-term, minimally invasive and mobile evaluation of the nervous system. A soft, stretchable and freely movable fibre sensor called NeuroWorm, inspired by earthworms and that can be magnetically steered through soft tissue, is described as a new platform for dynamic bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring.},

  abstract     = {Learning enables biological organisms to begin life simple yet develop immensely diverse and complex behaviours. Understanding learning principles in engineered molecular systems could enable us to endow non-living physical systems with similar capabilities. Inspired by how the brain processes information, the principles of neural computation have been developed over the past 80 years1, forming the foundation of modern machine learning. More than four decades ago, connections between neural computation and physical systems were established2. More recently, synthetic molecular systems, including nucleic acid and protein circuits, have been investigated for their abilities to implement neural computation3–7. However, in these systems, learning of molecular parameters such as concentrations and reaction rates was performed in silico to generate desired input–output functions. Here we show that DNA molecules can be programmed to autonomously carry out supervised learning in vitro, with the system learning to perform pattern classification from molecular examples of inputs and desired responses. We demonstrate a DNA neural network trained to classify three different sets of 100-bit patterns, integrating training data directly into memories of molecular concentrations and using these memories to process subsequent test data. Our work suggests that molecular circuits can learn tasks more complex than simple adaptive behaviours. This opens the door to molecular machines capable of embedded learning and decision-making in a wide range of physical systems, from biomedicine to soft materials. DNA molecules can be programmed to autonomously carry out supervised learning in vitro, with the system learning to perform pattern classification from molecular examples of inputs and desired responses.},

  abstract     = {General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs)1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting3, have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. A new artificial intelligence model, DeepSeek-R1, is introduced, demonstrating that the reasoning abilities of large language models can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning, removing the need for human-annotated demonstrations.},

  abstract     = {Symmetry-protected topological phases1–4 cannot be described by any local order parameter and are beyond the conventional symmetry-breaking model5. They are characterized by topological boundary modes that remain stable under symmetry respecting perturbations1–4,6–8. In clean, gapped systems without disorder, the stability of these edge modes is restricted to the zero-temperature manifold; at finite temperatures, interactions with mobile thermal excitations lead to their decay9–11. Here we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge mode12–14, which is protected by emergent symmetries and persists across the entire spectrum, in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. Through digital quantum simulation of a one-dimensional disorder-free stabilizer Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles for a wide range of initial states. We show that the interaction between these edge modes and bulk excitations can be suppressed by dimerizing the stabilizer strength, leading to an emergent U(1) × U(1) symmetry in the prethermal regime of the system. Furthermore, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence, despite the system being disorder-free and at finite temperature. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach15–18 to experimentally study topological matter at finite temperature and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived, robust boundary qubits in disorder-free systems. Stable and robust topological edge modes are observed at finite temperatures in an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits because of emergent symmetries present in the prethermal regime of this system.},

  abstract     = {Realizing universal fault-tolerant quantum computation is a key goal in quantum information science1–4. By encoding quantum information into logical qubits using quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be detected and corrected, enabling a substantial reduction in logical error rates5–11. However, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on these encoded qubits is often constrained1,12, necessitating the use of special resource states known as ‘magic states’13 to implement universal, classically hard circuits14. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform ‘distillation’, creating them from multiple lower-fidelity inputs13,15. Here we present the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach uses a dynamically reconfigurable architecture8,16 to encode and perform quantum operations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation of magic states encoded in d = 3 and d = 5 colour codes, observing improvements in the logical fidelity of the output magic states compared with the input logical magic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal fault-tolerant quantum computation and represent an important step towards large-scale logical quantum processors. Magic state distillation is achieved with logical qubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer using a dynamically reconfigurable architecture for parallel quantum operations.},

  abstract     = {Quantum error correction1–4 is essential for bridging the gap between the error rates of physical devices and the extremely low error rates required for quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on superconducting processors5–8 have focused primarily on the surface code9, which offers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. The colour code10 enables more efficient logic, but it requires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding. Measuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting qubits is challenging, and realizations of colour codes11–19 have not addressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here we present a comprehensive demonstration of the colour code on a superconducting processor8. Scaling the code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of Λ3/5 = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the threshold of the colour code, and the colour code may become more efficient than the surface code following modest device improvements. We test transversal Clifford gates with logical randomized benchmarking20 and inject magic states21, a key resource for universal computation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection. Finally, we teleport logical states between colour codes using lattice surgery22. This work establishes the colour code as a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation on superconducting processors in the near future. Colour code on a superconducting qubit quantum processor is demonstrated, reporting above-breakeven performance and logical error scaling with increased code size by a factor of 1.56 moving from distance-3 to distance-5 code.},

  abstract     = {Owing to increasing demand for low-cost energy storage with secure material&nbsp;supply chains, the battery community is approaching a pivotal shift beyond&nbsp;conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) towards next-generation cells. Technologies that&nbsp;include alkali-metal anodes, solid electrolytes and earth-abundant materials&nbsp;such as&nbsp;sodium (Na) and sulfur (S) are reaching commercialization in cells. The abuse tolerance and thermal runaway hazards of such technologies diverge from conventional Li-ion cells. Consequently, designing safe batteries with next-generation materials requires a holistic approach to characterize cells and to understand their responses to abuse conditions from the beginning to the end of life. Here we provide a Perspective on how the safety and abuse tolerance of cells are likely to change for up-and-coming technologies; challenges and opportunities for reimagining safe cell and battery designs; gaps in our knowledge; capabilities for understanding the hazards of thermal runaway and how to address them; how standard&nbsp;abuse tests may need to adapt to new challenges; and how research needs to support affected professionals, from pack designers to first responders, to manage hazards and ensure safe roll-out of next-generation cells into&nbsp;applications like electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, given the large number of next-generation technologies being explored, we encourage giving priority to safety-focused research in proportion to the rate of manufacturing scale-up of each specific technology. Next-generation batteries&nbsp;will present different risks to&nbsp;conventional lithium-ion cells, emphasizing the need for efforts towards characterizing&nbsp;the abuse tolerance and hazards associated with&nbsp;next-generation battery materials over their life cycle and providing the data in the context of supporting affected professionals.},

  abstract     = {AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain1. Assembled from combinations of four core subunits, GluA1–4 and around 20 auxiliary subunits, their molecular diversity tunes information transfer and storage in a brain-circuit-specific manner. GluA3, a subtype strongly associated with disease2, functions as both a fast-transmitting Ca2+-permeable AMPAR at sensory synapses3, and as a Ca2+-impermeable receptor at cortical synapses4,5. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the Ca2+-permeable GluA3 homomer, which substantially diverges from other AMPARs. The GluA3 extracellular domain tiers (N-terminal domain (NTD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD)) are closely coupled throughout gating states, creating interfaces that impact signalling and contain human disease-associated mutations. Central to this architecture is a stacking interaction between two arginine residues (Arg163) in the NTD dimer interface, trapping a unique NTD dimer conformation that enables close contacts with the LBD. Rupture of the Arg163 stack not only alters the structure and dynamics of the GluA3 extracellular region, but also increases receptor trafficking and the expression of GluA3 heteromers at the synapse. We further show that a mammalian-specific GluA3 trafficking checkpoint determines the conformational stability of the LBD tier. Thus, specific design features define communication and biogenesis of GluA3, offering a framework to examine this disease-associated glutamate receptor. The GluA3 homomer substantially diverges from other AMPA-type glutamate receptors.},

  abstract     = {AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are integral to fast excitatory synaptic transmission and have vital roles in synaptic plasticity, motor coordination, learning and memory1. Whereas extensive structural studies have been conducted on recombinant AMPARs and native calcium-impermeable (CI)-AMPARs alongside their auxiliary proteins2–5, the molecular architecture of native calcium-permeable (CP)-AMPARs has remained undefined. Here, to determine the subunit composition, physiological architecture and gating mechanisms of CP-AMPARs, we visualize these receptors, immunoaffinity purified from rat cerebella, and resolve their structures using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our results indicate that the predominant assembly consists of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, with the GluA4 subunit occupying the B and D positions, and auxiliary subunits, including transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs) located at the B′ and D′ positions, and cornichon homologues (CNIHs) or TARPs located at the A′ and C′ positions. Furthermore, we resolved the structure of the noelin (NOE1)–GluA1–GluA4 complex, in which NOE1 specifically binds to the GluA4 subunit at the B and D positions. Notably, NOE1 stabilizes the amino-terminal domain layer without affecting gating properties of the receptor. NOE1 contributes to AMPAR function by forming dimeric&nbsp;AMPAR assemblies that are likely to engage in extracellular networks, clustering receptors in synaptic environments and modulating receptor responsiveness to synaptic inputs. Cryo-electron microscopy analyses of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors from rat brain show that they are composed primarily of GluA1 and GluA4 subunits, and biochemical studies show that noelin&nbsp;promotes inter-receptor interactions&nbsp;without modulating receptor function.},

  abstract     = {Gene editing has the potential to solve fundamental challenges in agriculture, biotechnology and human health. CRISPR-based gene editors derived from microorganisms, although powerful, often show notable functional tradeoffs when ported into non-native environments, such as human cells1. Artificial-intelligence-enabled design provides a powerful alternative with the potential to bypass evolutionary constraints and generate editors with optimal properties. Here, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins. Several of the generated gene editors show comparable or improved activity and specificity relative to SpCas9, the prototypical gene editing effector, while being 400 mutations away in sequence. Finally, we demonstrate that an artificial-intelligence-generated gene editor, denoted as OpenCRISPR-1, exhibits compatibility with base editing. We release OpenCRISPR-1 to facilitate broad, ethical use across research and commercial applications. Gene editors designed using artificial intelligence can undertake precision editing of the human genome.},

  abstract     = {Immunosuppressive tumour microenvironments are common in cancers such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)&nbsp;(MASH-HCC)1–3. Although immune cell metabolism influences effector function, the effect of tumour metabolism on immunogenicity is less understood4. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) links substrate availability and mitochondrial metabolism with lipid biosynthesis and gene regulation5–7. Although ACLY inhibition shows antiproliferative effects in various tumours, clinical translation has been limited by challenges in inhibitor development and compensatory metabolic pathways8–12. Here, using a mouse model of MASH-HCC that mirrors human disease, genetic inhibition of ACLY in hepatocytes and tumours reduced neoplastic lesions by over 70%. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this pathway, a novel small-molecule ACLY inhibitor, EVT0185 (6-[4-(5-carboxy-5-methyl-hexyl)-phenyl]−2,2-dimethylhexanoic acid), was identified via phenotypic screening. EVT0185 is converted to a CoA thioester in the liver by SLC27A2 and structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy reveals that EVT0185-CoA directly interacts with the CoA-binding site of ACLY. Oral delivery of EVT0185 in three mouse models of MASH-HCC dramatically reduces tumour burden as monotherapy and enhances efficacy of current standards of care including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapies. Transcriptomic and spatial profiling in mice and humans linked reduced tumour ACLY with increases in the chemokine&nbsp;CXCL13, tumour-infiltrating B cells and tertiary lymphoid structures. The depletion of B cells blocked the antitumour effects of ACLY inhibition. Together, these findings illustrate how targeting tumour metabolism can rewire immune function and suppress cancer progression in MASH-HCC. Using metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis-driven hepatocellular carcinoma mouse models, an ATP citrate lyase inhibitor reduces tumour burden and enhances efficacy of current standards of care.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer is the second most common cancer globally, with most deaths caused by metastatic disease, often following long periods of clinical dormancy1. Understanding the mechanisms that disrupt the quiescence of dormant disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) is crucial for addressing metastatic progression. Infections caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 trigger both local and systemic inflammation2,3. Here we demonstrate, in mice, that influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to loss of the pro-dormancy phenotype in breast DCCs in the lung, causing DCC proliferation within days of infection and a massive expansion of carcinoma cells into metastatic lesions within two weeks. These phenotypic transitions and expansions are interleukin-6 dependent. We show that DCCs impair lung T cell activation and that CD4+ T cells sustain the pulmonary metastatic burden after the influenza infection by inhibiting CD8+ T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Crucially, these experimental findings align with human observational data. Analyses of cancer survivors from the UK Biobank (all cancers) and Flatiron Health (breast cancer) databases reveal that SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increases the risk of cancer-related mortality and lung metastasis compared with uninfected cancer survivors. These discoveries underscore the huge impact of respiratory viral infections on metastatic cancer resurgence, offering new insights into the connection between infectious diseases and cancer metastasis. Mouse models show that respiratory infections from viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2 can trigger metastasis of dormant breast cancer cells in the lungs, a finding supported by epidemiological data from two large human cohorts.},

  abstract     = {Tumour necrosis is associated with poor prognosis in cancer1,2 and is thought to occur passively when tumour growth outpaces nutrient supply. Here we report, however, that neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis. In multiple cancer mouse models, we found a tumour-elicited Ly6GHighLy6CLow neutrophil population that was unable to extravasate in response to inflammatory challenges but formed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) more efficiently than classical Ly6GHighLy6CHigh neutrophils. The presence of these ‘vascular-restricted’ neutrophils correlated with the appearance of a ‘pleomorphic’ necrotic architecture in mice. In tumours with pleomorphic necrosis, we found intravascular aggregates of neutrophils and NETs that caused occlusion of the tumour vasculature, driving hypoxia and necrosis of downstream vascular beds. Furthermore, we found that cancer cells adjacent to these necrotic regions (that is, in ‘perinecrotic’ areas) underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, explaining the paradoxical metastasis-enhancing effect of tumour necrosis. Blocking NET formation genetically or pharmacologically reduced the extent of tumour necrosis and lung metastasis. Thus, by showing that NETs drive vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis, we demonstrate that tumour necrosis is not necessarily a passive byproduct of tumour growth and that it can be blocked to reduce metastatic spread. Neutrophils actively induce tumour necrosis, driving vascular occlusion, pleomorphic necrosis and metastasis.},

  abstract     = {Allergens that induce allergic airway inflammation are highly diverse, but they commonly activate type 2 immune responses1,2. Airway epithelial cells are crucial in allergen sensing3–5. However, the shared features among diverse allergens that elicit similar innate responses, and their epithelial detection mechanisms, remain poorly defined1,2,6–9. Here we identify pore-forming proteins as one of the common stimuli of allergic airway inflammation and reveal their immune-activation mechanisms. Using the prevalent mould allergen Alternaria alternata as a model, we established an in vitro system to investigate type 2 innate immune sensing. A six-step biochemical fractionation identified Aeg-S and Aeg-L as the core immune-stimulatory components. Biochemical reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that these proteins form 16- to 20-mer transmembrane pore complexes. Their cooperative perforation acts as a bona fide type 2 immune adjuvant to support antigen-specific T helper 2 and immunoglobulin E responses. Genetically engineered A. alternata strains that lack pore-forming activity do not induce allergic responses in mice. Furthermore, pore-forming proteins from various species, despite structural and membrane target differences, are sufficient to trigger respiratory allergies. Perforations in airway epithelial cells initiate allergic responses through two mechanisms: one triggers IL-33 release, and the other involves Ca2+ influx, which activates MAPK signalling and type 2 inflammatory gene expression. These findings provide insight into how type 2 immune responses detect common perturbations caused by structurally diverse stimuli. Targeting downstream signalling of epithelial perforation may open new avenues for treating respiratory allergies. The ability to form pores in the plasma membrane of host airway epithelial cells is a common feature of many structurally diverse allergens that induce type 2 immune responses by stimulating IL-33 release and causing Ca2+ influx.},

CoQ10 supplementation does not increase CoQ10 pools in the brain or in other tissues. The recent discovery of the mammalian CoQ10 headgroup synthesis pathway, in which 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase-like protein (HPDL) makes 4-hydroxymandelate (4-HMA) to synthesize the CoQ10 headgroup precursor 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB)7, offers an opportunity to pharmacologically restore CoQ10 synthesis and mechanistically treat CoQ10 deficiencies. To test whether 4-HMA or 4-HB supplementation promotes CoQ10 headgroup synthesis in vivo, here we administered 4-HMA and 4-HB to Hpdl−/− mice, which model an ultra-rare, lethal mitochondrial encephalopathy in humans. Both 4-HMA and 4-HB were incorporated into CoQ9 and CoQ10 in the brains of Hpdl−/− mice. Oral treatment of Hpdl−/− pups with 4-HMA or 4-HB enabled 90–100% of Hpdl−/− mice to live to adulthood. Furthermore, 4-HB treatment stabilized and improved the neurological symptoms of a patient with progressive spasticity due to biallelic HPDL variants. Our work shows that 4-HMA and 4-HB can modify the course of mitochondrial encephalopathy driven by HPDL variants and demonstrates that CoQ10 headgroup intermediates can restore CoQ10 synthesis in vivo. Decreased brain coenzyme Q10 levels cause encephalopathy and are associated with neurodegeneration; supplementation with 4-HMA or 4-HB restores coenzyme Q10 synthesis in mice and humans with HPDL variants, improving survival and neurological symptoms in&nbsp;HPDL-driven mitochondrial encephalopathy.},

Here we used the experimental control offered by a multisensory virtual reality system to determine that differences in sensory environment or behaviour do not detectably change drift rate. We also found that the excitability of individual place cells was most predictive of their representational drift over subsequent days, with more excitable cells exhibiting less drift. These findings establish that representational drift occurs in mice even with highly reproducible environments and behaviour and highlight neuronal excitability as a key factor of long-term representational stability. Tracking of individual place cells in mouse CA1 shows that representational drift is not influenced by changes in environment or behaviour, and is lower for more excitable place cells.},

  abstract     = {Multi-omics studies, represented by connectomes and spatial transcriptomes, have entered the era of single-cell resolution, necessitating a reference brain atlas with spatial localization capability at the single-cell level1–4. However, such atlases are unavailable5. Here we present a whole mouse brain dataset of Nissl-based cytoarchitecture with isotropic 1-μm resolution, achieved through continuous micro-optical sectioning tomography. By integrating multi-modal images, we constructed a three-dimensional reference atlas of the mouse brain, providing the three-dimensional topographies of 916 structures and enabling arbitrary-angle slice image generation at 1-μm resolution. We developed an informatics-based platform for visualizing and sharing of the atlas images, offering services such as brain slice registration, neuronal circuit mapping and intelligent stereotaxic surgery planning. This atlas is interoperable with widely used stereotaxic atlases, supporting cross-atlas navigation of corresponding coronal planes in two dimensions and spatial mapping across atlas spaces in three dimensions. By facilitating the data analysis and visualization for large brain mapping projects, our atlas promises to be a versatile brainsmatics tool for studying the whole brain at single-cell level.

  abstract     = {Evading imminent threat from predators is critical for animal survival. Effective defensive strategies can vary, even between closely related species. However, the neural basis of such species-specific behaviours remains poorly understood1–4. Here we find that two sister species of deer mice (genus Peromyscus)5 show different responses to the same looming stimulus: Peromyscus maniculatus, which occupies densely vegetated habitats, predominantly escapes, whereas the open field specialist, Peromyscus polionotus, briefly freezes. This difference arises from species-specific escape thresholds, is largely context-independent, and can be triggered by both visual and auditory threat stimuli. Using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiological recordings, we find that although visual threat activates the superior colliculus in both species, the role of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG) in driving behaviour differs. Whereas dPAG activity scales with running speed in P. maniculatus, neural activity in the dPAG of P. polionotus correlates poorly with movement, including during visually triggered escape. Moreover, optogenetic activation of dPAG neurons elicits acceleration in P. maniculatus but not in P. polionotus, and their chemogenetic inhibition during a looming stimulus delays escape onset in P. maniculatus to match that of P. polionotus. Together, we trace species-specific escape thresholds to a central circuit node, downstream of peripheral sensory neurons, localizing an ecologically relevant behavioural difference to a specific region of the mammalian brain. Visual threat triggers contrasting freeze and escape defensive responses in two species of deer mice as a result of different activation thresholds downstream of&nbsp;the superior colliculus in the dorsal periaqueductal grey.},

  abstract     = {Wild plants can contribute valuable genes to their domesticated relatives1. Fertility barriers and a lack of genomic resources have hindered the effective use of crop–wild introgressions. Decades of research into barley’s closest wild relative, Hordeum bulbosum, a grass native to the Mediterranean basin and Western Asia, have yet to manifest themselves in the release of a cultivar bearing alien genes2. Here we construct a pangenome of bulbous barley comprising 10 phased genome sequence assemblies amounting to 32 distinct haplotypes. Autotetraploid cytotypes, among which the donors of resistance-conferring introgressions are found, arose at least twice, and are connected among each other and to diploid forms through gene flow. The differential amplification of transposable elements after barley and H. bulbosum diverged from each other is responsible for genome size differences between them. We illustrate the translational value of our resource by mapping non-host resistance to a viral pathogen to a structurally diverse multigene cluster that has been implicated in diverse immune responses in wheat and barley. A study describes the assembly and analysis of a haplotype-resolved pangenome of bulbous barley with the potential to improve domesticated barley and illustrates its use in evolutionary research and trait mapping.},

Here we analyse a new global dataset of genomic DNA sequences, spanning an entire taxonomic class of benthic invertebrates (Ophiuroidea), to obtain a broad understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across all oceans, from coastal margins down to the abyssal plains. We show that regional faunas on the continental shelf are phylogenetically divergent, particularly at temperate and tropical latitudes. By contrast, assemblages in the deep sea are much more connected. Many temperate deep-sea lineages have achieved distribution ranges across the planet, including over the Quaternary period. A close relationship exists between deep-sea faunas of the northern Atlantic and, on the opposite side of the globe, southern Australia. Bathymetric interchange is not only reliant on vertical migration through isothermal polar waters but also occurs across the thermal depth gradients of tropical regions. The connected nature of deep-sea life should be an important consideration in marine conservation assessments. We analyse a global dataset of genomic DNA sequences for Ophiuroidea to gain an understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across oceans, finding phylogentically divergent faunas at shelf depths but greater connectivity of species at deep-sea depths.},

However, in contrast to plants and animals, the global distribution of mycorrhizal fungal biodiversity is largely unknown, which limits our ability to monitor and protect key underground ecosystems4,5. Here we trained machine-learning algorithms on a global dataset of 25,000 geolocated soil samples comprising &gt;2.8 billion fungal DNA sequences. We predicted arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungal richness and rarity across terrestrial ecosystems. On the basis of these predictions, we generated high-resolution, global-scale maps and identified key reservoirs of highly diverse and endemic mycorrhizal communities. Intersecting protected areas with mycorrhizal hotspots indicated that less than 10% of predicted mycorrhizal richness hotspots currently exist in protected areas. Our results describe a largely hidden component of Earth’s underground ecosystems and can help identify conservation priorities, set monitoring benchmarks and create specific restoration plans and land-management strategies. Machine-learning algorithms trained on 25,000 geolocated soil samples are used to create high-resolution global maps of mycorrhizal fungi, revealing that less than 10% of their biodiversity hotspots are in protected areas.},

  abstract     = {While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines1,2. Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population3–8. However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs5,7,9–11. Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users (N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits1. Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area. By analysing the smartphone data of 2,112,288 participants, in particular observing and comparing the activity of the same individual in two different environments, we find that increases in the walkability of environments result in increases in daily physical activity, providing evidence of the importance of the built environment on physical health.},

Nowhere is this challenge greater than in Africa4–6, where we still know little about the spatial details of development3,7–9. Here we leverage a comprehensive, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street block level10–12 everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality with cities showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and services than rural and peri-urban areas. We show that such patterns of informality are characterized by consistent statistical distributions reflecting uneven local development2,13,14. We also show that these physical measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of human deprivation, which form a single principal component co-varying predictably with specific changes in street access to buildings. These results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service expansion that taps local innovations in systematic, equitable and context-appropriate ways7,11,12,15. A new&nbsp;network approach maps every street block in sub-Saharan Africa using high-resolution building and street data, pinpointing infrastructure needs and revealing development gradients from neighbourhoods to cities and rural areas.},

  abstract     = {Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events1–4. Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events5,6. Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8.

  abstract     = {The mechanical properties of metallic materials often degrade under harsh cryogenic conditions, posing challenges for low-temperature infrastructures1. Here we introduce a dual-scale atomic-ordering nanostructure, characterized by an exceptionally high number density of co-existing subnanoscale short-range ordering (approximately 2.4 × 1026 m−3) and nanoscale long-range ordering (approximately 4.5 × 1025 m−3)&nbsp;domains, within a metallic solid-solution matrix in a CoNiV-based alloy to improve the synergy of strength and ductility at low temperatures. We observe an ordering-induced increase in dislocation shear stress as well as a more rapid dislocation multiplication owing to the dislocation blocking effect of nanoscale long-range ordering and the associated generation of new dislocations. The latter effect also releases stress concentrations at nanoscale long-range-ordered obstacles that otherwise would promote damage initiation and failure. Consequently, the alloy shows a strength–elongation product of 76 GPa % with a yield strength of approximately 1.2 GPa at 87 K, outperforming materials devoid of such ordering hierarchy, containing only short-range ordered or coherent precipitates of a few tens of nanometres. Our results highlight the impact of dual co-existing chemical ordering on the mechanical properties of complex alloys and offer guidelines to control these ordering states to enhance their mechanical performance for cryogenic applications. Dual-scale chemical ordering in CoNiV-based alloys improves the synergy of strength and ductility at cryogenic temperatures, providing an approach for obtaining high-performance metallic materials for cryogenic applications.},

Here we introduce a method for real-time in situ magnetization reprogramming that enables the rearrangement and recombination of magnetic units to achieve diverse magnetization profiles. We explore the applications of this method in structures of varying dimensions, from one-dimensional tubes to three-dimensional frameworks, showcasing a diverse and expanded range of configurations and their deformations. This method also demonstrates versatility in diverse scenarios, including navigating around objects without undesired contact, reprogramming cilia arrays, managing multiple instruments cooperatively or independently under the same magnetic field, and manipulating objects of various shapes. These abilities extend the range of applications for magnetic actuation technologies. Furthermore, this method frees magnetic soft robots from the sole reliance on external magnetic fields for shape change, facilitating unprecedented modes and varieties of deformation while simultaneously reducing the need for complex magnetic field generation systems, thereby opening avenues for the development of magnetic actuation technologies. A real-time in situ magnetization reprogramming method for magnetic soft robots enables dynamic shape control, cooperative multi-tool manipulation and expanded actuation abilities.},

  abstract     = {Solution-processed semiconductor lasers promise lightweight, wearable and scalable optoelectronic applications. Among the gain media for solution-processed lasers, metal halide perovskites stand out as an exceptional class because of their ability to achieve wavelength-adjustable, low-threshold lasing under optical pumping1–8. Despite the progress in this field, electrically driven lasing from perovskite semiconductors remains a critical challenge. Here we demonstrate an electrically driven perovskite laser, constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED (PeLED) sub-unit. Under pulsed electrical excitation, the dual-cavity perovskite device shows a minimum lasing threshold of 92 A cm−2 (average threshold: 129 A cm−2, at about 22 °C, in air), which is an order of magnitude lower than that of state-of-the-art electrically driven organic lasers9,10. Key to this demonstration is the integrated dual-cavity device architecture, which allows the microcavity PeLED sub-unit to deliver directional emission into the single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit (at a coupling efficiency of about 82.7%) to establish the lasing action. An operational half-life (T50) of 1.8 h (6.4 × 104 voltage pulses at 10 Hz) is achieved, outperforming the stability of electrically pumped organic lasers9,10. The dual-cavity perovskite laser can be rapidly modulated at a bandwidth of 36.2 MHz, indicating its potential for data transmission and computational applications. An electrically driven perovskite laser is constructed by vertically integrating a low-threshold single-crystal perovskite microcavity sub-unit with a high-power microcavity perovskite LED sub-unit.},

  abstract     = {Trapped-ion applications, such as in quantum information processing1, precision measurements2–5, optical clocks6 and mass spectrometry7, rely on specialized high-performance ion traps. The last three of these applications typically use traditional machining to customize macroscopic 3D Paul traps8, whereas quantum information processing experiments usually rely on photolithographic techniques to miniaturize the traps and meet scalability requirements9,10. Using photolithography, however, it is challenging to fabricate the complex 3D electrode structures required for optimal confinement. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution 3D printing technology based on two-photon polymerization (2PP)11 that is capable of fabricating large arrays of high-performance miniaturized 3D traps. We show that 3D-printed ion traps combine the advantages, such as strong radial confinement, of traditionally machined 3D traps with on-chip miniaturization. We trap calcium ions in 3D-printed ion traps with radial trap frequencies ranging from 2 MHz to 24 MHz. The tight confinement eases ion cooling requirements and allows us to implement high-quality Rabi oscillations with Doppler cooling only. Also, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate with a Bell-state fidelity of 0.978 ± 0.012. With 3D printing technology, the design freedom is greatly expanded without sacrificing scalability and precision, so that ion trap geometries can be optimized for higher performance and better functionality. High-resolution 3D printing technology making use of two-photon polymerization instead of traditional machining is described, allowing low-cost and scalable production of large arrays of high-quality 3D Paul traps.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems1–7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization. An analog optical computer that combines analog electronics, three-dimensional optics, and an iterative architecture accelerates artificial intelligence inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform, paving a promising path for faster and sustainable computing.},

  abstract     = {Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter—they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems1–5, which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. 6, on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter. A superconducting quantum computer is used to realize an out-of-equilibrium topologically ordered state, which hosts anyonic excitations.},

  abstract     = {Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers1. In particular, models based on strongly correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems2, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter3,4. However, owing to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices5. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays6. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev’s model on a honeycomb lattice3, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states7. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement8 and feedforward9, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering10,11 with tunable entangling gates12 interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram13 and verify the non-Abelian spin-liquid phase3 by evaluating an odd Chern number14,15. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study the dynamics of the Fermi–Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry16 and high-energy physics17. Digital quantum simulations of Kitaev’s honeycomb model are realized for two-dimensional fermionic systems using a reconfigurable atom-array processor and used to study the Fermi–Hubbard model on a square lattice.},

  abstract     = {The Perseverance rover has explored and sampled igneous and sedimentary rocks within Jezero Crater to characterize early Martian geological processes and habitability and search for potential biosignatures1–7. Upon entering Neretva Vallis, on Jezero Crater’s western edge8, Perseverance investigated distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation. Here we report a detailed geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of these rocks and show that organic-carbon-bearing mudstones in the Bright Angel formation contain submillimetre-scale nodules and millimetre-scale reaction fronts enriched in ferrous iron phosphate and sulfide minerals, likely vivianite and greigite, respectively. This organic carbon appears to have participated in post-depositional redox reactions that produced the observed iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide minerals. Geological context and petrography indicate that these reactions occurred at low temperatures. Within this context, we review the various pathways by which redox reactions that involve organic matter can produce the observed suite of iron-, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing minerals in laboratory and natural environments on Earth. Ultimately, we conclude that analysis of the core sample collected from this unit using high-sensitivity instrumentation on Earth will enable the measurements required to determine the origin of the minerals, organics and textures it contains. A geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation on Mars reveals textures, chemical and mineral characteristics, and organic signatures that warrant consideration as potential biosignatures.},

  abstract     = {Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery1. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size–luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call ‘globular-cluster-like dwarfs’ (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2–4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars. The results from a state-of-the-art suite of hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations show how globular clusters naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology and also reveal the existence of a new class of object called globular-cluster-like dwarfs.},

Immunotherapies have proved to be efficient in many medical areas, but have not been considered to treat brain diseases due to the poor brain penetration of immunoglobulins1,2. Here we developed a bivalent biparatopic antibody, made of two camelid heavy-chain antibodies (called nanobodies)3, one binding to, and the other potentiating the activity of, homodimeric metabotropic glutamate receptor 2. We show that this bivalent nanobody, given peripherally, reaches the brain and corrects cognitive deficits in two preclinical mouse models with endophenotypes resulting from NMDA receptor hypofunction. Notably, these in vivo effects last for at least 7 days after a single intraperitoneal injection and are maintained after subchronic treatment. Our results establish a proof of concept that nanobodies can target brain receptors, and pave the way for nanobody-based therapeutic strategies for the treatment of brain disorders.

  abstract     = {Atherosclerosis is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases. Its prevention is based on the detection and treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors1. However, individuals at risk for early vascular disease often remain unidentified2. Recent research has identified new molecules in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis3, highlighting the need for alternative disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets to improve early diagnosis and therapy efficacy. Here, we observed that imidazole propionate (ImP), produced by microorganisms, is associated with the extent of atherosclerosis in mice and in two independent human cohorts. Furthermore, ImP administration to atherosclerosis-prone mice fed with chow diet was sufficient to induce atherosclerosis without altering the lipid profile, and was linked to activation of both systemic and local innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. Specifically, we found that ImP caused atherosclerosis through the imidazoline-1 receptor (I1R, also known as nischarin) in myeloid cells. Blocking this ImP–I1R axis inhibited the development of atherosclerosis induced by ImP or high-cholesterol diet in mice. Identification of the strong association of ImP with active atherosclerosis and the contribution of the ImP–I1R axis to disease progression opens new avenues for improving the early diagnosis and personalized therapy of atherosclerosis. Imidazole propionate produced by gut microbiota is associated with atherosclerosis in mouse models and in humans, and causes the development of atherosclerosis through activation of the imidazoline-1 receptor in myeloid cells.},

  abstract     = {The dendritic cell (DC)-initiated and sustained cancer immunity cycle is indispensable for effective endogenous and therapeutically mobilized antitumour T cell responses1–8. This necessitates the continuous migration of antigen-carrying DCs from the tumour microenvironment (TME) to the tumour draining lymph nodes (tdLNs)7–13. Here, through longitudinal analysis of human and mouse tumours, we observed a progressive decrease in migratory conventional DCs (mig-cDCs) in the tdLNs during tumour progression. This decline compromised tumour-specific T cell priming and subsequent T cell supply to the TME. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) and its substrate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) as key modulators of DC migration. Advanced tumours disrupted cGMP synthesis in DCs to decrease their motility, while PDE5 perturbation preserved the cGMP pool to restore DC migration. Mechanistically, cGMP enhanced myosin-II activity through Rho-associated factors, extending the paradigm of cGMP-regulated amoeboid migration from Dictyostelium to mammalian immune cells. Pharmacological inhibition of PDE5 using sildenafil restored mig-cDC homing to late-stage tdLNs and sustained antitumour immunity in a DC-dependent manner. Our findings bridge fundamental DC interstitial motility to antitumour immunity, revealing that its disruption in chaotic TME promotes immune evasion, and its enhancement offers a promising direction for DC-centric immunotherapy. Disruption of dendritic cell (DC) interstitial motility in the tumour microenvironment promotes immune evasion, and enhancement of DC interstitial motility offers a route for DC-centric immunotherapy.},

Here we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures of two FCoV-23 spike isoforms that correspond to the in-host loss of domain 0 observed in clinical samples. The loss of domain 0 markedly enhances the fusogenicity and kinetics of entry into cells and possibly enables biotype switching and lethality. We show that FCoV-23 can use several aminopeptidase N orthologues as receptors and reveal the molecular determinants of receptor species tropism, including a glycan that modulates human receptor engagement. We define antigenic relationships among alphacoronaviruses that infect humans and other mammalian species and identify a cross-reactive alphacoronavirus monoclonal antibody that inhibits FCoV-23 entry. Our results pave the way for the development of vaccines and therapeutics that target this highly pathogenic virus.

While the large RNA genome of CoVs shows relatively low mutation rates, recombination within genera is frequently observed4–7. Companion animals are often overlooked in the transmission cycle of viral diseases; however, the close relationship of feline (FCoV) and canine CoV (CCoV) to human hCoV-229E5,8, as well as the susceptibility of these animals to&nbsp;SARS-CoV-29, highlight their importance in potential transmission cycles. While recombination between CCoV and FCoV of a large fragment spanning orf1b to M has been previously described5,10, here we report the emergence of a highly pathogenic FCoV–CCoV recombinant responsible for a rapidly spreading outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) originating in Cyprus11. The minor recombinant region, spanning spike (S), shows 96.5% sequence identity to the pantropic canine coronavirus NA/09. Infection has rapidly spread, infecting cats of all ages. Development of FIP appears to be very frequent and sequence identities of samples from cats in different districts of the island are strongly supportive of direct transmission. A near-cat-specific deletion in the domain 0 of S is present in more than 90% of cats with FIP. It is unclear as yet whether this deletion is directly associated with disease development, and it may be linked to a biotype switch12. The domain 0 deletion and several amino acid changes in S, particularly the receptor-binding domain, indicate potential changes to receptor binding and cell tropism.

  abstract     = {Salicylic acid&nbsp;(SA) is a pivotal phytohormone for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants have evolved two pathways to produce SA: the isochorismate synthase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) pathways1. Whereas the isochorismate synthase pathway has been fully identified2–4, the PAL pathway remains incomplete. Here we report the full characterization of the PAL pathway for SA biosynthesis via functional analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) SA-DEFICIENT GENE 1 (OSD1) to OSD4. The cinnamoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase OSD1 catalyses the conversion of trans-cinnamic acid to cinnamoyl-CoA, which is subsequently transformed to benzoyl-CoA via the β-oxidative pathway in peroxisomes. The resulting benzoyl-CoA is further converted to benzyl benzoate by the peroxisomal benzoyltransferase OSD2. Benzyl benzoate is subsequently hydroxylated to benzyl salicylate by the endoplasmic reticulum membrane-resident cytochrome P450 OSD3, which is ultimately hydrolysed to salicylic acid by the cytoplasmic carboxylesterase OSD4. Evolutionary analyses reveal that the PAL pathway was first assembled before the divergence of gymnosperms and has been conserved in most seed plants. Activation of the PAL pathway in rice significantly enhances salicylic acid levels and plant immunity. Completion of the PAL pathway provides critical insights into the primary salicylic acid biosynthetic pathway across plant species and offers a precise target for modulating crop immunity. Characterization of four SALICYLIC ACID-DEFICIENT GENEs in rice identifies an ancestral pathway for biosynthesis of salicylic acid from phenylalanine and provides genetic targets for engineering disease resistance in crop plants.},

  abstract     = {Salicylic acid (SA) is a ubiquitous plant hormone with a long history in human civilization1,2. Because of the central role of SA in orchestrating plant pathogen defence, understanding SA biosynthesis is fundamental to plant immunity research and crop improvement. Isochorismate-derived SA biosynthesis has been well defined in Arabidopsis. However, increasing evidence suggests a crucial function for phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthesis in many other plant species1. Here we reveal the phenylalanine-derived SA biosynthetic pathway in rice by identifying three dedicated enzymes&nbsp;— peroxisomal benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyltransferase (BEBT), the&nbsp;endoplasmic reticulum-associated cytochrome P450 enzyme benzylbenzoate hydroxylase (BBH), and cytosolic benzylsalicylate esterase (BSE) that sequentially convert benzoyl-CoA to benzylbenzoate, benzylsalicylate and SA. The pathogen-induced gene expression pattern and SA biosynthetic functions of this triple-enzyme module are conserved in diverse plants. This work fills a major knowledge gap in the biosynthesis of a key plant defence hormone, establishing a foundation for new strategies to create disease-resistant crops.

  abstract     = {Salicylic acid (SA) is the active ingredient in willow bark that has been used for anti-inflammation and pain relief for centuries. Aspirin, a derivative of SA, is the most widely used medication in human history. SA also acts as a key plant defence hormone1–4. Although SA was known to be produced from chorismate in the model plant Arabidopsis5,6, how it is biosynthesized in plant families outside Brassicaceae remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a conserved pathway for SA biosynthesis in seed plants. Using Nicotiana benthamiana as a model, we identified three key steps for the biosynthesis of SA. First, ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A (CoA) and benzyl alcohol by benzoyl-CoA:benzyl alcohol benzoyl transferase (BEBT) gives rise to benzyl benzoate, which is then hydroxylated by benzyl benzoate oxidase (BBO) to produce benzyl salicylate. Subsequent cleavage of benzyl salicylate by benzyl salicylate hydrolase (BSH) yields SA. Notably, genes encoding these three enzymes are present in a broad range of plants, and the genes from dicots such as willow, poplar and soybean as well as the monocot rice can complement the phenotype of SA-deficient mutants of N. benthamiana. Moreover, knockout analysis of the Oryza sativa OsBEBT, OsBBO and OsBSH genes reveals that they are required for SA biosynthesis in rice. Our findings suggest that the SA biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved in plants. The salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis pathway—involving ligation of benzoyl coenzyme A and benzyl alcohol to give benzyl benzoate; hydroxylation of benzyl benzoate to give benzyl salicylate; and cleavage of benzyl salicylate to give SA—is highly conserved in plants.},

  abstract     = {The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood1. Here, to investigate them, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with a prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions that, notably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex) to motor regions (secondary and primary motor cortex and gigantocellular reticular nucleus) and high-level cortical regions (the dorsal anterior cingulate area and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision-making areas. This study offers a brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large-scale recordings on a single standardized task. Brain-wide recordings in mice reveal that prior expectations are distributed through recurrent loops across all levels of cortical and subcortical processing.},

  abstract     = {A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with previous expectations to initiate movements and make decisions1. It is difficult to meet this challenge if different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 621,733 neurons&nbsp;recorded with 699 Neuropixels probes across 139 mice in 12 laboratories. The data were obtained from mice performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor and cognitive components. The probes covered 279 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map and assess how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli transiently appeared in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of midbrain and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with&nbsp;impending motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption were also widespread. This publicly available dataset represents a resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour. The International Brain Laboratory presents a brain-wide electrophysiological map obtained from pooling data from 12 laboratories that performed the same standardized perceptual decision-making task in mice.},

Here we show the existence of such a population code for the dynamics of choice formation in the primate premotor cortex. We developed an approach to simultaneously infer population dynamics and tuning functions of single neurons to the population state. Applied to spike data recorded during decision-making, our model revealed that populations of neurons encoded the same dynamic variable predicting choices, and heterogeneous firing rates resulted from the diverse tuning of single neurons to this decision variable. The inferred dynamics indicated an attractor mechanism for decision computation. Our results reveal a unifying geometric principle for neural encoding of sensory and dynamic cognitive variables.

  abstract     = {Gastrointestinal (GI) motility disorders represent a major medical challenge, with few effective therapies available. These disorders often result from dysfunction of inhibitory nitric oxide (NO)-producing motor neurons in the enteric nervous system, which are essential for regulating gut motility. Loss or dysfunction of NO neurons is linked to severe conditions, including achalasia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction and chronic constipation1,2. Here we introduce a platform based on human pluripotent stem cells&nbsp;(hPSCs) for therapeutic development targeting GI motility disorders. Using an unbiased screen, we identified drug candidates that modulate NO neuron activity and enhance motility in mouse colonic tissue ex vivo. We established a high-throughput strategy to define developmental programs driving the specification of NO neurons and found that inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor&nbsp;receptors (PDGFRs) promotes their differentiation from precursors of the enteric nervous system. Transplantation of these neurons into NO-neuron-deficient mice led to robust engraftment and improved GI motility, offering a promising cell-based therapy for neurodegenerative GI disorders. These studies provide a new framework for understanding and treating enteric neuropathies.

  abstract     = {Birds have a sex chromosome system in which females are heterogametic (ZW) and males are homogametic (ZZ)1. The differentiation of avian sex chromosomes from ancestral autosomes entails the loss of most genes from the W chromosome during evolution1,2. However, the extent to which mechanisms evolved that counterbalance this substantial reduction in female gene dosage remains unclear. Here we report functional in vivo and evolutionary analyses of a Z-linked microRNA (miR-2954) with strong male-biased expression, previously proposed to mediate avian sex chromosome dosage compensation3. We knocked out miR-2954 in chicken, which resulted in early embryonic lethality in homozygous knockout males, probably driven by specific upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked target genes. Evolutionary gene expression analyses further revealed that these dosage-sensitive target genes underwent both transcriptional and translational upregulation on the single Z in female birds. Altogether, this work unveils a scenario in which evolutionary pressures following W gene loss drove transcriptional and translational upregulation of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes in females but also their transcriptional upregulation in males. The resulting excess of transcripts in males, resulting from the combined activity of two upregulated dosage-sensitive Z gene copies, was in turn offset by the emergence of a highly targeted miR-2954-mediated transcript degradation mechanism during avian evolution. This study uncovered a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation system in birds, in which a microRNA has become essential for male survival. Birds have evolved a unique sex chromosome dosage compensation mechanism involving the male-biased microRNA (miR-2954), which is essential for male survival by regulating the expression of dosage-sensitive Z-linked genes.},

  abstract     = {Human history is born in writing. Inscriptions are among the earliest written forms, and offer direct insights into the thought, language and history of ancient civilizations. Historians capture these insights by identifying parallels—inscriptions with shared phrasing, function or cultural setting—to enable the contextualization of texts within broader historical frameworks, and perform key tasks such as restoration and geographical or chronological attribution1. However, current digital methods are restricted to literal matches and narrow historical scopes. Here we introduce Aeneas, a generative neural network for contextualizing ancient texts. Aeneas retrieves textual and contextual parallels, leverages visual inputs, handles arbitrary-length text restoration, and advances the state of the art in key tasks. To evaluate its impact, we conduct a large study with historians using outputs from Aeneas as research&nbsp;starting points. The historians find the parallels retrieved by Aeneas to be useful research starting points in 90% of cases, improving their confidence in key tasks by 44%. Restoration and geographical attribution tasks yielded superior results when historians were paired with Aeneas, outperforming both humans and artificial intelligence alone. For dating, Aeneas achieved a 13-year distance from ground-truth ranges. We demonstrate Aeneas’ contribution to historical workflows through analysis of key traits in the renowned Roman inscription Res Gestae Divi Augusti, showing how integrating science and humanities can create transformative tools to assist historians and advance our understanding of the past. Aeneas, a generative neural network trained on ancient texts, helps historians contextualize inscriptions and perform epigraphic tasks, offering an improved starting point for historical research.},

Yet globally consistent LSP mapping has been hampered by methods that struggle to represent the full range of seasonal phenologies occurring across terrestrial biomes14, especially the subtle and complex phenologies of many arid and tropical ecosystems1,15,16. Here, using a data-driven analysis of satellite imagery to map LSP worldwide, we provide insights into Earth’s phenological diversity, documenting both intercontinental convergence between similar climates and regional heterogeneity associated with topoclimate, ecohydrology and vegetation structure. We then map spatial phenological asynchrony and the modes of asynchronous seasonality that control it, identifying hotspots of asynchrony in tropical mountains and Mediterranean climate regions and reporting evidence for the hypothesis that climatically similar sites exhibit greater phenological asynchrony within the tropics. Finally, we find that our global LSP map predicts complex geographical discontinuities in flowering phenology, genetic divergence and even harvest seasonality across a range of taxa, establishing remote sensing as a crucial tool for understanding the ecological and evolutionary consequences of allochrony by allopatry.

However, the storage potential is not unlimited3,4. Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO2 storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources. Treating carbon storage as a limited intergenerational resource has deep implications for national mitigation strategies and policy and requires making explicit decisions on priorities for storage use.

  abstract     = {Central to our understanding of chemical reactivity is the principle of mass conservation1, which is fundamental for ensuring physical consistency, balancing equations and guiding reaction design. However, data-driven computational models2–9 for tasks such as reaction product prediction rarely abide by this most basic constraint10–13. Here we recast the problem of reaction prediction as a problem of electron redistribution using the modern deep generative framework of flow matching14–16, explicitly conserving both mass and electrons through the bond-electron (BE) matrix representation17,18. Our model, FlowER, overcomes limitations inherent in previous approaches by enforcing exact mass conservation, resolving hallucinatory failure modes, recovering mechanistic reaction sequences for unseen substrate scaffolds and generalizing effectively to out-of-domain reaction classes with extremely data-efficient fine-tuning. FlowER also enables downstream estimation of thermodynamic or kinetic feasibility and manifests a degree of chemical intuition in reaction prediction tasks. This inherently interpretable framework represents an important step in bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and mechanistic understanding in data-driven reaction outcome prediction. A new tool based on generative machine learning called FlowER uses flow matching to model reactions as the redistribution of electrons between reactants and products, enabling the enforcement of mass conservation in reaction prediction.},

GRACE rapidly and automatically generates complex structures capable of conforming directly around features ranging from cellular to macroscopic scales with minimal user intervention. Here we demonstrate its versatility in applications ranging from synthetic objects to biofabrication, including adaptive vascular-like geometries around cell-laden bioinks, resulting in improved functionality. GRACE also enables precise alignment of sequential prints, as well as the detection and overprinting of opaque surfaces through shadow correction. Compatible with various printing modalities1–4, GRACE transcends traditional additive manufacturing limitations in automating overprinting and adapting the printed designs to the content of the printable material. This opens new possibilities in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

  abstract     = {Steel truss bridges are constructed by connecting many different types of bars (components) to form a load-bearing structural system. Several disastrous collapses of this type of bridge have occurred as a result of initial component failure(s) propagating to the rest of the structure1–3. Despite the prevalence and importance of these structures, it is still unclear why initial component failures propagate disproportionately in some bridges but barely affect functionality in others4–7. Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development. These findings can be used to enhance present bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately leading to safer transport networks. Experimental tests and computational simulations of a scaled-down specimen of a real steel truss bridge identify and characterize the latent resistance mechanisms following critical failures, demonstrating how loads supported by failed components can be redistributed and enable structure resilience.},

  abstract     = {Many chirality-sensitive light–matter interactions are governed by chiral electron dynamics. Therefore, the development of advanced technologies making use of chiral phenomena would critically benefit from measuring and controlling chiral electron dynamics on their natural attosecond timescales. Such endeavours have so far been hampered by the lack of characterized circularly polarized attosecond pulses, an obstacle that has recently been overcome1,2. Here we introduce chiroptical spectroscopy with attosecond pulses and demonstrate attosecond coherent control over photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD)3,4, as well as the measurement of chiral asymmetries in the forward–backward and angle-resolved photoionization delays of chiral molecules. We show that co-rotating attosecond and near-infrared (IR) pulses can nearly double the PECD and even change its sign compared with single-photon ionization. We demonstrate that chiral photoionization delays depend on both polar and azimuthal angles of photoemission in the light-propagation frame, requiring 3D momentum resolution. We measure forward–backward chiral-sensitive delays of up to 60 as and polar-angle-resolved photoionization delays of up to 240 as, which include an asymmetry of about 60 as originating from chirality in the continuum–continuum transitions. Attosecond chiroptical spectroscopy opens the door to quantitatively understanding and controlling the dynamics of chiral molecules on the electronic timescale. By introducing chiroptical spectroscopy with attosecond pulses, attosecond coherent control over photoelectron circular dichroism is demonstrated&nbsp;and measurements of chiral asymmetries in the forward–backward and angle-resolved photoionization delays of chiral molecules&nbsp;are reported.},

The accurate determination of atomic partial charges has far-reaching implications in fields such as chemical synthesis, applied materials science and theoretical chemistry, to name a few3. They play essential parts in molecular dynamics simulations, which can act as a computational microscope for chemical processes4. Until now, no general experimental method has quantified the partial charges of individual atoms in a chemical compound. Here we introduce an experimental method that assigns partial charges based on crystal structure determination through electron diffraction, applicable to any crystalline compound. Seamlessly integrated into standard electron crystallography workflows, this approach requires no specialized software or advanced expertise. Furthermore, it is not limited to specific classes of compounds. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by its application to a wide array of compounds, including the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, the amino acids histidine and tyrosine, and the inorganic zeolite ZSM-5. We refer to this new concept as ionic scattering factors modelling. It fosters a more comprehensive and precise understanding of molecular structures, providing opportunities for applications across numerous fields in the chemical and materials sciences.

  abstract     = {The forthcoming sixth-generation and beyond wireless networks are poised to operate across an expansive frequency range—from microwave, millimetre wave to terahertz bands—to support ubiquitous connectivity in diverse application scenarios1–3. This necessitates a one-size-fits-all hardware solution that can be adaptively reconfigured within this wide spectrum to support full-band coverage and dynamic spectrum management4. However, existing electrical or photonic-assisted solutions face a lot of challenges in meeting this demand because of the limited bandwidths of the devices and the intrinsically rigid nature of system architectures5. Here we demonstrate adaptive wireless communications over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz, driven by a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic wireless system. Leveraging the Pockels effect and scalability of the TFLN platform, we achieve monolithic integration of essential functional elements, including baseband modulation, broadband wireless–photonic conversion and reconfigurable carrier and local signal generation. Powered by broadband tunable optoelectronic oscillators, our signal sources operate across a record-wide frequency range from 0.5 GHz to 115 GHz with high-frequency stability and consistent coherence. Based on the broadband and reconfigurable integrated photonic solution, we realize full-link wireless communication across nine consecutive bands, achieving record lane speeds of up to 100 Gbps. The real-time reconfigurability further enables adaptive frequency allocation, a crucial ability to ensure enhanced reliability in complex spectrum environments. Our proposed system represents a marked step towards future full-spectrum and omni-scenario wireless networks. Adaptive wireless communication over an unprecedented frequency range spanning over 100 GHz can be achieved by a thin-film lithium niobate photonic wireless system, which can process a large flux of information at high speed.},

Optically addressable spin qubits form the foundation of an emerging generation of nanoscale sensors2–7. The engineering of these qubits has mainly focused on solid-state systems. However, fluorescent proteins, rather than exogenous fluorescent probes, have become the gold standard for in vivo microscopy because of their genetic encodability8,9. Although fluorescent proteins possess a metastable triplet state10, they have not been investigated as qubits. Here we realize an optically addressable spin qubit in enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. A near-infrared laser pulse enables triggered readout of the triplet state with up to 20% spin contrast. Using coherent microwave control of the enhanced-yellow-fluorescent-protein spin at liquid-nitrogen temperatures, we measure a (16 ± 2) μs coherence time under Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill decoupling. We express the qubit in mammalian cells, maintaining contrast and coherent control despite the complex intracellular environment. Finally, we demonstrate optically detected magnetic resonance in bacterial cells at room temperature with contrast up to 8%. Our results introduce fluorescent proteins as a powerful qubit platform that paves the way for applications in the life sciences, such as nanoscale field sensing and spin-based imaging modalities. An optically addressable fluorescent-protein spin qubit is realized using enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; the qubit can be coherently controlled at liquid-nitrogen temperatures and the spin detected at room temperature in cells.},

  abstract     = {For rocky planets, the presence of a solid inner core has notable implications on the composition and thermal evolution of the core and on the magnetic history of the planet1–3. On Mars, geophysical observations have confirmed that the core is at least partially liquid4–7, but it is unknown whether any part of the core is solid. Here we present an analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission, demonstrating that Mars has a solid inner core. We identify two seismic phases, the deep core-transiting phase, PKKP, and the inner core boundary reflecting phase, PKiKP, indicative of the inner core. Our inversions constrain the radius of the Martian inner core to about 613 ± 67 km, with a compressional velocity jump of around 30% across the inner core boundary, supported by additional inner-core-related seismic phases. These properties imply a concentration of distinct light elements in the inner core, segregated from the outer core through core crystallization. This finding provides an anchor point for understanding the thermal and chemical state of Mars. Moreover, the relationship between inner core formation and the Martian magnetic field evolution could provide insights into dynamo generation across planetary bodies. An analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission demonstrates that Mars has a 600-km solid inner core.},

  abstract     = {Within 20 pc of the Sun, there are currently&nbsp;29 known cold brown dwarfs—sources with measured distances and an estimated effective temperature between that of Jupiter (170 K) and approximately 500 K (ref. 1). These sources are almost all isolated and are the closest laboratories we have for detailed atmospheric studies of giant planets formed outside the Solar System. Here we report JWST observations of one such source, WISEA J153429.75-104303.3 (W1534), which we confirm is a substellar mass member of the Galactic halo with a metallicity of less than 0.01 times solar. Its spectrum reveals methane (CH4), water (H2O) and silane (SiH4) gas. Although SiH4 is expected to serve as a key reservoir for the cloud-forming element Si in gas giant worlds, it has remained undetected until now because it is removed from observable atmospheres by the formation of silicate clouds at depth. These condensates are favoured with increasing metallicity, explaining why SiH4 remains undetected on well-studied metal-rich Solar System worlds such as Jupiter and Saturn2. On the metal-poor world W1534, we detect a clear signature of SiH4 centred at about 4.55 μm with an abundance of 19 ± 2 parts per billion. Our chemical modelling suggests that this SiH4 abundance may be quenched at approximately kilobar levels just above the silicate cloud layers, in which vertical atmospheric mixing can transport SiH4 to the observable photosphere. The formation and detection of SiH4 demonstrates key coupled relationships between composition, cloud formation and atmospheric mixing in cold brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres. Silane, which is a precursor to the sandy surfaces of rocky planets and dusty clouds on gas giants, is seen directly in another world—a low-metallicity brown dwarf in which oxidation is slow and gas mixing is fast.},

  abstract     = {Physical neural networks (PNNs) are a class of neural-like networks that make use of analogue physical systems to perform computations. Although at present confined to small-scale laboratory demonstrations, PNNs could one day transform how artificial intelligence (AI) calculations are performed. Could we train AI models many orders of magnitude larger than present ones? Could we perform model inference locally and privately on edge devices? Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to these questions is probably “yes, with enough research”. Because PNNs can make use of analogue physical computations more directly, flexibly and opportunistically than traditional computing hardware, they could change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this, however, will require notable progress, rethinking both how AI models work and how they are trained—primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs, backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs and, so far, no method has been shown to scale to large models with the same performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this challenge has been rapidly changing and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be used to create both more efficient and larger-scale realizations of present-scale AI models. Methods to train physical neural networks, such as backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches, are explored to allow scaling up of artificial intelligence models far beyond present small-scale laboratory demonstrations, potentially enhancing computational efficiency.},
