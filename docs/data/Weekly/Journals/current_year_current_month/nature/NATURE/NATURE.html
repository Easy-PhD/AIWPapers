  abstract     = {Tight control of intracellular Ca2+ levels is fundamental as they are used to control numerous signal transduction pathways1. Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) have a crucial role in this process by extruding Ca2+ against a steep concentration gradient from the cytosol to the extracellular space2. Although new details of PMCA biology are constantly being uncovered, the structural basis of the most distinguishing features of these pumps, namely, transport rates in the kilohertz range and regulation of activity by the plasma membrane phospholipid PtdIns(4,5)P2, has so far remained elusive. Here we present the structures of mouse PMCA2 in the presence and absence of its accessory subunit neuroplastin in eight different stages of its transport cycle. Combined with whole-cell recordings that accurately track PMCA-mediated Ca2+ extrusion in intact cells, these structures enable us to establish the first comprehensive transport model for a PMCA, reveal the role of disease-causing mutations and uncover the structural underpinnings of regulatory PMCA–phospholipid interaction. The transport cycle-dependent dynamics of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are fundamental for its role as a ‘latch’ promoting the fast release of Ca2+ and opening a passageway for counter-ions. These actions are required for maintaining the ultra-fast transport cycle. Moreover, we identify the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site as an unanticipated target for drug-mediated manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Our work provides detailed structural insights into the uniquely fast operation of native PMCA-type Ca2+ pumps and its control by membrane lipids and drugs. Structural insights into ultrafast Ca2+ transport by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases are provided, highlighting an essential role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics.},

  abstract     = {The multilayered nucleolus is the primary site of ribosome biogenesis1,2, where successive maturation of small (SSU)3,4 and large (LSU)5 ribosomal subunit precursors occurs. However, the spatiofunctional relationship between pre-rRNA processing and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to changing cellular physiological demands have remained incompletely understood6,7. Here our spatiotemporal analyses revealed a compartment-specific ribosomal subunit processing in human nucleoli, with SSU processomes maintained in fibrillar centre (FC)–dense fibrillar component (DFC)–periphery dense fibrillar component (PDFC) domains while LSU pre-rRNAs largely transited to PDFC–granular component regions. Slowly proliferating cells exhibited unexpected 5′ external transcribed spacer (5′&nbsp;ETS)-centred SSU&nbsp;processing impairment, accompanied by structural remodelling of FC–DFC units&nbsp;and retarded SSU outflux. Direct 5′&nbsp;ETS processing perturbation at least partially recapitulated these FC–DFC unit&nbsp;alterations, supporting the functional interdependence between SSU processing and nucleolar architecture. Notably, anamniote bipartite nucleoli with merged FC–DFC compartments8,9 exhibited distinct 5′&nbsp;ETS distribution and slower pre-rRNA flux compared with multilayered nucleoli in amniotes. Introducing a FC/DFC interface to bipartite nucleoli enhanced processing efficiency, indicating that the evolutionary emergence of nested FC–DFC units&nbsp;may have optimized pre-rRNA processing. Collectively, depicting the spatiotemporal distribution of pre-rRNAs reveals an essential role of 5′&nbsp;ETS-centred processing in maintaining nucleolar substructures and suggests a possible evolutionary advantage of the multilayered structure in amniotes.

  abstract     = {Living cells depend on an intricate network of chemical reactions catalysed by enzymes, which sometimes make mistakes that lead to their inactivation. Here we report a metabolite-based mechanism for preserving enzyme function in an unfavourable environment. We found that the enzyme&nbsp;TGDS produces UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, a mimic of the reaction intermediate of the enzyme UXS1, which regenerates the essential cofactor NAD+ within the catalytic pocket of UXS1 by completing its catalytic cycle. Thus, the production of an ‘enzyme-rescue metabolite’ by TGDS represents a mechanism for maintaining the activity of an enzyme in a subcellular compartment where NAD+ is scarce. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that the inability to produce sufficient amounts of this enzyme-rescue metabolite leads to the inactivation of UXS1, impairing the synthesis of specific glycans that are crucial for skeletal development. This provides an explanation for the development of the hereditary skeletal disorder Catel–Manzke syndrome in individuals with TGDS deficiency. Defects in similar protective layers might contribute to metabolic changes in other diseases that cannot be explained with common concepts in metabolic biochemistry. In mammals, the enzyme TGDS&nbsp;produces UDP-4-keto-6-deoxyglucose, which binds to the catalytic pocket of UDP-xylose synthase, thereby regenerating the essential NAD+ cofactor of UDP-xylose synthase in conditions of low NAD+.},

  abstract     = {After fertilization, early embryos undergo dissolution of conventional chromatin organization, including topologically associating domains (TADs)1,2. Zygotic genome activation then commences amid unusually slow de novo establishment of three-dimensional chromatin architecture2. How chromatin organization is established and how it interplays with transcription in early mammalian embryos remain elusive. Here we show that CTCF occupies chromatin throughout mouse early development. By contrast, cohesin poorly binds chromatin in one-cell embryos, coinciding with TAD dissolution. Cohesin binding then progressively increases from two- to eight-cell embryos, accompanying TAD establishment. Unexpectedly, strong ‘genic cohesin islands’ (GCIs) emerge across gene bodies of active genes in this period. GCI genes enrich for cell identity and regulatory genes, display broad H3K4me3 at promoters, and exhibit strong binding of transcription factors and the cohesin loader NIPBL at nearby enhancers. We show that transcription is hyperactive in two- to eight-cell embryos and is required for GCI formation. Conversely, induced transcription can also create GCIs. Finally, GCIs can function as insulation boundaries and form contact domains with nearby CTCF sites, enhancing both the transcription levels and stability of GCI genes. These data reveal a hypertranscription state in early embryos that both shapes and is fostered by the three-dimensional genome organization, revealing an intimate interplay between chromatin structure and transcription. A study reveals progressive cohesin loading and&nbsp;a hypertranscription state responsible for the formation of genic&nbsp;cohesin islands at&nbsp;active regulatory&nbsp;genes in mouse embryos, highlighting an interplay between chromatin architecture and transcription as they are established for the first time.},

  abstract     = {Mammalian cells entering the cell cycle favour glycolysis to rapidly generate ATP and produce the biosynthetic intermediates that are required for rapid biomass accumulation1. Simultaneously, the ubiquitin-ligase anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and its coactivator CDH1 (APC/CCDH1) remains active, allowing origin licensing and blocking premature DNA replication. Paradoxically, glycolysis is reduced by APC/CCDH1 through the degradation of key glycolytic enzymes2, raising the question of how cells coordinate these mutually exclusive events to ensure proper cell division. Here we show that cells resolve this paradox by transiently inactivating the APC/C during cell cycle entry, which allows a transient metabolic shift favouring glycolysis. After mitogen stimulation, rapid mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of the APC/C adapter protein CDH1 at the amino terminus causes it to partially dissociate from the APC/C. This partial inactivation of the APC/C leads to the accumulation of PFKFB3, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, promoting a metabolic shift towards glycolysis. Delayed accumulation of phosphatase activity later removes CDH1 phosphorylation, restoring full APC/C activity, and shifting cells back to favouring oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, cells coordinate the simultaneous demands of cell cycle progression and metabolism through an incoherent feedforward loop, which transiently inhibits APC/C activity to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry. APC/C activity is&nbsp;transiently inhibited to generate a pulse of glycolysis that is required for mammalian cell cycle entry.},

  abstract     = {Both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) accumulate in cancer cells during tumour development, fuelling clonal evolution. However, accurate estimation of clone-specific copy numbers from bulk DNA-sequencing data is challenging. Here we present allele-specific phylogenetic analysis of copy number alterations (ALPACA), a method to infer SNV and SCNA coevolution by leveraging phylogenetic trees reconstructed from multi-sample bulk tumour sequencing data using SNV frequencies. ALPACA estimates the SCNA evolution of simulated tumours with a higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art methods1–4. ALPACA uncovers loss-of-heterozygosity and amplification events in minor clones that may be missed using standard approaches and reveals the temporal order of somatic alterations. Analysing clone-specific copy numbers in TRACERx421 lung tumours5,6, we find evidence of increased chromosomal instability in metastasis-seeding clones and enrichment for losses affecting tumour suppressor genes and amplification affecting CCND1. Furthermore, we identify increased SCNA rates in both tumours with polyclonal metastatic dissemination and tumours with extrathoracic metastases, and an association between higher clone copy number diversity and reduced disease-free survival in patients with lung cancer. A study presents ALPACA, a computational method for inferring clone- and allele-specific copy numbers of individual clones from multi-sample bulk DNA-sequencing data, and demonstrates its use to study metastasis trajectories.},

  abstract     = {Alcohol-use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are major causes of death and liver transplantation1. The gut–liver axis has a crucial yet poorly understood role in ALD pathogenesis, which depends on microbial translocation. Intestinal goblet cells (GCs) educate the immune system by forming GC-associated antigen passages (GAPs) on activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 (mAChR4, also known as M4), enabling sampling of luminal antigens by lamina&nbsp;propria antigen-presenting cells. Here we show that chronic alcohol use in humans and mice downregulates small intestinal mAChR4 and reduces GAP formation, disrupting antimicrobial immunity. This is reversed on activation of intestinal IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST, also known as&nbsp;glycoprotein 130;&nbsp;gp130), which restores mAChR4 expression and GAP formation, enabling induction of downstream type-3 innate lymphoid cell-derived IL-22 and antimicrobial REG3 proteins. This blunts translocation of enteric bacteria to the liver, thereby conferring ALD resistance. GAP induction by GC-specific mAChR4 activation was essential and sufficient for prevention of ethanol-induced steatohepatitis. These results lay the foundation for a therapeutic approach using mAChR4 or IL6ST agonists to promote GAP formation and prevent ALD by inhibiting microbial translocation. Chronic alcohol use in humans and mice downregulates small intestinal mAChR4 and reduces goblet-cell-associated antigen passage formation, disrupting antimicrobial immunity.},

However, how EBV infection initiates multiple sclerosis pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that EBV expands oligoclonal T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells that home to the CNS in humanized mice. Effector memory CD8+ T cells and CD4+ TH1 cells as well as CD4+ TH17 cells co-migrate to the brain of EBV-infected humanized mice. T-bet+CXCR3+ B cells can colonize submeningeal brain regions in the absence of other lymphocytes and attract T cells. Depletion of B cells with rituximab or blocking of CXCR3 significantly decreases lymphocyte infiltration into the CNS. Thus, we suggest that symptomatic primary EBV infection generates B cell subsets that gain access to the CNS, attract T cells and thereby initiate multiple sclerosis. Epstein–Barr virus infection generates a neuroinvasive B cell subset, which recruits activated T cells to the central nervous system, promoting multiple sclerosis.},

  abstract     = {Prenatal stress (PS) is a repeated exposure to aversive situations during pregnancy, including high emotional strain, which is suspected to affect homeostatic systems in infants. Paediatric eczema develops quickly after birth at flexural sites subjected to continuous mechanical constraints1,2. Although epidemiological studies have suggested an association between PS and a higher risk of eczema in children3–6, no causative biological link has yet been identified. Here we show that eczema at birth originates from molecular dysregulations of neuroimmune circuits in utero, triggered by fluctuations in the maternal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. We found that offspring of stressed pregnant dams have dysregulated mast cells and skin-projecting neurons and quickly develop eczema in response to harmless mechanical friction. We demonstrated that PS transiently modulates amniotic fluid corticosterone concentrations, which directly alters the activation program of skin mast cells expressing the glucocorticoid receptor Nr3c1 and the adjacent sensory neurons conveying mechanosensation. Therapeutic normalization of maternal corticosterone concentrations or genetic depletion of Mcpt5+ mast cells during stressed gestation prevents fetal immune dysregulation and protects against eczema development after birth. Our findings support a new model in which early-onset paediatric eczema originates from dysregulations in the fetal immune system, caused by fluctuations in maternal glucocorticoids induced by stress. Prenatal stress triggers molecular dysregulations in fetal neuroimmune circuits, leading to altered mast cell and sensory neuron function, which predisposes offspring to develop eczema in response to otherwise harmless mechanical friction after birth.},

  abstract     = {Nitrous oxide (N2O), a driver of global warming and climate change, has reached unprecedented concentrations in Earth’s atmosphere1. Current N2O sources outpace N2O sinks, emphasizing the need for comprehensive understanding of processes that consume N2O. Microbes that express the enzyme N2O reductase (N2OR) convert N2O to climate change-neutral dinitrogen (N2). Known N2ORs belong to the canonical clade I and clade II NosZ reductases and are considered key enzymes for N2O reduction2–4. Here we report a previously unrecognized protein family with a role in N2O reduction, clade III lactonase-type N2OR (L-N2OR), which diverges in sequence from canonical NosZ but conserves three-dimensional protein structural features. Integrated physiological, metagenomic, proteomic and structural modelling studies demonstrate that L-N2ORs catalyse N2O reduction. L-N2OR genes occur in several phyla, predominantly in uncultured taxa with broad geographic distribution. Our findings expand the known diversity of N2ORs and implicate previously unrecognized taxa (for example, Nitrospinota) in N2O consumption. The expansion of N2OR diversity and the identification of a novel type of catalyst for N2O reduction advances the understanding of N2O sinks, has implications for greenhouse gas emission and climate change modelling, and expands opportunities for innovative biotechnologies aimed at curbing N2O emissions5,6. Cultivation of tropical soil microorganisms combined with physiological experiments and bioinformatics analyses identify a family of clade III lactonase-type nitrous oxide reductases with low sequence identity but high 3D structural similarity to known nitrous oxide reductases.},

  abstract     = {Motor skill learning induces long-lasting synaptic plasticity at dendritic spines1–4 and at the outputs of motor cortical neurons to the striatum5,6. However, little is known about corticostriatal axon activity and structural plasticity during learning in the adult brain. Here, using longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging, we tracked thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum of awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill dynamically regulated these boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and unrewarded movements (UM). Notably, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behaviour. Motor learning significantly increased the proportion of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we saw that newly formed axonal boutons were more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and were stabilized during motor learning, whereas UM boutons were selectively eliminated. These findings reveal a novel form of plasticity in corticostriatal axons and show that motor learning drives dynamic bouton reorganization to support motor skill acquisition and execution. Individual boutons on mouse corticostriatal axons exhibit differential selectivity for rewarded and unrewarded movements during motor learning, and the proportion of reward-responsive boutons increases.},

  abstract     = {Many animals use vision to navigate their environment. The pattern of changes that self-motion induces in the visual scene, referred to as optic flow1, is first estimated in local patches by directionally selective neurons2–4. However, how arrays of directionally selective neurons, each responsive to motion in a preferred direction at specific retinal positions, are organized to support robust decoding of optic flow by downstream circuits is unclear. Understanding this global organization requires mapping fine, local features of neurons across an animal’s field of view3. In Drosophila, the asymmetrical dendrites of the T4 and T5 directionally selective neurons establish their preferred direction, which makes it possible to predict directional tuning from anatomy4,5. Here we show that the organization of the compound eye shapes the systematic variation in the preferred directions of directionally selective neurons across the entire visual field. To estimate the preferred directions across the visual field, we reconstructed hundreds of T4 neurons in an electron-microscopy volume of the full adult fly brain6, and discovered unexpectedly stereotypical dendritic arborizations. We then used whole-head micro-computed-tomography scans to map the viewing directions of all compound eye facets, and found a non-uniform sampling of visual space that explains the spatial variation in preferred directions. Our findings show that the global organization of the directionally selective neurons’ preferred directions is determined mainly by the fly’s compound eye, revealing the intimate connections between eye structure, functional properties of neurons and locomotion control. In Drosophila, the physical structure of the eye has a key role in the directional tuning of motion-sensitive neurons, showing how navigational behaviour is tightly associated with anatomy.},

  abstract     = {Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines1, it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour2. This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems3,4. Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models5. Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine&nbsp;agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them. People cheat more when they delegate&nbsp;tasks to artificial intelligence, and large language models are more likely than humans to comply with unethical instructions—a risk that can be minimized by introducing prohibitive, task-specific guardrails.},

  abstract     = {Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges, we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases.

  abstract     = {The application of biocatalysis in synthesis has the potential to offer streamlined routes towards target molecules1, tunable catalyst-controlled selectivity2, as well as processes with improved sustainability3. Despite these advantages, biocatalysis is often a high-risk strategy to implement, as identifying an enzyme capable of performing chemistry on a specific intermediate required for a synthesis can be a roadblock that requires extensive screening of enzymes and protein engineering to overcome4. Strategies for predicting which enzyme and small molecule are compatible have been hindered by the lack of well-studied biocatalytic reaction datasets5. The underexploration of connections between chemical and protein sequence space constrains navigation between these two landscapes. Here we report a two-phase effort relying on high-throughput experimentation to populate connections between productive substrate and enzyme pairs and the subsequent development of a tool, CATNIP, for predicting compatible α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)/Fe(ii)-dependent enzymes for a given substrate or, conversely, for ranking potential substrates for a given&nbsp;α-KG/Fe(ii)-dependent enzyme sequence. We anticipate that our approach can be readily expanded to further enzyme and transformation classes and will derisk the investigation and application of biocatalytic methods. A two-phase machine-learning-based tool making use of high-throughput experimentation is introduced to examine the connections between chemical and protein sequence space and predict productive biocatalytic reactions among substrate and enzyme pairs.},

In battery chemistry, the formation of a well-known solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reversible operations of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)1,2. However, characterizing the precise chemical composition of the low crystallinity and highly sensitive SEI presents a formidable challenge3. Here, taking lithium fluoride (LiF)—a widely studied and considered crucial SEI component4–7—as an example, we use 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and identify that LiF formed in SEI (LiFSEI) has fruitful spectroscopy features that originated from the formation of limited LiF–LiH solid solutions: H-rich phase (LiH1−yFy) and F-rich phase (LiF1−xHx), which is further validated by 6Li isotope NMR, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). By characterizing SEI formed in various electrolytes, we confirm the dominance of LiH1−yFy in high-coulombic-efficiency electrolyte, which can be rationalized by the fact that LiF–LiH solid solution shows improved ionic conductivity over LiF. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that LiH1−yFy-rich coating layer presents obvious advantages compared with LiF-rich coating layer in lithium-metal batteries. This revised understanding of the heterogeneous nature of SEI components would provide new insights for electrode–electrolyte interface design. Using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance to study LiF–LiH solid solutions revealed that it is present in the solid–electrolyte interphase of lithium metal batteries and confirms the heterogeneous nature of LiF in such interphases.},

However, their instability often compromises the operational performance of devices, strongly hindering their practical applications7,8. Here we employ a cross-linkable co-SAM to enhance the conformational stability of hole-selective SAMs against external stresses, while suppressing the formation of defects and voids in SAM during self-assembly. The azide-containing SAM can be thermally activated to form a cross-linked and densely assembled co-SAM with a thermally stable conformation and preferred orientation. This effectively minimizes substrate surface exposure caused by wiggling of loose SAMs under thermal stress, preventing perovskite decomposition. This enables a certified PCE of 26.92% to be achieved for the best-performing cell, which also possesses excellent thermal stability with negligible decay under maximum-power-point tracking at 85 °C for 1,000 h. It also retains &gt;98% of initial PCE after 700 repetitive thermal cycles between −40 °C and 85 °C, representing the state of the art of the field. This work offers an in-depth understanding of SAM degradation mechanisms to guide the design of a&nbsp;more robust buried interface for SAM-based devices adopting high-roughness substrates to realize highly efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.

Here we program discs to deform into stably falling parachutes as they deploy under fluid–structure interaction. Parachutes are expensive and delicate to manufacture, which limits their use for humanitarian airdrops or drone delivery. Laser cutting a closed-loop kirigami pattern18 in a disc induces porosity and flexibility into an easily fabricated parachute. By performing wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations using a custom flow-induced reconfiguration model19, we develop a design tool to realize kirigami-inspired parachutes. Guided by these results, we fabricate parachutes from the centimetre to the metre scale and test them in realistic conditions. We show that at low load-to-area ratios, kirigami-inspired parachutes exhibit a comparable terminal velocity to conventional ones. However, unlike conventional parachutes that require a gliding angle for vertical stability20 and fall at random far from a target, our kirigami-inspired parachutes always fall near the target, regardless of their initial release angle. These kinds of parachutes could limit material losses during airdropping as well as decrease manufacturing costs and complexity. A thin planar disc designed with appropriately patterned cuts transforms itself, due to air flow effects, into an effective parachute exhibiting good positional stability, regardless of its initial orientation.},

Here we show precise qubit operation of silicon two-qubit devices made with standard semiconductor tooling in a 300-mm foundry environment.

  abstract     = {Spin-squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement1–7. These squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals8–16. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. Here we report the experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly interacting ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (−0.50 ± 0.13 dB) below the noise of uncorrelated spins is generated by the native magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between nitrogen–vacancy centres. To generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome several challenges. First, we develop an approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids. An ensemble of spins from nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamonds is prepared in a spin-squeezed state.},

  abstract     = {Electronic spins of nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nanoscale magnetic sensing1–4, because of their operation under ambient conditions5, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets6 and biological compatibility7. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits8 but can also potentially enhance9 sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor. Our approach uses time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering10 in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. We observe that optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo11,12. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opportunities for practical entanglement-enhanced quantum sensing. The experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor is reported.},

  abstract     = {Carbonaceous asteroids are the source of the most primitive meteorites1 and represent leftover planetesimals that formed from ice and dust in the outer Solar System and may have delivered volatiles to the terrestrial planets2–5. Understanding the aqueous activity of asteroids is key to deciphering their thermal, chemical and orbital evolution, with implications for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Analyses of the objects, in particular pristine samples returned from asteroid Ryugu, have provided detailed information on fluid–rock interactions within a few million years after parent-body formation6–11. However, the long-term fate of asteroidal water remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence for fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid more than 1 billion years after formation, based on the 176Lu–176Hf decay systematics of Ryugu samples, which reflect late lutetium mobilization. Such late fluid flow was probably triggered by an impact that generated heat for ice melting and opened rock fractures for fluid migration. This contrasts the early aqueous activity powered by short-lived radioactive decay, with limited fluid flow and little elemental fractionation12. Our results imply that carbonaceous planetesimals accreted by the terrestrial planets could have retained not only hydrous minerals but also aqueous water, leading to an upwards revision of the inventory of their water delivery by a factor of two to three. Analysis of samples from the asteroid Ryugu provide evidence of late fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid, indicating that such bodies may have retained two to three times more water than previously thought.},

  abstract     = {Accretion disks in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars)1–4 and supermassive black holes5. Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems in which radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disk (L ≳ LEdd). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies6. Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual (L ≳ LEdd). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disk than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disk. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast (v ~ 0.3c) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at a similarly high Eddington ratio7. The XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines.},

  abstract     = {The doughnut-shaped framework of social and planetary boundaries (the ‘Doughnut’) provides a concise visual assessment of progress towards the goal of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet1–3. Here we present a renewed Doughnut framework with a revised set of 35 indicators that monitor trends in social deprivation and ecological overshoot over the 2000–2022 period. Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall. These trends and inequalities reaffirm the case for overcoming the dependence of nations on perpetual GDP growth4,5 and reorienting towards regenerative and distributive economic activity—within and between nations—that assigns priority to human needs and planetary integrity. A revised ‘Doughnut’ providing a visual assessment of trends in social deprivation and planetary degradation over the past two decades shows more than doubling of global GDP accompanied by accelerating ecological overshoot but only a modest reduction in human deprivation.},
