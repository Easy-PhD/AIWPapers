  abstract     = {[Joshi] provides a critical examination of how big data and AI technologies can both advance and hinder gender equality in healthcare access and treatment. This perspective article addresses one of the most pressing ethical challenges in contemporary healthcare technology: bias is a big challenge when implementing AI systems in medical settings, particularly relevant for conditions like Multiple Sclerosis, where gender disparities in diagnosis and treatment access are well-documented.The contribution by [Joshi] highlights three critical categories where machine learning can facilitate accessible, affordable, personalized, and evidence-based healthcare for women, while simultaneously addressing the algorithmic bias that threatens to undermine these advances. This work exemplifies the critical need for intersectional approaches to healthcare AI development that consider both the transformative potential and the ethical implications of these technologies in specialized treatment contexts such as neurological care.[Chen et al.] contribute valuable insights into the practical challenges of leveraging social media data for public health research and healthcare accessibility analysis. Social media has profoundly changed our modes of self-expression, communication, and participation in public discourse, generating volumes of conversations and content that cover every aspect of our social lives. Their research addresses the critical gap between the theoretical potential of social media analytics and the practical hurdles researchers face in accessing and utilizing these data sources for understanding patient experiences and healthcare navigation challenges.The work by [Chen et al.] is particularly relevant for understanding patient perspectives on healthcare accessibility, treatment barriers, and health-seeking behaviors-essential components for developing comprehensive models of healthcare access, such as those needed for MS treatment planning as an example of the United Arab Emirates. Social media platforms provide unprecedented access to real-time patient sentiment, treatment experiences, and geographic variation in healthcare access that can inform policy and practice improvements.The fourth contribution explores advanced techniques in knowledge-based recommendation systems, with direct relevance to clinical decision support and personalized treatment recommendations for complex conditions like Multiple Sclerosis. This research demonstrates how sophisticated recommendation algorithms can be applied to support clinical decisionmaking in specialized care contexts, patient education about treatment options, and healthcare resource allocation-all critical components for ensuring equitable access to Disease-Modifying Therapies.The integration of knowledge-based systems with machine learning approaches represents a significant advancement in creating transparent, including clinically interpretable, explainable AI tools for specialized healthcare settings. This work addresses the crucial challenge of AI interpretability in neurological care contexts, where understanding the rationale behind treatment recommendations is essential for both clinical acceptance and patient adherence to complex therapeutic regimens.When handling private health information, strong protections are needed to prevent breaches and unauthorized use. Across all four articles, several critical themes emerge that are directly applicable to addressing geographic and socioeconomic disparities in specialized healthcare access, particularly relevant for conditions requiring ongoing Disease-Modifying Therapy.The methodological approaches demonstrated across these studies provide frameworks for mapping healthcare accessibility patterns.[Santos et al.]'s geographic analysis of educational access barriers during the pandemic offers direct parallels to understanding how distance, infrastructure, and socioeconomic factors create barriers to specialized medical care in diverse geographic regions, including accessibility heatmaps or location allocation models, which are used in health system planning to reduce spatial inequality Algorithmic Bias and Treatment Equity: [Joshi]'s examination of gender bias in healthcare AI systems highlights challenges that extend to all aspects of specialized care delivery. The research demonstrates how historical inequities in healthcare access can be embedded in algorithmic systems used for treatment allocation, facility planning, diverse training data and patient risk stratification-directly relevant to ensuring equitable DMT access across different populations.The integration of quantitative analytics with qualitative patient experience data, demonstrated by [Santos et al.] and supported by [Chen et al.]'s social media analysis framework, provides essential methodological guidance for comprehensive healthcare accessibility studies that combine geospatial analysis with patient journey mapping.The research presented in this collection moves beyond theoretical accessibility models to address practical implementation challenges in healthcare delivery. [Chen et al.]'s analysis of data collection hurdles provides essential guidance for researchers conducting patient experience studies, while [Santos et al.]'s socioeconomic analysis offers actionable insights for policymakers addressing geographic healthcare disparities.These studies demonstrate that successful implementation of equitable healthcare access requires not only advanced analytical capabilities but also careful attention to privacy protection, stakeholder engagement, and systematic approaches to addressing the social determinants that influence treatment access and adherence patterns.Policymakers can use Big Data to subsequently review the social factors, among others, behind these health disparities. The collective insights from these four articles point toward several critical areas for future research in healthcare accessibility, with direct applications to specialized treatment access challenges.The development of comprehensive accessibility indices that integrate geographic, socioeconomic, and system-level factors becomes increasingly crucial for conditions requiring complex, ongoing treatment regimens. The methodological frameworks demonstrated in this collection provide essential building blocks for creating predictive models that can identify patients at risk of treatment discontinuation and guide targeted intervention strategies.Furthermore, the research highlights the importance of real-time monitoring systems that can track accessibility patterns and identify emerging barriers to care. The integration of social media analytics, demonstrated by [Chen et al.], with geospatial analysis approaches offers promising directions for developing systems that monitor healthcare accessibility in real time.},

  abstract     = {ObjectiveLower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a serious health problem, causing local discomfort and hindering walking. It can lead to severe complications, including pulmonary embolism, chronic post-thrombotic syndrome, and limb amputation, posing risks of death or severe disability. This study aims to develop a diagnostic model for DVT using routine blood analysis and evaluate its effectiveness in early diagnosis.MethodsThis study retrospectively analyzed patient medical records from January 2022 to June 2023, including 658 DVT patients (case group) and 1,418 healthy subjects (control group). SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was employed for feature selection to identify key blood indices significantly impacting DVT risk prediction. Based on the selected features, six machine learning models were constructed: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC).ResultsSHAP analysis identified ten key blood routine indices. The six models constructed using these indices demonstrated strong predictive performance, with AUC values exceeding 0.8, accuracy above 70%, and sensitivity and specificity over 70%. Notably, the RF model exhibited superior performance in assessing the risk of DVT.ConclusionsOur study successfully developed machine learning models for predicting DVT risk using routine blood tests. These models achieved high predictive performance, suggesting their potential for early DVT diagnosis without additional medical burden on patients. Future research will focus on further validation and refinement of these models to enhance their clinical applicability.},
