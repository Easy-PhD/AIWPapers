  abstract     = {IntroductionSocially Assistive Robots (SARs) hold promise for augmenting speech-language therapy by addressing high caseloads and enhancing child engagement. However, many implementations remain misaligned with clinician practices and overlook expressive strategies central to speech-language pathology.MethodsWe conducted a 4-week Asynchronous Remote Community (ARC) study with thirteen licensed speech-language pathologists (SLPs). Participants engaged in weekly activities and asynchronous discussions, contributing reflective insights on emotional expression, domain-specific needs, and potential roles for SARs. The ARC format supported distributed, flexible engagement and facilitated iterative co-design through longitudinal peer dialogue. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis to identify emerging patterns.ResultsAnalysis revealed five clinician-driven design considerations for SARs: (1) the need for expressive and multi-modal communication; (2) customization of behaviors to accommodate sensory and developmental profiles; (3) adaptability of roles across therapy contexts; (4) ethical concerns surrounding overuse and fears of clinician replacement; and (5) opportunities for data tracking and personalization.DiscussionFindings highlight clinician-informed design implications that can guide the development of socially intelligent, adaptable, and ethically grounded SARs. The ARC approach proved a viable co-design framework, enabling deeper reflection and peer-driven requirements than traditional short-term methods. This work bridges the gap between robotic capabilities and clinical expectations, underscoring the importance of embedding clinician expertise in SAR design to foster meaningful integration into speech-language interventions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we present an approach to cluster interaction forms in industrial human–robot co-work using spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks (STGCNs). Humans will increasingly work with robots in the future, whereas previously, humans worked side by side, hand in hand, or alone. The growing frequency of robotic and human–robot co-working applications and the requirement to increase flexibility affect the variety and variability of interactions between humans and robots, which can be observed at production workplaces. In this paper, we investigate the variety and variability of human–robot interactions in industrial co-work scenarios where full automation is impractical. To address the challenges of interaction modeling and clustering, we present an approach that utilizes STGCNs for interaction clustering. Data were collected from 12 realistic human–robot co-work scenarios using a high-accuracy tracking system. The approach identified 10 distinct interaction forms, revealing more granular interaction patterns than established taxonomies. These results support continuous, data-driven analysis of human–robot behavior and contribute to the development of more flexible, human-centered systems that are aligned with Industry 5.0.},
