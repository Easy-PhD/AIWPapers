  abstract     = {Abstract Recent advances in machine learning, deep learning, and large language models enable the design of refined and complex algorithms to detect and prevent cybersecurity attacks. In this paper, we present a hybrid fusion approach combining Generative AI, ADASYN, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and boosting algorithms to detect DDoS attacks. RFE was employed to optimize feature selection, enhancing model interpretability and performance by reducing dimensionality. The proposed model leverages (1) Packet Capture (pcap) data generated from virtual networks as real data, (2) synthetic data generated by the Synthetic Data Vault, (3) ADASYN to balance the data, and (4) boosting algorithms for training and testing. The results obtained from this hybrid-fusion model provided an accuracy of 97â€“98%, indicating that the model is robust and reliable. Cross-validation of the model further validated the results},

  abstract     = {Abstract Congenital heart defects (CHD) are heart malformations present at birth, affecting heart function and circulation, and are a leading cause of infant mortality. CHD can result from genetic, environmental, and maternal health factors, making early detection essential. Early diagnosis allows for timely intervention, reducing risks like heart failure or stroke. In countries like Egypt, CHD often remains undiagnosed due to limited healthcare resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) can improve early detection by analyzing risk factors. This study presents a predictive model for CHD using maternal and paternal health factors. Data was collected from 571 families: 260 with a CHD-affected child and 311 with healthy children. After preprocessing the data, ten machine learning models were tested, including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and MLP Classifier. RF achieved the highest accuracy at 97.37%, followed by DT at 96.49%, and MLP at 92.96%. The results show AI's potential in predicting CHD, supporting early diagnosis and improving infant outcomes.},
