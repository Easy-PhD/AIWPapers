  abstract     = {Abstract Face super-resolution generates high-resolution face images from low-resolution inputs, supporting face recognition in challenging environments. While deep learning methods, like Stable Diffusion and origin Transformer-based framework, have advanced super-resolution, they require heavy computation, making them difficult for tasks like face recognition. However, recognition accuracy only needs images of size 112x112, reducing the necessity for extremely large outputs. Existing methods often rely on convolutional attention, limiting receptive fields and performance. To address this, we propose SETFSR, a Semantically Guided Efficient Attention Transformer Face Super-Resolution. Our model leverages efficient self-attention for global feature extraction and incorporates face parsing constraints for structural accuracy. Experiments on Helen, CelebA, and FFHQ datasets show that SETFSR outperforms state-of-the-art models in PSNR, SSIM, and identity preservation.},

This study focuses on a two-degree-of-freedom manipulator, developing a mechanical dynamics model and implementing a parallel Linear Active Disturbance Rejection Controller (LADRC) for joint control. To enhance robustness and responsiveness, a hybrid adaptive control method is introduced, integrating adaptive laws (AL) for online tuning of parameters and offline optimization using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This improves tracking control efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, offline reinforcement learning refines parameters without adding real-time computational demands. Finally, semantic web principles ensure interpretability and transparency of the control flow. Compared to traditional LADRC, the proposed method shows superior anti-interference capabilities and dynamic performance.},

A GSR model for the identification of suboptimal operating conditions of yield and quality based on random forest classification was established. The experimental results demonstrate that the method is capable of rapidly and accurately identifying the production and quality of the calcining kiln. The identification accuracy of the yield and quality of the suboptimal operating conditions is 99.82% and 99.18% respectively. In the production process, real-time identification of operating parameters enables rapid detection of suboptimal operating conditions in yield and quality, providing the basis for optimal regulation and control, which in turn can improve production efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Abstract A brain tumor is one of the most prevalent causes of cancer death. The best strategy is the timely treatment of brain tumors in their early detection. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a standard non-invasive method to detect brain tumors. For early detection and better patient survival through MRI scans, the diagnosis needs a high level of knowledge in the radiological and neurological domains to identify the cancers. Researchers have suggested various brain cancer detection techniques. However, most existing automatic cancer detection approaches suffer from poor accuracy and low detection rates. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) using deep feature extraction and adaptive Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask-RCNNs) model for brain tumor detection and classification method to overcome these issues. The experimental findings on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the planned model is highly effective, with 99.64% accuracy, 95.93% precision, 95.39% recall, and 95.67% F1-score.},

However, trust issues can undermine users' willingness to collaborate, reduce the frequency of interaction and collaboration efficiency. This paper introduces a super node-based trust management model designed to enhance semantic networks by linking nodes through trust relationships. The model exploits the synergistic incentives of similar interest behaviours to achieve a steady construction of trust relationships. We propose a similarity filtering algorithm that calculates the similarity to filter out false, misleading, or unfair information effectively. Through simulations, we compare our model with RRGRET, Surework, and community-based approaches, and the results show that our model has good network properties, while also resisting multiple malicious attacks and guaranteeing collaboration success.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel ghosting-free image fusion method using a dual gain video stream setup on an FPGA. IMX662 image sensor is employed, which simultaneously captures both HCG and LCG images with the same exposure time, enabling efficient HDR image synthesis. The proposed method directly addresses the source of the problem, eliminating the need for post-processing steps, thereby preserving algorithmic simplicity. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method not only removes ghosting by 100% but also processes data on an FPGA 98.79% faster than traditional software-based HDR fusion techniques, enabling real-time video stream processing. This dual gain, ghosting-free fusion algorithm demonstrates promising potential for use in high-speed photography and surveillance.},

When many consumers need to rent a car, they hope to use it conveniently and quickly. They also need to book parking spaces along the way and have corresponding insurance services. However, there is a lack of effective integration between the existing car rental system and reserved parking spaces. As a result, users often need to spend extra time and energy looking for parking spaces when using car rental services, and the insurance policies generated by temporary insurance services are difficult to cover at the same time. To address these issues, this study proposed an integrated car rental service platform based on blockchain technology and the Interplanetary File System. This platform consolidates transaction information among various stakeholders in the car rental service. It also preserves the consumer's complete rental order information and status, uses the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to privately generate a shared key.},

However, the sensitivity and privacy of data make data sharing for analysis challenging. Current systems typically rely on local data, making it difficult to handle cross-institutional data or complex fraudulent activities. To address this issue, we propose a financial risk control model based on the Federated Semantic Web (FSW). This model deploys a federated learning framework between banks, allowing data to be stored independently, thus ensuring privacy protection. The model automatically selects and scores risk features from transaction data using a multi-perspective topological graph, and assigns the final risk labels via a weighted voting mechanism. The central model updates and redistributes the global model based on parameters shared by local models through the federated averaging algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively identifies fraudulent transactions and predicts credit risk, meets security standards, and improves accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Abstract In multi-UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC), insufficient consideration of collaborative computation in inter-UAV communication can significantly reduce computational service capabilities. For this problem, we present a multi-UAV-assisted MEC offloading optimization model that jointly optimizes task offloading decision, UAV resource allocation, UAV trajectories and establish collaborative computation through inter-UAV communication. First, to solve the multi-UAV-assisted MEC offloading optimization issue, we define a weighted utility function that balances delay and energy consumption. Then, to tackle the continuous nature of the computation-offloading problem and the coexistence of discrete and continuous variables, the PPO algorithm is enhanced by integrating an average reward objective function and a hybrid action generation offloading mechanism. Finally, we propose a multi-UAV-assisted MEC computing offloading optimization method to improve the utility function. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly enhances system utility.},

The proposed DBSCAN++ based aiNet clustering algorithm (D-aiNet) is firstly used for clustering the training samples on the extracted network traffic, and then generates a Self Set (Ss) and an Antibody Set (As). In the testing phase, an Immune Network based anomaly detection model (INAD) is employed to match network traffic samples from the selected dataset with antibodies of the Antibody Set (As) in order to detect APT attacks. To validate the effectiveness of UADDN, experimental studies were conducted using the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset. Compared with UADAIN, and the other detection methods based on K-means clustering, aiNet-HC clustering, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UADDN shows superior performance in detecting APT attacks.},

To address this, we propose the Semantic Web-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning-based Urban Planning Optimization Model (SWRL-UPOM). Integrating Semantic Web technologies with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Multimodal Graph Convolutional Network (STAMFGCN) and Spatio-Temporal Gated Hierarchical Attention LSTM (STGHALSTM), SWRL-UPOM uses reinforcement learning to optimize strategies dynamically. STAMFGCN extracts complex inter-regional relationships from multimodal data, while STGHALSTM models and predicts spatiotemporal pollution evolution. Leveraging Semantic Web for structured data and reasoning, the RL framework iteratively updates strategies based on predicted pollution trends. Experiments show SWRL-UPOM outperforms traditional methods in pollution prediction, strategy optimization, and adaptability to dynamic changes.},

Additionally, SWDESA splits the feature map and compresses its spatial dimensions through linear mapping, reducing the computational burden. The model introduces separation and restoration self-attention to aggregate spatial and channel information, with the computational cost being linearly related to the window size. By utilizing semantic information to guide the separation and restoration self-attention in establishing long-range relationships, the model optimizes semantic perception and enhances information aggregation. Multi-branch parallel separable convolutions such as a feed-forward network are introduced to extract fine-grained textures of the main objects and macro features of the background selectively. Experimental results on the DIV2K dataset show that SWDESA model achieved a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 68.91 and a structural similarity index of 68.84, achieving the best performance.},

However, it is a challenging task to complete due to the presence of false positives and a lack of contextual awareness. In this context, this paper presents a fall detection model that integrates You Only Look Once11—for real-time object detection—with semantic web technologies for intelligent decision-making. The semantic knowledge graph is used to establish a relation between the You Only Look Once11 results and the fall events. Experimental evaluation of the proposed model presents an mAP@0.5 of 0.806, validating the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-driven visual processing combined with semantic knowledge representation for enhanced fall detection in robotic systems.},

This study explores the role of semantic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven knowledge networks in enhancing linguistic competence within educational management. By leveraging AI's semantic capabilities, such networks organize, analyze, and visualize linguistic data to support deeper knowledge sharing and language development. This interdisciplinary research empirically investigates the approach. A semester-long intervention involved 69 Chinese junior students majoring in linguistics, who engaged with an AI-assisted education management system equipped with tools, such as Gephi, WORDij, and mathematical software. Triangulated data from linguistic assessments, structured interviews, and semantic network analysis demonstrates notable improvements in students' language proficiency and conceptual understanding. The findings suggest that semantic AI-driven knowledge networks hold significant potential in advancing linguistic competence and optimizing educational management practices.},

Despite their widespread use in intrusion detection against DDoS attacks, machine learning methods still suffer accuracy degradation due to inadequate data pre-processing and computational inefficiency. This study combined a fine-tuned extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model with correlation-based feature selection—for efficient feature selection—to effectively maximize detection accuracy while lowering computing overhead. Both correlation-based feature selection and XGBoost contribute to boosting the final model's efficiency. To evaluate the proposed model, different metrics were employed over three DDoS data sets, considering both binary and multi-classification scenarios. Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed XGBoost achieves highly competitive accuracy. For the Network Security Laboratory–Knowledge Discovery Databases data set, University of New South Wales–Network Behavior15 data set, and Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity–Intrusion Detection System–2017 data set, the model secures 0.995, 1.000, and 0.999 and 0.996, 0.885, 0.998 for binary and multi-classification, respectively, outperforming its rival models.},

The performance of the proposed framework was tested using predefined queries processed on LinkedGeoData datasets. Benchmark comparisons were made to evaluate WasGeo against Ontop and GeoSPARQL. The proposed framework achieved a reasoning accuracy of 95%, processed up to 1 million Resource Description Framework triples, and demonstrated execution times ranging from 0.3 to 7.7 seconds. Comparative benchmarks show that WasGeo provides greater reasoning depth than GeoSPARQL and Ontop, while maintaining better balance between scalability and analytical power. These results position WasGeo as a robust and practical framework for advanced semantic geospatial querying, although future enhancements are needed for scalability.},

Subsequently, they selected three state-of-the-art machine-learning models, including ACmix, demonstrating the highest accuracy in single-model trials for pairwise combinations. They introduce the ACL method to classify fraudulent URLs based on these insights. The experiments show that the Semantic-Aware Fusion Model model surpasses the other selected baselines with a maximum accuracy of 97.6% on the comprehensive dataset.

Drawing on our experience developing a visual ML platform that uses an informal semantic representation approach, we propose improvements that leverage semantic representations—such as clearer workflow segmentation, interactive tutorials based on intuitive conceptual definitions, visual aids, and structured methodological checklists. By defining concepts and relationships through semantically inspired visual structures, these enhancements aim to improve user understanding, AI reliability, and research quality in medical contexts.
