  abstract     = {A new surveillance-evasion differential game is posed and solved in which an agile pursuer (the prying pedestrian) seeks to remain within a given surveillance range of a less agile evader that aims to escape. In contrast to previous surveillance-evasion games, the pursuer is agile in the sense of being able to instantaneously change the direction of its velocity vector, while the evader is constrained to have a finite maximum turn rate. Both the game of kind, concerned with conditions under which the evader can escape, and the game of degree, concerned with the evader seeking to minimize the escape time while the pursuer seeks to maximize it, are considered. The game-of-degree solution is surprisingly complex compared to solutions to analogous pursuit-evasion games with an agile pursuer because it exhibits dependence on the ratio of the pursuer’s speed to the evader’s speed. It is, however, surprisingly simple compared to solutions to classic surveillance-evasion games with a turn-limited pursuer.},

  abstract     = {Communication between satellites is an important component of collision-free navigation operations. The work in this paper is motivated by the premise that each satellite has more reliable knowledge of its own state compared to its direct observations of others. The authors aim to leverage this shared, enhanced information among satellites to enable autonomous coordination and collision avoidance. They rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to model multiple autonomous satellites interacting in a shared environment with limited observation and communication ranges. First they demonstrate the effectiveness of their method against comparable MARL algorithms. To address the computational expense of MARL, they investigate the effectiveness of transferring a model trained on a ground environment to one trained in space. Despite the fact the two environments have very different dynamics, they show that the transfer learning model outperforms a model that is trained directly on the space environment. Furthermore, even in the presence of additional perturbations, the authors’ transfer learning model is able to accelerate training and achieve comparable rewards. With the effectiveness of their method explored, they then evaluate the benefits of information sharing by studying collision rates and path planning. Their results indicate that sharing maneuver information leads to lower collision rates and more efficient path planning.},

  abstract     = {Center manifold theory describes the phase flow near collinear libration points as a combination of two harmonic oscillations and one hyperbolic motion, the latter driving exponential spacecraft divergence. The Floquet modes approach (FMA), based on Floquet theory, is widely studied but suffers from inefficiency due to its inability to suppress nondivergent components (NDCs) beyond the unstable motion. To overcome this limitation, we propose an improved FMA strategy that leverages the collateral effect of NDCs—a key factor in traditional FMA failures yet exploitable for enhanced control. First, a predictor–corrector algorithm computes a correction factor to refine unstable mode estimation, accounting for unmodeled nonlinearities. Next, the most critical NDC is identified and suppressed, the timing of the next maneuver is predicted, and a maneuver overshoot factor is introduced to regulate excessive NDCs. By strategically selecting maneuver types, our approach ensures effective suppression. Finally, three numerical simulations validate the method’s effectiveness, versatility, and robustness.},

  abstract     = {This paper develops the mathematical framework to use higher-order state transition tensor (STT) approximations of nonlinear dynamics to design impulsive spacecraft maneuvers incorporating the effects of state uncertainty. Several semi-analytic formulations are derived strictly as a function of a reference STT expansion, including minimum-energy, minimum-covariance, and maximum-covariance cost functions; mean state constraints; state chance constraints; and control-linear maneuver execution errors. Analytical gradients are derived for most of the formulations, which can be used to speed up optimization procedures developed with these equations. A tractable approximation of the nonlinear covariance propagation equations is also derived to further speed up these calculations. Example applications for each of the formulations are provided for a multi-impulse, highly nonlinear transfer in the Earth–moon system. The proposed methodology can be used to efficiently compute a variety of maneuvers accounting for the effects of spacecraft state uncertainty using a single STT expansion. This can enable more flexible and rapid maneuver planning in reaction to changing mission priorities, navigation errors, and maneuver execution errors.},

  abstract     = {Aerocapture leverages atmospheric drag to convert a spacecraft’s hyperbolic trajectory into a bound orbit. For some aerocapture missions, heating due to the radiation of high-temperature gases in the shock layer can be much larger than the heat due to convection. This paper provides analytical proof and numerical validation that radiative heat load is minimized by the same trajectory that minimizes the final : a single switch bang-bang trajectory, starting with lift-up. The proof is general and is valid for several formulations of radiative heat flux; further, the same proof can be used to conclude that convective heat load, computed according to many of the available formulations, is instead maximized by that trajectory. Further, a novel guidance that plans a bang-bang trajectory with constraints in the attitude kinematics is introduced. While achieving performance similar to that of the current state-of-the-art, the inclusion of constraints in attitude kinematics allows for much less tuning. Finally, a lateral guidance that makes use of information on the final inclination of the predicted trajectory is introduced. Such guidance allows for very high accuracy in the inclination requirements with only two reversals by requiring a single parameter to be tuned.},

In Auto-SCvx, the authors solve a sequence of convex subproblems until convergence to a solution of the original nonconvex problem. This method iteratively optimizes dual variables in closed form in order to update the penalty hyperparameters used in the primal variable updates. A benefit of this method is that it is autotuning and requires no hand tuning by the user with respect to the constraint penalty weights. Several example hypersonic reentry problems are posed and solved using this method, and comparative studies are conducted against current methods. In these numerical studies, our algorithm demonstrates equal and often improved performance while not requiring hand tuning of penalty hyperparameters.},

  abstract     = {Autonomous on-orbit assembly operations are usually translated into complex optimal control problems requiring advanced methods to solve. Solved through either direct methods or indirect methods, these optimal control problems are known to be highly sensitive to the initial guess provided to the solver. This paper proposes an algorithm to reduce the problem’s sensitivity to the initial guess by integrating the continuation method and the notion of reinforcement learning. To this end, a continuation space is formed from a trivial problem with a known solution to the desired optimal control problem. A set of continuation parameters, selected from the state, control, or constraint variables, forms the basis for this continuation space. Finding a suitable continuation path is problematic since it requires a comprehensive search algorithm that considers several factors, such as the choice of continuation parameters and continuation steps for each parameter, to find an appropriate path. To search for this path, a reinforcement learning search agent was proposed based on the Sarsa method to traverse the continuation space in real-time for a continuation trajectory satisfying some desired criteria. Numerical experiments were conducted for a series of autonomous on-orbit assembly operations using robotic spacecraft to demonstrate the capability of the proposed technique. Various simulations with different reward functions showed that the shape and size of the objects in the assembly environment affect the solver’s performance.},
