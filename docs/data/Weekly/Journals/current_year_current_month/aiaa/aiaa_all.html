  abstract     = {Ground vibration tests are conducted on spacecraft equipment prelaunch to replicate the severe vibration loads encountered during rocket liftoff. Given strict reliability requirements, spacecraft equipment must be assessed for safety before being subjected to these destructive loads. Traditional finite-element simulations and other physical modeling techniques face difficulties in quantitatively analyzing nonlinear dynamic behaviors, such as the frequency-drift phenomenon during vibration. This study aimed to establish a data-driven dynamic modeling approach for spacecraft equipment design assessment, utilizing training data from nondestructive vibration tests. However, the training data may have low signal-to-noise ratios, leading to considerable prediction errors in the data-driven dynamics model. The challenge in this study was determining how to ensure that the excitation amplitude of nondestructive vibration tests can be kept at a minimum while fully exciting the system’s dynamic characteristics. To address this challenge, a novel data-driven dynamic modeling method was developed using model frequency analysis to assess whether the system was sufficiently stimulated. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo simulation was used to quantify the uncertainty of the model frequency caused by noise. Finally, the proposed data-driven modeling method was validated through its application to complex spacecraft equipment, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  abstract     = {To improve the deployed stiffness and mass efficiency of pretensioned spacecraft structures, the efficacy of cable-stayed configurations is analyzed in this paper. The reference structure is a deployable array wing that supports a series of radio frequency panels for space-based antenna applications, and it is designed to be z-folded under stowage. Due to the significant mass of the panels and the large span of the array wing, the entire structure is susceptible to low-frequency excitation. Lightweight pretensioned cables that elastically support and stiffen the array along its span are found to drastically raise its fundamental frequency and critical buckling load. An analytical model that is validated by finite element simulations is used to predict the vibration and buckling modes of the constituent structures for both the reference and cable-stayed architectures. A parametric analysis then optimizes the cross section of the load-bearing members, cable attachment points, and the number of cables to maximize the fundamental frequency for the structural systems. These optimal cable-stayed forms are compared against the reference design, and their effectiveness is demonstrated with a 157% and 255% increase in fundamental frequency for one and two cables, respectively.},

This paper describes a recently developed numerical technique to simulate the fluid/structure interaction between the hypersonic stream and the flexible structure of the HIAD. The authors do so by using a front-tracking/shock-fitting technique that models both the bow shock and the thin membrane of the HIAD as double-sided surfaces of negligible thickness. Shock motion is governed by the Rankine–Hugoniot jump relations, whereas a nonlinear membrane model is used to simulate the deformation of the HIAD under the combined effect of the inflation and aerodynamic pressure. Local remeshing is used to ensure that the surface triangulations used to geometrically describe both the material interfaces and the bow shock are conforming with the background tetrahedral grid that fills the fluid domain. The computational examples cover three different HIADs of increasing geometrical complexity. We also show that fitting the bow shock allows to preserve the design order of the spatial discretization scheme in the entire shock-downstream region.},

  abstract     = {While particle-laden flows are of great interest for a wide variety of applications, accurately accounting for particle–particle collisions can be challenging. In this work, three particle collision strategies based on the hard-sphere paradigm (event-driven (EDHS), time-driven (TDHS), and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)) are considered in order to gain insight into which method is best suited for use in aerospace applications. First, a spatially homogeneous 0-D setup was investigated in the kinetic regime to leverage theoretical results from kinetic theory. While the DSMC method showed excellent agreement with the theoretical kinetic collision rate, both the EDHS and TDHS methods displayed inaccurate collision rates due to an artificially increased particle volume fraction from the use of simulated particle bundles. Next, a particle-laden nozzle setup was considered using the Dust Simulation and Tracking plug-in for the US3D unstructured finite-volume CFD solver. Comparisons of the particle-induced surface erosion on the test article were made with both elastic and inelastic particle collision parameters using the DSMC and TDHS methods. Both the TDHS and DSMC methods agreed extremely well for both the elastic and inelastic setups, although there is a slight discrepancy in the results for the inelastic comparison. Based on the overall results of the two studies in this work, the DSMC method was determined to be the most suitable for aerospace applications (i.e., cases with low volume fractions) because of its accuracy, efficiency, ability to handle arbitrary particle weights, and ease of implementation on parallel architecture.},

  abstract     = {Ingenuity has sustained an astonishing 72 flights on Mars. The small helicopter proved that nonterrestrial powered flight is possible, even on planets with thin atmospheres. Future planetary rotorcraft will be bigger and heavier to accomplish new scientific and exploratory goals. For example, the Dragonfly mission will send a rotorcraft the size of a regular car to explore Titan. However, on dusty planets, the increase in rotor thrust due to increased weight poses a potential challenge. Dust clouds could form during takeoff and landing due to rotor wash, a phenomenon referred to as brownout. This work evaluates the effectiveness of existing numerical simulation models in predicting the severity of this phenomenon for planetary rotorcraft. We compare the output of a CFD-based dust mobilization model with Ingenuity flight data gathered using image processing techniques. The simulation results suggest that the sensitivity of the wall friction velocity to the rotorcraft height may be lower than previously assessed. We further evaluate the sensitivity of the total mass of mobilized dust to other model parameters such as the sandblasting efficiency and the saltation threshold velocity. Finally, we discuss the limitations of this comparison due to uncertainty in both the observational and the numerical model.},

A novel reaction kinetic mechanism is introduced for NEPE propellant reactions, integrating temperature-dependent condensed phase kinetics with semiglobal kinetic submodels to capture gas-phase reaction intricacies. The refined propellant microstructure is incorporated into the macroscale model, enhancing our understanding of the interaction between turbulent flow and reactive flow. The pressure oscillation is modeled as a sine form, providing a structured approach to study oscillations. This research examines transient flame evolution, dynamic temperature changes near the propellant surface, and unstable gas flow characteristics.

  abstract     = {This paper investigates a throat compensation design method applied to the large-scale scramjet combustor based on the scale effect of supersonic combustion under a Mach 2.52 inflow. The variation in the relative thickness of the boundary layer at the throat of different-scale combustors would lead to the difference in the actual effective flow area. To compensate for the changes in the effective flow area caused by the scale effect in combustors, the throat compensation theory was derived, and the compensation design method was established. By designing three combustors with different geometric structures, the small-scale, large-scale, and large-scale combustors with throat compensation were tested and compared. The results indicate that the throat geometry setting has a significant impact on the scale effect of the scramjet combustor, and this impact is closely related to the combustion modes. In the Scram and Dual modes, the throat compensation can rectify the out-of-design proportional scale-up of the effective flow area through effective geometric configuration, which ensures the combustion characteristic does not deviate due to scale variation. However, in the Ram mode, the throat compensation presents an overcompensating effect because the nonproportional variation of boundary-layer thickness with the combustor scale has little effect on combustion.},

The inflow parameters Mach number, stagnation temperature, total pressure, and global equivalence ratio were 2.92, 1650 K, 2.6 MPa, and 0.25, respectively. Shock wave generators with different blockage ratios and dimensionless distances from the strut were used to enhance flame stabilization. On the premise of avoiding blockages, a larger blockage ratio can promote the expansion of the reaction zone and improve the flame stabilization ability. Increasing the dimensionless distance can provide more space for the expansion of the reaction zone. A long dimensionless distance requires a larger blockage ratio to achieve flame stabilization. Three-dimensional simulations near the flame stability limit showed that the shock wave generators improve flame stabilization characteristics by generating adverse pressure gradients, low-speed regions, and accumulating fuel. The size of the recirculation zone downstream of the strut expands under the adverse pressure gradient. Besides, the expansion fan downstream of the shock wave generator suppresses the combustion process, which leads to the flame discontinuity phenomenon. As a result, the combustor with and has the largest recirculation zone and strongest combustion (combustion ).},

Measurements are reported for Mach 8 and 14 pure-nitrogen flows. The fs CARS instrument includes a 100 fs pump/Stokes pulse and a spectrally narrow probe pulse from a second harmonic bandwidth compressor. Important experimental considerations such as limits on the pump/Stokes pulse energy are discussed. The fs CARS focusing and collimating optics are mounted on a two-axis translation stage system to scan the measurement location during a 30 second wind tunnel run. Single-laser-shot rotational CARS spectra are recorded at the laser repetition rate of 1 kHz in the wind tunnel freestream and near simple cone models. Spectral fitting is used to determine quantitative gas temperatures. Freestream temperatures at Mach 8 and 14 spanned ranges of 40–75 and 35–50 K, respectively, depending on tunnel operating conditions. Temperature variations across the central 100 mm span of the wind tunnel were quantified. Measured temperature jumps across conical bow shocks from various models varied by less than 1% from predicted values. Hypersonic boundary layer measurements were demonstrated. These measurements illustrate the utility and robustness of this instrument for the study of complex fluid flow phenomena in challenging ground test facilities.},

The present study examines the control effect of streaks on the first-mode oblique breakdown in a high-speed boundary layer at Mach 4.5 using direct numerical simulation and stability analysis. The results show significant differences in control mechanisms. Firstly, the mean-flow distortion induced by streaks in the current study exerts a destabilizing effect on the oblique wave, in contrast to the suppression of the oblique mode reported in earlier work. Secondly, the control modes analyzed here, with a spanwise wavenumber twice that of the fundamental oblique wave, can delay the onset of oblique breakdown. When the spanwise wavenumber exceeds 2.0, the control mode results in a higher amplification rate of the fundamental oblique mode in the present study, whereas it was found to suppress the oblique wave in previous studies.

  abstract     = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to control the flow separation induced by the shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SBLI) for the first time in a laminar compression ramp configuration simulated via OpenFOAM. The wall pressure coefficient serves as the observed state, while the agent outputs microjet actuation as the corresponding action. The wall skin friction coefficient, indicating the extent of SBLI-induced flow separation, is used as the reward to guide the learning process. Under both constant and varying incoming Mach number conditions, a converged controlled model can be obtained through the repeated DRL training, resulting in a 40% reduction in the separation area. The suppression of the separated shear layer is owing to the weakening of the separation shock and the energizing of the local boundary layer under the DRL control. To reduce the computational costs of CFD simulations, a long short-term memory network is employed as a surrogate model for the environment in DRL. This model-based approach reduces overall training time by nearly 60% and at the same time achieves accuracy comparable to the model-free method that only interacts with the CFD environment. The present study opens a gateway to the closed-loop control of SBLI using state-of-the-art DRL.},

In this study, we use a combination of linear stability theory (LST) and direct numerical simulations (DNSs) to examine perturbation growth on ogive-cylinder forebodies, relevant to modern hypersonic vehicles, focusing on the effect of nose bluntness. The spatial evolution of disturbances is first examined through the solution of a linear eigenvalue problem. As the ogive nose bluntness is increased, the first mode, which was unstable downstream for the sharp nose, moves upstream, and its oblique component displays higher instability. The LST predictions are used to inform DNS to examine the effect of amplitude on perturbation growth and modal characteristics. For small 2D perturbations, second-mode growth with DNS yields similar results as LST for all bluntness cases examined, suggesting that the streamwise gradients inherent to ogive forebodies have relatively little effect on this behavior. When the forcing is azimuthally localized, the oblique nature associated with low-frequency perturbations becomes apparent, analogous to the first mode. These are, however, inhibited when the forcing is azimuthally coherent. Furthermore, at higher amplitudes, nonlinear interactions appear among unstable modes, providing insights into the different interactions governing transition in such nose geometries.},

  abstract     = {Laminar-to-turbulent boundary-layer transition leads to increased friction and aerodynamic heating in hypersonic vehicles. This study proposes a novel methodology to control transition in hypersonic wall-bounded flows by introducing spanwise nonuniform temperature surface distributions. The proposed control mechanism modulates the spanwise uniform boundary-layer flow through the generation of spanwise-periodic streamwise-elongated streaks. First, direct numerical simulations are performed at Mach 6 with imposed spanwise nonuniform wall temperature variations. The wall-prescribed temperature conditions successfully generate streaks of sufficient amplitude that suppress transitional instabilities. Second, a wind-tunnel experimental implementation of a steady-state temperature control strategy is proposed, incorporating local cooling below a wall of finite thickness. A thermal model is employed to predict the surface temperature with varying cooling temperature inputs below the finite-thickness wall at Mach 6. The thermal analysis validates the methodology to achieve spanwise nonuniform temperature distributions and emphasizes the sensitivity of temperature input and wall-thickness variations. Lastly, to guide future experimental ground tests, restricted to short test duration, prototype models are proposed in order to regulate the local surface temperature by altering the local heat flux and diffusion within the wall. Specifically, dissimilar materials and thin wall structures are employed to achieve varying levels of heat diffusion and heat flux, respectively. Implementing these approaches generates a higher sensitivity to local surface temperature, thus enabling the passive achievement of spanwise nonuniform temperature distributions, as demonstrated by the thermal model.},

The dynamics are examined through the application of spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) to elicit coherent structure and linear resolvent analysis to reveal forcing-response characteristics. SPOD of a large-eddy simulation identifies Kelvin–Helmholtz coherent structures at the dominating frequency in the splitter plate shear layer region, formed by mixing core Mach 1.6 and bypass Mach 1.0 streams. Resolvent analysis leverages the time-averaged flowfield on the center plane with discounting to capture flow response over a finite time window, addressing base flow instabilities. The optimal and first suboptimal resolvent energy amplifications peak near the dominant frequency for a wide range of frequencies and spanwise wavenumbers. Comparing the resolvent and SPOD results, we find that the linear operator overoptimizes the optimal mechanism, and the suboptimal mode instead is more aligned with the leading SPOD mode. An intriguing shift phenomenon where the optimal and suboptimal gain distributions crossover is observed; these events are associated with receptive regions in the different shear layers. Subsequent input–output analyses with state-variable and spatial restrictions provide insights into componentwise amplification of the jet flow response, thus providing direction for tailored practical flow control.},

Standard continuum models such as the Navier–Stokes equations are inaccurate for these flows, and molecular models can be inefficient due to the large number of computational particles required at moderately high densities. We explore computational modeling of transition-continuum flows using a second-order constitutive theory that provides closures for the terms representing the molecular transport of momentum and energy. We optimize the second-order model parameters for one-dimensional viscous shocks using an adjoint-based optimization method, with the objective function comprising the primitive flow variables. Target data is obtained from moments of distribution functions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation. We compare results using optimized second-order models, the unoptimized second-order model, and the first-order Navier–Stokes model for Mach numbers and observe improvements to the shock profiles and shock thickness calculations. We validate the optimized models by comparing the predicted viscous stress and heat flux, which are not included in the objective function, to those obtained by integrating the distribution function. The close match to these moments indicates that the satisfactory performance of the optimized second-order models is consistent with the nonequilibrium flow physics.},

Neglecting nonlinear terms, the acoustic field is represented either by acoustic pressure or velocity potential, and determined through time-domain and frequency-domain boundary element method approaches. In particular, a novel frequency-domain solution algorithm is proposed, which is capable of providing accurate predictions of the multiharmonic scattered field occurring in the presence of deforming scatterers. It is suitable for the analysis of problems involving high-frequency signals for which time-domain solvers may suffer from numerical inaccuracies that make their predictions unreliable. For low-frequency incident waves, the time-domain and frequency-domain solution approaches are successfully correlated. Furthermore, the proposed solution method is validated through comparison against analytical results concerning both rigid and pulsating spherical scatterers. Finally, the multiharmonic frequency-domain solver is applied to examine the effect of body deformation on the directivity pattern of the multiple-tone, scattered noise.},

However, existing systems are active in that they rely on sensors and actuators to function, which adds weight and complexity. This work demonstrates a passively actuated load alleviation spoiler concept. This spoiler utilizes a nonlinear structure to gather and store strain energy from the wingbox, which is then rapidly released via a structural instability to deploy a leading-edge tab. The deployment of this tab locally stalls the wing, thus reducing its lift coefficient . Wind tunnel testing is used to investigate the performance of the device. It is found that the spoiler is capable of deploying and reducing within a few convective time units across a range of flow speeds and angles of attack. Fluid loads have been observed to have a small but measurable adverse impact on the desired response of the spoiler. A reduced degree-of-freedom model is used to explain this phenomenon and to explore strategies for minimizing it. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a purely strain-actuated gust load alleviating control surface has been demonstrated experimentally.},

  abstract     = {In aircraft design, computational fluid dynamics plays an important role by providing invaluable insights into aerodynamic characteristics, facilitating enhancements in aircraft performance and efficiency. High-fidelity simulations based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations are essential to capture phenomena like shock waves and flow separation, particularly in the transonic regime. Due to the significant computational cost, conducting the numerous evaluations required to cover the complete flight envelope becomes impractical. Alternatively, leveraging machine learning to construct surrogate models provides approaches to approximate quantities of interest within the design space. However, since these models are not exact, incorporating a measure of model epistemic uncertainty is advantageous. The Bayesian paradigm offers a rigorous framework to train and analyze uncertainty-aware models. This study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Bayesian surrogate models, specifically Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, in predicting aerodynamic pressure distribution.

  abstract     = {The intrinsic high dimension of fluid dynamics is an inherent challenge to control of aerodynamic flows, and this is further complicated by a flow’s nonlinear response to strong disturbances. Deep reinforcement learning, which takes advantage of the exploratory aspects of reinforcement learning (RL) and the rich nonlinearity of a deep neural network, provides a promising approach to discover feasible control strategies. However, the typical model-free approach to reinforcement learning requires a significant amount of interaction between the flow environment and the RL agent during training, and this high training cost impedes its development and application. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach by incorporating a novel reduced-order model as a surrogate for the full environment. The model consists of a physics-augmented autoencoder, which compresses high-dimensional CFD flowfield snapshots into a three-dimensional latent space, and a latent dynamics model that is trained to accurately predict the long-time dynamics of trajectories in the latent space in response to action sequences. The accuracy and robustness of the model are demonstrated in the scenario of a pitching airfoil within a highly disturbed environment. Additionally, an application to a vertical-axis wind turbine in a disturbance-free environment is discussed in the Appendix. Based on the model trained in the pitching airfoil problem, we realize an MBRL strategy to mitigate lift variation during gust-airfoil encounters. We demonstrate that the policy learned in the reduced-order environment translates to an effective control strategy in the full CFD environment.},

  abstract     = {This study examines the reliability of a four-degree-of-freedom tilt-rotor model in the presence of random load, taking into account both cubic and freeplay nonlinearities. We discuss the Hopf bifurcation, multistability phenomena, and dynamic responses of the tilt-rotor. To analyze the reliability, we firstly develop a dimensionality reduction method based on diffusion approximation theory and perform the effects of stochasticity on the dynamic behaviors of the tilt-rotor model in detail. Several undesirable phenomena, which ultimately result in the failure of the rotor structure, are induced by random load. Subsequently, the reliability of the tilt-rotor model is defined and analyzed in accordance with the principles of damage accumulation. The impacts of varying parameters on reliability are examined. Additionally, a nonlinear energy sink (NES) is incorporated to mitigate the rotor vibration and damage accumulation in the tilt-rotor model, thereby enhancing the reliability. Reliability regions for the tilt-rotor model are presented to delineate the safety parameter range. The findings demonstrate that the incorporation of the NES markedly enhances the rotor model’s reliability. This research offers novel insights into the safety design of tilt-rotor aircraft.},

  abstract     = {The airwake of a simplified frigate model was measured using a synchronous, dual-plane, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) approach. Four pairs of orthogonal streamwise and spanwise plane combinations were surveyed over the flight deck. Synchronous PIV measurements allowed the three-dimensional airwake structure to be examined during two flow events likely relevant to rotorcraft operations. The flow events were the vertical oscillations of the reattaching shear layer aft of the superstructure and the bistability of the recirculation region. Conditional averages were obtained by averaging flow snapshots meeting specific criteria for each flow event of interest. The conditional averages showed that vertical flow oscillations of the shear layer were associated with large-scale, three-dimensional regions of organized fluctuations. These large scales encapsulated significant flow gradients across the streamwise and spanwise extent of the flight deck. The influence of the shear layer on the recirculation bubble and the flow angularity above the deck were also established. In addition, examining the bistable recirculation region through conditional averages revealed that each stable state influenced nearly the entire flowfield over the flight deck. Specifically, the location and size of the horseshoe and flight deck vortices were altered depending on the predominant stable state. The time dynamics of the airwake as the flow transitioned between the two stable states were subsequently established.},

  abstract     = {Critical loading, a key parameter for evaluating the limit of pressure rise in cascade, plays a fundamental role in triggering compressor stall. This work identifies specified vortex aggregation as the primary mechanism driving critical loading, which subsequently accelerates stall onset. Through 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) cascade and three-dimensional compressor simulations, the mechanisms of specified vortex aggregation are comprehensively analyzed. In the 2.5D cascade, an increased angle of attack alters the trajectory of shedding vortices, causing them to spread circumferentially and converge with local vortices in adjacent passages. This convergence results in increased upstream blockage and redistribution of mass flow pitchwise, ultimately forming a spike inception. To validate these findings in areal 3D rotating case, the stall process in a highly loaded compressor is also investigated. It is found that in 3D compressor vortex aggregation is inherently more complex due to three-dimensional and rotational effects. The simulation results reveal that the Coriolis effect significantly accelerates specified vortex aggregation, especially enhancing interactions between the leading-edge vortex and the tip leakage vortex. The interaction between the two vortexes, forming a more intricate vortex system, increases passage blockage from the midchord to the trailing edge, thereby accelerating the onset of stall eventually. This work offers new insight into the role of critical loading, Coriolis effect, and vortex dynamics in a compressor, providing an earlier local unsteady flow structure for analyzing stall precursors and assessing compressor flow instability.},

  abstract     = {Accurately determining experimental blade loading distributions is crucial for analyzing rotor performance but challenging due to the limitations of conventional measurement techniques. This paper presents a so-called wake-informed lifting line model that estimates blade loading distributions from phase-locked velocity measurements in the slipstream, eliminating the need for blade instrumentation. The model is evaluated against computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under both attached and separated flow conditions. For the attached flow condition, the model achieves excellent agreement with CFD, with errors in the peak value of thrust distribution below 1%. In the separated flow condition, the model captures radial gradients and the shape of the thrust distribution but exhibits discrepancies in absolute values, with a 10% error in the peak value. These differences arise from the inherent limitations of the potential flow model, the increased significance of drag, and the heightened influence of the spinner’s presence in separated flows. Incorporating profile drag through external polar data improves the model prediction, reducing the error to 4%. The model cannot reliably predict power distributions without external polar data for both attached and separated flows due to the crucial role of drag in the torque direction. The application of the model to experimental flowfield data shows a performance similar to that of the validation case. Therefore, the wake-informed lifting line model offers a promising approach for obtaining experimental blade loading distributions, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.},

The present experimental investigation explores the utility of segmented Coanda actuation using spanwise distributions of fluidically oscillating wall jets integrated into the rounded trailing edge of a 2D supercritical airfoil model, and their circulation control performance is compared with 2D actuation at low angles of attack and . The actuation is characterized using the mass flow rate coefficient and a variant of the conventional momentum coefficient that measures the magnitude of the resultant aerodynamic force effected by the 2- and 3D actuation on the aerodynamic platform in the absence of a crossflow. It is shown that while 3D actuation yields somewhat higher lift increments at , the increments induced by 2- and 3D actuation are comparable at higher . However, the induced drag increments by the 3D actuation are significantly lower than the corresponding 2D increments over the entire range of the present measurements, even when the actuation force is deducted. Finally, when is scaled by the actuation’s active area and its spanwise duty cycle, the variations of the induced lift and drag increments with the scaled indicate a unified relationship for the different 3D arrays.},

The lip noise grew stronger with increased core-stream temperature for a given jet Mach number and was less prominent above the broadband jet noise as the jet Mach number was increased. The lip noise’s frequency was found to scale with the bypass stream’s velocity at the core-nozzle lip and the core-nozzle lip thickness—pointing to unexplained differences in the characteristic frequency of lip noise/vortex shedding from similar nozzles in prior works. A modified nozzle configuration allowed optical access to the core nozzle’s wake, and time-resolved schlieren flow visualizations ( frames per second) and particle-image velocimetry data were obtained. Modal analyses of these flow measurements via the proper orthogonal decomposition and its spectral variant established a link between the observed noise and the underlying vortex shedding. A boundary-layer trip was shown to suppress the vortex shedding—although, it sometimes led to a different, high-frequency noise.},

However, this introduces the complex but crucial transition flight phase, which is not yet well understood regarding aerodynamics and flight dynamics. To better understand the aircraft’s dynamic behavior within this flight regime, this paper analyzes the longitudinal tilt-wing transition, considering various operational strategies for the maneuver. The analysis is based on an optimal control approach where the dynamic control problem is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem. The developed framework allows for successfully exploring different transition strategies by adapting constraints and objective functions. Compared to the results of static trim analyses, the phenomena of transition folds are attenuated in the dynamic investigation due to inertial effects. Furthermore, the backward transition maneuver from cruise to hover flight proves to be more challenging from a flight physics perspective because of high effective angles of attack and requires upward motion if flow separation is to be avoided.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on developing a bearings-only measurement-based three-dimensional window traversal guidance method for quadrotor uninhabitated aerial vehicles (UAVs). The desired flight path and heading angles of the quadrotor are proposed as functions of the bearing angle information of the four vertices of the window. These angular guidance inputs employ a bearing angle bisector term and an elliptic shaping angle term, which directs the quadrotor toward the centroid of the window. Detailed stability analysis of the resulting kinematics demonstrates that all quadrotor trajectories lead to the centroid of the window along a direction that is normal to the window plane. A qualitative comparison with existing traversal methodologies showcases the superiority of the proposed guidance approach with regard to the nature of information, computations for generating the guidance commands, and flexibility of replanning the traversal path. Realistic simulations considering a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor model and Monte Carlo studies validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed guidance solution. Representative flight validation trials are carried out using an indoor motion capture system.},

  abstract     = {In deep space exploration missions involving lunar flybys, to ensure the successful execution of the lunar gravity assist (LGA), one or more trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) are typically required before the perilune. The concept of singularity suggests that targeting future states either requires a significant amount of maneuvering or cannot be calculated within a finite iteration time. To mitigate the high computational costs associated with TCMs determined via the differential correction method, it is essential to analyze the singularity of the Lambert problem in the lunar flyby. This study demonstrates that the singularity of the Lambert problem in Keplerian orbits exhibits transferability in lunar flybys under the three-body model by using the Lagrange coefficients and pseudostate theory. This transferability is validated through the determinant theory of the state transition matrix (STM), which is further extendable to other three-body systems. Furthermore, this study elucidates the applicability of singularity in lunar flybys under the three-body model through numerical simulations in both prograde and retrograde motions, considering different arguments of perilune. These derivations and simulations establish criteria for assessing singularity, facilitating the rapid identification of positions associated with high maneuver costs. The conclusions drawn from this study have been validated using the ephemeris model. It is shown that it is possible to preemptively circumvent singularities and enhance the robustness of the guidance algorithm in practical lunar flyby missions.},

  abstract     = {Future spacecraft and surface robotic missions require increasingly capable autonomous systems for exploring challenging and unstructured domains, and trajectory optimization will be a cornerstone of such autonomous operations. However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn toward amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and develop Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and develop a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a lunar rover problem and a 3-degree-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.},

This paper specifically addresses missions employing solar sail technology, aiming to explore the attainable reachability of a miniaturized solar sail departing from Earth. This is achieved by considering both flyby and rendezvous missions. Drawing inspiration from previous research using low-thrust propulsion, this work focuses on time-optimal missions, applying optimal control theory to achieve reasonable transfer times. The formulation relies on continuous guidance control, employing an indirect method derived from Euler–Lagrange variational equations and Pontryagin’s minimum principle. Results show that the algorithm is a versatile tool for obtaining optimal solutions for missions involving trajectories with multiple flybys.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an integrated midcourse-terminal guidance methodology for a trailing pursuer in a Shoot-Shoot-Look scenario. We consider the case of a pursuer implementing given standard guidance laws for the midcourse and terminal phases. These engagement stages are separated by a predefined decision time, at which the pursuer allocation is determined. The pursuer’s position and heading at the decision time, referred to as a handover point, is optimized with respect to a tradeoff between the expected miss distance and control effort. Since the pursuer uses known given guidance laws, the handover point is the only optimization parameter of the problem. We propose a computationally efficient approach to evaluate the performance index online for a set of candidate decision points sampled from the pursuer’s reachable set at the end of the midcourse stage. Specifically, for the terminal phase, we develop the performance index representation using a limited number of sensitivity functions, which relate to variations in initial conditions and evader maneuver and can be computed offline. This terminal phase cost evaluation procedure is applicable for a class of linear time-varying systems with a quadratic cost. The proposed methodology is exemplified for minimum-time midcourse trajectories and proportional navigation terminal guidance law.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical optimization algorithm for generating approach and landing trajectories for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aircraft. We improve on the existing research on aircraft landing trajectory generation by formulating the trajectory optimization problem with additional real-world operational constraints, including 6-DoF aircraft dynamics, runway alignment, constant wind field, and obstacle avoidance, to obtain a continuous-time nonconvex optimal control problem. Particularly, the runway alignment constraint enforces the trajectory of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway only during the final approach phase. This is a novel feature that is essential for preventing an approach that is either too steep or too shallow. The proposed method models the runway alignment constraint through a multiphase trajectory planning scheme, imposing alignment conditions exclusively during the final approach phase. We compare this formulation with the existing state-triggered constraint formulation for runway alignment. To solve the formulated problem, we design a novel sequential convex programming algorithm called extrapolated penalized trust region that extends the penalized trust-region algorithm by incorporating an extrapolation step to expedite convergence. We validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo study, to evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to varying initial conditions.},

Here, we consider control strategies with a level of decentralization such that they do not require hardware and software modifications when assembling multiple modules together irrespective of how they are connected. To this end, we present two strategies: the first does not require the knowledge of the configuration of the assemblage, while the second, which offers better performance, includes identifying the configuration automatically during the takeoff phase of the flight. We discuss the control allocation associated with both strategies, as well as the configuration identification algorithm employed in the second strategy. Experimental analysis, including conducting flight tests, validates the efficacy and performance of the presented control strategies.},

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator theory provides a global linearization framework for general nonlinear dynamics, offering significant advantages for system analysis and control. However, practical applications typically involve approximating the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator in a lifted space spanned by a finite set of observable functions. The accuracy of this approximation is the key to effective Koopman operator-based analysis and control methods, generally improving as the dimension of the observables increases. Nonetheless, this increase in dimensionality significantly escalates both storage requirements and computational complexity, particularly for high-dimensional systems, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods in real-world problems. In this paper, we address this problem by reformulating the Koopman operator in tensor format to break the curse of dimensionality associated with its approximation through tensor decomposition techniques. This effective reduction in complexity enables the selection of high-dimensional observable functions and the handling of large-scale datasets, which leads to a precise linear prediction model utilizing the tensor-based Koopman operator. Furthermore, we propose an optimal control framework with the tensor-based Koopman operator, which adeptly addresses the nonlinear dynamics and constraints by linear reformulation in the lifted space and significantly reduces the computational complexity through separated representation of the tensor structure.},

These operator norms can be used to understand the performance and range of applicability of an algorithm exploiting linear approximations in different sets of coordinates. We examine uses of tensor operator norms in the context of linear and higher-order rendezvous guidance and to present a unified treatment of nonlinearity indices for dynamic systems. Tensor norm computations can offer insights into these problems in one to two orders of magnitude less time than similarly accurate sampling methods while providing more general understanding of the error performance of linear or higher-order approximations.},

This work introduces a novel hybrid soft–rigid space manipulator system (HSMS), which integrates a tendon-driven continuum manipulator with a traditional rigid robot. A strain parameterization technique known as geometric variable strain (GVS) is employed to derive a closed-form, minimum-order dynamic model of the HSMS by leveraging the principle of virtual work. Thrusters and variable-speed control moment gyros are incorporated to activate the spacecraft base and enhance the realism of the description. Two inverse-dynamics control designs are then proposed: one to bring the system to rest from a nonzero momentum condition and another one to track a three-dimensional trajectory in the end-effector task space. Extensive numerical simulations validate both the dynamic model and the proposed controllers, demonstrating the potential of the proposed HSMS concept for advanced space-manipulation tasks.},
