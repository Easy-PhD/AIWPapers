  abstract     = {The broadcloth material used in parachute manufacturing is generally a thin, woven, permeable textile. The small length scales of fibers, pores, and gaps in fabric are challenging to spatially resolve in a full-scale parachute simulation. In this work, simulations are performed using a 3D reconstruction of the broadcloth material used in the Mars 2020 mission, and simulation results using the detailed reconstructed geometry are compared to a simplified model proposed in a previous work. Furthermore, results from simulations under Earth ambient lab conditions are compared to experimental permeability test data to validate the choice of parameters for this reduced-order model. Simulations under ASPIRE SR03 flight-relevant conditions are also performed to study permeability in a rarefied flow regime. It is observed that flow through the material is similar to a developing pipe flow, and under low-density conditions, significant slip velocity is present inside pores. For all conditions investigated, the pressure drag is the primary contributor to the total drag force. Drag and mass flow rate discrepancies are observed between models, motivating future work to investigate the sensitivity of system-level parachute FSI simulations to the assumed permeability model and associated parameters.},

  abstract     = {Coordinated experimental and computational studies were conducted on the ROTEX-T, a cone–flare geometry used in a successful flight-test experiment, with the objectives of explaining the origins of the largest differences between computational and experimental results, assessing code-to-code, facility-to-facility, and ground-to-flight differences, and further illuminating the flight-test results. Background-oriented schlieren, infrared thermography, high-speed self-aligned focusing schlieren, and focused laser differential interferometry measurements were made in two wind tunnels. The surface heat flux and Stanton number distributions were calculated. Separation and reattachment locations, as well as flow state at each, were determined. Computational results were obtained using the VULCAN-CFD and SU2 codes in steady-state mode, and direct numerical simulation (DNS). The nominally steady axisymmetric flow was found to be globally unstable to stationary three-dimensional disturbances concentrated in the reattachment region. Without adding external noise, the disturbance amplitudes computed by DNS were found to be high in the separation bubble, and thus the flow was transitional. The separation location predicted computationally is consistently upstream of the experimental observation. This difference is caused by tunnel noise, whose effect is not incorporated into the computations. Despite this, the computed density field and shape of the separation bubble closely matched that observed experimentally. The maximum vertical density gradient was confirmed as an accurate, very useful definition of the boundary-layer edge. Computed laminar heating rates before separation agreed well with experiment; transitional heating rates after reattachment from experiments were between laminar and turbulent computations. Reattachment location and the flow state upon reattachment were assessed for the flight data. At flight-matched Reynolds numbers, flight trends align with the ground-test results, indicating a transitional shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction.‡‡‡},

  abstract     = {The premise of over-the-wing mounted rotors is that a favorable aerodynamic effect is achieved by interaction with the lifting wing, which also acts as noise shield. A physics-based low-order model is proposed that accounts for aerodynamic interactions in the prediction of the aeroacoustic footprint of the installed rotor. The nonuniform inflow of the rotor disk is modeled by an analytical description of the inviscid potential effects of the wing’s circulation, given as a function of the blade sectional coordinates. Furthermore, the ingestion of the separated boundary layer is considered at large angles of attack. The related steady inflow distortion serves as input to an aeroacoustic noise prediction chain that computes the unsteady loading on the blades and the resulting tonal noise emission by helicoidal surface theory. The model is validated by measurements from a single over-the-wing mounted rotor for a wide range of angle of attack, advance ratios, and rotor positions over the wing’s chord. The predictions and experimental data show an equivalent increase in the tonal components relative to the isolated rotor, and a minimization of the tonal noise for a midchord rotor position, for emission directions around the rotor disk plane over the wing’s suction side.},

  abstract     = {A semi-analytical model is proposed that incorporates aerodynamic interactions between the rotor- and wing-induced flowfields. Predictions are validated through experiments performed with an array of five rotors above an airfoil, where the angle of attack, advance ratio, and chordwise rotor position are varied. At moderate angles of attack, the propulsive thrust is reduced due to the acceleration induced by the wing’s circulation. Around the stall angle of the isolated wing, the rotors re-energize the boundary layer when operated in low-thrust conditions. By increasing the thrust, a pronounced region of reverse flow between the rotors and wing adversely affects the leading-edge separation delay over the wing that occurs for lower thrust settings. However, in this condition, the wing–rotor-array system exhibits increased thrust compared to the attached flow condition due to the rotors ingesting low-momentum flow. In addition, the rotor-induced flow over the wing augments suction, while the pressure side is subjected to a pressure increase, ascribed to flow entrainment from the rotors. After comparison with the experimental observations, it is confirmed that the model predictions accurately describe the lift and thrust performance trends, aside from a discrepancy in the lift force when the rotors are operated in low-thrust conditions.},

The analysis is focused on the physics of the second-mode instability at high enthalpy and the role of high-temperature effects. Although the stability solvers considering thermochemical nonequilibrium were best at estimating the measured second-mode frequency ( for shot 2990, for shot 3019), they overpredicted the most amplified frequency by approximately 16–23%. A moderate spread in the predicted most amplified frequency was also observed between the different solvers. The solvers estimated a most amplified frequency range of approximately 1450–1550 kHz for shot 2990 and approximately 1525–1650 kHz for shot 3019. There was also significant inconsistency observed in predicting the peak -factor magnitude, ranging from for shot 2990 and from for shot 3019.},

  abstract     = {This research introduces a novel structure for a doubly curved shallow shell, termed the “single-variable-edge and variable-thickness doubly curved shallow shell” (SVEVT-DCSS). The shell is constructed from a functionally graded carbon nanotube/fiber/polymer multiscale laminated composite with three distinct carbon nanotube distribution patterns: uniform distribution (UD), FG-O, and FG-X. These distributions are modeled using the Halpin–Tsai micromechanical approach and an orthotropic micromechanical model. Employing the theory of elasticity and the Von Karman–Donnell geometrical nonlinearity assumption, the governing equations for the mechanical behavior of the shell, which rests on a Winkler–Pasternak elastic foundation and is subjected to a thermomechanical environment, are formulated. By applying Galerkin’s method to these equations, the dynamic characteristics of the shell are determined. The nonlinear dynamic responses of the SVEVT-DCSS are analyzed with a focus on both periodic and chaotic behavior. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of the results are validated through comparisons with existing literature and finite element method simulations. The findings, presented through numerical tables and graphical figures, demonstrate the significant potential of this novel shell structure for practical engineering applications, contributing to advancements in aerospace, civil, and mechanical engineering.},

The Newmark- method is utilized to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the rotor system. The influence of the positions and normal forces of the dampers on the critical speed, vibration, strain energy distribution, and sensitivity of the rotor is analyzed. The results show that the vibration suppression is related to both the equivalent damping coefficient and the equivalent dynamic stiffness of the DFD. The influence of the DFD on the strain energy distribution of the rotor is notable. The parameter selection of DFDs should balance vibration suppression and strain energy distribution in a rotor system. The installation position of DFDs significantly modulates rotor dynamic behavior. The parameter design of DFDs must be guided by rotor strain energy distribution while incorporating speed-dependent adaptation to ensure vibration suppression across operational states. This study is of great significance for exploring the optimal control strategy of the DFD-rotor system.},

This paper proposes a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM formulated as a highly compact multi-input Volterra series. Orthogonal matching pursuit is used to obtain a set of optimally sparse nonlinear multi-input ROM coefficients from unsteady aerodynamic training data. The framework is exemplified in an aeroelastic setting using the benchmark supercritical wing, considering forced response, flutter, and limit cycle oscillation. The simple and efficient optimal sparsity multi-input ROM framework performs with high accuracy compared to the full-order aeroelastic model, requiring only a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of possible multi-input terms to be identified and allowing a 98% reduction in the number of training samples.},

Schlieren imaging, nitric oxide planar laser-induced fluorescence (NO-PLIF) imaging, and pressure transducer techniques are employed to visualize flow structures and conduct parametric measurements. Numerical simulations are conducted to shed light on the flow structures and elucidate the underlying mechanisms as well. The results indicate that NO-PLIF imaging can effectively capture the spatially resolved structures surrounding the jet exit. Both the Mach disk height and barrel shock width are positively correlated with the jet momentum ratio and angle of attack . Furthermore, the pressure plateau and peak distribution upstream and downstream of the sonic orifice are also significantly influenced by and . Specifically, peak pressure increases with an increase in , while it drops for a larger .

Nonetheless, these models have some limitations in simulating flows with adverse pressure gradients due to the inclusion of various assumptions, such as the eddy viscosity hypothesis. As a result, many researchers have focused their efforts on improving turbulence models, including parameter calibration. In this paper, a progressive neural network framework is utilized to modify the dissipation coefficients of the shear-stress transport (SST) model into a function of physical quantities. Firstly, the zero pressure gradient flat plate case is employed to obtain the calibrated model SST-FP. Subsequently, the flow with a turbulent separation bubble is adopted to progressively acquire the calibrated model SST-TSB. The enhanced model performs well in predicting the mean velocity profile, friction coefficient, and other variables of training cases, owing to joint corrections on the and equations. Furthermore, verification research demonstrates that the SST-TSB model mitigates the potential damage to the wall-law prediction. It can also adapt the forecast properly in circumstances where the original model predicts larger or smaller separation zones, avoiding the drawbacks that Bayesian inference and other methods have when applied to parameter calibration.},

In this paper, the phenomenon of wave dispersion that causes this effect is exploited through time reversibility to focus waves both spatially and temporally and hence amplify the peak response at a chosen position. Harmonic finite element analysis is first undertaken to determine the wave bearing characteristics of a simplified representation of a wing leading edge. Transient analysis is then performed on the structure with an attached ice layer to focus disturbances of bandwidths up to 50 kHz at different chosen points. The amplitude of the peak shear stress between the ice and substrate is bandwidth dependent and predicted to be up to 30 times higher than due to a comparable pulse input. Predicted peak accelerations are successfully validated experimentally for a limited bandwidth of 10 kHz.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical structure design can improve the structural efficiency of lightweight sandwich structures, and the potential for multifunctional design is also considerable. By constructing fishbone-shaped Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) arrays onto the grid walls and introducing Absorbent Honeycomb Sandwich Structure (AHS) as its small-scale configuration, Hierarchical Grid Hybrid Absorber (HGHA) is proposed. By deriving the equivalent models of absorbent honeycomb, its Electromagnetic (EM) and mechanical properties are decoupled. The high relative permittivity and dielectric loss of AHS, combined with the local strong E-filed excited by the CFRP arrays, broaden the absorption band towards lower frequency and significantly reduce the reflection loss (RL), respectively. After optimization, HGHA achieves broadband (2–18 GHz), wide-angle (0–60°), and efficient (average ) EM wave absorption. Furthermore, honeycomb provide efficient lateral support for the grid walls, changing its failure mode from elastic buckling to plastic microbuckling. Thus, the specific compressive strength and specific energy absorption of HGHA is improved by 99.3% and 173%, respectively, compared to grid sandwich structure. It demonstrates that HGHA is competitive among radar absorbing structures and composite sandwich structures, providing a novel solution for the lightweight, high-efficiency, and multifunctional design of aircraft structures.},

The jet speed and temperature ratio are significantly higher than most laboratory facilities. At these high-speed and high-temperature conditions, compressibility effects become important. It is, therefore, possible that high-performance aircraft could emit a new noise component that has not been observed before. In the case of laboratory jets, turbulent mixing noise is generated by the shearing motion of the jet flow. The details of the process are discussed in this paper and others. In addition, this paper reports the identification of a new noise component from high-performance aircraft. This new noise component contains a significant fraction of infrasound. Infrasound at high intensity could lead to body cavity resonance. It becomes a health hazard. How this noise component is related to the early experimental observations of Mach wave radiation from shock-tube-generated jets, first reported by Oertel, and subsequent analysis based on the Euler equation by Tam and Hu are examined. The existence of the new noise component, which is the dominant component at an inlet angle larger than 140 deg, is confirmed by spectral data, directivity data, and as-measured sound pulse data.},

  abstract     = {Bistable deployable composite booms (Bi-DCBs) have broad application prospects in space deployable structures due to unique bistable characteristics, efficient stowage, lightweight, and excellent mechanical properties. However, the contrasting structural requirements (i.e., stiffness, stability) and operational requirements (i.e., lightweight, compact, and stowage) pose challenges to engineering design. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a many-objective optimization formulation for the Bi-DCB, leveraging the respective advantages of the analytical and surrogate models, aiming to achieve a balance between multiple objectives, thereby obtaining the optimal comprehensive performance. In this formulation, the cross-sectional radius, cross-sectional angle, and length are selected as design variables while ensuring that the Bi-DCB does not fail during operation. Based on these, an optimization model is established with the objectives to minimize the linear density and the longitude-sectional polar radius at the endpoint and to maximize the average strain energy and the natural frequency. To verify optimal results, benchmark testing and performance evaluation are conducted using different algorithms, and the Pareto front containing 112 solutions is ultimately found, all superior to the initial sample in four objectives. These solutions achieve a good balance and coordination among multiple objectives, providing optimal performance schemes for the design of the Bi-DCB.},

  abstract     = {This study uses direct numerical simulations (DNSs) with PyFR (www.pyfr.org) to investigate the impact of freestream disturbances on the performance of nonconventional triangular airfoils for Martian rotorcraft. First, triangular airfoils optimized for steady uniform freestream conditions at a 12 deg angle of attack are subjected to unsteady upstream conditions containing freestream eddies with various target turbulence intensities and characteristic length scales. Results show that the freestream eddies lead to a breakdown of coherent suction-side vortices and a reduction of aerodynamic forces, with the magnitude of this effect increasing with higher turbulence intensities and larger length scales. Building on this, DNSs are then used to optimize triangular airfoils at a 12 deg angle of attack for unsteady upstream conditions containing freestream eddies. The new designs still leverage an unsteady vortex roll-up mechanism to generate lift. However, their shapes are different from those obtained when optimizing for steady uniform inflow conditions, with their apexes closer to the trailing edge. This downstream apex position allows for the smaller and weaker vortices that result from the interaction of the freestream eddies with the separated shear layer to cover a larger suction surface area. Taken together, the results demonstrate the importance of considering freestream disturbances when designing nonconventional airfoils for use on a Martian rotorcraft.},

  abstract     = {Numerical simulations show great potential to reduce the need for costly physical flight testing during takeoff and landing, thereby decreasing the time-to-market for future aircraft. In order to validate computational fluid dynamics results, we often perform wind-tunnel experiments. However, most simulations in the literature are performed at free-air conditions, neglecting confinement effects, and therefore the wind-tunnel data must be corrected based on empirical methods. In the present work, we compare free-air and in-tunnel simulations of NASA’s high-lift configuration of the Common Research Model (CRM-HL) and quantify sensitivities for steady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS)-based methods and unsteady scale-resolving hybrid RANS/large-eddy simulations (HRLESs). Uncertainties associated with the choice of turbulence model, initialization strategies, and boundary conditions are covered. The present study provides valuable lessons learned and contributes toward best practices for in-tunnel simulations. For maximum lift prediction, RANS-based methods lead to nonphysical flow-separation patterns considering both free-air and in-tunnel configurations. We show consistency between in-tunnel and free-air HRLESs in terms of statistical and unsteady characteristics and reasonable agreement with wind-tunnel data. However, in-tunnel simulations increase the levels of complexity considerably and require long initial transients (independent of the initialization strategy). In order to explain persisting differences between simulation and experiment, we require better characterization of wind-tunnel flow conditions.},

In the LES, the new mechanisms for ethanol, n-heptane, and Jet A match available experimental data well, whereas the C1 mechanism slightly underpredicts the flame size.

Both the plate and stiffeners are modeled using the first-order shear deformation theory. Functionally graded material (FGM) properties vary continuously in the thickness direction using the power law. Compared to Finite Element Method (FEM), the Ritz method is beneficial while applying the skin-stiffener compatibility conditions, as the stiffeners can be placed arbitrarily and do not have to share nodes with the base structure finite element model. Such an approach would be efficient during shape optimization studies, as remeshing of the structure would not be required for changes in geometry. Orthogonal Jacobi polynomials as trial functions make the Ritz analysis robust, as they do not suffer matrix ill-conditioning-induced numerical issues when higher-order polynomials are required to accurately obtain the complex buckling mode shapes for curvilinearly stiffened panels. Stiffener displacements are approximated independently using one-dimensional trial functions, and compatibility is explicitly satisfied at the integration points along the stiffener path, which saves the computational cost by reducing the integration order. Accuracy of the proposed method is verified using several literature examples and commercial FEM software. Parametric studies on buckling response of the studied model with variation in the FGM power law index are conducted.},

The configuration examined is a panel located downstream of a compression ramp. First, the ramp is exposed to Mach 4 flow, and the frequency content of pressure fluctuations in the turbulent boundary layer upstream and downstream of the compression corner is compared. It is found that intermediate frequencies that may influence fluid-structure interaction propagate into the downstream boundary layer. Next, the coupling mechanism between turbulence and structural responses is studied. Changes in turbulence caused by structural deformations are examined, followed by an investigation into the aeroelastic effects of modified turbulence on a flexible panel. One-way coupling exists between turbulence and structural responses because structural deformations significantly affect turbulence properties, but variations in turbulence have minor effects on structural responses. Finally, the role of turbulence in fluid-structure interaction is determined. Pressure fluctuation histories of varying intensity are applied to panels of varying thickness. A threshold is established indicating when boundary layer turbulence causes moderate structural deformations. The findings of the paper provide guidelines for designing control surfaces of hypersonic vehicles subjected to turbulent shock wave-boundary layer interaction effects.},

A macroscopic numerical method for laser ablation under high-speed flow conditions was developed based on carbon/carbon (C/C) materials. The model includes both oxidation and sublimation processes of C/C materials. For the first time, mass injection effects on ablation characteristics were introduced. Numerical simulations of laser ablation on a flat plate model were conducted under Mach 6 and static conditions. The temperature evolution in the ablation zone was analyzed. Changes in flow characteristics due to ablation injection and high-speed airflow were examined in detail. Additionally, the impact of these flow changes on ablation characteristics was investigated. Results indicate that the airflow significantly affects temperature responses at different wall positions. The isotherms in the ablation zone bend downstream. The total ablation rate at Mach 6 is 5.3% higher than in static conditions. Local flow characteristics are altered by both ablation injection and high-speed flow, creating a high-pressure zone. This zone evolves continuously, leading to pressure variations at different wall locations. These local pressure changes significantly affect the sublimation rate of the wall, thereby influencing the ablation rate.},

  abstract     = {Aerobots are expected to play a key role in future missions to explore the atmospheres of Venus and other planetary bodies. Proposed missions to Venus involve lowering instruments on tethers toward the inhospitable surface from balloons at altitudes on the order of 50 km. Accurately capturing the viscoelastic behavior of the tethers in system design models is essential for managing response and loads during dynamic events (deployment, gusts, flight control) and following long-term aging in extreme environments. The behavior of materials likely to be used in tethers, such as Kevlar, is well-described by a fractional derivative viscoelastic model. One of the shortcomings of such models is the challenge of numerical time integration of the system equations of motion. In this work, fractional derivative behavior is approximated using a multi-anelastic displacement fields (multi-ADF) model. The multi-ADF model augments the instantaneous displacement field with multiple discrete internal displacement fields that individually evolve following first-order relaxation processes. Notably, while the fractional derivative model is nonlocal in time, requiring the entire history for evaluation, the first-order version is local, essentially capturing the history in the present values of internal state variables. A multi-ADF finite element model of a tether with an instrument gondola is developed, and a Newmark time integration scheme is used to obtain the dynamic response of the system during a drop test. The multi-ADF model is shown to be very accurate for creep, dynamics, and gondola-drop simulations, and it runs in a small fraction of the time required by a direct fractional-derivative model.},

  abstract     = {The accurate modeling of hypersonic environments, including coupled ablation, is a challenging problem due to the complex flow physics, numerical accuracy, and robustness required for these simulations. The simulation mesh needs to be designed carefully, and structured high-aspect ratio stretched grids are typically used to properly capture the high wall-normal gradients. The mesh generation process proves to be a cumbersome and time-consuming process for realistic and complex vehicles, creating a severe bottleneck to the current CFD workflow. This work highlights the development of the Cartesian Higher-Order Adaptive Multi-Physics Solver (CHAMPS) near-body Cartesian grid solver, capable of automatic volume mesh generation, and its accurate and robust use in simulating coupled ablation for steady-state graphite ablation by interfacing with the Kentucky Aerothermodynamics and Thermal Response System Material Response (KATS-MR) solver. Validation on a Mach 8.7 cylinder and a Mach 22.88 axisymmetric Mars 2020 capsule showcases the challenges associated with shock-capturing on non-shock-aligned Cartesian grids. A verification study of the CHAMPS–KATS coupled ablation framework is performed for steady-state graphite ablation on a Mach 25.2, 9 deg blunt cone, followed by the validation of the solver for a blunt cone in the NASA Ames Interaction Heating Facility arcjet.},

  abstract     = {We present a nonintrusive surrogate model to emulate time-dependent flow problems. Our approach enhances spatial mode decomposition using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to spectral model decomposition via spectral POD (SPOD), along with mapping of the spectrum in each case onto a common spectral domain. This alignment enables the collapse of fundamental frequencies in different cases into a single frequency. To emulate a new flowfield, we apply the kriging method to predict the SPOD coefficients for the target case, followed by flowfield reconstruction using the inverse Fourier transform. In our examples of flow past circular and square cylinders, we demonstrate the limitations of emulation based on POD or SPOD without a common spectral domain, as they fail to predict the fundamental frequency accurately. However, our proposed approach employing SPOD in the rescaled spectral domain successfully predicts the velocity spectrum and achieves a good predictability for time-dependent lift and mean drag. Moreover, we underscore the necessity of unbiased training data for the method’s efficacy. This study proposes a robust, nonintrusive surrogate modeling strategy to capture time-dependent features of flow problems, which is crucial for design purposes where time dependency between parameters is significant.},

The results demonstrated that the lift–drag ratio can be increased by about 21.8% without drag penalty after plasma actuation. Meanwhile, the time-averaged flowfield indicated that the separation region area around the flap is reduced by the plasma actuator. Moreover, the leading-edge stagnation point deflects toward the lower surface of the airfoil, which is similar to the effect of increasing the angle of attack and leads to the increment of the lift. In addition, the controlling mechanisms of the plasma actuator are uncovered based on the instantaneous flowfield results. It is of great importance that two flow structures produced by the interaction between the plasma actuator and the separated shear layer at different times play an important role in suppressing the separation flow by promoting the mixing between the main flow and the flow near the wall surface, and transferring the momentum from the leading edge of the flap to the trailing edge of the flap. The different characteristics of the separated shear layer at different times is the main reason for the generation of different flow structures of the plasma actuator.},

  abstract     = {The haystack phenomenon is a hallmark of turbulence–propeller interaction and a major source of unsteady thrust and aerodynamic noise in aircraft and underwater applications. This phenomenon is characterized by distinct broadband spectral humps in the unsteady thrust and noise at blade passing frequency harmonics. These humps tend to shift to higher frequencies under certain conditions, known as blue-shifting. Understanding the mechanics behind the haystack is crucial for developing effective flow and noise control strategies. This work introduces a theoretical model to predict unsteady thrust caused by these interactions. This model is validated through comparisons with numerical simulations under various inflow conditions, including single-frequency gusts and broadband turbulence. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of the haystack, with a focus on the influence of key parameters. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the model reveals certain flow structures ingested by the rotor that are related to the unsteady thrust and finally addresses the mechanisms of the blue-shifting phenomenon. This research not only deepens our understanding of the fluid mechanics underlying the haystacks but also provides valuable insights for designing the next generation of low-noise propellers, thereby contributing directly to quieter and more sustainable green aviation.},

  abstract     = {This paper describes a new computational strategy for complex aerodynamic flows that involve multiple powered devices, such as flow control actuators or power systems. A complete computational domain contains all the relevant physical regions, including the inner regions of all the powered devices. The proposed strategy aims to reduce the exorbitant computational resources required to resolve fine flow features within most of the devices. The approach involves modifying an existing computational fluid model by introducing a grid generation step and a boundary condition module. The grid generation step employs a predetermined strategy that is performed prior to the simulation step, resulting in a grid system that includes only a few of the devices. The flow computation is then performed by incorporating special boundary conditions replicated over all the powered devices and continually updated in the course of the time-stepping process. This approach demonstrates high computational efficiency, as exemplified by its application to a wing of a rotorcraft equipped with numerous flow control actuators in hover mode. The results obtained using this replication approach closely match those obtained using a complete computational domain, but with approximately 50% fewer computational resources. Excluding many actuators from the computational domain is particularly advantageous for flows with disparate length scales and time scales, enabling practical computations over sufficiently long times.},

Numerical simulations, performed using a lattice Boltzmann solver ProLB, are validated against these experimental data. While the geometry is relatively simple, this is still a challenging case to accurately predict numerically, particularly the boundary-layer separation bubble that occurs upstream of the spoiler. The flow is characterized by an arch-type broadband wake without any coherent vortex shedding. There is a horseshoe vortex that originates upstream of the spoiler and wraps around both sides of the spoiler. Inboard of the horseshoe vortex there are a pair of ground vortices with the opposite sign vorticity to the horseshoe vortex. A combination of band-filtered on-surface pressures and three-dimensional numerical beamforming was used to determine the noise sources. As well as the broadband bluff body wake and the horseshoe vortex, the beamforming showed that the ground edge vortices and the spoiler side edges were the dominant acoustic sources.},

Our optimization study modifies a DTU 10 MW benchmark with a simplified structure and isotropic material properties. The tightly coupled optimizations increase torque by 14% while reducing rotor mass by 9% or reduce blade mass by 27% while maintaining torque. Blade-resolved models provide greater design freedom, enabling 5% higher mass reductions than conventional parameterizations at equal torque.

  abstract     = {Tilt-wing aircraft promise to combine cruise efficiency with vertical takeoff and landing capability. However, this introduces the complex but crucial transition flight phase, which is not yet well understood regarding aerodynamics and flight dynamics. To better understand the aircraft’s dynamic behavior within this flight regime, this paper analyzes the longitudinal tilt-wing transition, considering various operational strategies for the maneuver. The analysis is based on an optimal control approach where the dynamic control problem is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem. The developed framework allows for successfully exploring different transition strategies by adapting constraints and objective functions. Compared to the results of static trim analyses, the phenomena of transition folds are attenuated in the dynamic investigation due to inertial effects. Furthermore, the backward transition maneuver from cruise to hover flight proves to be more challenging from a flight physics perspective because of high effective angles of attack and requires upward motion if flow separation is to be avoided.},

  abstract     = {This paper focuses on developing a bearings-only measurement-based three-dimensional window traversal guidance method for quadrotor uninhabitated aerial vehicles (UAVs). The desired flight path and heading angles of the quadrotor are proposed as functions of the bearing angle information of the four vertices of the window. These angular guidance inputs employ a bearing angle bisector term and an elliptic shaping angle term, which directs the quadrotor toward the centroid of the window. Detailed stability analysis of the resulting kinematics demonstrates that all quadrotor trajectories lead to the centroid of the window along a direction that is normal to the window plane. A qualitative comparison with existing traversal methodologies showcases the superiority of the proposed guidance approach with regard to the nature of information, computations for generating the guidance commands, and flexibility of replanning the traversal path. Realistic simulations considering a six-degree-of-freedom quadrotor model and Monte Carlo studies validate the effectiveness, accuracy, and robustness of the proposed guidance solution. Representative flight validation trials are carried out using an indoor motion capture system.},

  abstract     = {In deep space exploration missions involving lunar flybys, to ensure the successful execution of the lunar gravity assist (LGA), one or more trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs) are typically required before the perilune. The concept of singularity suggests that targeting future states either requires a significant amount of maneuvering or cannot be calculated within a finite iteration time. To mitigate the high computational costs associated with TCMs determined via the differential correction method, it is essential to analyze the singularity of the Lambert problem in the lunar flyby. This study demonstrates that the singularity of the Lambert problem in Keplerian orbits exhibits transferability in lunar flybys under the three-body model by using the Lagrange coefficients and pseudostate theory. This transferability is validated through the determinant theory of the state transition matrix (STM), which is further extendable to other three-body systems. Furthermore, this study elucidates the applicability of singularity in lunar flybys under the three-body model through numerical simulations in both prograde and retrograde motions, considering different arguments of perilune. These derivations and simulations establish criteria for assessing singularity, facilitating the rapid identification of positions associated with high maneuver costs. The conclusions drawn from this study have been validated using the ephemeris model. It is shown that it is possible to preemptively circumvent singularities and enhance the robustness of the guidance algorithm in practical lunar flyby missions.},

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn toward amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and develop Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and develop a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a lunar rover problem and a 3-degree-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.},

This paper specifically addresses missions employing solar sail technology, aiming to explore the attainable reachability of a miniaturized solar sail departing from Earth. This is achieved by considering both flyby and rendezvous missions. Drawing inspiration from previous research using low-thrust propulsion, this work focuses on time-optimal missions, applying optimal control theory to achieve reasonable transfer times. The formulation relies on continuous guidance control, employing an indirect method derived from Euler–Lagrange variational equations and Pontryagin’s minimum principle. Results show that the algorithm is a versatile tool for obtaining optimal solutions for missions involving trajectories with multiple flybys.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes an integrated midcourse-terminal guidance methodology for a trailing pursuer in a Shoot-Shoot-Look scenario. We consider the case of a pursuer implementing given standard guidance laws for the midcourse and terminal phases. These engagement stages are separated by a predefined decision time, at which the pursuer allocation is determined. The pursuer’s position and heading at the decision time, referred to as a handover point, is optimized with respect to a tradeoff between the expected miss distance and control effort. Since the pursuer uses known given guidance laws, the handover point is the only optimization parameter of the problem. We propose a computationally efficient approach to evaluate the performance index online for a set of candidate decision points sampled from the pursuer’s reachable set at the end of the midcourse stage. Specifically, for the terminal phase, we develop the performance index representation using a limited number of sensitivity functions, which relate to variations in initial conditions and evader maneuver and can be computed offline. This terminal phase cost evaluation procedure is applicable for a class of linear time-varying systems with a quadratic cost. The proposed methodology is exemplified for minimum-time midcourse trajectories and proportional navigation terminal guidance law.},

  abstract     = {This paper presents a numerical optimization algorithm for generating approach and landing trajectories for a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) aircraft. We improve on the existing research on aircraft landing trajectory generation by formulating the trajectory optimization problem with additional real-world operational constraints, including 6-DoF aircraft dynamics, runway alignment, constant wind field, and obstacle avoidance, to obtain a continuous-time nonconvex optimal control problem. Particularly, the runway alignment constraint enforces the trajectory of the aircraft to be aligned with the runway only during the final approach phase. This is a novel feature that is essential for preventing an approach that is either too steep or too shallow. The proposed method models the runway alignment constraint through a multiphase trajectory planning scheme, imposing alignment conditions exclusively during the final approach phase. We compare this formulation with the existing state-triggered constraint formulation for runway alignment. To solve the formulated problem, we design a novel sequential convex programming algorithm called extrapolated penalized trust region that extends the penalized trust-region algorithm by incorporating an extrapolation step to expedite convergence. We validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, including a Monte Carlo study, to evaluate the robustness of the algorithm to varying initial conditions.},

Here, we consider control strategies with a level of decentralization such that they do not require hardware and software modifications when assembling multiple modules together irrespective of how they are connected. To this end, we present two strategies: the first does not require the knowledge of the configuration of the assemblage, while the second, which offers better performance, includes identifying the configuration automatically during the takeoff phase of the flight. We discuss the control allocation associated with both strategies, as well as the configuration identification algorithm employed in the second strategy. Experimental analysis, including conducting flight tests, validates the efficacy and performance of the presented control strategies.},

  abstract     = {The Koopman operator theory provides a global linearization framework for general nonlinear dynamics, offering significant advantages for system analysis and control. However, practical applications typically involve approximating the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator in a lifted space spanned by a finite set of observable functions. The accuracy of this approximation is the key to effective Koopman operator-based analysis and control methods, generally improving as the dimension of the observables increases. Nonetheless, this increase in dimensionality significantly escalates both storage requirements and computational complexity, particularly for high-dimensional systems, thereby limiting the applicability of these methods in real-world problems. In this paper, we address this problem by reformulating the Koopman operator in tensor format to break the curse of dimensionality associated with its approximation through tensor decomposition techniques. This effective reduction in complexity enables the selection of high-dimensional observable functions and the handling of large-scale datasets, which leads to a precise linear prediction model utilizing the tensor-based Koopman operator. Furthermore, we propose an optimal control framework with the tensor-based Koopman operator, which adeptly addresses the nonlinear dynamics and constraints by linear reformulation in the lifted space and significantly reduces the computational complexity through separated representation of the tensor structure.},

Thrusters and variable-speed control moment gyros are incorporated to activate the spacecraft base and enhance the realism of the description. Two inverse-dynamics control designs are then proposed: one to bring the system to rest from a nonzero momentum condition and another one to track a three-dimensional trajectory in the end-effector task space.
