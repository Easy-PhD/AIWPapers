  abstract     = {This paper examines the concept of creativity from a historical-psychological perspective, exploring its evolution over time and its manifestation as both an individual and collective phenomenon. Through a narrative-theoretical review of the literature on creativity’s conceptualization, nature, and valuation, we examine how social, cultural, and psychological factors have influenced the understanding of creativity throughout history. The discussion contrasts key aspects at the individual level, such as motivation, personality, intuition, exceptionality, and intelligence, with group dimensions like domain, field, collaboration, background, and the societal consequences of creative acts. The paper presents diverse psychological frameworks, including behaviorism, psychoanalysis, Gestalt psychology, humanistic psychology, and cognitive psychology, each offering unique insights into the mechanisms behind creativity. By tracing the historical phases of creativity—from its early association with divine creation to its modern applications in art, science, and technology, as well as its relationship with artificial intelligence—this paper highlights how creativity has been judged and valued across different eras. One of the conclusions drawn is that while the concept of artistic genius and originality cannot be disentangled from its broader social and cultural context, creativity is also an intensely personal psychological process, with the internalized sociocultural context acting as a proxy for external fields and domains.},

  abstract     = {We humans have scaffolded minds into an ecological niche. Considering this, the main thesis I will defend in this article is that we humans live surrounded by images, and we spatially organise these images into a particular cultural niche which I call imaginal space, a material or virtual space that we interactively navigate. We use such images in the imaginal space as fundamental props in the imaginative dynamics of our scaffolded minds. The images we find in our imaginal space are public depictive representations. They are twofold objects: on the one hand, they are material objects in that they can be manipulated into the ecological niche; on the other hand, they also are normative objects in that their representational function can be redesigned through a practice of use. As a first consequence of this main thesis, I will contend that public representations emergent into the imaginal space of a certain community may play a crucial regulative role for imagination: emergent systems of public representations can get a canonical status in their community, so that they can exert a normative power on the members of that community regulating their imagistic mental representations. As a second consequence, I will defend that the canonical images emergent in the imaginal space constitute the collective imagery of a human community: they support and influence the development of public narratives in the considered community.},

  abstract     = {The foraging task is a commonly studied scenario for distributed swarm robotic systems. The robots switch searching and resting behavior in a distributed manner to perform foraging quickly and energy efficiently. It is known that robots that are resting can act as a potential labor pool in addition to saving energy. Because they function as a potential labor pool, resting robots can help with foraging if needed. In this study, we consider the group foraging task, which requires two or more robots to transport a food item. In a group foraging task, resting robots can help with the transportation of a heavy food item in response to the recruitment of other robots. Until now, the efficacy of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool has been suggested, but the environments in which this function is dominant is still unknown. In this study, we propose a state-transition model for robots that includes the resting behavior and investigate the performance through multi-agent simulation. By comparing models with and without the resting behavior, we found that the function of the resting behavior as a potential labor pool is dominant in cases when the food items are heavy or the population is small.},
