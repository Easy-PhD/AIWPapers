  abstract     = {This study introduces significant improvements in the construction of deep convolutional neural network models for classifying agricultural products, specifically oranges, based on their shape, size, and color. Utilizing the MobileNetV2 architecture, this research leverages its efficiency and lightweight nature, making it suitable for mobile and embedded applications. Key techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions, linear bottlenecks, and inverted residuals help reduce the number of parameters and computational load while maintaining high performance in feature extraction. Additionally, the study employs comprehensive data augmentation methods, including horizontal and vertical flips, grayscale transformations, hue adjustments, brightness adjustments, and noise addition to enhance the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 99.53%∼100% with nearly perfect precision, recall of 95.7%, and F1-score of 94.6% for both “orange_good” and “orange_bad” classes, significantly outperforming previous models which typically achieved accuracies between 70% and 90%. While the classification performance was near-perfect in some aspects, there were minor errors in specific detection tasks. The confusion matrix shows that the model has high sensitivity and specificity, with very few misclassifications. Finally, this study highlights the practical applicability of the proposed model, particularly its easy deployment on resource-constrained devices and its effectiveness in agricultural product quality control processes. These findings affirm the model in this research as a reliable and highly efficient tool for agricultural product classification, surpassing the capabilities of traditional models in this field.},

  abstract     = {The Gaussian Q-function (GQF) is widely used in various scientific and engineering fields, especially in telecommunications and wireless communication. However, the lack of a closed-form expression for this function has led to considerable research efforts to achieve more accurate approximations. This study introduces a new approximate method that provides high accuracy for the boundaries of the GQF. The proposed approach utilizes parametric functions for both the lower and upper bounds of the GQF. The parameters of these functions are estimated using the Wild Horse Optimization (WHO), a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, with the aim of minimizing the distance between the proposed functions and the actual GQF. The optimization process targets the minimization of the maximum absolute error and the mean absolute error, ensuring that the proposed bounds provide a tight and accurate approximation of the GQF. Numerical experiments and comparisons with existing bounds demonstrate the superior accuracy of the proposed method. The new lower and upper bounds achieve significantly lower maximum absolute error and mean absolute error values compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed bounds in estimating the symbol error probability (SEP) for various digital modulation schemes, showing that the new bounds provide more accurate estimates of the SEP compared to the existing bounds. The results highlight the practical significance of the proposed method in enhancing the reliability of error probability estimation in communication systems.},

To determine the start times of the jobs, we introduce and adapt the left timetabling method for the tardiness objective under consideration.

  abstract     = {In manufacturing, especially in oil flow filtration, combustion systems, cooling turbines, and other areas, heat transfer performance through hybrid nanofluids (HNFs) is a key factor in achieving dominance of the final product. The present study deals with the movement of the fluid containing tri-hybrid nanoparticles on an excessively large stagnation point area on a smooth plate in a permeable medium. Additionally, the leading partial differential equations of the proposed model are converted to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by incorporating similarity variables, and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method is then used to solve these. To find the missing initial conditions of first-order ODEs, a shooting technique is also used. Furthermore, the consequences of heat transmission rate in the form of graphs and tables are explored. It is noticed that by enhancing the strength of the solid volume fraction the skin friction along the x-axis ( f ″ ( 0 ) or C F X ) increases as γ ∈ ( − 2 , 10 ] and decreases for the values of γ ∈ [ − 10 , 2 ) . But the converse of this behavior is true for g ″ ( 0 ) = C F Y . Moreover, the ternary fluid has taken the most significant effect on the Nusselt number, that is, 17.12978%, 8.43809%, and 19.20192% increment for Go, Ag and Cu type mono-nanofluid and 12.67309%, 18.13489%, and 13.65317% enhancement for HNF (Go-Ag, Go-Cu, Ag-Cu, respectively).},

Based on the dynamic modeling of the robot manipulator, the PD control law is designed, and the improved dung beetle optimization (DBO) algorithm is introduced using the good point set (GPS) method for population initialization and the sine strategy for convergence factor adjustment. Furthermore, a fuzzy adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the PD controller gain based on real-time errors. This article uses discrete Lyapunov iterative stability to analyze the global asymptotic stability of the robot closed-loop system. The experimental results verify that the DBO-fuzzy-PD controller is superior to the original PD controller. The ISE value is reduced from 3.4140 to 0.0384, and the IAE value is reduced from 1.9876 to 0.1843. The DBO-fuzzy-PD controller has better tracking accuracy and response speed than traditional PD.

The speedups seen range from slightly worse (in some extreme examples) to equal compared to previous works while returning exactly the same output and is significantly faster when filtering is used (15x for birth-death pairs when removing 75% of birth-death pairs). Filtering is shown to maintain machine learning performance on both synthetically generated and real world datasets while providing orders of magnitude speedup depending on how intensive of filtering is done. Due to the introduced algorithm’s algorithmic design, the speedup seen is greater when filtering using the introduced birth-death filtering algorithm.

  abstract     = {Accurate time-series classification (TSC) remains a fundamental challenge in deep learning due to the complexity and variability of temporal patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU have shown promise in modeling sequential dependencies, they often suffer from limitations like vanishing gradients and high computational cost when handling long sequences. To overcome these issues, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly the Inception architecture, have emerged as powerful alternatives due to their ability to capture multiscale local patterns efficiently. In this study, we propose InceptionResNet, a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates the residual learning mechanism of ResNet into the InceptionTime architecture. By replacing the fully convolutional network (FCN) shortcut module in InceptionFCN with ResNet-50, the model gains deeper representational capacity and improved gradient flow during training. We conduct extensive experiments on the UCR-85 benchmark dataset, comparing our model against state-of-the-art approaches, including InceptionTime, InceptionFCN, ResNet, FCN, and MLP. The results show that InceptionResNet achieves superior accuracy on 49 of 85 datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling diverse and complex time series data. This work highlights the potential of integrating multiscale feature extraction and deep residual learning to advance the performance of TSC models in practical applications.},

  abstract     = {The nonnegative representation-based classification (NRC) method has attracted increasing attention in the field of face recognition. Building upon collaborative representation (CR), NRC incorporates a nonnegative constraint on the representation coefficients, thereby reducing the contribution of irrelevant training samples and enhancing overall classification performance. Despite these improvements, NRC inherits the same decision-making mechanism as the CR method, resulting in a decoupling of the representation and classification stages. This separation limits the method’s classification effectiveness. Furthermore, the presence of multicollinearity in the nonnegative representation may introduce inaccuracies in classification estimates, further undermining performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the competitive-collaborative nonnegative representation (CCNR) model. CCNR integrates two regularization terms: A competitive constraint and a collaborative constraint. The competitive constraint adopts a residual-based strategy during the classification stage, thereby strengthening the connection between representation and classification. This approach enables training samples from different classes to compete in representing the query sample, significantly improving classification performance. In parallel, the collaborative constraint applies an ℓ 2 -norm regularization to the representation coefficients, enhancing the stability of the model’s solution. Moreover, the CCNR model has been effectively deployed in smart campus environments. Extensive comparative experiments conducted on publicly available face datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, consistently demonstrating its competitive performance.

  abstract     = {Effective proportional–integral–derivative controller tuning is critical for attaining high-performance operation in direct current motor systems, especially when traditional approaches fail under nonlinear or uncertain dynamics. This study conducted a statistically robust comparative analysis of seven evolutionary algorithms for proportional–integral–derivative gain tuning: genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimisation, shuffled frog leaping algorithm, firefly algorithm, artificial bee colony, simulated annealing and invasive weed optimisation algorithm. Simulations were performed in MATLAB/Simulink using two different tuning scenarios: Case 1 (conservative bounds) and Case 2 (aggressive bounds), with the integral time absolute error serving as the primary performance metric. Analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's d were employed to ensure statistical validity. The results revealed distinct trade-offs among the algorithms. Particle swarm optimisation achieved the best overall performance, with a minimal integral time absolute error mean of 190.54 in Case 2, low volatility and a moderate execution time of 1200.19 s. The invasive weed optimisation algorithm was the fastest algorithm, with execution times of 285.76 and 371.43 s in Cases 1 and 2, respectively, but it exhibited higher integral time absolute error variability. Simulated annealing and the firefly algorithm yielded the lowest integral time absolute error means (158.74 and 160.22, respectively) in Case 1, but they required the highest computational time (up to 20,567.84 s for simulated annealing). In contrast, the artificial bee colony performed the worst, with a Case 2 integral time absolute error mean of 422.38 and significant gain inconsistency. Statistical analysis with analysis of variance, Tukey's honestly significant difference and Cohen's d revealed the significance of the differences. This work provides evidence-based guidance for selecting evolutionary algorithms in proportional–integral–derivative tuning based on system priorities. A hybrid invasive weed optimisation algorithm–particle swarm optimisation framework is proposed as a promising future direction, combining the rapid global search of invasive weed optimisation algorithm with the reliable convergence of particle swarm optimisation for real-time, high-precision control. DC motors power many everyday systems, from robots to electric vehicles. To control them effectively, engineers use PID controllers, but tuning these controllers can be difficult. This study compared seven computer algorithms inspired by natural processes to find the best way to tune PID settings. Results showed that Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) gave the most reliable overall performance, while Invasive Weed Optimisation (IWOA) was fastest but less consistent. The study provides practical guidance on choosing the right method based on priorities.},
