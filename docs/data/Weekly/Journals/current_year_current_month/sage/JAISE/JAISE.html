  abstract     = {The concept of smart cities is becoming increasingly popular, driven by the goal of improving residents’ overall quality of life. Effective thermal management is a crucial component of smart cities, especially in light of significant changes in global weather patterns. These changes pose challenges for individuals seeking indoor comfort, particularly in workplaces and schools. Occupants often struggle with extreme temperatures, leading to increased energy consumption due to excessive use of air conditioners and heaters. In this work, we propose a novel edge machine learning-based smart controller for air conditioners to maintain user-preferred thermal comfort levels while minimizing energy consumption. The trained long short-term memory model is embedded in a mobile application designed to predict the predicted mean vote (PMV) based on temperature setpoints and the PMV index. Through this mobile application, personalized parameters such as clothing insulation, metabolic rate, and other environmental factors are communicated to the controller. The performance of the smart controller in maintaining PMV-based temperature setpoints for cooling is compared with fixed setpoints. The results reveal that by utilizing PMV-based setpoints for male occupants, the smart controller reduces energy consumption by 38.14% compared to a fixed setpoint of 26°C and by 60.68% compared to 25°C, while maintaining the user-preferred thermal comfort level.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing development of applications in smart homes, healthcare, and personal fitness, a broad scientific community has identified human activity recognition (HAR) as a critical study issue. This paper introduces a unique hybrid deep learning architecture for efficient human activity identification that combines multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The suggested CNN–MLP model provides a robust solution for HAR problems by leveraging the feature extraction capabilities of CNNs and the classification prowess of MLPs. Four different datasets were employed to comprehensively assess the model’s performance: WISDM, PAMAP2, and UCI HAR datasets for smartphone-based HAR, and the CASAS Aruba dataset that provided a novel perspective on activity detection in a home context, based on smart homes, while the smartphone-based UCI HAR, WISDM, and PAMAP2 datasets offered a variety of activity data. Across all datasets, our hybrid design outperformed all previous benchmarks, achieving high accuracy rates. These results underscore the model’s adaptability and efficiency in handling diverse sensor data types and activity scenarios. Furthermore, the model’s robustness and generalizability, demonstrated by its consistent performance across multiple datasets, establish it as a significant contribution to the field of HAR.},

  abstract     = {Virtual education (online education or e-learning) is a form of education where the primary mode of instruction is through digital platforms and the Internet. This approach offers flexibility and accessibility, making it attractive to many students. Many institutes also offer virtual professional courses for business and working professionals. However, ensuring the reachability of courses and evaluating students’ attentiveness presents significant challenges for educators teaching virtually. Various research works have been proposed to evaluate students’ attentiveness using facial landmarks, facial expressions, eye movements, gestures, postures, etc. However, no method has been proposed for real-time analysis and evaluation. This paper introduces a multi-modal student attentiveness detection (MMSAD) model designed to analyze and evaluate real-time class videos using two modalities: facial expressions and landmarks. Using a lightweight deep learning model, the model analyzes students’ emotions from facial expressions and identifies when a person is speaking during an online class by examining lip movements from facial landmarks. The model evaluates students’ emotions using five benchmark datasets, achieving accuracy rates of 99.05% on extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+), 87.5% on RAF-DB, 78.12% on Facial Emotion Recognition-2013 (FER-2013), 98.50% on JAFFE, and 88.01% on KDEF. The model identifies individuals speaking during the class using real-time class videos. The results from these modalities are used to predict attentiveness, categorizing students as either attentive or inattentive.},

  abstract     = {With the increasing application of construction robots on construction sites, autonomous path planning in unstructured and uneven construction sites has become an urgent challenge. Current path planning approaches face several issues, including prolonged computation times, low efficiency, and redundant nodes, often resulting in impractical paths for robots. Addressing these concerns, this study introduces a global path planning method based on an enhanced A* algorithm to ensure safe and robust navigation of construction robots in such challenging environments. The Improved A* algorithm initially incorporates a bidirectional alternating search strategy to expedite computational speed. Subsequently, it employs path node filtering to mitigate issues associated with bidirectional search and reduce the number of critical nodes, thereby enhancing search efficiency. Furthermore, the introduction of slope constraints decreases the robot's climbing and tilting angles, augmenting the safety of the planned paths. Finally, the paths are smoothed using Bézier curve fitting, facilitating better motion control for the robots. The efficacy of the improved algorithm was validated through experiments on elevation maps with varying terrain and obstacle densities. Simulation results indicate that, compared to the traditional A* algorithm, the Improved A* algorithm reduced computation time by 71.05% to 82.90% and the number of critical nodes by 51.94% to 70.53%, while only increasing the path length by 14.6% to 37.84%. Additionally, there was a significant reduction in climbing and tilting angles, and the paths have become smoother. Therefore, this method not only improves efficiency while generating safe and reliable paths in unstructured and uneven construction sites, but also enables robots to adapt to complex environments, and promotes automation and intelligent construction processes.},

WA by extracting the background information of facial expression images while focusing on texture information, thus achieving better feature extraction. The MF mechanism is added at the connection points of layers in ResNet, where features extracted from each upper layer are fused using different-sized convolutional kernels and input into the lower layer. Finally, a viewpoint-invariant Capsule Net is used as the classification network after receiving the feature maps. The proposed WAMF model was applied to two publicly available datasets, CK+ and Jaffe, achieving excellent recognition rates of 98.98% and 98.46%, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The ubiquitous use of mobile devices in recent years has enabled learning more about human behavior. This study uses mobile phone data, point-of-interest data, and publicly available socioeconomic indicators to present an integrated analysis of individual socioeconomic and behavioral profiles in Lisbon. To effectively segment users and identify mobility patterns, we employ multiple clustering techniques tailored to different data types: varied density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (VDBSCAN) detects meaningful places by identifying clusters of varying densities in mobile phone data, while K-Means and K-Modes cluster numerical and categorical data, respectively, to determine socioeconomic status (SES) and categorize work environments. Our analysis identifies four primary groups of individuals, each distinguished by different SES and behavioral tendencies, ranging from practical and family-oriented to lifestyle-driven patterns. The results show that SES strongly influences mobility behaviors and interactions with urban spaces, revealing disparities in housing access, services, and work environments between different population segments. These findings highlight the interaction between mobility, social habits, and economic conditions, offering key insights for urban planning and strategies to mitigate the impacts of gentrification. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities to support inclusive policymaking, transportation planning, and spatial equity strategies, fostering more accessible and equitable urban environments.},
