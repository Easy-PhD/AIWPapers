  abstract     = {In this paper, a multi-strategy improved African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (MIAVOA) is proposed address the drawback of premature convergence of the African Vulture Optimization Algorithm (AVOA). Firstly, the gaussian quasi reflection-based learning strategy is introduced, which improves the vulture initial population’s randomness and diversity. Then, the adaptive control strategy is used to enhance the search ability of the algorithm and avoid premature convergence. Furthermore, the elite candidate pooling strategy is designed in the exploitation phase, which expands the discovery fields for the optimal solution and reinforces the ability to escape from local optima. Finally, the formula of starvation factor is modified to balance the exploitative and explorative abilities of algorithm. MIAVOA is compared with seven state-of-the-art meta-heuristics on CEC 2022 and 23 classical test functions. It is observed that the proposed algorithm significant outperforms the other compared algorithms in terms of convergence and accuracy on the majority of benchmark functions. In addition, four engineering design problems and mobile robot path planning problem are utilized to evaluate the performance of MIAVOA. The experimental results demonstrate MIAVOA is effective and can achieve better applicability in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract     = {Millions of lives could be saved annually if liver tumours could be detected early with computed tomography. But it's a huge strain for radiologists to read hundreds or even tens of these CT scans. Therefore, developing an autonomous, rapid, and reliable method of reading, detecting, and assessing CT scans is important. However, extracting the liver region from CT scans is a bottleneck for any approach. This paper introduces a three-part automatic process. Initial processing includes noise suppression and image enhancement. Optimized Bi-lateral Filtering is used to carry it out; in this case, the process's control parameters are optimized using the Monarch butterfly optimization method. After that, automatic liver segmentation and lesion identification are performed. Mask-Region-based Convolutional Neural Network segment liver from the pre-processed images. Then a new generator network named LiverNet is used to detect tumors within the liver. Finally, an Enhanced Swin Transformer Network employing Adversarial Propagation distinguishes between malignant and benign liver lesions. Positive developments were discovered as a result of the inquiry. Expert results are associated with the consequences of segmentation and analysis. The classifier makes a relatively accurate tumour differentiation and gives the radiologist a second opinion.},

Many types of image-processing software are being developed to extract meaningful information from medical photos to enhance patient diagnosis. Simultaneous segmentation and object detection is a computer vision task that combines object detection and image segmentation, two related functions usually done separately. It involves detecting objects in an image and generating a segmentation mask for each object. This assortment of tasks can enhance the precision and velocity of object detection by providing more accurate object boundaries and, in some cases, eliminating the need for post-processing steps. The image segmentation module in YONET handles intermediate abstract representations and utilizes them as input for object detection. YONET will be trained on bounding boxes that delineate the detected objects and pixel-wise segmentation information. The resultant system is optimized for segmenting an optionally distinct class of structures and detecting a class of objects.},

  abstract     = {RGBT target tracking is a significant downstream task in the field of object tracking. However, compared to visible light target tracking, RGBT target tracking faces the challenge of smaller datasets, making it difficult to achieve performance levels comparable to those achieved in visible light target tracking. To address how to effectively combine the complementary characteristics of visible and thermal modalities, as well as how to fully leverage the superior performance of models trained on visible light target tracking tasks, while also aiming for lower computational costs and higher tracking effectiveness, a dual-prompt complementary fusion strategy for an RGBT tracking network is proposed. Drawing on the concept of prompt learning, this network aims to extend the efficient performance of visible light target tracking to the RGBT target tracking domain. In its implementation, the prompt module inputs both visible and thermal modality information as dual prompts into the backbone network, where the network utilizes these prompts to generate new, enriched prompt information at each layer. Subsequently, an information enhancement fusion module enhances the acquired prompt information and refeeds it into the backbone network, aiming to improve the tracking accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on GTOT, RGBT234 and LasHeR datasets show that the tracking accuracy (PR) and success rate (SR) of the network reach 93.1%/76.8%, 84.4%/62.4% and 66.8%/53.8%, respectively, which is improved compared with the current mainstream RGBT target tracking network, which verifies the effectiveness of the network.},

To obtain fine-grained features, we employ the multilingual pre-trained language model xlm-RoBERTa to extract the CLS vector as overall semantic features, integrating with statistical features log rank, probability, and cumulative probability for detection. Moreover, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) serves to interpret the decision-making process. The experimental results demonstrate significant advancements over baselines, notably with the F1 score improvements exceeding 10% and 5% on the English and Chinese HC3 sentence-level datasets, respectively. Our proposed method exhibits higher generalization for advanced LLMs and out-of-domain datasets with a 91.13% F1 score, thereby providing a more robust solution for detecting generated text.},

This study introduces an advanced system utilizing the EmoBank dataset, which contains text annotated with six basic emotions from diverse sources like social media, narratives, news articles, and movie scripts, ensuring accurate labeling through automated algorithms and manual annotation. Extensive preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, lowercasing, stop words removal, stemming, lemmatization, punctuation removal, handling special characters and numbers, text normalization, and encoding, prepare the text for analysis. Data augmentation methods such as random insertion, deletion, swapping, synonym replacement, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3, BERT, and RoBERTa enrich the dataset. Feature extraction combines word embeddings with self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual and semantic information. The ANOVA-RFE Fusion technique is applied for feature selection, while the Emotion Fusion Ensemble (EFE) method enhances classification by combining Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, XGBoost, Extra Trees, SVM, and K-NN. Systematic experimentation and hyperparameter tuning using grid search validate the system's performance. Notably, the combination of GPT-3+WE+ANOVA-RFE+EFE achieved 89% accuracy before tuning and 94% after tuning. This research underscores the critical role of integrated processing, augmentation, and ensemble learning in advancing emotion recognition, suggesting future exploration of emerging language models, novel augmentation techniques, and domain specific adaptations for developing more accurate and robust systems.},

To address the above issues, a fuzzy controller was designed to regulate the HVAC system, and an improved snake optimizer (ISO) was proposed to optimize the membership function of the fuzzy controller in this study. In the ISO algorithm, the parameter Threshold of the snake optimizer (SO) was dynamically adjusted, and the snake egg-hatching formula was improved. Benchmark function tests show that the convergence speed and optimization accuracy of ISO are superior to those of the established comparison algorithms. Furthermore, simulation experiments indicate that the ISO-optimized HVAC system has a temperature error of 0 and a humidity ratio error of less than 1.5% compared to competing methods. In addition, the ISO-optimized HVAC system achieves a 40.8% reduction in annual energy consumption.},

Therefore, it can collect more comprehensive fuzzy information in decision-making issues, which makes PDHFS has a wide range of applications in practice. The distance, similarity and entropy measures (EMs) of PDHFSs were studied. Due to the particularity of PDHFS, the length of MD and NMD of two probabilistic dual hesitation fuzzy elements (PDHFEs) are often different. To define the distance measure more expediently, many current studies need to add fresh elements to ensure that the length of corresponding elements in MD and NMD are the same, which will destroy the original information of the elements. In order to overcome this disadvantage, this paper defined some novel PDHF distance measures without adding elements. Some novel PDHF similarity measures were defined through the complementary relationship between distance and similarity measures based on the newly proposed PDHF distance measures. The fuzziness of a given PDHFS can be measured by the similarity measure between it and its complement. Based on the property, some novel PDHF EMs were proposed. Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and rationality of these novel information measures.},

  abstract     = {Recommender systems that mine users’ intentions to explore their potential interaction preferences have received increasing attention. However, the existing research on intent recommendation has some limitations. On one hand, the extant studies only consider users’ historical interaction information and the sparse interactions cannot reflect users’ potential interaction intention; on the other hand, they do not consider the changes in users’ kinematic and static intentions over time and the importance of users’ intention disentanglement representation, which makes it impossible for the general intention recommendation model to obtain a better representation of the intention. We propose a multitask recommendation model with dynamic and static intent integration and de-entanglement. The model mines users’ dynamic and static intents and then combines them with regularization to model the independence of the intents, encouraging the differences between the intents. Meanwhile, to further alleviate the data sparsity problem, this study additionally constructs user–user and item–item graphs using four different similarity measures, such as cosine similarity and mutual information, applies graph convolutional networks to learn about the three graphs, and then captures the complementarity between different graphs using a graph-level cross-attention mechanism. Extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies on three public datasets demonstrate that DSI-ID consistently outperforms all baseline methods, achieving a 3.5%–7.4% improvement in recommendation performance over the best baseline.},

The self-attention mechanism (SAM) of this model focused on the correlations among data elements of the minority class. The degree of correlation was first obtained by calculating the attention scores, which enabled the effective extraction of the distribution characteristics of the data. Subsequently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to generate samples with high similarity to reduce data imbalances. Finally, a CNN classification model was constructed to train and predict the samples. The experimental results showed that the F1-score , G-mean , and area under PRC curve ( AUPRC ) of the model were considerably better than those of the other imbalanced data classification methods.

After analyzing the characteristics of interactions in the (dependently weighted) Bonferroni mean (BM) operators, the quadratic-polynomial (POLY2)-based classifier, and the factorization-machine (FM)-based classifier, we introduce the WBM operators to capture the independent importance of weighted feature interactions among input arguments. These operators are a general generalization of the existing BM operators and the crossover parts of the POLY2-based and FM-based classifiers. Then, the WBM-based classifiers and their special cases, namely the WBM-based classifiers based on the factorization machines (abbreiated as FM _ WBM-based classifiers), are constructed to handle the (in)dependent importance of weighted feature interactions. Extensive experimental results on the synthetic datasets and four UCI machine-learning datasets verify the effectiveness of these proposed classifiers.},
