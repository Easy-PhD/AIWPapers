  abstract     = {This work presents an enhanced identification procedure utilising bioinformatics data, employing optimisation techniques to tackle crucial difficulties in healthcare operations. A system model is designed to tackle essential difficulties by analysing major contributions, including risk factors, data integration and interpretation, error rates and data wastage and gain. Furthermore, all essential aspects are integrated with deep learning optimisation, encompassing data normalisation and hybrid learning methodologies to efficiently manage large-scale data, resulting in personalised healthcare solutions. The implementation of the suggested technology in real time addresses the significant disparity between data-driven and healthcare applications, hence facilitating the seamless integration of genetic insights. The contributions are illustrated in real time, and the results are presented through simulation experiments encompassing 4 scenarios and 2 case studies. Consequently, the comparison research reveals that the efficacy of bioinformatics for enhancing routes stands at 7%, while complexity diminish to 1%, thereby indicating that healthcare operations can be transformed by computational biology.},

  abstract     = {The spinal diseases commonly faced by people in the 19th century included intervertebral disc degeneration, tuberculosis and congenital defects that resulted in neurological impairment and global disability. To address these issues, cervical spine surgery was performed. Modern techniques currently used in spine surgery include interbody devices, pedicle screws, artificial discs and bone grafts. The postoperative complications clinically reported during follow-up include nonunion and implant subsidence, which remain significant drawbacks. The objective of this study is to develop a 3-dimensional finite element model of the C2-C7 cervical spine and validate it against existing experimental studies. The loading conditions considered for this study include a compressive preload of 50 N and a 1 Nm moment applied to the C2 vertebra, with the C7 vertebra fixed at the bottom. In this study, the biomechanical alterations of 4 different cage morphologies were analysed using finite element analysis. Valeo cages with 4 distinct designs were implanted at the C5-C6 level, and physiological motion at the surgical site was studied. Cage subsidence and migration, which can lead to adjacent segment disc degeneration, were also examined. Subsidence was primarily attributed to higher stress encountered in the cage, so stress distribution within the cages was evaluated. Additionally, stress distribution in the anterior plate and screws was analysed. The study concludes that introducing anterior plate and screw fixation helps prevent cage subsidence. Physiological motion at the surgical level was reduced compared to the intact model. Adjacent disc stress was also evaluated and found to be lower than in the intact model.},

In the present study, the epidemic patterns of SARS-COV-2 disease have been investigated from the point of view of mathematical modeling. Also, the effect of quarantine has been considered. This mathematical model is designed in the form of fractional calculations along with a model predictive control (MPC) to monitor this model. The fractional-order model has the memory and hereditary properties of the system, which can provide more adjustable parameters to the designer. Because the MPC can predict future outputs, it can overcome the conditions and events that occur in the future. The results of the simulations show that the proposed nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) of fractional-order has a lower mean squared error in susceptible people compared to the optimal control of fractional-order (~3.6e-04 vs. 47.4). This proposed NMPC of fractional-order can be used for other models of epidemics.},

Nevertheless, CNN and BiLSTM architectures provide automatic feature learning, enhancing ECG classification accuracy. The current research work puts forward a framework integrating CNN with CBAM and BiLSTM layers for the purpose of extracting valuable features and classifying ECG signals. The model classifies heartbeats according to the AAMI EC57 standard into 5 categories: normal beats (N), supraventricular ectopic beats (S), ventricular ectopic beats (V), fusion beats (F), and unknown beats (Q). To tackle uneven class distributions, SMOTE synthesizes new samples, making the model more robust. Evaluation on MIT-BIH arrhythmia database yields remarkable results with 99.20% accuracy, 97.50% sensitivity, 99.81% specificity, and 98.29% mean F 1 score. Deep learning methods have great potential to alleviate clinicians’ workload and improve diagnostic accuracy of cardiac diseases.},

  abstract     = {In this study, reliability methods were demonstrated as a promising approach in medical engineering by identifying the most significant muscle forces affecting femoral stress. First, the finite element method (FEM) in Abaqus software was used to model the effects of 10 muscle and joint forces across various regions of the femur. Then, using the response surface methodology (RSM), and examining the effect coefficients of each joint and muscle force, the hip joint reaction force with an impact coefficient of 210.97 was identified as the most effective force on bone stress. After that, the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius muscle forces were ranked second and third in terms of stress effect with coefficients of 66.6 and 34.47. This study showed that the anterior femoral muscles have a significant effect on stress compared to the posterior femoral muscles. RSM enables faster and more precise identification of joint and muscle forces influencing femoral stresses compared to conventional methods. This innovative approach not only increased the understanding of biomechanical phenomena, but also provided a more efficient tool for investigating and optimizing such processes in biomedical engineering applications.},

This study focuses on reducing the acoustic noise produced inside the cylindrical shell of the scanner, where the patient is located. Vibration modes are generated by eddy currents in the cylindrical shell induced by gradient magnetic fields. Additionally, the scanner wall is typically joined to the gradient spiral cylinder, causing vibrations to be transmitted to the wall and thereby producing extra sound waves. The present study investigates methods for mitigating noise from the scanner wall and reducing the transmission noise from the spiral gradient cylinder. Numerical methods and practical solutions for lowering acoustic noise in MRI gradient coils are explored. A 20 mm uniform absorber is demonstrated as an effective design for significantly reducing acoustic noise in the frequency range 0 to 3 kHz. Finally, numerical analysis of gradient cycles yields solutions that lower both vibration and noise levels.},

  abstract     = {Tiny Artificial Intelligence (Tiny AI) is transforming resource-constrained embedded systems, particularly in e-health applications, by introducing a shift in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and its integration with the Internet of Things (IoT). Unlike conventional machine learning (ML), which demands substantial processing power, TinyML strategically delegates processing requirements to the cloud infrastructure, allowing lightweight models to run on embedded devices. This study aimed to (i) Develop a TinyML workflow that details the steps for model creation and deployment in resource-constrained environments and (ii) apply the workflow to e-health applications for the real-time detection of epileptic seizures using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The methodology employs a dataset of 4097 EEG recordings per patient, each 23.5 seconds long, from 500 patients, to develop a robust and resilient model. The model was deployed using TinyML on microcontrollers tailored to hardware with limited resources. TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) efficiently runs ML models on small devices, such wearables. Simulation outcomes demonstrated significant performance, particularly in predicting epileptic seizures, with the ExtraTrees Classifier achieving a notable 99.6% Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the validation set. Because of its superior performance, the ExtraTrees Classifier was selected as the preferred model. For the optimized TinyML model, the accuracy remained practically unchanged, whereas inference time was significantly reduced. Additionally, the converted model had a smaller size of 256 KB, approximately ten times smaller, making it suitable for microcontrollers with a capacity of no more than 1 MB. These findings highlight the potential of TinyML to significantly enhance healthcare applications by enabling real-time, energy-efficient decision-making directly on local devices. This is especially valuable in scenarios with limited computing resources or during emergencies, as it reduces latency, ensures privacy, and operates without reliance on cloud infrastructure. Moreover, by reducing the size of training datasets needed, TinyML helps lower overall costs and minimizes the risk of overfitting, making it an even more cost-effective and reliable solution for healthcare innovations.},
