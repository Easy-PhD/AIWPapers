  abstract     = {The advent of location information platforms based on global positioning systems has led to a proliferation of spatiotemporal trajectory data, which has, in turn, made the analysis of such data available to a broad range of applications, including traffic prediction, route planning, and trajectory similarity computation. Traditional methods for calculating trajectory similarity often suffer from high computational costs due to quadratic time complexity, particularly when dealing with large datasets. To this end, deep learning-based approaches to trajectory similarity learning have been proposed, with a view to offering enhanced efficiency and adaptability in comparison with traditional methods. However, these methods primarily focus on spatial trajectory similarity and fail to capture important temporal periodicity. Moreover, most of them directly use recurrent neural networks to obtain trajectory representations, while ignoring the spatial proximity information between neighboring regions. To address these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced spatiotemporal trajectory network, named GST, which integrates both spatial and temporal information to effectively learn trajectory similarity. Specifically, our model incorporates a graph neural network to capture the spatial proximity relationships and a time-embedding module to model the temporal periodicity information, thereby providing a more comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory representation learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on 2 real-life datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spatiotemporal learning mechanism.},

  abstract     = {From smart cities to healthcare, the internet of things (IoT) has transformed numerous industries. However, this expansion has raised security concerns, particularly cyberattacks. Traditional IoT intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have high false-positive rates and low detection accuracy due to IoT devices and traffic patterns. To overcome these challenges, this research proposes an intelligent-computing-based time series IDS that utilizes sophisticated data augmentation, signal transformation, and deep learning methods. The system begins by augmenting minority-class samples using conditional generative adversarial networks to handle class imbalance. The augmented dataset is then transformed into signal representations based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients, allowing the model to capture both the frequency and temporal characteristics of network traffic. Finally, a hybrid convolutional-neural-network–long-short-term-memory (CNN–LSTM) architecture is trained to identify anomalous behaviors with enhanced accuracy and lower false-positive rates. The proposed model utilizes the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity CICIoT2023 dataset, which is widely used for network security experiments. The results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional deep learning models in terms of accuracy, precision, and false-positive rate. Specifically, the proposed system improves accuracy by 5% to 10% across different attack types while reducing false-positive rates considerably. The research presents a detailed exploration of the advantages of signal transformation and explains how the CNN and LSTM models complement each other in detecting anomalies. This framework addresses the pressing need for intelligent time series analysis in cybersecurity through the introduction of a scalable and interpretable IDS solution specifically designed for IoT environments.},

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising adsorbents, yet atomic-level insights into Xe and Kr adsorption remain limited. Here, we report the first application of high-field solid-state 83 Kr nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), alongside extensive 129 Xe NMR, to investigate gas adsorption in eight MOFs representing three design strategies: ultramicroporous one-dimensional–channel MOFs with pore sizes matching noble gas diameters, functionalized MOFs, and MOFs with open metal sites. Single-gas and coadsorption studies reveal distinct adsorption sites, guest-host interactions, and gas dynamics in each MOF. Most MOFs retain crystallinity after exposure to 60-kilogray γ radiation. Several radiation-sensitive MOFs exhibit enhanced stability in the presence of Xe, suggesting that Xe adsorption enhances framework stability and may broaden the range of MOFs usable under γ radiation in nuclear off-gas separation. These findings offer valuable molecular-level design insights.},

However, once prototyped, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)–based silicone elastomer is limited in mechanical strength and programmable spatial construction due to the flexible polymer matrix and mismatched interface with other materials. We propose a mechanically strengthened PDMS-based origami structure (MSOS) via polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/acetone solution swelling. The planar elastomer precursor can be swollen-folded into programmable spatial construction based on mechanically strengthened creases during solvent diffusion and de-gelatinization. This strengthened crease is induced by a hierarchical shrink-fitting based on solute molecular chain insertion and a seamless coupling interface between elastomer microstructures and solidified PMMA. We present a programmable MSOS to support a load more than 58,100 times of its own weight and a pillbug-inspired ringbot to resist heavy impact. Our work provides a strategy toward customized mechanically strengthened soft material for developing functional structural architectures and soft origami robots.},

It achieves dual-modal imaging at a 10-hertz frame rate and completes a whole-breast scan in 12 seconds, providing penetration up to 5 centimeters in vivo. In a clinical study involving 170 patients with 186 breast tumors, we developed a diagnostic model leveraging combined photoacoustic and ultrasound features.

The inner layer also exhibits superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, synergizing therapeutic effects with bacteria.

Here, we report a multibit programming spine structure strategy to create a magnetorheological metamaterial with high-density, reprogrammable, and visually readable information encoding capacities. Inspired by spine features, the magnetorheological spine beams, exhibiting substantial stiffness variation by bistable transition, meticulously conceived the stiffness reprogrammable magnetorheological metamaterial (SRMM). The SRMM exhibits a large stiffness conversion capability (40-fold) and high-density information encoding performance (10-bit). Coupling with the mechanoluminescent materials, the mechanical information achieves visualization conveniently, which is attributed to the conversion of the stiffness data into optical signals through optical energy level transitions. Such stiffness-based magnetorheological metamaterial offers expansive information encoding spaces, stable operation capabilities, and convenient readout approaches, advancing mechanical information processing system design for extreme environments.},

Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the MurJ/Lys M (JM) complex at 3.09-angstrom resolution, revealing that Lys M interacts with the crevasse between TM2 and TM7 of MurJ, locking MurJ in an outward-facing conformation, with Lys M acting like a wedge. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis and pull-down assays revealed key residues responsible for Lys M function, and molecular dynamics simulations showed that Lys M stabilizes MurJ’s outward-facing state.

The cholesterol in current LNP formulations promotes their uptake by hepatocytes, while the polyethylene glycol-modified (PEGylated) lipids induce PEG immunogenicity, further reducing the efficacy in the setting of repeated administrations. We develop a three-component (ThrCo) LNP by replacing cholesterol and PEGylated lipids in Pfizer-BioNTech LNPs with zwitterionic pyridine carboxybetaine (PyCB) ionizable lipids (ILs), achieving ~70% lower liver accumulation and a 4.5-fold increase in spleen-specific mRNA translation. PyCB ILs enhance LNP hydrophilicity, stabilizing the outer membrane to compensate for cholesterol removal. PyCB groups also exhibit strong protonation at endosomal pH, facilitating mRNA translation. The zwitterionic surface of ThrCo LNP reduces protein adsorption, thereby preventing the accelerated blood clearance effect caused by PEGylated lipids following repeated administrations. Thus, ThrCo LNP–based vaccines efficiently deliver mRNA to splenic antigen-presenting cells, boosting immune responses and improving therapeutic outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted attention due to their high theoretical capacity of 1675 mAh g −1 . However, a knowledge gap remains regarding nanoscale lithium sulfide (Li 2 S) reactions, limiting full S utilization and rational catalyst design. Here, we show how Li 2 S nanoclusters transform and distribute under operation using in situ atomic force microscopy, providing the structure-(re)activity relationships. Comparing to the lamellar structures formed at noncatalyzed electrodes, Li 2 S deposited at Pt catalytic electrode exhibited a spherical morphology. The zero-order reaction kinetics was captured on catalytic surfaces, differing from noncatalyzed electrodes. The electrodeposition of Li 2 S follows the overpotential-driven progressive and instantaneous nucleation processes, showing a promoted deposition and reversible dissolution at the overpotential of 80 mV. The Li 2 S transformation under high polysulfides concentrations indicated that an increase of catalytic sites and uniform distribution of Li 2 S would be critical for practical Li-S batteries. Our work provides fundamental insights into Li 2 S reaction kinetics, advancing the development of energy storage systems.},

Ion and molecule transport through SEIs largely determines the cycling stability of high-energy rechargeable metal and metal-ion batteries, where electroreduction during charging often occurs beyond electrolyte stability limits. We report nanometer-thick gradient zwitterionic polymer (G-ZWP) interphases, synthesized via a scalable solvent-free method, to regulate transport and electroreduction kinetics at Li-metal anodes, achieving stable cycling. The synthesis combines initiated chemical vapor deposition and diffusion-limited vapor derivatization to form a zwitterionic top layer with high ionic conductivity and an inner covalently cross-linked layer blocking solvent access while remaining stable at reducing potentials. Cu substrates with G-ZWP interphases show >2000-hour cycling at 1 milliampere per square centimeter [6 milliampere hours per square centimeter (mA·hour/cm 2 )]. The interphases also enable long-term cycling of Li batteries (N/P = 0 to 2.5) and Li–dry-air batteries (10 mA·hour/cm 2 ) and stabilize Na/Zn electrodeposition.},

  abstract     = {Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic RNA-protein assemblies that form in response to cellular stress and must be efficiently disassembled to restore normal cell function. Valosin-containing protein (VCP), an enzyme implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, is essential for SG disassembly, but whether and how this process is coordinated with SG assembly remains unclear. Here, we identify the VCP cofactor, Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL) as a key regulator linking SG assembly and disassembly. ASPL promotes SG assembly by facilitating biomolecular condensation of Ras guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein-binding protein (G3BP) and stabilizing its interactions with other SG proteins. ASPL also facilitates phosphorylation and activation of VCP by UNC-51-like kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), enabling G3BP extraction and efficient SG disassembly. Pathogenic VCP mutations that disrupt ASPL binding impair SG disassembly, a defect rescued by phosphomimetic mutations or ASPL depletion. Our findings suggest that disruptions in the ASPL-VCP interaction uncouple SG assembly and disassembly, representing a potential mechanism underlying VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases.},

Here, we integrated biochemistry, multiscale cryo–electron microscopy, and AlphaFold modeling to investigate the architecture of the centriole. Using an improved centriole isolation method, we determined the structure of the A-C linker bound to microtubule triplets, which revealed how the A-C linker cross-links microtubules and integrates with the B-C junction. We found marked changes in the structure and composition of the A-C linker that correlate with the presence of other centriolar modules, including the pinhead, cartwheel, and inner scaffold. Our findings show that the A-C linker is a highly integrated component of the centriole whose polymorphism may orchestrate the assembly of spatially distinct centriolar modules, and provide a framework for dissecting the biology of centrioles.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the precise neural mechanisms governing the regulation of contagious pain in response to diverse environmental stressors. Here, we report that early life maternal separation (MS) precipitates impairments in the pain contagion between familiar partners. Specifically, we identify the indispensable role of glutamatergic projections from the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) to the prelimbic cortex (PrL) for the development of vicarious pain hypersensitivity. MS dampens activation of the PVT → PrL pathway during social interactions between observer and painful demonstrator. Augmenting the excitability or activity of the PVT → PrL circuit through chemogenetic interventions or tactile stimulation resembling social touch significantly ameliorates the MS-evoked contagious pain deficits. Collectively, our findings delineate a neural circuitry substrate underlying the loss of contagious pain stemming from MS and propose a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating empathic impairments associated with early life adversity.},

  abstract     = {High-temperature stress in plant stamens frequently causes male sterility, limiting crop yields. Gene duplication resulting from polyploidization offers insights into plant adaptation to environmental stress. Here, we reveal that extensive duplication of GhRALF30L , which encodes an intrinsically disordered small peptide, contributes to thermotolerance in cotton male reproductive organs. Polyploidization has driven the formation of 23 GhRALF30L genes in allotetraploid cotton, whereas only four or five homologs are identified in its two diploid ancestors. Expression and functional analyses confirm that GhRALF30L regulates thermotolerance in a dosage-dependent manner, with reduced dosage decreasing heat resistance. Under heat stress, GhRALF30L interacts with GhFERA1/GhCAPA1 and enhances their condensation at the plasma membrane, which activates heat stress responses by up-regulating the expression of heat shock factors ( HSFs ), heat shock proteins ( HSPs ), and reactive oxygen species scavenging genes. Our findings demonstrate that the GhRALF30L gene cluster, resulting from polyploidization, confers thermotolerance through facilitating the condensation of GhFERA1/GhCAPA1.},

Glial cells regulate ionic homeostasis, which is essential for neuronal function and survival. Here, we investigated the role of glial ion channel CLH-1, which is a glial pH regulator, in aging. We found that loss of clh-1 extends life span, improves stress resistance, reduces neuronal damage, and extends health span. These effects are linked to protective pathways, including those for oxidative stress and autophagy, and depend on the DAF-16/FoxO transcription factor. Notably, by knocking down and overexpressing the carbonic anhydrase cah-4 , we show that it is the glial alkalinization caused by loss of clh-1 that mediates these protective effects.

We developed an automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking system to continuously collect behavioral data from entire colonies, monitoring 102 individuals from five colonies for 30 days. Based on behavioral parameters, we statistically identified distinct behavioral phenotypes, comprising one cluster for breeders and six clusters for nonbreeders. Breeders formed strong social bonds, consistently remaining close in activity rhythm synchrony, spatial proximity, and directional following. In contrast, nonbreeders exhibited behavioral heterogeneity according to their cluster: One cluster avoided other active nonbreeders, whereas another cluster attracted frequent following.

Analyzing two decades of seismicity (2005–2024) across three crustal sectors, we distinguished magma recharge from the mantle, its transfer and storage at intermediate depths, and final ascent to the surface. Moreover, we found that b value time variations can precede geochemical anomalies from magma ascent and its eruption by a few months.

The machine learning strategy identified microdroplet size as the key parameter controlling electric field strength, product yield, and selectivity. In our lab-based scaled-up system, microdroplets <10 micrometers improved performance by four to seven orders of magnitude over bulk-phase systems, achieving ~99% methanol selectivity. Strong interfacial electric fields stabilize intermediates and modulate carbon-oxygen bond lengths, directing pathways to high-value products.

The multilayered A-Textile features a composite coating of three-dimensional SnS 2 nanoflowers (NFs) embedded in silicone rubber to enhance charge capture and transfer, along with a SnS 2 NFs–decorated graphite-like carbonized textile for charge accumulation and preservation. This design maximizes the charge density on the textile, achieving a 21-volt output, 1.2 volts per pascal sensitivity, 1-hertz resolution, and a wide sound response frequency range of 80 to 900 hertz. Using a well-trained DL model, the A-Textile precisely classifies and visualizes voice commands for internet-of-things control and cloud information access. Furthermore, we demonstrate its integration with ChatGPT, providing an intuitive interface for engaging with generative AI services to perform sophisticated tasks.},

  abstract     = {Electrostatic energy harvesting and storage technologies for next-generation wearable devices are typically constrained by slow carrier dynamics and dielectric polarization delays. Here, we developed a plasma-enabled energy textile (PEET) by emulating the carrier transport mechanism in lightning return strokes. By engineering plasma-treated discharge microchannels, our design enables direct conduction current generation through cascading ionization, overcoming the efficiency limitations of conventional polarization-dependent systems. Under 2-hertz mechanical excitation, the PEET achieves a current density of 2.5 amperes per square centimeter, an average power output of 4.46 watts per square meter per hertz, and an energy conversion efficiency of 19%—two orders of magnitude higher than conventional electrostatic energy harvesting technologies, e.g., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and capacitive systems. This work represents a transformative advance in electrostatic energy harvesting, enabling efficient and scalable wearable energy solutions.},

These dynamics are responsible for dust lifting and atmospheric injection, a vital part of the dust cycle that governs modern Mars’ weather and climate. Here, we use deep learning and two decades’ worth of orbital images to track the global, diurnal, and seasonal migration patterns of dust devils across Mars, providing a distributed characterization of the dynamics of near-surface winds. Across Mars, derived wind stresses systematically exceed those predicted by global circulation models and frequently surpass the threshold required to initiate particle saltation and the lifting of dust. We identify instances of fast-moving dust devils, indicating strong near-surface winds, that are colocated with large-scale dust lifting events and storms. Our observations show that strong near-surface winds are abundant on Mars and play an important role in atmospheric dust sourcing, directly informing more accurate models of Mars’ atmosphere, weather, and climate.},

During normal replication, p21 promotes nascent DNA synthesis alongside the DNA polymerase iota (Pol ι)/p53 complex. When p21 is down-regulated but detectable, nascent DNA tracks are longer and discontinuous and rely on primase and DNA polymerase (PrimPol). With the complete elimination of p21, nascent DNA tracks become shorter and continuous and depend on Pol kappa (κ). Endogenous p21 levels are critical for genomic stability, as both PrimPol- and Pol κ–mediated syntheses can induce chromosomal instability. The residual expression of p21 in p53-null cells influences the involvement of PrimPol or Pol κ in nascent DNA synthesis and subsequent chromosomal instability. Our results demonstrate that endogenous levels of p21 in cycling cells, insufficient for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition, prevent genomic instability through proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding (PCNA), limiting PrimPol and Pol κ’s role in nascent DNA synthesis.},

Mechanistically, photocatalytically generated hydrogen induces robust immunogenic cell death by triggering severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Concurrently, photosynthetic oxygen production and photocatalytic lactic acid depletion collaboratively alleviate immunosuppression within the TME, thereby enhancing cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive cells and promoting the repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to the M1 phenotype. In vivo studies demonstrate that PCC@AuNP not only eradicates primary tumors but also elicits potent systemic antitumor immunity against distant lesions, without observable toxicity to healthy tissues. Collectively, this innovative PCC@AuNP platform offers a safe and effective therapeutic strategy, heralding a pioneering era of cascade-augmented gas-driven cancer immunotherapy with superior precision and biosafety.},

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 integrates innate immune signals following diet-induced obesity to promote glucose homeostasis through the induction of mitophagy. Whereas TRAF6 was dispensable for pancreatic β cell function at baseline, TRAF6 was pivotal for insulin secretion, mitochondrial respiration, and mitophagy following metabolic stress in mouse and human islets. TRAF6 was critical for the recruitment and function of the ubiquitin-mediated (Parkin-dependent) mitophagy machinery. Glucose intolerance induced by TRAF6 deficiency following metabolic stress was reversed by concomitant Parkin deficiency by relieving obstructions in receptor-mediated (Parkin-independent) mitophagy. Our results establish that TRAF6 is vital for traffic through Parkin-mediated mitophagy and implicates TRAF6 in the cross-regulation of ubiquitin- and receptor-mediated mitophagy. Together, we illustrate that β cells engage innate immune signaling to adaptively respond to a diabetogenic environment.},

Overexpression of the immunostimulatory cytokine TNFSF14/LIGHT associates with improved survival and correlates with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients and a clinically relevant model of colorectal liver metastases. We demonstrate that LIGHT monotherapy activates T cells, but also induces T cell exhaustion and the recruitment of immunosuppressive elements. As colorectal liver metastases exhibit high levels of CTLA-4 expression, we combined LIGHT overexpression with anti-CTLA-4, leading to complete tumor control. The combination functions by homing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, inducing tumor antigen-specific T cells, and reversing T cell exhaustion. Whereas both LIGHT overexpression and anti-CTLA-4 increase tumor-promoting macrophages, the combination eliminates this population. The ability of LIGHT overexpression combined with CTLA-4 inhibition to reverse T cell exhaustion and myeloid cell suppression is supported by analysis of complementary patient cohorts and has strong clinical relevance, especially given that liver metastases contribute to immunotherapy resistance across various cancer types.},

They are typically derived from secondary formation, which is generated through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor compounds, such as phenolic compounds. However, information on NAC formation mechanisms remains limited. Here, we found that particulate-phase NAC concentrations were notably affected by relative humidity (RH) in field observations. Smog chamber experiments indicated that RH could influence NAC formation via changes in gaseous water concentration, rather than solely through aerosol liquid water content. Theoretical calculations further clarified that water clusters (WCs), formed from gaseous water, can notably lower reaction energy barriers along the NAC formation pathway, rendering this pathway competitive under atmospheric conditions. Hence, we propose a potential mechanism in which WCs catalyze NAC formation, offering a previously unidentified perspective on atmospheric secondary aerosol formation.},

This study examines the role of B cells and their extracellular vesicles (EVs) in melanoma responses to ICB. Retrospective meta-analyses reveal increased B cell enrichment in ICB responders’ pretreatment. Functional assays show that B cell depletion impairs T cell–mediated tumor cytotoxicity. EVs from melanoma tumors were analyzed, identifying miR-99a-5p in CD19 + EVs as up-regulated in responders. Silencing miR-99a-5p in B cells reduces T cell antitumor activity, suggesting its role in immune modulation. Mechanistically, miR-99a-5p promotes B cell maturation via class-switch recombination.

Genetic perturbation of AMPAR function and optogenetic control bidirectionally shifted the anemo-discrimination learning pace, with contrasting phenotypes observed for odor learning, engagement of inhibitory circuits, and setting the optimal inhibition level for stimulus refinement. Enhanced learning caused by multimodal odor-airflow stimuli at subthreshold levels confirmed the heightened olfactory perception by mechanical stimuli.

The microbiota community determines the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in cancer immunotherapy; however, mechanisms able to improve this function are not known. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) released by the microbiota restricts the sIgA repertoire by limiting T follicular helper (T FH ) cell activity in the Peyer’s patches via stimulation of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor. We show that sIgA amplification by oral administration of the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase corrects enteropathic features of ICB and improves therapeutic efficacy. Consistent with sIgA function in reshaping the gut ecosystem and enhancing ICB, IgA −/− mice did not show any improvement of antitumor response by apyrase administration. Mechanistically, data in mice and patients with cancer suggest that invigorated enterotropic cytotoxic T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CCR9 replenish the tumor microenvironment in a CCL25-mediated manner and control tumor growth, resulting in improved ICB efficacy.},

  abstract     = {A highly periodic electrostatic potential and coherent band transport can emerge in organic molecular crystals, despite weak van der Waals interactions. Although charge carrier mobility in single-crystalline organic semiconductors (OSCs) reaches 10 square centimeters per volt per second (cm 2 V −1 s −1 ), it is predominantly limited by molecular vibrations excited at room temperature. The extent to which mobility in single-crystalline OSCs can be increased remains a central question. Here, we demonstrate charge transport in a clean two-dimensional hole gas (2DHG) in uniaxially strained, single-crystalline OSCs at cryogenic temperatures, with minimized lattice vibrations. Hall effect measurements reveal a mobility of 117 cm 2 V −1 s −1 at 2 kelvin under 2.8% compressional strain, with an extraordinarily large piezoresistive effect and low sheet resistivity of 550 ohms, one-fifth of the lowest resistivity in unstrained samples. These clean systems offer opportunities to explore intrinsic strain-induced charge transport physics, where condensed matter phenomena, characterized by weakly bonded molecular orbitals, combine electronic correlation and lattice degrees of freedom.},

Here, we determine the structure of the COPI vesicle coat containing GOLPH3, an adaptor protein that binds the cytosolic tails of many Golgi residents. Analysis of this structure, together with structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, reveals how GOLPH3 uses coincidence detection of COPI and lipids to engage Golgi residents preferentially at late cisternae. Our findings rationalize the logic of cisternal maturation and explain how COPI can engage different types of substrates in different Golgi cisternae to retrieve some proteins back to the ER while retaining others within the Golgi apparatus.},

These metastructure system is used to explore and directly visualize the complex mesoscale topological deformation mechanisms hidden at molecular scales, providing fundamental insights into the mechanical properties of these materials. Beyond mimicking known polydomain materials, we demonstrate functionalities including mechanical encoding/decoding and programmable shape morphing.

Although the conservation of protein fold can reveal deep homologies, viral proteins remain underrepresented in structural databases. We address this by clustering viral sequences from RefSeq and predicting the structures of ~27,000 representative proteins using AlphaFold2 to create the Viral AlphaFold Database (VAD). We uncover conserved folds in diverse viruses infecting bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. We predict homodimers and make comparisons to the Protein Data Bank, providing data on oligomerization potential. We reveal considerable functional darkness in the viral protein universe and report the discovery and validation of an uncharacterized toxin-antitoxin system.

Here, we present a sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy using shape memory polymers (SMPs) to facilitate full-cycle capture operations. The engineered SMP-frame adhesive structure captures targets with normalized kinetic energies exceeding 3800 joules per square meter, empowered by the intrinsic viscoelasticity of the material to provide both strong energy dissipation and rapid adhesive interface strengthening. The dynamic strengthening mechanism delays crack propagation and greatly enhances detachment toughness, enabling unprecedented rebound suppression within the short timescales of collision. The adhesive-integrated system successfully performs dynamic capture, manipulation, and release under free-floating conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the sequential phase-switching adhesion strategy.

In this study, we use cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr 46.8 Ti 8.2 Cu 7.5 Ni 10 Be 27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the β-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without appreciable density changes. Conversely, α-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T / T g,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermomechanical processing.},

Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I), which are important for T cell–mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity—Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. Here, we show that Nef proteins derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1 restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to the antiviral protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) in a SERINC3/5-independent manner. Using Nef derived from primary HIV-1 clade C infection, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes, reduces IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions, and restores HIV-1 fusion with target cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.},

Pharmacological and genetic disruption of ECA1-mediated Ca 2+ efflux triggered enhanced [Ca 2+ ] cyt transients and [ABA] cyt , exacerbating root growth hypersensitivity to osmotic stress. Biochemical assays reveal that CPK2/6/11 directly bind and phosphorylate ECA1, enhancing its Ca 2+ -pumping activity to restore cytosolic Ca 2+ equilibrium and subsequently prevent ABA cyt overaccumulation. Genetic analysis shows that eca1cpk11 phenocopied eca1 hypersensitivity, while triple and quadruple mutants amplified osmotic sensitivity, demonstrating that CPKs and ECA1 function as a cooperative phosphoregulatory hub regulating Ca 2+ signaling and root growth.

Unfortunately, simpler, genetically tractable CI models do not recapitulate the same regulatory behavior, compromising mechanistic studies. Here, we report the structure of isolated CI from the yeast Pichia pastoris ( Pp -CI) and identify distinct closed and open states that resemble those of mammalian CI. Notably, a hitherto-unknown protein (NUQM) completes an interdomain bridge in only the closed state, implying that NUQM stabilizes it by restricting the conformational changes of opening. The direct correlation of NUQM binding with closed/open status in Pp -CI provides opportunities for investigating regulatory mechanisms relevant to reversible catalysis and ischemia-reperfusion injury.},

Here, we studied mitochondrial ROS (mROS) function in plant-pathogen interactions, deploying genetically encoded sensors, assorted fluorescent markers, and genetic approaches to track mROS, specifically H 2 O 2 , dynamics and identify interorganelle contact sites. We unexpectedly found a mitochondria–endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ROS signal cascade functioning independently of apoplastic and chloroplastic ROS in plant immunity. mROS initiate immune responses induced by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora parasitica and promote mitochondria-ER association. These enhanced mitochondria-ER membrane associations are required for transfer of mROS signals and initiation of extensive unfolded protein responses. We conclude that mROS transfer via mitochondria-ER membranes to the ER lumen is an underappreciated yet essential component in plant defense.},

Like humans, 72% of mammals exhibited a female life expectancy advantage, while 68% of birds showed a male advantage, as expected from the harmful effects of sex chromosomes described by the heterogametic sex hypothesis. Yet, sex differences varied widely. In zoos, we found strong evidence that this variation generally correlated with both the mating system and sexual size dimorphism. Although with weaker evidence, the patterns remained consistent in populations from the wild, with an even larger effect of the mating system. Thus, even in zoos, where environmental pressures are largely reduced, precopulatory sexual selection seems to play a fundamental role in shaping sex differences in life expectancy in mammals and birds.},

  abstract     = {Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are typically embedded in the bulk of their hosts, making their electronic transitions inaccessible to surface modification. In contrast, two-dimensional materials, with their all-surface nature, offer a platform for tuning quantum emitters via chemical functionalization. Because of its semiconducting properties that enable electrical addressability, monolayer WSe 2 is a promising candidate for quantum emission, although the complex interplay between point defects and the localized strain needed to activate quantum emission leads to poor spectral purity. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing monolayer WSe 2 with conformal adlayers of 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) improves quantum emission spectral purity. Optical spectroscopy reveals that PTCDA functionalization lowers defect activation energies by 10 meV and induces a 30 nm redshift in quantum emission wavelength, while preserving the bright and dark exciton energies of monolayer WSe 2 . First-principles calculations corroborate these findings, thus providing molecular-level insight into the underlying mechanism of enhanced spectral purity.},

However, their exact functions remain elusive. Here, we used cryogenic correlative light and electron microscopy to visualize stress granules in their native environment and reconstructed them in three dimensions using tomography. This approach provided the first quantitative and spatial analysis of the translational machinery within stress granules. Our findings suggest that stress granules have a limited impact on global translation regulation but serve to protect small ribosomal subunits and preinitiation complexes from degradation. Numerical simulations based on a phase-field model accurately reproduced the spatial distribution of ribosomal components inside and outside the stress granules, shedding light on the thermodynamic principles governing this process.},

  abstract     = {The presence of quantum effects in photosynthetic excitation energy transfer has been intensely debated over the past decade. Nonlinear spectroscopy cannot unambiguously distinguish coherent electronic dynamics from underdamped vibrational motion, and rigorous numerical simulations of realistic microscopic models have been intractable. Experimental studies supported by approximate numerical treatments that severely coarse-grain the vibrational environment have claimed the absence of long-lived quantum effects. Here, we report the nonperturbative, accurate microscopic model simulations of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson photosynthetic complex and demonstrate the presence of long-lived excitonic coherences at 77 kelvin and room temperature, which persist on picosecond timescales, similar to those of excitation energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that full microscopic simulations of nonlinear optical spectra are essential for identifying experimental evidence of quantum effects in photosynthesis, as approximate theoretical methods can misinterpret experimental data and potentially overlook quantum phenomena.},

With the increasing demand for Li, metallurgical techniques using excess acid leaching of mineral ores are common. However, these techniques are limited by multistep processes with adverse environmental impacts caused by secondary waste streams. Here, we show a one-step, acid-free, and alkali-free extraction process for Li from mineral ores with an initial Li content of only 4.8%. By applying flash Joule heating to α-spodumene under an atmosphere of Cl 2 (FJH-Cl 2 ), LiCl immediately distills from the remaining nonvolatile aluminum and silicon oxides. LiCl with a 97% purity and 94% yield can be achieved, enormously reducing costs and waste emissions. Local processing with FJH-Cl 2 can markedly lessen the complexity and cost of obtaining Li, obviating remote mining and facilitating the world’s progression toward cleaner renewable energies, which also paves the way for extracting critical metals from other mineral ores.},

Since these leaks do not present with specific symptoms, regular follow-up is necessary; however, now, only imaging-based monitoring is available. This study proposes an ultrathin flexible sensor inserted endovascularly with a stent to detect type I endoleaks, which pose the highest rupture risk. A coplanar capacitive sensor was attached to the stent graft using a specially developed flexible thermal adhesive to monitor blood leakage, without compromising the stent graft’s function. It seamlessly folds and unfolds with the stent, allowing implantation through catheter-based procedures. Experimental validation confirmed that the sensor does not induce blood leakage and demonstrated long-term stability and functionality under vascular and dynamic conditions. This technology enables wireless monitoring of endoleak status, facilitates timely intervention, and improves postoperative outcomes by reducing the risk of recurrent aneurysms.},

Our structural data and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism by which the amino-terminal region of P116 perturbs the membrane, the lipid transfer route, and the regulation of membrane binding by the cargo mass within P116’s large hydrophobic cavity. When adequately filled with cargo, P116 undergoes a rapid conformational change that modulates membrane binding. Together, our results show that Mycoplasma developed an integrated lipid uptake and delivery machinery that simplifies the complex multiprotein pathways used by higher developed organisms.},

Comprehensive magnetostratigraphic sampling shows highly variable directions, consistent with a rapidly changing geomagnetic field along a longitudinally preferred band. High-precision geochronology constrains the geomagnetic variability to ~568 to 562 million years and suggests rates that are likely too rapid for true polar wander or plate tectonic interpretations. Comparison of igneous- and sedimentary-derived data, using a new statistical approach combining Bingham and Fisher distributions, indicates a high-inclination paleomagnetic direction that is compatible with independent evidence for regional glaciation. Our analysis produces a late Ediacaran paleogeographic reconstruction that is consistent with paleomagnetic and geologic constraints.},

Posttranslational modifications provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms of disorders, yet their role in depression remains underexplored.

In this study, we demonstrate how chronic stress alters region-specific O-glycosylation across multiple brain regions, with a particular focus on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our findings reveal significant changes in sialylated O-glycosylation patterns mediated by St3gal1 , a sialyltransferase essential for O-glycosylation. Notably, knockdown of St3gal1 in nonstressed mice induced depressive-like behaviors, whereas its overexpression in stressed mice alleviated depressive symptoms, underscoring its regulatory role in stress resilience. In addition, we identify potential glycoprotein targets and downstream regulators of St3gal1 , including neurexin 2 (NRXN2) in the medial PFC (mPFC), offering insights into molecular pathways linking O-glycosylation to depressive-like behaviors.},

We demonstrate that cervical organoids closely resemble native tissue at transcriptional and cellular levels, identifying epithelial subtypes with region-specific immune specializations. Upon infection, ectocervical epithelia reinforce barrier integrity, whereas endocervical epithelia, particularly uninfected bystander cells, exhibit extensive transcriptional reprogramming characterized by robust interferon activation, antigen presentation, and antimicrobial defense. Infection profoundly reshapes epithelial intercellular communication, positioning bystander cells as major contributors to signaling networks coordinating immune responses and tissue regeneration.

Here, we present evidence that two of the largest glaciers in California’s Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park persisted throughout the Holocene. Cosmogenic in situ carbon-14 and beryllium-10 exposure dating in newly exposed proglacial bedrock indicates continuous Holocene cover, likely by ice. At a nearby smaller glacier, bedrock exposure-burial ages suggest glacier expansion at ~7 thousand years ago, earlier than previously recognized. Moraine exposure ages at these sites and the Sierra Nevada’s largest glacier are distributed across the past several thousand years, suggesting that glaciers were near their preindustrial extent for much of the late Holocene. These findings imply that a glacier-free Sierra Nevada is unprecedented since before the Holocene. Future alpine glacial environments in California are thereby likely a no-analog scenario within the current interglacial.},

In lymphoid organs, the adult T reg pool is continuously replenished with cells generated at different ages. In contrast, the skin retains a large fraction of T regs that colonize the tissue during the neonatal period, with minimal turnover in adulthood. The liver, lungs, and colon exhibit intermediate T reg renewal dynamics.

  abstract     = {As an eye-friendly display technology, electrochromic displays still face challenges in playing videos due to their slow response speed. Here, we designed and developed pseudo-rhodamine electrochromic molecules through a “tandem all-in-one” synthetic strategy that covalently integrates three distinct functional units within a single molecule. This molecular architecture simultaneously achieves exceptionally high heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant and ultrahigh molar absorption coefficient. We verified the underlying electrochromic mechanism involving a two-electron redox process of pyridinecarboxylic acid derivative units coupled with reversible pseudo-rhodamine spirocyclization. By implementing this tandem all-in-one molecular engineering strategy, different functional subunits within the electrochromic molecule are mutually bonded to interact through alternating reaction sequences, enabling near-synchronous operation of individual units. The resulting electrochromic display demonstrates ultrafast response speeds (35 milliseconds for bleaching and 65 milliseconds for coloration), capable of smooth video playback and rapid switching between digital states. The design principle showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of ultrafast electrochromic video displays.},

However, previous research paints an incomplete picture of their effectiveness—in particular, there has been little work assessing the impact of reminders on downstream arrests and incarceration. In partnership with the Santa Clara County Public Defender’s Office, we randomly assigned 5709 public defender clients to either receive automated text message reminders (treatment) or not receive reminders (control). We found that reminders reduced warrants issued for missed court dates by ~20%, with 12.1% of clients in control issued a warrant compared to 9.7% of clients in treatment. Further, we found that incarceration from missed court dates dropped by a similar amount, from 6.6% in control to 5.2% in treatment. The effectiveness of reminders bolsters the theory that lapses in memory or comprehension contribute to missed court appearances.},

To investigate how these architectures shape bacterial behavior, we generated near-isogenic strains representing each configuration in Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58, an important soil bacterium widely used for plant genetic transformation. Strains with a single-chromosome architecture, whether linear or circular, exhibited faster growth, enhanced stress tolerance, and greater interstrain competitiveness. In contrast, bipartite chromosome strains showed higher virulence gene expression and enhanced transient plant transformation efficiency, suggesting a pathogenic adaptation. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed architecture-dependent gene expression patterns, underscoring the profound impact of chromosome organization on Agrobacterium fitness and virulence.

However, the intrinsic electric effect of moving water molecules on a pristine van der Waals surface has seldom been explored. Here, we find a water-flow electric-gating effect on graphene, WSe 2 , and MoS 2 without dangling bonds or functional groups. It is an intrinsic electric effect, different from a traditional ion-reliant or functional group–dependent fluid electrokinetic effect. On the basis of this finding, we develop a water-flow gated transistor (WGT) capable of transducing flow signals down to 600 nanometers per second into electrical signals, achieving a voltage responsivity up to 1.53 × 10 4 volts per meter-second, about two orders of magnitude higher than existing hydroelectronic devices. The WGTs can serve as a basic unit of hydroelectronics, enabling efficient signal transduction and logical calculation.},

Disentangling the relative effects of these factors is challenging yet crucial for designing management strategies. We used a temperature-dependent population dynamics model to assess the impacts of lake warming and fishing on 521 freshwater fish populations in the Midwestern United States—a transitional zone between cold- and warmwater species. Overall, most warmwater species (65% of populations) exhibited increases in productivity from warming, while slightly more than half of the cool-/cold-water species (53% of populations) experienced reduced productivity. Populations closer to their carrying capacity showed greater resilience to warming. For the majority of populations (92%), fishing had a more pronounced effect on population dynamics than warming during the time period examined. Therefore, while warming is likely to increasingly threaten many fish populations, effective local fishery management remains a key lever to mitigate these impacts.},

On the basis of accurate chronological frames and faunal quantitative data, we demonstrate that extinct megafauna were the principal prey item of early foragers from ~13,000 to 11,600 calibrated years before the present, and this fact had likely been obscured by lumping together pre- and postextinction archaeological faunal assemblages within a single chronological window. We also show that the most exploited extinct taxa were at the apex of the ranking of the prey choice model. After the diversity and abundance of megafauna had already declined severely (~12,500 B.P.), and especially after they had virtually disappeared (~11,600 B.P.), the human diet was broadened. This strongly reinforces the idea that humans must be central to the debate on Quaternary extinctions in South America.},

Here, we describe an mRNA delivery system that overcomes current challenges by co-encapsulating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and mRNA within non-ionic surfactant vehicles (NSVs) to create “Aurniosoves” (AuNSVs). Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that AuNSVs improve vector accumulation and uptake within the tumor, resulting in enhanced protein expression and therapeutic efficacy. Mechanistically, these effects are the result of an iterative delivery process in which AuNSVs enter cells initially through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and release AuNPs into the cytoplasm. AuNPs subsequently adsorb and inactivate cellular trafficking regulators PP2A and Rab7, producing two effects: (i) rapid entry of additional AuNSVs through activation of caveolin-mediated endocytosis (CvME) and (ii) endosomal escape through inhibited endolysosomal fusion. We propose that AuNSVs be exploited as next-generation mRNA delivery systems.},

Under Pi-deficient conditions, etiolated seedlings exhibit elongated hypocotyls, shortened roots, and small, pale cotyledons—a morphological adaptation that enhances light-foraging capacity. However, how Pi is strategically distributed among these organs to optimize seedling establishment remains unclear. We here identify a PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 regulatory module that directs minimal Pi resources to suppress root elongation and cotyledon expansion or to accelerate greening, promoting Pi conservation. This mechanism prioritizes hypocotyl elongation to improve light acquisition. In contrast, under sufficient Pi supply, hypocotyl and root growth is promoted along with cotyledon enlargement, while greening is delayed. Thus, the PHR1-EIN3/EIL1 module enables efficient allocation of limited Pi to maximize hypocotyl elongation for light foraging during early seedling establishment while strategically restricting Pi usage in other organs to enhance overall survival.},

Upon mitochondrial damage, PP2A-B55α determines the amplitude of mitophagy induction and execution by regulating both early and late mitophagy events. A few minutes after the insult, ULK1 is released from the inhibitory regulation of PP2A-B55α, whereas 2 to 4 hours later, PP2A-B55α promotes the nuclear translocation of TFEB, the master regulator of autophagy and lysosome genes, to support mitophagy execution. Moreover, PP2A-B55α controls a transcriptional program of mitochondrial biogenesis by stabilizing the Parkin substrate and PGC-1α inhibitor PARIS.

How FAK becomes activated in response to cell-ECM adhesive forces at single FAs to facilitate directional motion is poorly understood. Using micropillar-based force microscopy and FA-targeted FRET biosensors, we monitored real-time traction forces and FAK activity at individual FAs during assembly and disassembly. Our results demonstrate oscillatory temporal coupling of traction force and FAK activity in high-tension FAs before FA disassembly. Cross-correlation analyses revealed that force precedes FAK activation, guiding FA turnover. Atomistic molecular simulations unveiled a force-induced mechanism where traction forces disrupt autoinhibitory FERM-kinase interactions in FAK, enabling catalytic activity without structural unfolding. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal integration of mechanical forces and biochemical signaling in cell migration.},

  abstract     = {Scattering resonances are fundamental to many areas of physics, occurring across a wide range of energy scales. In ultracold quantum gases, magnetic Feshbach resonances have transformed quantum many-body research by enabling precise interaction control between atoms. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control to engineer Feshbach resonances at tunable positions via Floquet driving in a lithium-6 (^{6}Li) atom gas, achieved through strong magnetic field modulation at megacycles per second frequencies. This periodic modulation creates scattering resonances whenever dressed molecular levels cross the atomic threshold. By adding a second modulation at twice the base frequency, we tune the asymmetry of resonance loss profiles and suppress two-body losses from Floquet heating. This technique enhances control over atomic interactions, expanding possibilities for quantum simulations of complex systems and studies of exotic quantum phases.},

  abstract     = {Climate change risks triggering abrupt weakening in two climatically important North Atlantic Ocean circulation elements, the subpolar gyre and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Loss of AMOC stability has been inferred from slowing recovery of temperature and salinity fluctuations over time. However, observational datasets, constructed from records with sparse spatial and temporal coverage, may introduce substantial biases in stability indicators. Alternative records are therefore needed for reliable stability assessments. Here, using bivalve-derived environmental reconstructions, we show that the subpolar North Atlantic has experienced two destabilization episodes over the past ~150 years. The first preceded the rapid circulation changes associated with the 1920s North Atlantic regime shift, suggesting that a tipping point may have been crossed in the early 20th century. The second and stronger destabilization began around 1950 and continues to the present, supporting evidence of recent stability loss and suggesting that the region is moving toward a tipping point.},

However, the inherently weak vdW interactions enable facile sliding between layers, introducing complexities beyond those encountered in conventional ferroelectric materials and presenting substantial challenges in uncovering intricate switching pathways. Here, we combine atomic-resolution imaging under in situ electrical biasing conditions with first-principles calculations to unravel the atomic-scale switching mechanisms in SnSe, a vdW group IV monochalcogenide. Our results uncover the coexistence of a consecutive 90° switching pathway and a direct 180° switching pathway from antiferroelectric (AFE) to FE order in this vdW system. Atomic-scale investigations and strain analysis reveal that the switching processes simultaneously induce interlayer sliding and compressive strain, while the lattice remains coherent despite the presence of multidomain structures. These findings elucidate vdW ferroelectric switching dynamics at atomic scale and lay the foundation for the rational design of 2D ferroelectric nanodevices.},

Compared to NC IMPBs, CC IMPBs have smaller, sulfur (S)–poor, highly siderophile element (HSE)–enriched cores and younger core formation ages. However, the origins of these differences remain debated. Using equilibrium partitioning models between the S-poor solid and the S-rich liquid metal, we argue that HSE enrichment in IID, IIF, IIIF, and IVB cores resulted from a multistage evolutionary sequence: (i) segregation of S-rich, HSE-depleted protocores during initial planetesimal heating; (ii) collisional disruption before S-poor metal segregation; (iii) reaccretion of mantle fragments into daughter planetesimals; and (iv) further 26 Al-driven heating producing HSE-enriched, S-poor cores. We suggest that iron meteorites from these CC IMPBs originate from such second-generation cores. Accounting for “missing” S-rich protocores helps reconcile several NC-CC IMPB differences and highlights the role of early collisional processing in shaping planetesimal chemical evolution.},

However, research to date has focused primarily on phase and retardance aberrations, whereas another major source of aberration—diattenuation—remains largely unexplored. Unlike the others, diattenuation affects intensity in addition to phase and polarization, limiting the intrinsic correction capability of adaptive systems. In this work, we propose the use of optical skyrmions to probe diattenuation-aberrated systems and provide metrics that characterize the performance of vectorial adaptive optics (V-AO), with theoretical and experimental validations. Based on the probed results, we demonstrate V-AO correction under real-world aberrations for complex media imaging and analyze correction strategies to optimize measurements in aberrated polarimetric systems. This work paves the way for high-dimensional aberration correction, introduces a previously unidentified use of optical skyrmions, and provides insights that will aid the development of vectorial measurement systems.},

Here, we propose and demonstrate a nonvolatile silicon photonic microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switch enabled by tailored stiction effect based on van der Waals (vdW) force. The device uses a unique split waveguide crossing (SWX) with a push-pull MEMS actuator to efficiently switch the mode propagation. The vdW force between two halves of the combined SWX with zero gap provides reliable nonvolatility. The device features 0.23-decibel excess loss, 44.4-decibel extinction ratio, 200-nanometer bandwidth, and ~1-picojoule theoretical switching energy. Furthermore, excellent scalability is validated by a fabricated high-performance 16 by 16 nonvolatile photonic switch array, which has never been reported before.},

This violation becomes pronounced toward the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties—specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients—coincides with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO 2 , contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.},

We used Nkapl transgenic mouse models to explore the impact of NKAPL on SCZ-related cognitive deficits. NKAPL acts as a transcriptional repressor of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolizing enzyme succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Nkapl deletion in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interneurons led to increased SSADH levels, reduced GABA concentration in the synaptic cleft, impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, the rs1635 mutation (T153N) caused similar effects as the Nkapl knockout. Reexpression of wild-type NKAPL or genetic knockdown of SSADH in mPFC interneurons restored the synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Nkapl −/− mice. Our study indicates the potential role of NKAPL and SSADH in mPFC interneurons in neuronal mechanisms of learning and memory in mice.},

Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes.

  abstract     = {Causal inference between measured variables is crucial to understand the underlying mechanism of complex biological processes at a network level but remains challenging in computational biology. We propose an innovative causal criterion, knockoff conditional mutual information (KOCMI), to accurately infer interventional direct causality without prior knowledge of the network structure using either time-independent or time-series data. KOCMI performs knockoff operation on a variable as its virtual intervention, which preserves the original network structure, and then identifies the causality between two variables by estimating the distributional invariance before and after such a virtual intervention. We show that, algorithmically, KOCMI enables quantification of causal relationship, even for networks with loops, and, theoretically, is also consistent with the do-calculus causal analyses but without their prerequisite of the network structure. KOCMI shows superior performance on benchmark and real datasets, comparing with existing methods. Overall, KOCMI provides a powerful tool in inferring interventional causality, which is theoretically ensured and experimentally validated by real intervention data.},

  abstract     = {Flavonoid O -glycosylation, catalyzed by uridine diphosphate (UDP)–glycosyltransferases, is crucial for their therapeutic efficacy. However, most UDP-glycosyltransferases encounter three major limitations: low activity, poor regioselectivity, and restricted substrate availability, hindering their pharmaceutical applications. To address these challenges, we conducted protein engineering on a previously unidentified glycosyltransferase, UGT75AJ2, which had 3′,7- O -glycosylation capabilities. Our approach involved three strategies: (i) development of a tailored focused rational iterative site-specific mutagenesis strategy, augmented by virtual screening and iterative mutagenesis, to design mutant Mut4-1 (S367A/V274A/F82V/I132T) with a 128-fold enhancement in relative catalytic activity; (ii) enhancement of the enzyme’s compatibility with a broader spectrum of sugar donors achieved through structural-based engineering, yielding mutant S14G/F366H/S367G and demonstrating effective utilization of diverse donors; (iii) construction of a targeted mutant library to enhance regioselectivity by active site analysis, leading to mutants with high selectivity for targeted glycosylation sites. This comprehensive study tackles predominant challenges in UDP-glycosyltransferases protein engineering, providing innovative approaches and insights that enhance the development of flavonoid glycosides.},

Here, we report the successful observation of an ATHE developing below the superconducting transition temperature at zero magnetic field in the kagome-lattice superconductor CsV 3 Sb 5 . This finding is verified by the absence of a signal in a conventional type-II superconductor using the same setup and by ruling out the trapped-vortex effects through micro-Hall array measurements. Both the temperature dependence and the magnitude of the observed anomalous thermal Hall conductivity are quite different from those expected for the quantized thermal edge current of an intrinsic ATHE but consistent with extrinsic impurity-induced ATHEs in chiral superconductivity. Our study of ATHE offers an alternative approach to probe TRS breaking in the superconducting states.},

We conducted a data-driven investigation into the predictability of outbreak severity, using chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a case study. For mosquito-transmitted viruses like CHIKV, the potential for severe outbreaks is often assessed using climate-based estimates of the basic reproduction number, R 0 . We derived a large set of R 0 estimates for CHIKV by fitting a mechanistic model to data from 86 chikungunya outbreaks. These R 0 estimates were weakly predicted by climatic and other factors. Among deterministic drivers of outbreak severity, the contribution of R 0 was comparable to that of generation interval length, transmission distance, and population network structure. While aspects of chikungunya outbreak severity are predictable, innovative approaches are needed that look beyond the impacts of climate on R 0 .},

We show that floods driven by compound space-time storm clustering have higher peaks, volumes, and durations compared to those from isolated storms or single-mode clustering. Under future climate conditions (2070 to 2100; SSP3-7.0 scenario), projections indicate a 26% rise in the number of extreme storms, an 8% increase in average storm precipitation, and a 17% reduction in dry intervals preceding flood peaks. The dominant flood type is projected to shift from those produced by isolated storms (38%) to ones produced by compound storm clustering (49%)—the type of floods that have been responsible for catastrophic floods historically.

Performance can be separated into two “states”—an engaged (attentive) state with high performance, where fish consistently turn in the direction of coherent motion, and a second, disengaged (inattentive) state, where performance drops to chance. A hidden Markov model is sufficient to model these transitions and can be incorporated into a drift-diffusion model framework that has previously been used to model perceptual decision-making in larval zebrafish. Furthermore, we fit a mixture model of performance distributions and extract two latent variables termed “focus” and “competence” that are largely influenced by parents and environmental context, respectively. This quantitative framework can potentially help to identify a genetic basis and a neural mechanism for attention that extends across organisms.},

The model integrates tide gauges, GPS, and satellite altimetry with past and future constraints on mountain glaciers, polar ice sheets, thermal expansion, ocean circulation, land water storage, and glacial history. By separating unforced ocean variability from long-term trends, we provide posterior estimates of sea level change and vertical land motion. The inclusion of local constraints reduces uncertainty in near-term local projections while producing global median projections and uncertainty ranges similar to those in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

We show that Bacteroides DGRs are horizontally transferred across species, display activity levels ranging from high to low, and preferentially alter the functional characteristics of ligand-binding residues on adhesive organelles. Specific variable protein sequences are enriched when Bacteroides strains compete with other commensal bacteria in gnotobiotic mice. Analysis of >2700 DGRs from diverse phyla in mother-infant pairs shows that Bacteroides DGRs are disproportionately transferred to vaginally delivered infants where they actively diversify.

Despite the modest genetic distance between the parents, we observed notable proteomic diversity and mapped more than 6400 genotype-protein associations, with more than 1600 linked to individual genetic variants. Proteomic adaptation emerged from a conserved network of cis- and trans-regulatory variants, often originating from proteins not traditionally linked to gene regulation. This atlas allowed us to forecast organismal fitness effects across diverse conditions.

  abstract     = {Cholesterol is an important component of cell membranes and can be shuttled between different subcellular compartments through the action of proteins belonging to the Aster family. Gao et al . found that deleting Aster-A specifically in T cells inhibited the uptake of dietary fats and prevented diet-induced obesity in mice (see the Perspective by Burkhardt and Ecker). By regulating the abundance of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, Aster-A modulated T cell receptor signaling and differentiation. In the absence of Aster-A, CD4 T cells in the gut produced a cytokine, interleukin-22, which decreased the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to take up fatty acids from the diet. —Sarah H. Ross The intrinsic pathways that control membrane organization in immune cells and their impact on cellular functions are poorly defined. We found that the nonvesicular cholesterol transporter Aster-A linked plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol availability in CD4 T cells to systemic metabolism. Aster-A was recruited to the PM during T cell receptor (TCR) activation, where it facilitated the removal of accessible cholesterol. Loss of Aster-A increased cholesterol accumulation in the PM, which enhanced TCR nanoclustering and signaling. Aster-A associated with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and negatively regulated calcium (Ca 2+ ) flux. Aster-A deficiency promoted CD4 T cells to acquire a T helper 17 (T H 17) phenotype and stimulated interleukin-22 production, which reduced intestinal fat absorption and conferred resistance to diet-induced obesity. These findings delineate how immune cell membrane homeostasis links to systemic physiology.},

Observing the atmospheres of these objects provides information on the geological processes that influence their climates and surfaces. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of these planets, including insights into the interaction between the atmosphere and interior based on observations made with the JWST. We describe the expected climatic and interior planetary regimes for planets with different density and stellar flux and how those regimes might be observationally distinguished.

  abstract     = {To better understand how tumor cells respond in the stressful environments they encounter, Groessl et al . used CRISPR screens to evaluate genes that promote responses to metabolic stress and compared responses to metabolic stress in pancreatic tumor cells in vivo and in cell culture. Acidosis, a metabolic state known to occur in tumors, appeared to be a main factor affecting cell metabolism by decreasing activity of the protein kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase). ERK suppression blunted the effects of oncogene activation on mitochondrial morphology and favored tumor growth by allowing the cells to adapt to metabolic stress. —L. Bryan Ray Malignant tumors are characterized by diverse metabolic stresses, including nutrient shortages, hypoxia, and buildup of metabolic by-products. To understand how cancer cells adapt to such challenges, we conducted sequential CRISPR screens to identify genes that affect cellular fitness under specific metabolic stress conditions in cell culture and to then probe their relevance in pancreatic tumors. Comparative analyses of hundreds of fitness genes revealed that cancer metabolism in vivo was shaped by bioenergetic adaptations to tumor acidosis. Mechanistically, acidosis suppressed cytoplasmic activity of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), thereby preventing oncogene-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and promoting fused mitochondria. The resulting boost in mitochondrial respiration supported cancer cell adaptations to various metabolic stresses. Thus, acidosis is an environmental factor that alters energy metabolism to promote stress resilience in cancer.},

Chen et al . revealed a molecular mechanism that contributes to successful aging in these rodents: a change in the enzyme cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS), which is known to sense cytosolic DNA and initiate immune defense responses (see the Perspective by Martinez et al .). Unlike human cGAS, which inhibits DNA repair by homologous recombination in the nucleus, the naked mole rat enzyme has four amino acid changes that allow it to enhance DNA repair, thus delaying aging and enhancing life span. —L. Bryan Ray Efficient DNA repair might make possible the longevity of naked mole-rats. However, whether they have distinctive mechanisms to optimize functions of DNA repair suppressors is unclear. We find that naked mole-rat cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS) lacks the suppressive function of human or mouse homologs in homologous recombination repair through the alteration of four amino acids during evolution. The changes enable cGAS to retain chromatin longer upon DNA damage by weakening TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination and interaction with the segregase P97. Prolonged chromatin binding of cGAS enhanced the interaction between repair factors FANCI and RAD50 to facilitate RAD50 recruitment to damage sites, thereby potentiating homologous recombination repair. Moreover, the four amino acids mediate the function of cGAS in antagonizing cellular and tissue aging and extending life span. Manipulating cGAS might therefore constitute a mechanism for life-span extension.},

By analyzing both short- and long-read RNA-sequencing data across human tissues and other mammals, Calvo-Roitberg et al . revealed a coordinated relationship between transcription start and end sites that is dictated by the genomic order of alternative sites. This positional coupling, called the positional initiation-termination axis, is most prominent in long genes and is governed by the rate of RNA polymerase II elongation. These findings uncover a molecular mechanism that shapes mRNA diversity across tissues. —Di Jiang Transcriptional initiation and termination decisions drive messenger RNA (mRNA) isoform diversity but the relationship between them remains poorly understood. By systematically profiling joint usage of transcription start and end sites, we observed that mRNA using upstream starts preferentially use upstream end sites and that the usage of downstream sites is similarly coupled. Our results suggest a positional initiation termination axis (PITA), in which usage of alternative terminal sites are coupled based on their genomic order. PITA is enriched in longer genes with distinct chromatin features. We find that mRNA 5′ start choice directly influences 3′ ends depending on RNA polymerase II trafficking speed. Our results indicate that spatial organization and transcriptional dynamics couple transcription initiation and mRNA 3′ end decisions to define mRNA isoform expression.},

  abstract     = {Many cancers are resistant to immunotherapy because of poor immune cell infiltration. Activating the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) pathway is one way to encourage tumor immune cell infiltrates and positive therapeutic response. However, targeting the STING pathway has not yet succeeded in human trials despite encouraging results from experimental preclinical models. Hsu et al . report one possible reason: Many human cancers lose expression of a gene called methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP), which causes a block of the STING pathway, but MTAP deficiency is rare in animal models. The researchers found that targeting a related process, polyamine metabolism, with the existing drug DL-α-difluoromethylornithine could restore immune activity in MTAP-deleted cancers and reduce tumor growth. This approach may offer a new way to improve cancer treatment and patient selection for STING-based therapies. —Priscilla N. Kelly Cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways are potential targets for cancer immunotherapy. Although stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists have shown substantial antitumor effects in animal models, their clinical efficacy in human tumors remains unclear. Deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) is a common genomic alteration in human tumors but is rare in preclinical syngeneic mouse models. We found that homozygous MTAP deletion in human tumors creates a tumor microenvironment that obstructs cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways by down-regulating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to resistance to STING agonists. Targeting polyamine biosynthesis reverses IRF3 down-regulation, restoring sensitivity to STING agonists in MTAP-deficient tumors. Our findings suggest that MTAP genetic status may inform patient responses to STING agonist therapy and offer an alternative strategy for boosting antitumor immune responses using STING agonists in MTAP -deleted tumors.},

Zhao et al . report on the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical testing of a solid-state lithium tantalum oxychloride electrolyte with the formula Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 . The material has high ionic conductivity and low activation energy, even at lower temperatures. These properties are due to the mixed-anion chemistry, which enables facile lithium-ion migration pathways. The broad applicability of the mixed-anion strategy was validated using niobium and other cost-effective or earth-abundant elements to replace the tantalum, although with some decrease in conductivity. —Marc S. Lavine Solid-state batteries are attractive energy storage systems as a result of their inherent safety, but their development hinges on advanced solid-state electrolytes (SSEs). Most SSEs remain largely confined to single-anion systems (e.g., sulfides, oxides, halides, and polymers). Through mixed-anion design strategy, we develop crystalline Li 3 Ta 3 O 4 Cl 10 (LTOC) and its derivatives with excellent ionic conductivities (up to 13.7 millisiemens per centimeter at 25°C) and electrochemical stability. The LTOC structure features mixed-anion spiral chains, consisting of corner-shared oxygen and terminal chlorine atoms, which induces continuous “tetrahedron-tetrahedron” Li-ion migration pathways with low energy barriers. Additionally, LTOC demonstrates holistic cathode compatibility, enabling solid-state batteries operation at 4.9 volts versus Li/Li + and low temperature, down to −50°C.

Ferromagnetics and ferroelectrics have stray fields that can interfere with nearby memories, resulting in depolarization and ultimately limiting storage density. By contrast, in ferroaxial materials, the electric dipoles line up head to tail, forming vortices and thereby removing the stray fields. However, these vortex states have so far been difficult to control and switch. Zeng et al . demonstrated how single optical pulses can repeatedly switch a ferroaxial phase between two stable states (see the Perspective by He and Khalsa). The controlled switching between left and right helicity could be useful in developing a new platform for ultrafast information storage. —Ian S. Osborne Ultrafast switching of ferroic phases is an active research area with technological potential. Yet, some key challenges remain, ranging from limited speeds in ferromagnets to intrinsic volatility of switched domains owing to depolarizing fields in ferroelectrics. Unlike these ferroic systems, ferroaxial materials host bistable states that preserve spatial-inversion and time-reversal symmetry and are therefore immune to depolarizing fields but also difficult to manipulate with conventional methods. We demonstrate photo-induced switching of ferroaxial order by engineering an effective axial field composed of circularly driven terahertz phonon modes. A switched ferroaxial domain remains stable for many hours and can be reversed back with a second terahertz pulse of opposite helicity. The effects demonstrated in this work may lead to the development of a robust platform for ultrafast information storage.},

Tang et al . addressed this question with updated analyses incorporating many projects and carefully chosen controls. Across 52 REDD+ Avoided Unplanned Deforestation projects from 12 countries in South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, the authors found greater climate benefits than previous studies but low efficacy overall: Less than 20% of projects met their emissions targets.

Nonetheless, many underperforming projects still delivered partial climate benefits, with an estimated 13.2% of tradable credits supported by counterfactual analysis. Effectiveness varied by region, with stronger performance in Brazil and Africa.

However, it remains unknown where and how these bats locate, catch, and ingest relatively large passerine prey. Here, we used high-resolution biologging tags to reveal that greater noctule bats ( Nyctalus lasiopterus ) ascend to high altitudes, engage in long echo-guided chases, and consume migrating passerines in flight.

  abstract     = {High-power fiber lasers are used in a range of scientific fields in addition to their standard use for technology. However, increases in laser output power are limited by nonlinear effects that can damage the optical components and reduce the beam quality. Rothe et al . used a spatial wavefront-shaping technique for multimode fiber lasers that mitigates the detrimental processes, thus enabling output power to be increased appreciably while maintaining beam quality. —Ian S. Osborne High-power fiber lasers are powerful tools used in science, industry, and defense. A major roadblock for further power scaling of single-frequency fiber laser amplifiers is stimulated Brillouin scattering. Efforts have been made to mitigate this nonlinear process, but these were mostly limited to single-mode or few-mode fiber amplifiers, which have good beam quality. Here, we explored a highly multimode fiber amplifier in which stimulated Brillouin scattering was greatly suppressed due to a reduction of light intensity in a large fiber core and a broadening of the Brillouin scattering spectrum by multimode excitation. By applying a spatial wavefront shaping technique to the input light of a nonlinear amplifier, the output beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot. Our multimode fiber amplifier can operate at high power with high efficiency and narrow linewidth, which ensures high coherence. Optical wavefront shaping enables coherent control of multimode laser amplification, with potential applications in coherent beam combining, large-scale interferometry and directed energy delivery.},

  abstract     = {Mitochondrial production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is essential for life and depends on the cooperation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with the nuclear genome, but little is known about the mechanisms ensuring nuclear-mtDNA compatibility. Frison et al . found that mitochondria harboring a mtDNA mutation evade mitochondrial quality control by inhibiting the ubiquitin proteasome system. In mouse models, restoring mitochondrial ubiquitination through ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 (Usp30) loss increased purifying selection of mtDNA in early embryogenesis. In vitro, genetically or chemically inhibiting Usp30 reduced mutant burden by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy. Usp30 thus provides a promising target to treat and prevent mtDNA disorders. —Stella M. Hurtley Mitochondrial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate is essential for eukaryotic life but is dependent on the cooperation of two genomes: nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA mutates ~15 times as fast as the nuclear genome, challenging this symbiotic relationship. Mechanisms must have evolved to moderate the impact of mtDNA mutagenesis but are poorly understood. Here, we observed purifying selection of a mouse mtDNA mutation modulated by Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 30 ( Usp30 ) during the maternal-zygotic transition. In vitro, Usp30 inhibition recapitulated these findings by increasing ubiquitin-mediated mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). We also found that high mutant burden, or heteroplasmy, impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system, explaining how mutations can evade quality control to cause disease. Inhibiting USP30 unleashes latent mitophagy, reducing mutant mtDNA in high-heteroplasmy cells. These findings suggest a potential strategy to prevent mitochondrial disorders.},

  abstract     = {The total solar eclipse that occurred across the central southern to northeastern parts of the US presented an opportunity to study the responses of animals to rapid changes in light. Aguilar et al . anticipated this event and created an app that observers could use to record bird behavior, receiving input from over 10,000 users. They combined these data with locally recorded vocalizations analyzed by the artificial neural network model BirdNET. Together, these analyses revealed that half of the species responded to the end of the eclipse by singing a dawn chorus despite the “night” lasting only a few minutes. Variation in species response also informs us about variation in sensitivity to light, with implications for the impacts of artificial light. —Sacha Vignieri On 8 April 2024, a total solar eclipse disrupted light-dark cycles for North American birds during the lead-up to spring reproduction. Compiling more than 10,000 community observations and artificial intelligence analyses of nearly 100,000 vocalizations, we found that bird behavior was substantially affected by these few minutes of unexpected afternoon darkness. More than half of wild bird species changed their biological rhythms, with many producing a dawn chorus in the aftermath of the eclipse. This natural experiment underscores the power of light in structuring animal behavior: Even when “night” lasts for just 4 minutes, robust behavioral changes ensue.},

  abstract     = {Bacteria in the soil form complex communities, and some colonize the surfaces of roots. These bacteria are not uniformly distributed, however, and exhibit precise patterning around emerging lateral roots and early root differentiation zones. Tsai et al . established that the Casparian strip, an endodermal barrier around the root vasculature, is required for normal patterning of root bacteria (see the Perspective by Kozaeva and Brophy). At locations where the Casparian strip is absent, glutamine leaks from the vasculature and serves as an attractant for soil bacteria. Using precise spatial and temporal analysis, the authors provide insight into how bacteria around the root interact both with the plant and with each other. —Madeleine Seale Plant roots release exudates to encourage microbiome assembly, which influences the function and stress resilience of plants. How specific exudates drive spatial colonization patterns remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that endodermal Casparian strips—forming the root’s extracellular diffusion barrier—restrict nutrient leakage into the rhizosphere, coinciding with and controlling spatial colonization patterns of rhizobacteria. We find that vasculature-derived glutamine leakage is a major bacterial chemoattractant and enhancer of proliferation, defining a previously unknown pathway for root exudate formation. Bacteria defective in amino acid chemoperception display reduced attraction toward leakage sites, and roots with Casparian strip defects display bacterial overproliferation, dependent on bacterial capacity for amino acid metabolization. Associated chronic immune stimulation suggests that endodermal nutrient restriction is crucial for regulating microbial colonization and assembly, limiting excessive proliferation that could compromise plant health.},

  abstract     = {When cells experience a lack of amino acids, they initiate a stress response signaled by activations of the protein kinase GCN2. Zhou et al . used an in vitro translation system to refine our understanding of how this activation of GCN2 occurs. In their experiments, the critical factor appeared to be the collision of ribosomes that occurs when aminoacyl-transfer RNAs are not available and a peptide chain cannot be elongated. The trailing ribosomes then collide with the stalled ribosome, and GCN2 was found to be associated with this molecular traffic jam. There, the presence of uncharged transfer RNAs, another consequence of a shortage of amino acids, also promoted the phosphorylation and activation of GCN2. —L. Bryan Ray During nutrient deprivation, activation of the protein kinase GCN2 regulates cell survival and metabolic homeostasis. In addition to amino acid stress, GCN2 is activated by a variety of cellular stresses. GCN2 activation has been linked to its association with uncharged tRNAs, specific ribosomal proteins, and conditions of translational arrest, but their relative contribution to activation is unclear. Here, we used in vitro translation to reconstitute GCN2 activation by amino acid stress and compared collided ribosome populations induced by diverse translational stressors. Initiation of GCN2 signaling required the di-ribosome sensor GCN1, which recruits GCN2 to ribosomes in a collision-dependent manner, where GCN2 becomes activated by key ribosomal interactions and stably associated with collided ribosomes. Our findings define the molecular requirements and dynamics of GCN2 activation.},

  abstract     = {A distinguishing feature of the mostly warm surface of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP) is a “cold tongue” that extends thousands of kilometers to the west from Ecuador. This structure, formed by upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water from greater depths, has major impacts on both ocean biological productivity and climate. But how did this system behave during the Pliocene epoch, an interval that had a warmer climate than today and often is considered a climate analog for our warmer future? Rafter et al . analyzed the nitrogen isotopic compositions of marine sediments and organic phases in foraminifera to conclude that upwelling in the EEP has persisted over the past 4 million years, although the cold tongue was warmer during the Pliocene (see the Perspective by Rosenthal and Hess). These results have implications for both ocean circulation during the Pliocene and in the future. —Jesse Smith Upwelling generates a nutrient-rich “cold tongue” in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean (EEP), with impacts on global climate, oceanic biological productivity, and the carbon cycle. The cold tongue was reduced during the Pliocene Epoch, a feature attributed to weaker upwelling and an associated deepening of the surface mixed layer in the EEP. Here, we report nitrogen-isotope evidence that modern-like upwelling occurred in the EEP during the Pliocene and has persisted over the past 5 million years. We explain the reduced Pliocene cold tongue as an expression of the reduced temperature difference between surface and subsurface waters in the tropical Pacific. The attendant reduction in the vertical density gradient may have maintained EEP upwelling despite the expected slackening of the trade winds under Pliocene warmth.},

However, recent data have demonstrated the existence of noncanonical routes of interneuronal communication mediating the transport of materials including calcium, mitochondria, and pathogenic proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ). Using super-resolution and electron microscopy, Chang et al . identified and characterized structures called nanotubular bridges that connect dendrites in the brain (see the Perspective by Budinger and Heneka). These bridges mediate the transport of calcium ions, small molecules, and Aβ peptides, and may contribute to the spreading and accumulation of pathological Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease. —Mattia Maroso Intercellular nanotubular networks mediate material exchange, but their existence in neurons remains to be explored in detail. We identified long, thin dendritic filopodia forming direct dendrite–dendrite nanotubes (DNTs) in mammalian cortex. Super-resolution microscopy in dissociated neurons revealed DNTs’ actin-rich composition and dynamics, enabling long-range calcium ion (Ca 2+ ) propagation. Imaging and machine learning–based analysis validated in situ DNTs as anatomically distinct from synaptic spines. DNTs actively transported small molecules and human amyloid-β (Aβ); DNT density increased before plaque formation in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 mice (APP, Aβ precursor protein; PS1, presenilin-1), suggesting that the dendrite-DNT network might play a role in Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Computational models of DNT-mediated Aβ propagation recapitulated early amyloidosis, predicting selective intracellular accumulation. These findings uncover a nanotubular connectivity layer in the brain, extending neuronal communication beyond classical synapses.},

  abstract     = {Eukaryotic DNA is packaged as chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome, around which about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped, limiting its accessibility. Chromatin remodelers mobilize nucleosomes to regulate replication and transcription. Moore et al . studied two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, in crowded chromatin by recreating phase-separated chromatin droplets in vitro. They found that both remodelers could enter and mobilize nucleosomes within droplets, but only RSC decompacted chromatin and increased droplet mobility. This decompaction likely enhances DNA accessibility in cells. Their findings suggest that remodelers differ in biological importance depending on their capacity to mobilize and decompact compacted chromatin. —Di Jiang Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes mobilize nucleosomes, but how such mobilization affects chromatin condensation is unclear. We investigate effects of two major remodelers, ACF and RSC, using chromatin condensates and single-molecule footprinting. We find that both remodelers inhibit the formation of condensed chromatin. However, the remodelers have distinct effects on preformed chromatin condensates. ACF spaces nucleosomes without decondensing the chromatin, explaining how ACF maintains nucleosome organization in transcriptionally repressed genomic regions. By contrast, RSC catalyzes ATP-dependent decondensation of chromatin. RSC also drives micron-scale movements of entire chromatin condensates. These additional activities of RSC may contribute to its central role in transcription. The biological importance of remodelers may thus reflect both their effects on nucleosome mobilization and the corresponding consequences on chromatin dynamics at the mesoscale.},

Zhang et al . present a combined experimental and modeling study examining the fundamental mechanisms of lithium-ion intercalation into battery cathodes by analyzing current-voltage responses at small overpotentials (see the Perspective by Warburton). A key finding was the close agreement between the experiments and coupled ion–electron transfer theory rate expressions. The authors concluded that the reaction-limited current in lithium-ion batteries is associated with the lithium-ion vacancy fraction, in conjunction with temperature and electrolyte effects, thus providing a pathway for designing lithium-ion battery interfaces. —Marc S. Lavine The underlying reaction mechanism in lithium-ion batteries remains poorly understood. We provide experimental and theoretical evidence that lithium intercalation occurs by coupled ion-electron transfer, where ion transfer across the electrode-electrolyte interface is facilitated by electron transfer to a neighboring redox site. Electrochemical measurements for a variety of common electrode and electrolyte materials reveal a universal dependence of the (de-)intercalation rate on Li + vacancy fraction, as well as temperature and electrolyte effects consistent with the theory, which could be used to guide the molecular design of lithium-ion battery interfaces.},

Furthermore, the fossil informs on the evolution of the group’s Weberian hearing apparatus, suggesting that it was associated with freshwater adaptations. —Sacha Vignieri Otophysans, known for their enhanced hearing enabled by the complex Weberian apparatus, comprise two-thirds of extant freshwater fish species. Previously, they were thought to have originated in fresh water before the breakup of Pangea, implying a nearly 80-million-year gap between the origin and oldest known fossil. However, the discovery of a Late Cretaceous freshwater otophysan challenges this view. Integrating fossil, morphological, and genomic data, we estimate a younger crown group origin of ~154 million years ago. Notably, ancestral range and habitat reconstructions indicate marine origins for the otophysan crown groups, with at least two transitions to fresh water. Functional simulations of the Weberian ossicles of this fossil suggest that the distinctive hearing capabilities of otophysans evolved in conjunction with fusion of hearing ossicle parts and freshwater adaptations.},

They identified the gene DsCEN/2 , the two main haplotypes of which determine flowering time and segregate at different frequencies between low- and high-elevation populations. The low-elevation haplotype seems to have arisen during range expansion to warmer valleys during the Last Glacial Maximum. Given its fitness benefits to larger plants in warm conditions, this haplotype will likely increase in frequency in high-elevation populations with future temperature increases. —Corinne Simonti Adaptive evolution is key for species to persist in a warming climate. However, how adaptive genetic variants arise and shape both past and future evolutionary trajectories remains largely unknown. In this work, we integrate genomics with functional and ecological assays to unravel the evolutionary history and adaptive potential of alleles governing adaptation to climate through flowering time in an Alpine carnation. We reveal that “warm” and “cold” alleles of the flowering inhibitor CENTRORADIALIS ( DsCEN/2 ) originated through recombination of highly divergent haplotypes during the carnation radiation, implicating ancestral variation in seeding climate-adaptive alleles. These alleles survived in glacial refugia before mediating the species’ range expansion in response to postglacial warming.

  abstract     = {As climate warms and humans build in more undeveloped environments, the threat of costly wildfire disasters is thought to be increasing. Cunningham et al . examined data about the global distribution, frequency, and associated climate conditions of the most lethal and costly wildfire disasters from 1980 to 2023, finding that disaster risk was highest in regions near relatively affluent, populated areas, and that the frequency of economically disastrous wildfires increased sharply after 2015. They also found that major disasters coincided with extreme climatic conditions. —Jesse Smith Climate change and land mismanagement are creating increasingly fire-prone built and natural environments. However, despite worsening fire seasons, evidence is lacking globally for trends in socially and economically disastrous wildfires, partly due to sparse systematic records. Using a 44-year dataset (1980 to 2023) we analyze the distribution, trends, and climatic conditions connected with the most lethal and costly wildfires. Disastrous wildfires occurred globally over this period but were concentrated in the Mediterranean and temperate conifer biomes. Disaster risk was highest where highly energetic daily fire events intersected affluent, populated areas. Economic disasters increased sharply from 2015 onward, with 43% of the 200 most damaging events occurring in the last decade. Disasters coincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions, highlighting the urgent need to adapt to a more fire-prone world.},

  abstract     = {Neuronal control of skeletal muscle function is ubiquitous across species for locomotion and doing work. In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.},

  abstract     = {Reading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years ( n = 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.},

  abstract     = {According to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 ( N = 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 ( N = 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.},

  abstract     = {Intelligent miniature systems capable of wireless sensing and manipulation hold considerable promise for advancing biomedical applications. However, the development of these systems has been substantially hindered by sensing-actuation incompatibility at small scales. To overcome this challenge, we propose a robotic sensing approach that integrates embedded ultrasonic soft sensors (EUSSs) with magnetic actuators, resulting in a wireless sensor-integrated miniature machine with seamless integration and minimal interference between fields. The EUSS, with its compact dimensions (1.3 millimeters by 1.3 millimeters by 1.6 millimeters), softness (98 kilopascals), and lightweight design (4.6 milligrams), is compatible with both soft and rigid components in terms of deformability and size. By engineering onboard transducers and using passive ultrasound communication along with external magnetic fields, we could wirelessly detect and regulate environmental parameters such as force, vibration, viscosity, and temperature. Demonstrations in rabbit and porcine models show the potential for robotic feedback control, accurate drug dosing, and in situ physiological monitoring, paving the way for real-world applications of intelligent miniature machines.},

  abstract     = {Dynamics models that predict the effects of physical interactions are essential for planning and control in robotic manipulation. Although models based on physical principles often generalize well, they typically require full-state information, which can be difficult or impossible to extract from perception data in complex, real-world scenarios. Learning-based dynamics models provide an alternative by deriving state transition functions purely from perceived interaction data, enabling the capture of complex, hard-to-model factors and predictive uncertainty and accelerating simulations that are often too slow for real-time control. Recent successes in this field have demonstrated notable advancements in robot capabilities, including long-horizon manipulation of deformable objects, granular materials, and complex multiobject interactions such as stowing and packing. A crucial aspect of these investigations is the choice of state representation, which determines the inductive biases in the learning system for reduced-order modeling of scene dynamics. This article provides a timely and comprehensive review of current techniques and trade-offs in designing learned dynamics models, highlighting their role in advancing robot capabilities through integration with state estimation and control and identifying critical research gaps for future exploration.},

  abstract     = {Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.},

  abstract     = {The Ca 2+ release channel RYR1 mediates basal intracellular Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle, which is increased by mutations that confer life-threatening sensitivity to volatile anesthetics or heat. Yee et al. sought to determine whether these sensitivities were caused by RYR1-mediated Ca 2+ leak. Mice with a disease-inducing RYR1 mutation survived exposure to volatile anesthetics, and their skeletal muscle temperature did not appreciably increase during heat challenge if RYR1 also had a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation that reduced Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle. Thus, reducing the leakiness of mutant RYR1 prevents pathological thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. —Wei Wong Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2+ release channel required for both skeletal muscle contraction and Ca 2+ leak. Mutations in RYR1 cause malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) and enhanced sensitivity to heat stroke (ESHS), which can result in death due to excessive skeletal muscle thermogenesis upon exposure to volatile anesthetics or heat. Here, we investigated the molecular and physiological functions of phosphorylation of RYR1 at Ser 2902 by the kinase striated muscle preferentially expressed protein (SPEG). Muscle from SPEG-deficient mice expressing RYR1 with a Ser 2902 →Asp 2902 (S2902D) point mutation to mimic phosphorylation by SPEG showed decreased SR Ca 2+ sparks. Muscle from mice homozygous for the S2902D point mutation had reduced SR Ca 2+ transients and small changes in force generation but overall mild phenotypic changes. YS mice, which are heterozygous for a Tyr 524 →Ser 524 point mutation in RYR1, show increased Ca 2+ leak and are a model of MHS and ESHS. Crossing YS mice with S2902D mice led to decreased SR Ca 2+ leak and desensitized the mice to both volatile anesthetics and heat. Thus, SPEG inhibits SR Ca 2+ leak in skeletal muscle by phosphorylating Ser 2902 on RYR1, and mutation of Ser 2902 to Asp 2902 to mimic this phosphorylation event rescues YS mice from heat-induced death.},

  abstract     = {Longitudinal bone growth occurs at growth plates. Hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO) causes benign, bony tumors to form at growth plates in children. The tumors cease growing after puberty but do not regress, leading to skeletal abnormalities. In a mouse model of HMO, Catheline et al. found that the osteochondromas acquired a growth plate–like architecture as they emerged from the connective tissue surrounding the growth plate. Tumor outgrowth was driven by the establishment of an ectopic growth axis orthogonal to that of the bone from which the tumor emerged and, like a normal growth plate, depended on Hedgehog signaling. The findings shed light on the origin and development of osteochrondromas and suggest potential targets for slowing their growth in patients. —Annalisa M. VanHook Osteochondromas characterize the rare pediatric disorder hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO). The tumors originate from the growth plate perichondrium along skeletal elements, appear first as ectopic cartilage, and then grow unidirectionally, colliding with and damaging surrounding structures. HMO is caused by mutations that affect the heparan sulfate (HS) synthases EXT1 or EXT2, leading to HS deficiency and aberrant activity of HS-binding growth factors. We investigated the signaling pathways and mechanisms underlying tumor growth in HMO using mice with conditional Ext1 deficiency in the growth plate and perichondrium. Developing tumors displayed active Hedgehog (Hh) signaling within their cartilaginous moiety and the presence of parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) at their distal edge, generating an ectopic Hh-PTHrP axis orthogonal to the one directing normal bone lengthening at the adjacent growth plate. In Ext1 mutants, loss of the Hh signaling effector Smoothened (Smo) reduced tumor growth, whereas heterozygous loss of the Smo inhibitor Patched1 (Ptch1) increased tumor growth. Two HS-binding growth factors that promote normal cartilage growth in the growth plate, BMP2 and activin A, did not exert their normal prochondrogenic activity when Hh signaling was blocked, demonstrating that Hh signaling is essential for chondrogenesis. Together, our findings show that osteochondromas usurp a physiological signaling mechanism to guide and propel their directional outgrowth, enabling them to damage surrounding tissues, and suggest potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},
